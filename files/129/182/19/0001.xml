DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS government(75) 44 COPY NO 8221 March 1975CABINETSOCIAL SECURITY UPRATINGS IN 1975-76 AND BEYONDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer, When the  Committee considered increases in fuel prices at their meeting on 6 February, the Secretary of State for Social Services and I were invited to consider advancing the date of the second social security upratingin 1975, which has been publicly announced as intended to take place inDecember.,    We have exchanged views on the possibilities without reaching agreement.    This paper describes the main choice and sets out myconclusions on it.2. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy favoured bringing forward the second 1975 uprating because of the general price prospect and because of the impact on poor households of the agreed increases in coal and electricity prices.3. The Secretary of State&apos;s proposal is i. to advance the seconduprating to early October - six months after the previous uprating in April,ii. to make a lump sum payment of  10 before Christmas whereas theWhite Paper plans envisage no further such payments, and iii. because of staffing difficulties, to delay till October the special measures which it hashitherto been intended to introduce in July to help the poorest - namelysubstantial increases in supplementary benefit heating allowances anddisregards, and increased levels of entitlement to Family Income Supplement(FIS).4. My concern has been that, while I am in favour of taking measuresto mitigate the effect of the price increases on the poorest families, weshould not run the risk of substantially increasing the continuing calls of social security on public expenditure in later years by setting a pattern of6-monthly upratings and of repeated Christmas bonuses.    Such a patternonce established would mean additional expenditure of the order of 300 million in that year, compared with the provision in Cmnd 5897 whichassumed a single uprating and no bonus in 1976-77, and similarly largeadditions in every subsequent year.    This would aggravate, by   for  , theproblem which we face in achieving a substantial reduction in the borrowing requirement for 1976-77 by reductions of expenditure.
5. I had suggested that the best way of reconciling these interests would be:a- To increase supplementary benefit heating allowances anddisregards, and levels of entitlement to FIS, as soon as possible,ie in July,,b. To bring forward the uprating to the latter part ofNovember, but not earlier.c. Although it would involve an increase of nearly  3.00 million in expenditure at a difficult time, I had offered, if necessary, toprovide for a special lump sum of  10 in September.    Because thereis no provision for continuing lump sums this would have to be explained as warranted only in the special circumstances of heavyprice increases, especially for fuel, this year.The cost of my proposals and those of the Secretary of State would not be materially different for 1975-76.    But the Secretary of State would be using the provision for the lump sum for a Christmas bonus in consequence of having advanced the uprating from December to early October.6.        The Secretary of State for Social Services argues that my proposals is unacceptable, and would not be practicable without causing the Departmentof Health and Social Security staff to &quot;seek to extract .... a price for doing the work which we cannot afford to pay&quot;.    However, the only element in my proposal which would affect the staffing requirements of the programmes as previously intended would be the payment of a lump sum in September.But if staffing problems are regarded as governing what can be done, then the only possible course of action consistent with the overriding requirement of control over expenditure would be to revert to the original intention of asecond uprating in December, without an autumn lump sum.7. This conclusion is in part forced upon us by economic realities.But I consider that acting in this way would be politically defensible.    our existing programme for the first time involves two upratings in one year.During this period the summer discount will halve the effective price increase for domestic coal.    If we can increase FIS, supplementary benefitheating allowances, and supplementary benefit disregards in July, that willprecede the first of the electricity bills reflecting the new prices.    early action here will mean that we shall not need to justify an interval of15 months or more between increases in heating allowances and FIS.Moreover there are signs that the size of the help we have already been ableto give to pensioners, the largest group likely to benefit from early uprating,is beginning to be more widely realised.    Next October, before allowing forany further uprating, pensions will be at a level almost 20 per cent higher in real terms than immediately before the uprating in July 1974.    Over thesame period real personal disposable income for the whole community will,if anything, have fallen.2
conclusion. I recommend my colleagues to agree that the best way to reconcile the requirements of protecting the poor, public expenditure andadministrative feasibility is that -a. The increase in FISt supplementary benefit heatingallowances and disregards should be brought into effect in July;  andbo the second 1975 uprating should be advanced to the second half of November, at the earliest.D treasury Chambers21 March 19753
