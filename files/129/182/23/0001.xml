IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government(75) 4815 April 1975REFERENDUM:   UNITED KINGDOM CITIZENS OVERSEASMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. On 13 March the Cabinet decided that British people living abroadwho are hot on the current register should not be enabled to vote in the referendum (CC(75) 12th Conclusions, Minute 4).    The Referendum Billaccordingly makes no provision for themt2. There has been a good deal of pressure on the Government to reverse this decision, and we were strongly criticised for it by theOpposition parties and by one or two Labour Members during the SecondReading debate on 10 April.    At the end of the debate, the Chief Whipreceived a letter, signed by nearly 40 Labour Members, urging theGovernment to make arrangements to enable British people abroad to vote in the referendum.ii3. There is clearly a risk that, if we continue to resist this proposal in Committee, the proceedings will be prolonged and an amendment will becarried against the Government.    I accordingly instructed officials toreport to me urgently on the feasibility of a scheme for the enfranchisementin the referendum of defined categories of British people living abroad.Their report is in the Appendix to this paper.4. The report shows that,  on the one hand, a scheme which would havesubstantially the desired effect is possible but that, on the other (paragraph 6)it would contain a number of imperfections and anomalies.    It would alsorepresent a major departure from the arrangements that obtain at elections.But in my judgment there is little risk that a Speaker&apos;s Conference would recommend that it should be imported into our electoral law, since at elections there are no constituencies in which people overseas could be registered.    This risk does however apply to proposals to allow those on holiday to vote in the referendum, which I believe we should continue to resist t o the utmost.copy NO        g cabinet
conclusion. On balance, I recommend that we should adopt the schemedescribed in the Appendix and that I should table Government amendments to the Bill to give effect to it.ESPrivy Council Office15 April 19752

ANNEXHOW RESIDENTS OVERSEAS WOULD VOTE1.     The ballot papers would have to be printed and ready for des-patch from the FCO by the end of April.    We would, hope to be ableto get the declaration forms printed and. sent out at the same time;if not, posts would have to arrange for printing or reproductionlocally.   We would hope that posts would be able to obtain envelopes(which are in short supply in this country) for the ballot papersoverseas.2.     Depending upon the exact terms of the arrangements made by theDepartments concerned and contained in the Secretary of State&apos;instructions to posts, posts would be able to start receivingpotential voters as from the day the Order consequent upon the referendum Bill was approved (this is at present to be on      May).A date on which the poll would close at our posts would have to befixed by order of the Secretary of State depending on the bagarrangements made by the Communications Department and in consulta-tion with the post concerned.    In some.posts the poll may have to close as early as 23 May,  though in most cases it would be a datearound the end of May.3.  1   The potential voter would, have to present himself at the postwithin working hours armed with his passport (that of a Citizen ofthe United Kingdom and Colonies with the right of abode).    He v/ould be asked to fill in and sign the declaration form.    He would thenbe given a ballot paper and an envelope and shown to a separate roomor &quot;polling booth&quot; where we v/ould hope that the same instructions as would be displayed in UK polling stations would be displayed.    Hewould make his vote, put the ballot paper in the envelope, seal itand put it in the receptacle resembling a ballot box which the consular officer v/ould have to supply.k.     When the poll v/as over, the consular officer would empty his&quot;ballot box&quot; and check that the number of envelopes corresponded tothe number of counterfoils and the number of declarations.    He would,have to make a return of the numbers on a schedule and would have to account for any discrepancy.    These three bundles would then beplaced in a bag or bags and sealed.    The bag or bags would then be despatched to London by the means which had been arranged with the communications Department. 4
5.     On arrival in London the Communications Department wouldmake arrangements for these hags to he taken to Earls Court andto he handed over to the officer responsible for checking inthe overseas ballots.15 April, 1975.
