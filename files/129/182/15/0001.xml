DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 40 COPY NO19 March 1975CABINETPAY OF THE INDUSTRIAL CIVIL service memorandum by the Lord Privy seal. At its meeting on 18 March 1975, the Sub-Committee on pay negotiations of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EC(P)) were unable to reach agreement on the pay of the industrial Civil Service, someof whom are currently taking industrial action in Whitehall.2.        After discussions with the Secretary of State for Employment, Ihave undertaken to give an answer to the trade unions on their claim foran interim pay increase by the end of this week.    I attach at the Annex a paper on the issues involved which has been prepared by Civil service department officials after consultation with Treasury and Department ofEmployment officials.3. It sets out three options for our consideration in response to theclaim for an interim pay increase which EC(P) provisionally decided to reject at a meeting on 21 January.    Since that meeting I have met theTrade Union Side in accordance with the committee suggestion that weshould probe their likely reaction to a rejection of their claim,4. The unofficial action affecting Parliament from the beginning of lastweek is in support of this interim claim.    In considering the options,however, I think it is important that we should not allow ourselves to be unduly influenced by the present strike action.    This - though potentiallyserious in its effects - involves a relatively small number of people whoare by no means among the lowest paid of industrial civil servants.    the basic questions we have to consider are of far wider application and affectthe Industrial Civil Service as a v/hole.5. So far as the interim claim is concerned, I have no doubt that this must be rejected.    If my colleagues agree, I will formally reply to thetrade unions to that effect.6. It is essential that, at the same time, I should be able to say where we stand on the question of comparability. I could, if it was insisted upon,try the kind of middle-way approach suggested in option (c) of the Annex.1
GONFII *ENTIALI must say, however, that I have no confidence that this - whateverprecise formulation of words might be used - would be sufficient to satisfy the trade unions.7. I believe that we cannot avoid making a choice between reaffirmingonce again the principle of comparability so far as industrial civil servantsare concerned - and accepting that if the pay comparison exercise showsthat they are in fact seriously behind their counterparts in outside industry,then that must be put right - or openly stating that there are overridingeconomic reasons why the Government cannot commit themselves to applythis principle for the time being,8, Even if a middle-way based on some subtle wording (and mycolleagues will not over-estimate the effect of subtleties of wording ondown to earth trade unionists) were effective in resolving the immediate problem, I think we should only be laying ourselves open to accusations ofdeviousness later on, with the risk of mere widespread trouble and serious effects on the management and efficiency of the Industrial Civil Service,Whatever arguments there may be about the exact meaning of statementsor commitments made by the Government in the past, there can be no doubtthat the trade unions and industrial civil servants generally regard theGovernment - I believe justifiably - as having committed themselves topaying rates of pay which are fair as compared with those of other groups,9c I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that, in replying to thetrade unions, I should reaffirm that the Government accept the broadprinciple of fair comparison for industrial civil servants and willnegotiate in earnest on the results of the pay comparison exercise - thoughthe interpretation of the results and their translation into pay increasesmust necessarily be a matter for realistic bargaining between the two sides,10,       As I have said, I reach this conclusion without regard for theindustrial action which is now taking place.    As far as that action isconcerned, I must say that I can see no hope of persuading the officialtrade unions to help to get the unofficial strikers back to work unless I can at least give the assurance I suggest concerning our acceptance of theresults of the pay comparison exercise,civil Service Department19 March 19752
ANNEXPAY OF THE INDUSTRIAL CIVIL service.     Ministers are aware that industrial civil servants whocarry out maintenance work on &quot;behalf of the Department of the environment are taking unofficial strike action in support ofan interim pay claim on behalf of the Industrial Civil Service.Parliament and Government Offices are being picketed with theresult that Parliamentary papers are not being delivered tothe Palace of Westminster, and government departments in whitehall are not receiving papers normally carried by theInter-Departmental Van Service.     The unofficial action involvesabout 420 people out of the 180,000 in the Industrial CivilService.2.     The last annual settlement for industrial civil servants -effective from 1 July 1974 - was reached just before the stage 3 Pay Code was abandoned and gave average increases ofabout 9$ (though since then there have been further thresholdpayments amounting to  2.40 a week - an average of l%fo - and where applicable increases in London Weighting of just under 6 for the inner area and just over  3 for the outer area).Details of current rates of pay are shown in Appendix A.3.     The Unions were reluctant to accept last year&apos;s settle-ment, since they considered that the pay of the industrial civil Service had already fallen behind that of comparableemployees to an extent that Stage 3 increases would not comenear to making good.     Agreement could only be reached on thebasis of an undertaking by the management side that therewould be a joint survey to determine more precisely how the pay of the Industrial Civil Service compared with that ofother comparable employees.     No undertaking was given of anyfurther increase before the next settlement date - 1 July 1975 -though expectations have undoubtedly been aroused by some tradeunion representatives among their members of an earlier special&apos;pay comparison&apos; settlement.4.     The present action arises from a claim submitted by theTrade Unions last December which, though expressed in general terms, in effect sought the extension of threshold arrange-ments of some form of interim pay increase pending the nextannual settlement from 1 July 1975.     EC(P) considered this claim in January (EC(P)(75)lst Meeting) and agreed that itshould not be conceded, particularly in view of the fact thata breach of the 12 month* rule would be involved and of theGovernment&apos;s policy to discontinue Stage 3 threshold arrange-ments.   , This decision has not yet been conveyed to the TradeUnions who recently asked for a meeting with the Lord privy seal, at which he explained the difficulties of making an interim payment.     This caused the Trade Unions to ask for an assurance that the pay settlement in July would be determined on the basis of the comparison exercise which is now under way.5.     While, for the reasons discussed in EC(P), there appearsto be no alternative on incomes policy grounds but to reject the interim claim as such, it will be necessary for the/     CONFIDENTIAL
lord Privy Seal in his formal reply to the Trade Unions to say something on the question of comparability in relation to thisyear&apos;s annual settlement.     While it is true that the industrials -unlike the non-industrials - do not have an established and well-defined system for determining pay comparisons (and to that extent it would be more difficult to justify comparability forindustrials than for non-industrials), there is a long-standingcommitment to the broad principle of fair comparison, stemmingfrom the Fair Wages Resolution, as the basis for determiningtheir pay, (see Appendix B).6.     There is no sign of any change in the extent of this action.A favourable offer would help the trade union side to prevent itspreading elsewhere in the Service and to bring it to an end.An unfavourable offer might result in more widespread unofficialaction and possibly in the strike being made official by theUnions.     On the other hand, the Recess is approaching and theUnion Side may be reluctant either to take official action inadvance of the July negotiations or to seek to stop the work ofParliament after the Recess.7.     There are three main options on the question of comparability.(i)   To say that the Government cannot make any commitment on comparability.Advantages- No problems of conflict with the guidelines which do not include comparability. - \- No repercussions on other pay negotiations between now and July in which comparability is or will bean issue. ,- Maximum freedom of manoeuvre retained for the Julynegotiations.Disadvantages- The present industrial action likely to continue.- Possibility that the present action would gainofficial support from the Unions and could spread  .to other parts of the Industrial Civil Service.- Might be held to be inconsistent with previous government assurances.(ii)   To accept that pay comparability should be restoredand that the next annual settlement will be determined on the basi3 of the results of the current comparisonexercise now being carried on.Advantages- The course most likely to persuade the strikers to discontinue their action and to contain the situationin the Industrial Civil Service generally until thenext settlement without meeting the interim claim.2
- Could &quot;be held to &quot;be the most straightforwardcourse and to be consistent with previous government assurances (quoted in Appendix B).Disadvantages- Would restrict the room for manoeuvre in the July-negotiations and seem bound to result in asettlement well above the TUC guidelines.     Sucha settlement could set the tune for claims for thefirst settlements for manual workers in the nextpay round in the autumn, eg the local authority manual workers.- Might be thought to conflict with the lineMinisters agreed to take last week in handling the negotiations for non-industrial civil servants,some of whom are at or below the ICS pay rates(eg some clerical officers and assistants,messengers, cleaners, typists).- Possible repercussions on other public sectormanual groups with current comparability claims,eg railwaymen and electricity workers (with theminers), and Glasgow dustcart drivers (with H.G.V.drivers in Scotland),     Could be wider repercussions in the private sector and amongst non-manuals withcomparability claims.(iii)   To attempt to take a middle course which would offer the Trade Unions some reassurance oncomparability without amounting to a definitecommitment.A possible formula would be to say:&quot;The Government is expected, like other employers,to comply with the Social Contract.     The principlethat industrial civil servants should be paidfairly in relation to others has been repeatedlyreaffirmed over the years and the Prime minister has made plain the Government1s view that thereshould be no discrimination against the publicservice.     It is against this background and inthis spirit that the Government intend to conduct the negotiations for the next annual settlement in which both sides will have the assistance ofthe results of the survey of pay outside theCivil Service.&quot;\ Advantages- More likely than (i) to secure a return to work ofthe strikers   and to contain the situation untilJuly.- Less risk of repercussions on other groups and damage to the social contract than (ii).
- Reference to both the social contract and faircomparisons would leave more room for manoeuvrein the July negotiations.Disadvantages- Might fail to resolve the present strike and evenrisk extension of the action, possibly on an .official basis.- Still carries a clear implication that comparabilitywould play.a significant part in the July negotia-tions.- Could lead to difficulties in the July negotiations and accusations of deviousness if the Governmentthen sought to secure a settlement below the levelsuggested by the pay comparison exercise.8. With any of the three options above it would be possible to add assurances that in the July negotiations the Governmentwould be ready to consider other issues on which the unions were seeking improvements.     These include:(i)     the consolidation of threshold payments;(ii)     some problems of skill differentials;(iii)     consideration of the case of those groups withinthe ICS who because of the nature of their workdid not have the opportunity to receive produc-tivity payments.4
APPENDIX APAY AND EARNINGS OF INDUSTRIAL CIVIL SERVANTSThere are about 175,000 industrial civil servants whose pay is negotiated in theJoint Co-ordinating Committee for Government Industrial Establishments (the JCC).The JCC pay system provides for a graded common structure of basic rates of pay which, with supervisory and special responsibility allowances, are negotiatednationally, and also for productivity and payment by results schemes^ negotiatedat unit level, which provide- additional earnings opportunities.   Basic rates of pay are set out in the table attached.   The rates include threshold paymentstotalling  4.40 a week which all industrial civil servants now receive.   The tablealso shows the numbers receiving each pay rate.   About two-thirds also receivepayments under various productivity and payment by results schemes.   These schemes,however, provide very widely varying earnings opportunities ranging from around 1.50 a week to  10 a week and more&quot; for a small minority.   Opportunities for workingovertime also vary considerably.   Fewer than half of all industrial civil servants, regularly work overtime.Full details of earnings will not be available until this year&apos;s annual survey of earnings of industrial civil servants has been completed.   In the meantime, thebest we can do is to make estimates on the basis of earlier surveys.   These showthat for all industrial civil servants on the JCC pay system average earnings,excluding overtime, amounted to about  38.75 a week and that the overall averageof overtime earnings is about  5 a week.   As indicated above, however, theseaverages conceal wide variations in opportunities for earning productivity etcbonus and for working overtime.   Because of the absence of such opportunities, we estimate that about 12$ of all adult men and 15$ of all adults (men and women)have earnings (excluding overtime) of less than  30 a week.\/

APPENDIX BEVIDENCE OF A COMMITMENT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPARABILITY AS THE BASIS for determing JCC PAY FOR INDUSTRIALS   -The principle that the pay of industrial civil servants should be based onComparability&apos; flows from the Government&apos;s undertaking in 1910 to apply the fair Wages Resolution (FWR) to its own employees.   The FWR requires a ramtractbr .1cfcb pay rates and wages and observe hours and conditions of employment not less favourable than those established by customary negotiations, or otherwise observed by other employers where general circumstances are similar in the trade or industry concerned.   This commitment has been endorsed by successive Governmentsover the years and is illustrated by the most recent statements:-Meeting 15 June 1970 - Discussion of NBPI Report No 146The Chairman said - &quot;The Official Side welcomed the recommendation that pay shouldbe determined on :..the basis of fair comparison.   It represented a very significantstep towards bringing industrial and non-industrial conditions of service in line- which had long been the aim of the Trade Union Side&quot;.Meeting 11 June 1971 between the Lord Privy Seal and the Trade Union SideThe Lord Privy Seal said - &quot;As for future years, he thought it was unsatisfactoryif there were disagreement about basic facts and the Official Side would, therefore,be very willing to look at ways in which the present system /of pay comparability/could be improved&quot;.Statement made during the 1972 arbitration caseAn agreed factual memorandum submitted to the Tribunal stated &quot;Thus, whilecomparability remains the underlying principle in determining industrial CivilService pay, there is no agreement between the two Sides of the JCC on howcomparison should be made.   The Official Side have agreed with the Trade union side that, once the current dispute is settled, they should discuss further whether some agreed basis for comparability can be found for the future&quot;.In the Official Side&apos;s statement of the case&quot;The principle of determining industrial Civil Service pay underlying both the fair Wages Resolution and the recommendations in NBPI Report No I46 is compara-bility of earnings with those for comparable outside employment .... The processin the industrial Civil Service is essentially one of catching up with relevantand firmly established outside movements; this guarantees a fair deal to industrial civil servants; avoids the Government setting the pace for outside wages; and does not impose an unfair burden on the taxpayer&quot;.1
CONFIDENTIALIn the Trade Union Side statement of case&quot;The importance of comparability as a principle for determining pay was acceptunreservedly by the NBPI Report No 146 .....&quot;1iThe Arbitration Tribunal&apos;s award summarised the position as follows:&quot;Pay settlements in the ICS, folLowing out the Fair Wages Resolution, mustreflect firmly established earnings levels outside and not anticipate them oract as pacesetters for them&quot;.&quot;At the present time, therefore, whilst the two Sides accept comparability as abasis fordetEtsiiiiiing rates, they do not have an agreed basis for determining it&quot;,19 March 1975
