DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S government(75) 3111 March 1975THE 1975 PAY RESEARCH RESULTS FOR THENON-INDUSTRIAL CIVIL SERVICE AND the wider PAY SCENEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment.1. The Ministerial Working Group on Civil Service Pay Research on March agreed that it would be helpful if the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s proposalsfor handling the 1975 pay research surveys for the non-industrial CivilService were set in the context of the current pay round.    The Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations of the Ministerial Committee on economic policy (EC(P)) was invited to meet, not to try to decide the merits of thequestion, but to submit a paper to Cabinet on the relationship of theLord Privy Seal&apos;s proposals to the recent decisions we have taken on anew pay posture and on their possible repercussions on other pay negotiations.2. Following discussion in the Sub-Committee, the attached papercovers three main areas:  the relationship of pay research to the TradesUnion Congress guidelines (paragraphs 2 and 3);  the effect of the lord privy Seal&apos;s proposals on the Governments new posture on pay(paragraphs 4-7);  and the risk of repercussions in the rest of the payround (paragraphs 8-12).    It is plain from this that a Civil Servicesettlement well outside the guidelines would weaken the Governmenfsposition in persuading other employers to adopt the new posture on pay and in urging union leaders to accept settlements within the guidelines andto eschew comparability as an argument.    It would also be likely to have repercussions on other pay negotiations over the rest of this pay round, asillustrated in Annex 2.3. The report does not deal with all the considerations which bear onthe decision on Civil Service pay. It is complementary to the Lord privy seal&apos;s paper which sets out the case for the proposed settlement.4. In my view we must do everything we can to negotiate a CivilService settlement much closer to 20 per cent than the annual rate of27 per cent implied by the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s proposals.    Our new postureon pay requires that we should make a genuine effort to get a settlement5 per cent lower and at that level the risk of repercussions would be much diminished.copy NO      ** iCABINET
5. I am not suggesting overturning pay research.    There is an element of judgment in the figures, and I think that the ministers concerned should meet the leaders of the Staff Side to point out to them the great difficulties of a settlement much above the guidelines;  thatthis problem arises from the provision for the elimination of time lags;and to urge them to accept an average 22 per cent increase (on anannual basis) on the pattern suggested by pay research as being a fairoffer in all the circumstances.    At the same time I could, if mycolleagues thought it might give useful support, approach the TradesUnion Congress informally to see if they could helpfully intervene withthe Staff Side.6. Unless we can get a settlement at this level, I do not see how wecan convincingly argue that the outcome of pay research is compatible with the Trades Union Congress guidelines and we shall have underminedotir own position in urging others to keep their pay increases within therise in the cost of living.i iM department of Employment11 March 19752
(secret)THE 1975 PAY RESEARCH RESULTS FOR THE NON-INDUSTRIAL CIVILSERVICE AND THE WIDER PAY SCENEvThis note considers the implications for the new posture on pay which Ministers have agreed to adopt and also the risk ofrepercussions arising from any settlement for the non-industrial civil service based on the 1975 pay research results which is wellin excess of the TUC guidelines,PAY RESEARCH AND THE TUC GUIDELINES2.    It was recognised,  both when the TUC guidelines werepromulgated and when Ministers decided on the time lag adjustmentlast December that there would be problems if the pay researchevidence supported increases for Civil Servants well above thecost of living guideline.    This is because the tuc guidelines donotinclude;comparability as a justification for an increase inexcess of the cost of living and pay research is based entirely on the principle of fair comparisons.   (It was thought,  when theguidelines were drawn up by the TUC,  that there was no possibility of including words to cover &quot;fair comparison&quot; forthe civil service which would not open the way for other groups to press for exceptional increases based on comparability.)3o    It is now apparent that the results of the 1975 pay research,including the elimination of the time lag support a settlementabove the cost of living guideline.    None of the other TUC guide-lines,  such as low pay, productivity or restructuring,  appliesas justification in the present case.    In speeches following therecent miners&apos;  settlement Ministers have emphasised thatcomparability does not justify exceptional increases under theguidelines.    So there is an acute problem of reconciliation.THE EFFECT ON THE GOVERNMENT*S NEW POSTURE ON PAY-4,    Ministers have recently agreed to adopt a new posture on paypolicy,   the main feature of which will be to secure settlementsmuch closer to the increases in the cost of living.    It was envisaged in this approach that the maximum which might beachieved would be a reduction of about 6 per cent in thesettlement rate compared with the forecast rate of settlementof 26% up to July 1975 with the aim of bringing the level ofsettlements down to &apos;20%.     (Annex 1 lists the elements which 1Ministers have agreed should be included in the new postureo)In the public sector the Chancellor of!the Exchequer and otherjIMinisters will be meeting nationalised industry1chairman&apos;and other public sector employers to urge them to reach settlements&apos; close tothe cost of living guidelines and to resist claims based ohcomparability with other pay increases or pay levels.3
5.    A settlement between the Government and it own employees inthe civil service well above the cost of living guideline andjustified on the principle of fair comparison would make the new approach by Ministers much more difficult to sustain and would belikely to undermine its effectiveness.    The settlement,wouldappear to other employers,  particularly those in the public sector,  to be in direct conflict with the advice they were receiving from Ministers on the  settlements they should seek tosecure.    Although points could be made about the special natureof the pay research system of comparability,  these would be unhfcefyt;convince other employers faced with,comparability claims.6.    There is a feeling amongst nationalised industry board members that the Government &quot;looked after its 01m&quot; in its vdecisions on the Top Salaries Review Body report, which isalready making it more difficult to persuade them to take a hard&apos;;line in their own negotiations. .  The Government has to rely on&apos; &apos;their co-operation in the pursuit of a stronger policy-.7.    Ah above-guidelines settlement, could also^effect the attitudeattitudes of union leaders outside the civil service.    although they would not argue    that the pay research system should be -abandoned because&quot; of the guidelines,  they cCLearly expect thatsettlements in which the Government is involved as the employerwill be within the guidelines.    A pay research settlement this  - .year well above the rise in the cost Of living would be tin-helpful to those union leaders, who were seeking to reach -settlements within the guidelines and would be exploited by others pressing claims for settlements outiside the guidelines:,especially if based oh comparability.                   .THE RISK OF REPERCUSSIONS -8.    Pay research results apply to about 450,000 civil servantsdirectly,  and are also applied to some 118,000 National health service staff and to 46,000 staff in &quot;fringe foodies&quot;.9.    We are now about half;way through the  1974-1975 pay round.In the public  sector there is a number of important negotiationsfor manual workers over the coming months,  notably for&quot;electrical workers,  railwaymen and. industrial civil servants; .and,   for non-manual workers,   the Post Office,   local authorities,teachers and nurses.    In the private sector important&apos; coming^&apos;negotiations include engineering,   the docks and the banks.10.  It is clear that a major problem in the rest, of the payround will be the handling of claims based.on comparability;with pay increases and pay levels of groups who have alreadysettled at high levels.    If such claims were conceded,  the levelof settlements generally would remain well above the cost ofliving, guidelines and the new Government posture on pay could notbe successfully adopted.    An above-guidelines settlement for thecivil service based on the principle of&apos;fair comparison willmake it more difficult to resist the general comparability claims of manual, workers at a time when it is particularly important todo so,  and other hon-manual -groups will use, the size &quot;of the&apos;civilservice increase and the resulting pay levels in their negotiations4    i .
(secret)11.  For these reasons the civil service settlement is likely tohave a general impact on efforts to  sustain, the,socialscontractduring the remainder of this pay round.    We have  sought to identify the more likely repercussions in Annex 2.    The mostdirect effects are likely to be on settlements in the public sector .12.  Another problem could be the relationship between an aboveguidelines civil, service settlement and the recommendations ofthe Doctors and Dentists and Armed Farces Review Bodies for implementation on the same date of 1 April  1975-    The DDRBhave already indicated that they will take account of comparativepay levels at April  197^ and the AFPRB have received evidence onthe elimination of time-lags as in the new civil serviceagreement.    Both bodies are likely to  justify their recommenda-tions,   at least in part,  by comparability.    But they may be reinforced in this if they see the Government1 as party to anabove-guidelines  settlement based on fair comparisons,   and thereis just a possibility that such a settlement could also affectthe level of their recommendations.    In addition,   there could be some effect on the Government&apos;s freedom of manoeuvre in handling the Review Body recommendations,   although this is already very limited by the existing undertakings and commitments.5(secret)
ANNEX 1Elements in a- new policy as a minimum consistent with the freedom of collective bargainingimplied by the Social Contract,  a new posture by the Governmentwould have to include the following elements:(i) The Government would have to give more leadership on pay,taking a rather bigger part of the responsibility it alreadyshares with the TUC.    Ministers would make renewed reference in public speeches to the dangers of excessive pay increases for employment at home and competitiveness abroad.(ii) We should insist that the TUC guidelines should be&quot;.honoured in the spirit as well as in the letter.    The greatmajority of working people should not continue to receiveincreases far beyond the rise in prices through stretching the exceptions permitted by the guidelines so as to make &quot;nonsenseof their main principle that any general settlements,  includingthresholds,  should be sufficient only to cover the increase inthe RPI in the preceding twelve months.(iii) The Government should try to get the TUC to confirm this interpretation of the Social Contract and in particular to restrict to the bare minimum the number of exceptions to themain principle.    The TUC should be persuaded to ensure that themain principle is observed in respect of the next pay period aswell as the present one.(iv) The Government must be prepared to  ensure that  employers inthe public sector do not make settlements which involve departure 1from the 12-months rule or big excesses over the RPI increase.Now that the miners1  settlement is out of the way,  the national-ieod industries must resist the pressures it has generated;  theminers must be isolated as the most special of special of cases.(v) It would be particularly desirable to  ensure that groups which have already received special case treatment in thesecond half of 197^ should be kept to a strict application of the Imain principle of the guidelines for their ordinary annualsettlements;   in many cases  (like nurses and teachers)  this would Istill mean increases of 50 per cent within a year.    This would   Ijdo at least a little to limit repercussions and would produce sonjjimportant settlements at lower nominal rates.    It would also do something to contain public expenditure.(vi) The Government and the TUC should lay more stress on thesocial wage and publish information about its growing cost in cash.    This would be in line with the views of the TUC andwould re-inforce the argument about the limited scope for increasing privately financed consumption.6

Their next settlement is due on 1&quot;July 1975&quot;    They are not linked to the non-industrial civil service,  but could be expected to make use,in their claim and negotiations of any above guidelines settlement  for !non-industrial civil servants as an argument for similar:     , -increases. , , ;;&apos;There is a number of groups in education who are currentlypressing for pay increases based on comparability with theHoughton    recommendations  for non-university teachers.    Themost important are university teachers who are pressing for an interim increase in advance of their settlement date of1 October.    Other groups include education inspectors andorganisers,  youth leaders,   and some administrative educationofficers all of whom are seeking increases outside the social contract based on comparability with teachers.Public sector manual workersNegotiations are currently in progress for electricity workers who are seeking increases comparable with the surface workers  incoalmining.    Negotiations will be resumed in the week beginning17 March and pressure is likely to continue from the Unions for increases of well over 30%.    An above-guidelines settlement forthe civil service based on comparability will make it moredifficult for the Electricity Council to resist the Unions 1claim. n(secret)
