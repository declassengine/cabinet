secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT35C(75) 26 COPY NO10 March 1975CABINETNON-INDUSTRIAL. CIVIL. SERVICE:  1975 pay research RESULTSMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal. This paper considers the pay offers to be made for the non-industrial civil Service from 1 April 1975, following the analysis of pay researchsurveys.    Annex A briefly describes the pay research system,,2.        Our commitment to the continuation of the pay    search system, andto a policy of non-discrimination against the Civil Service, is unquestionable.Not only has it been publicly stated, but as recently as December weapproved a modification of the calculating system (the time-lag correction)and a new Pay Agreement incorporating a movement of operative date from1 January to 1 April.3. This year, therefore, the increases are made up of the basicevidence on outside pay rates, plus an element for the 15 month period since the last increase, plus the time-lag adjustments    Annex B shows the increases for the most important grades.    For the 15 month period theincrease is about 34 per cent (27 per cent at an annual rate).    about  per cent of this 27 per cent is attributable to the time-lag correction.The extra cash cost in the financial year 1975-76 would be  321 million.4. Within this overall figure, increases for particular grades varyquite widely; most fall within 30 per cent to 40 per cent.    Most of thelarger increases are for the lower-paid grades, so that taking account ofthreshold payments, &quot;new money&quot; for eg the Clerical Assistant at age 16is  2 a week.    Annex C shows costs in detail for the Civil Service(450, 000) and the agreed conseqiientials in the National Health Service(118, 000 staff) and &quot;fringe bodies&quot; (about,46, 000 staff).THE PROBLEMS5. I recognise that increases of this order create serious difficulties forus, both in the context of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) guidelines, andof our new posture on pay policy.    They may also affect subsequent negotiations elsewhere (the Secretary of State for Employment is circulating a separate paper on this aspect).1
6. If however we seek to reduce the increases arbitrarily say from27 per cent (annual) to 22 per cent, we could not do so without openlybreaching the system.    Pay research is now largely mechanistic, and theevidence is given equally both to the unions and to the Official Side;  so thenew Civil Service rates that are indicated cannot be cut down without ineffect departing from written procedures incorporating longstanding methods.For negotiating purposes only, first offers could of course be constructedat 1 to 2 per cent below the figures in Annex B, but. they could not be sustained on their merits.7. Any significant cut would thus lead to acwsations of breaking ourword, and the Staff Side would be bound to ask what had changed since weapproved the time-lag adjustment and the New Pay Agreement (we did ofcourse have estimates of the cost of this;  at 39 per cent to 44 per cent theywere considerably higher than the 34 per cent we are now looking at).    Ican see nothing that we could point to;  the TUC guidelines were in existenceat the time, and have not changed;  and we ourselves have not announced anew policy.8. There would therefore be a public dispute, and our position wouldbe very difficult to defend.    Axid there would probably be immediateindustrial action at key points such as airports, the revenue departments and social security offices.    Before deciding to face up to these difficulties,we should have to be very sure that we were not eventually going to give way.9. The unions have the right to go to arbitration, and an undertaking that Governments will honour awards.    Large increases would be awarded -probably larger than those in Annex B;  and in the interim, some industrial action would be likely.10.       I have considered staging.    But this is not helpful, since it wouldbe taken by the outside world as an example of how to breach the guidelinesby agreeing to a large increase, and then deferring part of it.    Andcriticisms of breach of faith would be bound to be levelled at us.11.        I believe that the right course is to honour our undertakings and toauthorise negotiations on the figures in this paper.    Presentation couldstress the origins of the system and the need for the Civil Service to have such a system (the Priestley Royal Commission has much material on this);the restructured Pay Agreement which abolishes retrospection;  and perhapsan explanation of the time-lag (which might not be as dangerous as appearsat first sight), which compensates once-for-all for the &quot;catching-up&quot; thathas previously been inherent in the system.    Effective use could also be madeof the fact that, for most staff, the last substantive review was based onevidence of outside rates at 6 November 1972, giving a compounded annual rate of increase of 17 per cent.Civil Service Department10 March 19752SECRET
ANNEX ATHE PAY RESEARCH system the pay research system has been the accepted basis for CivilService pay for nearly 20 years, following the recommendationsof the Royal Commission on the Civil Service 1953-55 (thePriestley Commission).The Principle2.     The Commission recommended that the primary principle for determing Civil Service pay should be fair comparison, defined as &quot;fair comparison with the current remuneration of outsidestaffs employed on broadly comparable work, taking account of differences in other conditions of service&quot;.   They pointed outthat this would be fair to the community at large, and inparticular would look after the taxpayer&apos;s interest; fair tothe employers of civil servants, who must have the staff tocarry out the tasks demanded of them; and fair to the individualcivil servant.   They added that the fair comparison principle would safeguard the Civil Service from political pressures.3.     The fair comparison principle has been endorsed by successive governments since then, and by this Government inthe Prime Minister&apos;s written replies on 30 April 1974 and19 February 1975* which also gave assurances of non-discrimination against the public service.The Procedures4.     The Royal Commission went on to recommend machinery (&quot;pay research&quot;) for giving effect to the fair comparison principle,and to discuss how they would expect various factors to betreated.5.     Their recommendations are now embodied in detailedprocedural agreements defining the pay research system.!!Experience of applying them has enabled increasinglystandardised, precise and limiting procedures to be devolped in successive Agreements. The present Agreement was signed inDecember 1974, and specifies timetables and calculatingprocedures for all foreseeable situations.   Also, pay research in the past has not been operated each year, and so has led to large &quot;catching up&apos; increases and presentational problems: thenew Agreement provides for annual pay research, so 1975 willbe the last &quot;catching up&apos; problem in the system.6.     The new Agreement also contains two provisions approved by ministers which have a once-for-all transitional effect in1975*   One is a modification of the calculating system to give some compensation for the time-lag between the introduction of outside pay settlements and the rather later date on which the1
equivalent rates come into effect for civil servants (at higherlevels of pay, the effect in 1975 is tapered).   The other isa change in the operative date of pay research settlements from1 January to 1 April with a transitional arrangement for thepayment of four-fifths of the 1975 increase from 1 January andthe remaining fifth from 1 April (this change was necessary to abolish the presentational and other problems of retrospection).How it Works7.     The pay research procedures provide for an independent,specialist Unit to identify by direct inspection in the CivilService and outside which jobs done by staff in a wide range of outside organisations correspond with those performed by eachgrade of civil servants, and to establish the rates of pay andconditions of service for the outside staff.   This evidence isreported jointly to the Official and Staff Sides, and is processedbetween the two sides in accordance with the agreed procedures andcalculations.   First, the outside remuneration is adjustedarithmetically to bring it into line with Civil Service practice(eg by subtracting London weighting or superannuation contributionsor adding the value of a free car, where appropriate).   Thisproduces a list of outside rates for equivalent work: for theExecutive Officer grade there are some 150 rates derived from 50major outside organisations.   The Civil Service rate centres around the median of this list, with final adjustments being made (whichare relatively small in the total picture and follow Priestleyguidance and established precedent; for further evidence (egcheap mortgages); differences in hours, leave and superannuationbenefits; and less quantifiable factors in a fair comparison.8.     Thus Civil Service pay research operates on objectiveevidence of actual rates of pay, and not on pay movements, ortrends, or earnings; it operates on the median of those rates;and it is a substantially mechanistic process.   It contrasts with&quot;comparability   by preventing unions from basing arguments onthe forms of comparison most attractive to them at a given time, anchanging the basis of comparison, or methods of calculation, to fit higher ambitions or expectations.   This clear contrast with&quot;comparability&quot; was investigated and specifically endorsed bythe Pay Board in its &quot;Anomalies&quot; study.   Pay research thusprovides a controlled pay, hours and leave system for 500,000staff, which can only reflect what has already happened to payrates for comparable work and so is not inflationary in itself.Arbitration7.     The whole system is backed by an agreement on arbitrationdating from 1925, which is compulsory up to the Principal grade.The Government is committed to accepting the awards of theTribunal (subject to the overriding authority of Parliament).
