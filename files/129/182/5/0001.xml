I attach a paper that I prepared for the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy: Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations on the implications of the Civil Service pay proposals for the staff for whom I am responsible.20 I invite my colleagues:a. To reject any phasing or interference with the currentPay Research findings unless this is part of an overall strategyincluding the review of our previous decisions on top salaries.b. To initiate consultations with the Trades Union congress on the need for tougher guidelines in those cases where a substantive settlement has already been made following the liftingof statutory controls.B A department of Health and Social Security11 March 1975
NON-INDUSTRIAL CIVIL SERVICE : 1975 DAY RESEARCH RESULTSMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE for social services.     The Working Group on Civil Service Pay Research decided at its meetingon 5 March (Misc 47(75)lst Meeting)1 to refer this matter to EC(P) so thatit could be considered in relation to the decisions of MES and the possible repercussions of the Civil Service pay proposals on other pay negotiations.I feel it would be useful if I were to explain the implications of theSecretary of State for Employment&apos;s proposals for the staff for whom 1 amresponsible.   Together with the other Health Ministers I am directly or indirectly the employer of 800,000 staff in the National Health Serviceand 70,000 civil servants.   I have therefore a particular interest in theeffect of our pay policy on essential health and social services.2.     In Bart A of Annex I have listed all pay settlements entered into inthe National Health Service since statutory restrictions ended last July.Two of these were treated as special cases by the Government:   nurses(30 per cent) and the professions supplementary to medicine (38 per cent),both effective from 23 May 1974*   Others included special features such asrestructuring required by National Health Service reorganisation or adjust-ments for low pays   And for these good reasons all exceeded the increase inRPI.   The Government&apos;s decision on Top Salaries not only exceeded RPI, butallowed for comparability.3.    We are currently negotiating with nurses for a 1975 settlement due to operate from April&apos; and are daily expecting the annual claim from the professions supplementary to medicine for the same period.   I am clear thatexcept to the extent that we decide that any special treatment is needed for the lowest paid, we must keep increases for these professions withinthe RPI figures.   Since the 1974 settlement they cannot claim that they areburdened any longer by unfairness in the statutory policy.   They are infact on the same footing as all those making pay claims after July ie all those who will already have achieved a negotiated settlement free of statutory restraint, and in my view after July we should accept no claims for special treatment.4.    A particular difficulty arises, however, in regard to pay claims due for settlement from a date earlier than July, since those concerned havehad no opportunity to reach a freely negotiated settlement since the endof statutory restraint.   The claims expected to arise in the National health service are listed in Part B of the Annex.
5.     In many of these cases pay is currently assessed on a basis of comparability, either through strict pay research or somewhat more generallythrough the operation of the Review Bodies.   For some of the National health service classes mentioned pay is determined by way of analogy with CivilService rates.   I realise too that the difficulties which comparability may cause for us are inherent also in the report which will come from the armed forces Review Body, the recommendations of the Top Salaries Review Body onMPs1 salaries and any report we receive from Lord Boyle on local governmentand other administrative staff, including some of my own.   We know alreadysomething of the embarrassing recommendations likely to come to us as aresult of applying comparability.   We already have before us the pay researchresults for the non-industrial Civil Servants.   We know that the Doctors&apos;and Dentists&apos; Review Body stated in their last report that by April 1974doctors and dentists had fallen 11 to 15 per cent behind on a comparabilitybasis and that they intend to recommend this be made good in this April&apos;ssettlement over and above whatever adjustment they consider right for thepast year.6.     In my view there are only two ways in which we can approach this problem:   The first is to adopt a rigorous attitude from now on, rejectingcomparability and linking all settlements more closely to the increase inthe last 12 months of the RPI.   The consequences in my own field could wellbe extremely grave.   I will give three examples.   First, in the case of theCivil Servants affected by the current pay research proposals, abandonment of the pay research principle would be a clear breach of faith.   We shouldhave nothing to put in its place but collective bargaining.   There would undoubtedly be very serious and widespread unrest in the Government machine and a very real chance of a protracted breakdown in the payment of social security benefits.   Secondly, in the case of doctors and dentists, we already have industrial action from consultants;   junior hospital doctors are onlyholding back in the hope that they will get a good pay settlement, linkedto their new contract;   and the BMA are collecting undated resignations fromgeneral practitioners to be used if the pay settlement is considered by themunacceptable.   We could be faced with a complete breakdown of the national health Service.   Indeed the possibility of joint action for all doctors and dentists earlier this year was averted only by my urging them to await the review Body&apos;s recommendations and telling them, in agreement with theSecretary of State for Employment, that it was the Government&apos;s intention that the recommendations in the report will be treated in the same spirit and way as the recommendations for the public services made in the top salaries Review Body Report.   Thirdly, great difficulty could be caused byany interruption of services by members of the scientific and technicalclasses in the National Health Service, including a risk to life.7.     If we were to take such a course we should in my view at the very least be compelled to reverse the decision which we have taken (and implemented)in regard to the Top Salaries Review Body&apos;s Report.   It would not bedefensible to deny comparability to Assistant Secretaries and below in theCivil Service while preserving it for more senior people.   Nor would itbe practicable to accept (except for staging awards at the higher levels)the report of one Review Body and to reject a similar report from another.A reversal of a decision would at least bring home the seriousness of ourintent.   We should certainly have to accompany it with the announcement ofour intention to take action in the private sector as soon as Lord Diamond&apos;commission has reported.2
8.     In recent evidence which has been given to Review Bodies we have asked them to have regard to the TUC guidelines and the other considerations which they believe to be relevant but they have not been given explicitadvice on comparability and the application of the guidelines and they havebeen told that they cannot be given a Government view in advance of their detailed recommendations being seen by the Government and the considerationson which these recommendations have been made.   If we are to follow thisstronger line I think the Review Bodies should be advised forthwith of ourview.   The DDRB will be completing their report at Easter.   In view of theletter sent to the Chairman of the DDHB prior to appointment (Annex. II)there is a real chance of him and his colleagues resigning.9.     In my view the only other course is to accept that it is not practicableor desirable to act discriminately against those who are unfortunate enoughto come up for consideration towards the end of the year since we abolishedstatutory powers.   I believe it is only defensible if we deal with eachproposed settlement as nearly as we can in line with what we have already decided elsewhere.   In the case of the Review Bodies this would still leave us, consistently, with the opportunity to phase increases in salary at thelevel at which they were phased following the Top Salaries Review Body report.Unfortunately it will still leave us with the implementation of a number ofsettlements of embarrassing size.   We will be helped in dealing with the associated publicity if we are at the same time making it quite clear thatthe present situation cannot continue;   and that we are consulting the TUCon the need for new and tougher guidelines for the post-July period.   Actionprior to July would be strongly resented as arbitrary and inconsistent andwould I think effectively sabotage any hope of achieving a tougher voluntarycode.10.   It is not for this committee to decide what those tougher guidelinesshould be or the extent to which the principle of comparability may haveto be modified in future but it is essential that the policy should be fair as between the public and private sectors.   We are also more likelyby July to be able to persuade the TUC and the CBI to accept firmerguidelines, not just because of the general economic climate, but because it can be argued that in one year of free collective bargaining we willhave removed some of the worst distortions of the statutory pay policy.11.   I invite my colleagues:a. to reject any phasing or interference with the current pay research findings unless this is part of an overall strategy including the review of our previous decisions on top salaries;b. to initiate consultations with the TUC on the need for tougherguidelines in those cases where a substantive settlement has alreadybeen made following the lifting of statutory controls.8 &amp;department of Health and social security london SE16 March 1975

lO DOWNING STREETFrom the Principal Private Secretary6 February 1975Thank you for your letter of 4 February.The Prime Minister has asked me to say that theGovernment is committed to the principle that there shouldbe no discrimination against the public services,  or thepublic sector generally, in matters of pay.      Thus itaccepted, large though they were, the increases recommendedlast year by Lord Halsbury for nurses and professionssupplementary to medicine and by Lord Houghton for non-university teachers, because it acknowledged the need foran up-to-date reassessment of the relative position ofthose professions.      Thus, too, the Government is committed to maintain the principle of fair comparison with remuneration for comparable outside employment as the basis for settling the pay of the Civil Service.The Government is of course committed to general policies of redistribution of income and wealth;    but these policiesare of general appliaction to private and public sectors alike,and it is not Government policy to discriminate against thepublic sector in putting into effect its general redistributivepolicies.The three Review Bodies - on Top Salaries, Doctors&apos;  and dentists&apos; Remuneration, and Armed Forces Pay and Allowances -were established by the last Administration to advise theGovernment on the pay of certain groups in the public services for whom the ordinary processes of settlement by negotiation between management and staff representatives were for one reason or another unavailable or inappropriate.      The present government has confirmed its commitment to this method of determining the remuneration of the groups concerned.      in doing so, it has recognised that the acceptability of the systemdepends upon the maintenance of the confidence of all concernedin the independence and integrity of the Review Bodies,  and upon an understanding that the Government will not only not seek to influence the Review Bodies&apos;  findings for political ends, but will also accept and implement their recommendations unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to do so.REGRET
All that I have said is of general application.      Thereare particular problems in relation to high-level salaries inthese groups - mainly the salaries of those covered by the top Salaries Review Body, but also of course the salaries ofthe highest-paid doctors and dentists in the National health service. ....The increases recently recommended by the Top salaries review Body were the result of the first substantive review ofthese salaries since 1969, and represented very large increases,both in absolute and in proportionate terms.      The government recognised that the rates recommended were appropriate rates on the basis of the principles on which the Review Body conductedits review, but at a time of critical economic difficulty feltcompelled (in respect of three out of the four groups coveredby the review) to phase the implementation of the increases.In relation to the salaries of the Chairmen and Members of boards of nationalised industries, some of the salaries concerned are (for the public sector) especially high, and some of the increases recommended were particularly large;    and the cross-references to private industry are more direct than is the case with the other groups covered by the Top Salaries Review Body.The Government had already asked the Royal Commission on income distribution and Wealth to undertake an inquiry on higherincomes;    and immediate acceptance and implementation of the review Body&apos;s recommendations (which could also have hadconsequences for decisions on salaries at comparable levels ofresponsibility in private industry) could have prejudiced the findings of the Royal Commission&apos;s inquiry and decisions in thelight of their recommendations.      The Government therefore thoughtit right to postpone decisions on the Review Body&apos;srecommendations until after the Royal Commission had reported,but to ask the Royal Commission to accelerate its inquiry andthe completion of its report.The Prime Minister has, however,  asked me to assure you that, within whatever general policies may be adopted in thelight of the Royal Commission&apos;s review of the considerationsapplicable to high incomes in both the private and the publicsectors,  it will be the Governments intention that there shouldbe no discrimination against the public sector in theapplication of those policies.The Prime Minister very much hopes that with these assurances you will be ableto see your way to acceptingappointment to the chairmanship of the Review Body on Doctors&apos;and Dentists&apos; Remuneration.      He recognises that this will add
r-*     3    ***to the burdens upon you;    but he is in no doubt that yourappointment would command the confidence of the professions,as it certainly would that of the Government,  and reinforce the independence and integrity of the Review Body.R. T. armstrongSir Ernest Woodroofe,7
