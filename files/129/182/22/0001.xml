HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 4715 April 1975CABINETEXPORTS OF ARMS SPARES FOR SOUTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for Tiade1, I seek my colleagues agreement to proposals for bringing to an end the supply to South Africa of spare parts for weapons.2. When we resumed office in March 1974 we announced that we would continue the policy pursued in our previous Administration of embargoingthe sale of arms to South Africa.    Following our review of various aspectsof policy towards Southern Africa last year, the Foreign and commonwealth secretary stated, on 4 December, that we had completed an overhaul of the licensing arrangements for arms sales, and that this would ensure that our policies were fully in line with our international undertakings.3. The policy which has been established, and agreed within the defence and Oversea Policy Committee, will ensure a continuing tight embargo on all new weapons.    The future treatment of spares for weapons has not however been agreed and I believe that my colleagues would wish to consider this important element in our future policy.4. Since the United Nations Resolutions of 1963-64 calling for an end tothe supply of arms to South Africa both Conservative and LabourGovernments have allowed the continued export of spare parts for UnitedKingdom weapons previously supplied, with the exception of spares whichwould assist enforcement of apartheid.    When the Labour Government firstimposed the United Kingdom arms embargo in 1964, we allowed the executionof existing contracts, and in 1965 we accepted as a general principle that a contract to supply equipment carried with it an undertaking that thenecessary spare parts would be provided.    But we made a specific reser-vation about spares which would assist the enforcement of apartheid.    Underthis reservation supplies of spares for military fighting vehicles were brought to an end by 1967.5.        I believe that the policy on spares which we adopted in 1965 shortly after the imposition of the arms embargo is no longer appropriate.    It isnow some 10 years since most of the weapons were supplied and there havebeen developments in our general policies towards South Africa includingCOPY NO        0d6 L1
our decision to withdraw from the Simonstown Agreement.    I consider thatit would be a logical development of these policies to make arrangements now to end the supply of spares.    Otherwise the South Africans will be ableto prolong the normal life of the weapons provided before the embargo andto update them, in a way which I do not think we could defend.6.        There is still a substantial demand for weapon spares.    There were186 applications for export licences, totalling  5.6 million from March-December 1974 and 89 applications valued  2.1 million in the first threemonths of 1975.    Most relate to aircraft spares but there is a significantnumber for naval equipment spares,7. I think we should distinguish between &quot;sharp&quot; spares clearly related to the offensive role of the weapon where I consider we should allow nofurther exports, and &quot;non-sharp&quot; spares where we could reasonably phaseout supplies more gradually.    Accordingly I propose that:-i. We should refuse all applications for the export of &quot;sharp&quot;weapon spares, such as gunnery equipment (including naval gunneryand practice ammunition), bomb carriers and night vision equipment.ii. In the case of other weapon spares, for aircraft and navalequipment, officials should examine the contractual position in eachcase and, having regard to the nature of the equipment and the period for which it has been in use, recommend ways of phasing out thespares in an orderly manner but without involving Government actionto break existing contracts.    I envisage that where contracts existproviding for supply up to a fixed date, notice should be given thatexport licences would not generally be issued beyond that date.Where there is no such contract officials should consider thecircumstances in each case and recommend how soon supplies could resonably be terminated.8. I recognise that in adopting a more stringent policy for the future wemust be careful to avoid acting in ways which would provoke harmfulreactions on our defence sales to other countries of our own civil trade with south Africa.    I do not believe that my proposals will have this effect.    Thespecial position of South Africa in relation to the United Nations Resolutionsis well understood elsewhere, and action to adopt a stricter policy in line with those Resolutions is unlikely to have wider implications for our armssales to other countries.    As for our trade with South Africa, while thestopping of further sharp spares would no doubt be ill-received, the orderlyphasing out of non-pharp spares for weapons supplied many years ago and forwhich we are no longer under any firm contractual obligation should not giverise to difficulty.    My proposals would, I consider, be a consistent anddefensible development of our publicly stated policies towards South Africa,and would not, I believe, result in harmful reprisals.9.        I invite my colleagues approval to the proposals in paragraph 7 above.Department of Trade15 April 1975
