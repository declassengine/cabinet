4o     It should be noted that those binder (i) qualify wherever they are butthat those under (ii) to (iv) qualify only when resident, outside the United kingdom:5o     Service voters may only be registered in pursuance of a service declaration.This declaration is made with a view to registration in the register of electorsfor a particular year, and must be attested, in the case of the armed forces, bya commissioned officer or member of a government department, and, in the case of Crown servants and British Council staff, by an officer of the employing Departaenor of the British Council, as the case may be, or another person with a servicequalification through being employed in the service of the Crown in a postoutside the United Kingdom0   Service declarations made by members of the forces are sent direct to the registration officer;   in other cases they are sent byway of the Government department concerned or the British Council as the case may be0   There is provision for the department and the British Council to indicatethat declarations appear to be invalid and for the registration officer to disregard these, and to return declarations if these appear to him to be invalid,giving his reason for doing so060     The names of electors included in the register in consequence of a servicedeclaration are marked with an SoService voters - method of voting7o     Service declarations are set out in two parts, the second part beingprovision for a proxy to be appointed at the same time as the declaration itself is madeD   Such an appointment is optional;   an appointment may be made later oran existing appointment may be changed or cancelledo
80     In the United Kingdom Service voters may vote(i) in person,(ii) by post,(iii) by proxy0She grant of a postal vote to a service voter is dependent only on his being able to provide an address in the United Kingdom to which the ballot paper maybe sento   The grant of a postal vote to a service voter for an election entailsthe cancellation of any proxy for that election;   it also precludes the servicevoter from voting in persono   A subsisting proxy appointment does not preclude the service voter voting in person if he can do so before his proxy reaches thepolling station.,9o     Service voters who cannot provide an address in the United Kingdom to whichthe ballot paper should be sent are not entitled to apply for a postal voteBi ,,They can vote only by proxy, or, if they happen to be in the country on pollingday and can reach the polling station before their proxy, in person01945 Arrangements10o   A special service register was brought into existence in 1944o   A conference which reported in January 1945 estimated that by 15 March that year the serviceregister would be SOfo comprehensiveo   In response to the recommendations of that conference special arrangements were made for any election held between april and September 1945oThe main features were as follows s-(i) The closing date for the service register was 15 March (31 january,yfor the civilian population)(ii) Various theatres of the war were designated postal, voting area so(iii) Postal votes were permitted for any application from such an ares.received by a certain closing daten
(iv) To avoid a long election campaign, and at the same time to allowtime for the receipt of overseas postal votes, counting did not beginuntil 3 weeks after polling dayQ(v) Existing proxy appointments were allowed to stand in case anythingwent wrong with posting arrangements, but elaborate provision wasmade for the count to be conducted in such a way that a proxy couldbe rejected if a postal vote had been received for the same electorsThese provisions were incorporated in the Representation of the People Bill whichhad been introduced on 19 December 1944 and received Royal Assent on15 February 1945oo cai. e of problemllo   Figures produced for Speaker&apos;s Conference in 1973 showed that the numberof members of the armed forces and of wives resident abroad was then some 404,000Crown servants, British Council staff, and their wives accounted for anotherIOjOOOo    The 1974-5 register included registrations for only some 100,000service voterso    (Figures for the current register are not yet available:2 general elections last year may have prompted greater interest and produced a slightly higher proportion of registrations.!)   It is understood that crown servants are, for the most part, likely to have made their declarations and thatthe deficit will be almost entirely among members of the armed forceso12o To these must be added the Government servants who are excluded from thecurrent definition of Crown Servants (paragraph 3 above) The number of these is unlikely to exceed a few hundredo
)POSSIBLE SCHEMES. FOR REFERENDUM13o   There are 3 main aims to be achieved^(i)to give a vote to Service voters who failed to make their service declaration (the majority, if not all, in this category vrill be members of the armed forces)(ii)to give a vote to civil servants serving overseas who arenot Service voters because they fall outside the definition of Crown servants0(iii)in either case, to permit postal voting from overseas insteadof proxy votingoWhatever solution is adopted ought also to preserve broadly the same safeguardsas the existing electoral law0ll+o There are two main alternatives; a supplementary register, or voting byunitso The&apos; first would use adaptations of existing arrangements; the second would be a new schemeoAo     A supplementary register15o   This could be compiled by arranging for service declarations for the1976-7 register to be submitted as soon as possible,,   Provision might then beincluded in the Bill for e0r0o0&apos;s to compile a supplementary register of anyser-vice declarant who is not already on the cur-rent registers    (Declarationsinclude service numbers so identification should be easyo)   Declarations mayalready include nominations of proxies, so these appointments could proceedbefore Royal Assentol6o   There would be problems connected with the supply of forms and envelopesand the preparation and promulgation of advice and^instructionso   If work beganon 21 March it is estimated that the material would reach all units not later than
30 Aprilo   For the distribution of forms to men (and their wives) completionof forms and return to electoral registration officers another 2 weeks is theminimum time which could realistically be allowedo   The closing date for such a supplementary register ought to be not later than 4 weeks before polling daywhich would give a maximum time for many men to receive, complete and return thei;forms of about 4 weeks017o   Such a timetable would be bound to create problems both for the men andfor electoral registration officerso   Some men would have a maximum effective ticsof about 3 weeks to absorb the new instructions and do the necessary work(longer in the United Kingdom and Western Europe)   For e0r00o&apos;s there would be considerable extra work in identifying those eligible,   compiling the supplementary lists, writing to proxies, and granting postal, voting applications.In theory the suggested timetable should just allow for thiso   In practice,however, there are a number of complications,.   In England there will be local elections in Metropolitan districts on 1 May0   In Scotland there will be localgovernment reorganisation on 16 May and in Northern Ireland there will be theConstitutional Convention elections on 1 May0   In addition, 4 weeks beforemaypolling day/coincide.  Y/ith the Spring Bank Holiday0   To fix an earlier closing   day for the supplementary register would make it virtually impossible for theservices to complete their part of the work;   nor would bringing the date forward 1help those eor.0oS who will be affected by the other considerations mentionedaboveo   The coincidence of a hump of work vrith a Bank Holiday weekend, however,would create serious difficulties of another kindo180   Timing considerations alone, therefore, suggest that while this scheme might Isucceed in enfranchising a proportion of service voters who are not on thecurrent register, at the same time, it would run the serious risk of disappointin0Jexpectations on a very wide scale-because of the arrival of declarations out of til
19o   Other difficulties would be the position of service men on leave, detachedduty, or in submarines, during the short period for return of declarations,the possibility of dual registrations if a serviceman on the current registersent his new declaration to a different area and the absence of any procedure for challenging the supplementary registeroPostal Voting20o One reason suggested for the low level of registration in the armed forces is the fact that, from overseas, voting can at present only be by proxy0 there might, therefore, be little response to a scheme for a supplements.ry registerIunless overseas postal voting could be permitted at the same time    Tills mightjust be possibleo   The Bill would have to include provision for thiso   Applicationsfor postal voting facilities might accompany service declarations on a form whichwould have no effect until after Royal Assento   There would then, however, justbe time for them to be granted and for ballot papers to be sent out and returnedbefore the close of the poll0   If the application was received out of time - whichwould have to be fixed at 3 weeks before polling day - existing proxy appointmentswould continue to be effective.,   But if the application was in time the proxywould be cancelledo   The Service voter1s vote would then depend on his being ableto receive and return his ballot paper in tirae0   There would be a real risk thatpostal delays would in some cases prevent this0210   The strongest pressure for postal voting from overseas appears to come from members of the armed force so   There is some pressure for this from crown Servants,but these appear to have their proxy arrangements better organised..   If postalvoting were extended to overseas it would clearly be appropriate to make thisavailable for Crown Servants as well as servicemen.,   It is understood, however,that FoCOo at least would be disposed to advise their staff to stick to existingproxy arrangements because of the risk of losing their vote completely in the
&apos;&amp;&apos;oyernment: Servants lent to overseas governments220   If supplementary registers for Service voters were to be arranged, provisionmight be made for the category of civil servants abroad who do not come withinthe existing description of Crown Servants but whose posting is not of theirown volitioiio   This category includes staff lent to overseas governments andappointments such as the Governor of Hong kong   The practical difficulties ofdealing with a few hundred in this position would not be very greato   Thedifficulty of defining the category, however, might be considerable   It mightnot always be possible to distinguish between the civil servant who had beenseconded in this way as part of his career and the member of the staff of aninternational organisation   This difficulty might prove to be insuperable^Moreover., if supplementary registers are not to be printed for service voters^- he work needed to provide them for this group alone would be likely to bedisproportionate,, &apos;Bo     A system of unit voting23o     Although there is no precedent in United Kingdom practice, Ministry ofDefence are confident that unit voting arrangements, based on service nominalrolls could be arrangedo   These would have to be organised by a special unit,detailed instructions for commanders would have to be prepared and other administrative work carried out to   Provision would need to be made for pollingdaj in units to be in advance of polling day in the United Kingdom so thatballot boxes could be returned in time    Provision would also have to be madeto enable the ordinary electoral safeguards to be applied as far as possible soas to secure secrecy, and exclude corrvipt and unlawful electoral practiceso24o   Such, a scheme would differ from the 1945 arrangements in substitutingservice rosters for the electoral registers,.   The centralised count would preclude any comparison being made between those who had voted in units andvotes cast locally.   Dual voting by proxies^ therefore5 would only be eliminateby cancelling all seryice^Y.8tl o- for the referendumrLi

( pnr\!ary:i\m/M 1r    Xj U 5 y i  5 Ij Lilt ir:L    J.....&quot;............to not qualify as Crown Servants (paragraphs 11   and 12)(iv) There are basically two schemes for. giving a vote in the referendum to service voters who are not on the current register (paragraphs 13 and 14-)(v) A supplementary register could be compiled by relying on making declarationsfor next year&apos;s register earlyo   But the operation would be difficult to underataniand to operate in the time available, both at the Service and the registrationendSo   Overseas postal arrangements could be grafted on, but at the expense ofadditional administrative strain..   The probability is that such arrangements would give a vote to a proportion of those at present disfranchised but that an equivalent, or larger, proportion might well find themselves out of tiffiSo   Therewould be some other disadvantages (paragraphs 13-21)(vi) Civil Servants whose service overseas does not qualify them for service votingfacilities could be handled by a supplementary register, if one were introduced for the services, but hardly justify this in isolation..   Their statuss however,is difficult to define, and their enfranchisement could raise   issues ofprinciple (paragraph 22.)(vii) A system of unit voting could be introduced.,   This would be likely to makevoting available to a wider range of servicemen than the scheme of supplementaryregisters.)   It would, however, involve cancelling existing facilities forservicemen so as to avoid dual voting, and this would mean disfranchising thosewho had made their declarations but could not vote through units for one reason or anotherc   There would also be a risk of giving votes to some who could notothervri.se qualify (paragraphs 23 and 24)1, I s-\ LI.J
