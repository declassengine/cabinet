&amp;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT\ l&apos;P 9C(75) 28 COPY NO    &quot;&apos;0b11 March 1975CABINETREFERENDUM:  EXTENSION OF FRANCHISE and additional VOTING FACILITIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. At their meeting on 20 February the Cabinet invited me, inconsultation with the Lord President and other Ministers concerned, toconsider whether a practicable system could be devised for providing postalvotes for Servicemen and others working abroad, and to consider a contingency plan for postal votes for holidaymakers (CC(75) 9th Conclusions,Minute 3).    Time has precluded consultation at Ministerial level but my own conclusion is that the difficulties, though considerable, should nevertheless be surmountable by adopting the arrangements described inthe annex to this paper.2.        I myself firmly believe that the principle is right.    In view of what has been described as the unique character of the forthcoming referendum,it seems most desirable to ensure that we give the greatest possible opportunity to people to register their votes; indeed if we decline to do sowe will inevitably come under severe criticism.   Ln these circumstances do not consider that the normal electoral criterion of current residenceis adequate.    Nor, in the circumstances, does it seem justifiable, whilegiving votes to citizens of the Commonwealth and of the Irish Republic,the future of whose own countries is not at issue, to deny the franchise to united Kingdom citizens working abroad whose interests and prospects are still very much bound up with their homeland.    The end of June is not normally a time that would be chosen for a general election (still less July),and even if the timetable for the referendum is maintained, there will stillbe large numbers of people on holiday then, whom I believe that it would be wrong to disenfranchise on an issue of this moment; nor should I think itfair that Servicemen serving overseas should be disenfranchised becauseof their omission to register at a time when the full consequence wasunknown to them.3.        The Civil Service Department and the Treasury have been consulted on the extra costs of these proposals.    These are impossible to estimatewith any accuracy but might be of the order of  1. 6 million, of which 1 million represents the extra costs to the Foreign and Commonwealth1
Office, including the employment, on a temporary basis, of some extralocal staff at diplomatic posts;    0. 5 million is the estimated extra costto the Ministry of Defence (and takes account of the possible need to usespecial aircraft to transport ballot papers);  and  0,1 million representsextra printing and stationery costs,4, I believe that the proposals contained in the annex for enlarging the franchise and extending voting facilities are right in principle, and that thepractical problems, though considerable, are nevertheless well capable ofsolution.    I therefore seek the endorsement of my colleagues, so that:a. the principles can be founded in the Referendum Bill;b. a start can be made at once in working out the detailed arrangements for the purposes of the Order;  andc. as much advance notice as possible can be given to those affected by, or required to operate, the arrangements.R H j home Office11 March 19752
CONFIDENTIALPOSTAL VOTES FOR &quot;HOLIMYMAKERS&quot;Here no enlargement of the register would &quot;be needed, only theextension of voting facilities..    It would hardly &quot;be possible to limit the extension in terms to those on holiday;    it would have tobe to those who declared that, for whatever reason, they expectedto &quot;be absent from home on polling day.   The difficulty is not inthe drafting of the necessary provisions but in the additional burden of work which would be thrown upon the electoral registration officers, and the accompanying problems of providing the necessaryforms, stationery, etc.   I believe that, with due notice, the taskcould be accomplished, provided only that there is no reduction inthe planned period between Royal Assent and the poll.2.     I propose that the facility should extend to those on holidayat home or abroad or otherwise temporarily absent;   on theunderstanding that those abroad would have to pay whatever postagewas necessary and take the chance of postal delays,SERVICE VOTERS3.     There is the double object of giving a second opportunity tothose servicemen who have neglected to register, and of substitutingpostal voting for voting by proxy, which is generally unpopular.There are two possibilities:a. To make arrangements to ensure that the servicedeclarations for the 1976/77 register are submitted beforethe Bill receives Royal Assent, and to provide in the Billfor the current registers to be amended to include anydeclarant who is not already on it.   This, by itself,would simply establish an entitlement to vote by proxy;but the Bill could at the same time extend postal votingto servicemen,b. To provide, in effect (and on the precedent of the 194-5election) for service units to poll abroad, under the supervision of their commanding officers, who would besupplied with the necessary ballot forms and beresponsible for verifying entitlement;   the ballot boxes,with the voting lists or other forms of authentication,then being sent direct to the national returning officer for the votes to be included in the central count,(Or, if in theevent there were no central count, to the returning officerfor one named area or a specially appointed returning officer.)A-,     IHe first alternative would raise a number of serious difficulties in getting the declarations forward in time, in theadditional work imposed upon the already over-burdened electoral registration officers, and in ensuring the dispatch and receipt ofthe postal votes by polling day.   The second would involve the- 1 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsubstitution, for this occasion only, of an entirely new system,taking advantage of the central count.   It would have the merits of speed, directness and simplicity, but there would be problems connected eg with servicemen on leave or on detached duty.   Ipropose that each alternative should be given further, urgent,study;   but I believe that the second will be found to be the&quot;more satisfactory,OVERSEAS RESIDENTS (OTHER THAN SERVICE VOTERS)5.     Among United Kingdom citizens residing abroad to whom servicevoting facilities are at present denied, but whose claims seem tome particularly meritorious, are those employed by organisationsancillary to the armed forces, such as NAAFI, and those employed in international organisations, of all kinds, of which theUnited Kingdom is a member,    I should also, however, wish to seethe facilities extend to all whose business, employment, professionor calling has caused them temporarily to reside abroad, although they have previously been resident in the United Kingdom and oughtproperly to be regarded as still settled here.   There is a problemof definition, but the underlying concept seems to me sufficiently clear for an acceptable and serviceable definition to be found,6.     The right to vote, in these cases, would not extend to Britishsubjects in general but be strictly confined to citizens of theUnited Kingdom and colonies, and the qualification would involvea continuing connexion with the United Kingdom alone.   The systemI contemplate, once again taking advantage of the central count,would be for consular officers overseas to be given theresponsibility for establishing the credentials of those concerned,on the basis of passport information and of declarations made by the applicants as to their past residence and the circumstances oftheir present residence abroad;   of dispatching the ballot papers(stocks of which would be supplied for the purpose) and of receiving the votes, which would then be forwarded, dulyauthenticated, to the national returning officer (or a selectedreturning officer)o   In effect, the consuls would construct theirown registers of entitlement.   Preferably this should be done in anticipation of the passage of the Bill so that the ballot paperscan be sent out as soon as possible thereafter.Home OfficeWhitehall- 2--CONFIDEMTIAL
