:HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 422COPY NO21 M*rc&amp; 2975CABINETTIMING OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFIIN SECOND HALF OF 1975BENEFIT INCREASEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services.foillows: -My existing programme which was approved last autumn, is asi.     Uprate all social security benefits and family allowances(FAM) in the week beginning 7 April;  the increase in the long-term national insurance benefits will be one of 16 per cent(from  10/ 16 to  11/18.50) and that in FAM one of 60p forthe first and 50p for each subsequent qualifying child, makingthe present 90p/ 1 into  1. 50 in all cases, which will fallsomewhat short of restoring their October 1968 value for thenon-tax payer (this was the date on which they were last increased).ii.    a.    Uprate the discretionary heating additions payable withsupplementary benefit (some 700, 000 are now in payment).b. Increase supplementary benefit disregards (some250, 000 people will benefit but some of these are thesame people as under a); andc. increase the Family Income Supplement (FIS) (presentload some 70, 000 people on annual average)  - all in July.iii. Introduce, in August, the new non-contributory invalidity pension (NCIP) for the congenitally disabled who cannot earn a living.iv. Make the second uprating to which we are committed in 1975effective from the week beginning 1 December, with no Christmasbonus (though no announcement has yet been made that there willbe no bonus).
2. I was invited by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy(MES) to study additional ways of helping poorer consumers, especially the disabled and the aged to meet rising prices, in particular against the background of the proposed increases in fuel prices.    Even though the increases in the di.scretiona.ry heating additions would fully cover all existing and prospective increases in fuel prices, and the increase Sn FISwould be fully commensurate with the movement in prices, these twoimprovements would be too limited in scope to make any major impact onthe problem faced by the generality of those who are dependent on social security payments before the general uprating planned for December.    Onthe formula we have adopted the increase in December would representa substantial real improvement which would probably restore the positionof pensioners relative to earnings to the July 1974 level.    However, itwould give no relief for the months before December and by this autumnthe purchasing power of the pension will be 7 per cent less than the newlevels we established last July despite the April uprating.    By thebeginning of October our expenditure on benefits will be running at anannual rate of nearly  500 million less than would be needed to restoretheir purchasing power to the level achieved last July.3. If therefore, we are to fulfil, the remit given me by MES it will benecessary to bring forward the uprating planned for December to theearliest possible date of week beginning 6 October.    We should then bedemonstrating the genuineness of our commitment to uprating asfrequently as necessary in the present inflationary situation.    It is truethat this advancement would only be operationally practicable if wedeferred the increases in heating additions, supplementary benefitdisregards and NCIP from the summer to October (it may be possible to commence FIS at the beginning of August if legislation to abolish the supplementary benefit &quot;wage stop&quot; has by then been enacted).    However,there would be a considerable operational gain from this, from which weshould hope to obtain full co-operation of the staff, in making all theoperations coincide at the beginning of October.    We should, however,given advancement of the general uprating to October again be underirresistible pressure to make another Christmas bonus payment.Bringing forward the uprating from December to October (with defermentof the other increases from July to October) would cause no significantextra costs in 1975-76.    A single  10 Christmas bonus would cost about 75 million at 1974 survey prices ( 90 million cash).4. The MES Committee agreed that the date of the second 1975 upratingshould be brought forward from December and invited me, in consultationwith the Chancellor, to consider whether the date of the uprating should beOctober or November;  and whether there should be an accompanyingstatement indicating that there would be no Christmas bonus.2
5. I have been unable to reach agreement with the Chancellor, whois concerned with the implications of my proposals for expenditure in later years;  in particular that a fourth Christmas bonus payment willmake subsequent repetition inevitable at similar cost each year; andthat a second uprating in 1975 exactly six months after the first will seta pattern of six-monthly upratings in future at a cost of roughly 200 million extra each year (excluding any bonus).    He has suggestedinstead a small acceleration of this year&apos;s uprating to second half ofNovember with a lump sum payment in September, with increases inheating allowances etc, returned to July.6. The Chancellor&apos;s suggested alternative is impracticable onoperational grounds alone.    We cannot contemplate involving our offices in a series of operations which overlap but have different dates for implementation.    We are putting an unprecedented load of extra workon our offices this year.    In the light of last year&apos;s confrontation (whichwe cannot afford to repeat) we must so far as possible, in framing our policies and their timing,pay regard to operational considerations.    Ifwe seem to be ignoring these for reasons that will not be readilyappreciated by the staff, and adopting timetables that maximise the extrawork falling on our offices, the militants will have no difficulty inexploiting this and other discontents that may arise out of the pay review and over our review of grading allowances and will seek to exact from usa price for doing the work which we cannot afford to pay.    We shall notagain be able to buy our way out with promises     The recent &quot;WiderIssues Review&quot; underlines the importance of this and it has of course been further pointed out in the Prime Minister&apos;s recent personal minute of19 February (M 32/75) on Management of the Civil Service.    Indeed in thelight of current staff attitudes I would now envisage great difficulty incarrying out the programme referred to in paragraph 1 and I do not think we can safely revert to it.7. I conclude that we have little practical,, or political, option but togo for a general uprating at the beginning of October, with the heatingallowance etc. improvements deferred until then, with a Christmas lump sum payment.    If during April we are clear that legislation to abolish the wage stop will be enacted by August we could, in the light of prevailingstaff attitudes, then take a decision to increase FIS at the beginning ofAugust.    October is the earliest date on which we can achieve a generaluprating and, to me, the latest politically acceptable date to which wecould defer the increases in heating allowances etc.    I seek mycolleagues agreement to this.    As regards expenditure implications for later years I would have viewed with great concern the implications of a lump sum in the autumn as suggested by the Chancellor; this would notnecessarily enable us to avoid a similar Christmas bonus and might well,be a precedent for more frequent lump sums.    The risk of having to havetwo upratings in 1976-77 (or in subsequent years) depends above all on
the pace of inflation not on the advancement by two months of the seconduprating in this year.    To the extent that we are successful in reducinginflation we shall be in a strong political position to return to less frequent upratings.    But if we are not successful I do not think we couldresist the demand that the value of pensions and benefits should be preserved.    To do any less would be to reverse our existing policies,and would mean that we were financing our economic strategy, includingthe phasing out of subsidies, at the expense of those we have promised toprotect.    But we need an immediate decision if an October uprating isto be possible at all.BACDepartment of Health and Social Security21 March 19754
