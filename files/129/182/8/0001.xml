S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENTbC(75) 33 COPY NO   C3 &amp;14 March 1975CABINETEEC: RENEGOTIATION STOCKTAKINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs,, The Cabinet agreed on 6 March (CC(75) 11th Conclusions, Minute 3)to take stock on Monday 17 March of the outcome of renegotiation.2. Renegotiation began a year ago with my statement in the Council ofMinisters on 1 April 1974, which was published as Cmnd 5593.    Our agreedapproach was to seek changes in the policies and decisions of the community to meet our needs, though I reserved the right to propose Treaty amendmentsif our essential needs could not otherwise be met. \3. Renegotiation has centred on the 7 objectives in our Manifesto ofFebruary 1974.    As a basis for the Cabinefs discussion, I attach (Annex A)a statement of our objectives under the 7 Manifesto headings, and of theresults we have achieved.    I have tried to make this as factual as possible.In view of our discussion on 27 February (CC(75) 10th Conclusions, Minute 4)I have set out as fully as possible on pages 14-16 of the Annex our discussions in the Community on the steel question.4. In the light of the agreements reached at the European Council in dublin on the outstanding issues of a correcting mechanism for theCommunity budget and arrangements for access after 1977 for New Zealanddairy products, the Prime Minister has already made clear that our discussions within the Community on renegotiation have been taken as faras they can go.    The other Heads of Community Governments have taken note of our position, while fully recognising that we shall naturally continueto pursue our aims and interests - eg on Common Agricultural Policy reform and aid to non-associates - in the course of normal Community businessprovided that we remain in the Community after the referendum.5. We must now, therefore, review what has been achieved in the renegotiation as a whole.    The associated question of Parliamentarysovereignty can be discussed on the basis of the separate memorandum on theLegislation Committee!s discussions which the Lord President is circulating.1
The implications of withdrawal are also relevant to the Cabinefs decision;and I attach (Annex B) a note on this aspect designed to give as balanced a picture as possible of the new situation, range of issues and specificconsequences with which we would be confronted,6. On all these questions it will be a matter for judgment by the cabinet as to the extent to which we have fulfilled our Manifesto objectives, and asto whether Britain&apos;s interests will be best served inside or outside theCommunity.    1 shall be ready to give my opinion when we meet, butmeantime I make the following general observations as a result of 12 monthsexperience.First, the Community is changing fast, mostly in directions whichfit in with our aims and our presence has given considerableimpetus to these changes.Second in real life the Community is much more sensitive to thenational interests of its members than it might seem to be fromthe outside.Third, the Commission is zealous in trying to maintain the dutiesthat are placed upon it by the treaties and there is a continuingdialogue, and occasional friction, between the Commission and individual member States as to how far the Community should develop a policy at any given moment.Fourth, the very fact of regular meetings between the member states in the Council of Ministers tends to produce a consensusin trade, aid and social policies leading to greater co-ordination and to common policies.Fifth, it is the smaller members who on the whole take the lead orsupport the Commission in trying to produce common policies,sometimes as a means of protecting themselves against the largermembers of the Community,Sixth, there is an energetic and successful advocacy by member states of their national interests: for example, Germany in thematter of budgetary expenditure and energy policyj France, on theright to take independent political action and initiatives; Italy andIreland, in their quest for a regional fund, and so on.7.        I shall be ready to speak to the Annexes to this note, and to give mycolleagues any further information they would like on the individualrenegotiation issues.LJCForeign and Commonwealth Office14 March 19752

CONFIDENTIALOUTCOME   OP   RENEGOTIATIONANNEX     AI     C0KMO1T AGRICULTURAL policy.     In the February Manifesto the Government pledged itselfto securing &quot;major changes in the Common Agricultural Policy,so that it ceases to be a threat to world trade in food products,and so that low-cost producers outside Europe can. continue tohave access to the British food market&quot;.    The manifesto alsodrew attention to the need to secure better safeguards for theeconomic interests of the Commonwealth and the developing countries.   This involved securing continued access for thesecountries to the United Kingdom market.2,     The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food gave precisioto these objectives in his statement to the Council of ministers on 18 June.   He asked for:1.     The establishment of firm criteria for pricing policy, talcing account of the needs of efficient producers and the demand/supply situation.2.     Greater flexibility, taking account of the needfor appropriate measures to deal with special circumstances in different parts of the Community,5.     Measures to discourage surpluses and to give priority to Community consumers in the disposal of any surpluseswhich arise.4.     Improvement in the marketing regimes for some majorcommodities, particularly beef, with.a view to avoidingsurpluses.5.     The improvement of financial control.6,     Better access for certain commodities from outsidethe Community, with particular regard for the interestsof Commonwealth producers and of the consumer.
The object of these proposals was, in the words of the OctoberManifesto, Hto renegotiate the Common Agricultural Policy tomake sure shoppers get secure supplies of food at fair prices.&quot;A. Pricing Policy (Objective)3.     In the three price settlements since the Government took office the Ministry of Agriculture has succeeded in keepingprice increases below cost increases, thus reinforcing the downward trend in CAP prices in real terms.   This has benefitedconsumers and tax-payers and reduced the risk of surpluses0   TheCommission has increasingly related its price proposals to theneeds of efficient producers and the supply/demand situation foreach commodity, although the Council has not yet formallyendorsed this approach;   and it is reaffirmed in the Commission&apos;sreport on the stocktaking of the CAP.B. Greater flexibility to take account of special circumstances,and ^iiaprovemints in market regimes, especially beefTbTgeciives 2 and A)4.     There has been considerable progress in securing a more flexible operation of the CAP.    For beef, we have securedchanges under which Member States are no longer obliged to maintainhigh prices for producers by buying beef into store and denyingit to consumers.   Instead, they can let it go to consumers at reasonable prices and make up returns to producers by deficiency round partly financed by the Community. In addition specialencouragement has been given for sugar production in the UK. More/   generally
generally the monetary arrangements have been used to differentiathe percentage price increases between Member States.     There hasbeen more flexibility in the use of national aids.    Revision ofthe costly subsidy systems for olive oil and durum wheat has hadto be left over for the stocktaking, but the level of aid hasmeanwhile not been increased despite rising costs,C.     Me a Fsur e to dl no ou vp ge surpl \ i^e^/md more regard forComnunity con^-v-ioro ^Objective 3&quot;)5.     The downward pressure on CAP prices is the best safeguard against surplus production.     We have sought to reinforce this byprovision for the automatic reduction of support buying prices for milk products and cereals when surpluses arise.   the objectives will have to be pursued in the stocktaking of the CAPand we shall have the support of the Commission and the Germans s*surplus of cereals at present :-.     The third way to deal withsurpluses is to make sure that they go to Community consumersrather than being unloaded on world markets at great expense.This principle has been applied in the new arrangements for beef,in the beef subsidy for^jjensioners, and in the increased buttersubsidy.     Consumers/ESve also benefited from the monetary importsubsidies paid to devaluing countries and from special measuresto keep Community prices below world prices, notably the sugarfar as milk products are concerned,Cin the Uj^3import subsidy which is financed- by the Community./   D*    Improved
D.     Improved ?financial Control (Objective 5)6.     Progress is being made towards more effective financial control.   Better estimates of the costs and budgetary implications of new proposals and more regular information on expenditure isbeing provided.    Precautions against fraud are being improved.E*     Access for third-country foodstuffs (Objective 6)7*     Sugar   Details of the arrangements made for access of1 .4 million tons of sugar from developing countries are includedin the section of this Annex on trade and aid questions.8.     During the current period of shortages and high world prices for sugar the Community has also agreed to assure con-discontinuity of supplies for the areas of the Community which areexperiencing shortages (including the UK) and to subsidise theprice of sugar purchased under these arrangements down to Communityprice levels.    So far the United Kingdom refiners and manufacturershave purchased 170,000 tons of sugar under these arrangements with the aid of Community subsidies totalling  56m.9*     New Zealand Dairy produce   In the course of 1974 we securedan increase of 18^ in the prices paid to New Zealand for her dairyproduce under Protocol 18 of the Treaty of Accession in order totake account of rising costs of production.   After discussions with New Zealand Ministers, we secured agreement at the DublinHeads of Government meeting on the broad lines of the continuingarrangements which will be made for access for New Zealand dairy products after 1977.   These should give reasonable satisfaction to the New Zealanders on price by ensuring that prices areadjusted as necessary, taking all the relevant factors,including Community intervention prices, into account.   NewZealand dairy products will still be les3 expensive than.    / Community
Community products, but Hew Zealand farmers will get a betterreturn.   As regards quantities, we secured wording very close to that agreed with the ITew Zealand or s for the period up to1980, that is to say annual quantities remaining close toeffective deliveries under Protocol 18 in 1974 and the quantities currently envisaged by ITew Zealand for 1975.   Wehave not yet secured a specific commitment on cheese, but theposition has been left open (already an advance on Protocol 18)and the Community is on notice that we shall be pursuing thematter in the Protocol 18 review.10.    Improved access for some other foodstuffs has also been secured in the course of a number of general trade negotiations- eg the GA.TT Article XXIV:6 negotiations, the trade sectionsof the Lome Convention, the Mediterranean ilgreement and theCommunity&apos;sj 1975 Generalised Scheme of Preferences.   products for which improved access has been obtained include tropicaloils, Canadian Cheddar, soluble coffee and lard,11.   We have not yet achieved better access for certain other important foodstuffs.   V/e have requested levy-free quotas forhard wheat and flour, and put on record that we shall at anearly date seek reduction or elimination of the tariff on new Zealand lamb.    These and other access aspects will haveto be pursued further, some of them in the context of theforthcoming GATT multilateral trade negotiations ./ Summary
12*   In all our detailed objectives we have made progress *-This progress will need to be continued orconsolidated.   In this regard the Commission&apos;s stocktaking,report, which has some valuable ideas, should be helpful.Without consistent British pressure we could not have expectedthat report to be so relatively forward looking.13* -The world food situation is of critical importance when considering the CAP.    The recent CPRS report, (attached toHES(75)13) . W,hile acknowledgingthat no-one can forecast food supplies and prices -    says that&quot;there are strong grounds for thinking that what has happenedsince 1971 is not just a temporary self-reversing phenomenon,but represents a more permanent change.   In the next 10 to20 years there seems little likelihood.of a return to anything like the cheap food regime of the 1950&apos;s and i960&apos;s&quot;.   Inrelation to the CAP it says &quot;In general, the conclusion wouldbe that the changed world food scene means that the e.c. regimesfor cereals and sugar do not now represent anything like the disadvantage which they might have done a few years ago; andthat provided that the problem of the beef regime is resolved,e.c. membership should not aggravate the beef situation.   the butter problem remains .....&quot;
COHHUHITY BUDGET1,   The Manifesto commitment reads as follows:&quot;New arid fairer methods of financing the Community budget.Neither the taxes that form the so-called &quot;own resources&quot;Of the Communities, nor the purposes, mainly agricultural support, on which the funds are mainly to be spent, are acceptable to us.     We would be ready to contribute to community finances only such sums as were fair inrelation to what is paid and what is received by other member countries.&quot;2,    We decided in April that we would not set out to overturnthe &quot;own resources&quot; method of financing., the Community budget, but would rather seek to correct its unfair impact on the UK by an adjustment mechanism which would provide a refund to us.     we decided to go for an adjustment which would bring our grosscontribution more closely into line with our share of theCommunity&apos;s GDP.     The other members of the Community-raisenumerous objections of principle,3 .    It was not possible to secure progress until after the october election. We   secured agreement at the Heads of Government meeting in December that a correctivemechanism should be set up as soon as possible, taking intoaccount the suggestions we had made.     At the end of January,the Commission produced a report with recommendations for acorrective mechanism.     These were approved subject to one ortwo changes, at the Heads of Government meeting in Dublin on10/11 March. 4.. /   In order
4.    In order to qualify for a refund, a Member State willhave to have a GDP per head below 85$of the Community averageand a growth rate below 120$ of the Community average.     Itmust not be a net gainer from the Community budget.     We expect to qualify under these criteria during the whole of the seven-year trial period for which the correcting mechanism is to beset up.5.    Reimbursements are to be related to the whole of the gap between a Member State&apos;s GDP share and its share of the budget.They will be on a sliding scale, beginning at 105$ of GDPshare.     At over 130$ of GDP share, there will be 100$ refund.Refunds will be subject to several ceilings, namely:i)     that they should not make the Member State concerneda net gainer;ii) that they should not be larger than the whole of the member state&apos;s VAT contribution, and) in the case of the UK, a ceiling of 250 mua until there is a total budget size of 8,000 mua and thereafter 3$ of the Community budget.     The first two ceilings should not affect us (for the third see below).6.    There is a provision that when a moving average drawn upover three years indicates that the balance of payments on current account of the Member State concerned is in surplus,the correction shall only affect any diffierence between theamount of its VAT payments and its GDP share.     Finally, there/is
is a provision for a review if a Member State qualifies for acorrection for three years running, with the clear implication that its purpose would be to see what more the community should do.7 .    This result is reasonably satisfactory.     It is difficultto quantify the likely return in any given year, given thenumber of variables involved.     Experience shows that estimating the out-turn on the Community budget is extremely difficult.The 1971 estimates, for example, were that there would be a netUK contribution of  165 million in 1974 and  200 million in 1975.Our actual contribution in 1974 was  30 million and our presentestimate for 1975 is  60-S70 million.     But we would expect to begin to benefit from a correction in respect of the 1977 budgetwith a refund rising rapidly thereafter to over  100 million.In negotiation, we have had to accept that our gross contribution would to some extend exceed our GDP share.     I would not like to try to put a figure to this for any given year.     Clearly thereis some risk in regard to the budgets for 1980 and subsequent years.     If the situation were to become serious in respect ofthe 1980 budget, we should be able to take advantage of thethree-year review.     We should, moreover,   bAjbl       to improve ourposition on the recipts 3ide.     The Regional Development Fund,for example, is    useful in this direction, as havebeen various arrangements negotiated by the Minister ofAgriculture, such as the sugar subsidy.8,      I conclude that the outcome of the budget does not meet our Manifesto aims but that the agreed compromiserepresents a very worthwhile financial improvement.
ECONOMIC AND MONETARY union the Manifesto commitment reads as follows?&quot;We would reject any kind of international agreement which compelled us to accept increased unemploymentfor the sake of maintaining a fixed parity ...     Webelieve that the monetary problems of the european countries can be resolved only in   a world-wideframework.&quot;There has been a major change in the attitude of otherEconomic Governments to the practicability of achievingEconomic and Monetary Union by 1980,   The programme foradvancing to EMU by stages, adopted in 1971 and 1972 and endorsed by the Paris Summit of 1972, has been tacitly abandoned.The second stage which was due to start on 1 January 1974 has never been adopted.   Work by the Council in this area has beenvirtually at a standstill for some time and new ideas which maybe brought forward are expected to be on a more pragmatic basis.There is no prospect of our coming under pressure to agree toan arrangement which would threaten the level of employmentin the UK.     EMU remains a long-term Community goal but we will be able to ensure that our interests are fully protectedif and when proposals are made for steps in that direction.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has encouraged theCommunity to consider monetary problems on a world-wide scale and the Member States are taking part fully in the various international fora where these matters can be resolved.- 10 -/   REGIONAL
C ::   -;:.-:E:V&quot;:.: HI.&quot; \REGIONAL IimUGTRIAL AND FISCAL POLICIES1.     Our Election Manifesto of February 1974 stated our objective as:&quot;The retention by Parliament of those powers overthe British economy needed to pursue effectiveregional; industrial and fiscal policies.&quot;2.     So far as regional and industrial policy is concerned,-we had in mind the provisions of Articles 92-94 of the EECTreaty which lay down rules governing the admissibility ofstate assistance to industry.   Article 92 prohibits aids whichmight distort competition so as to affect trade between member states (with exceptions to cover certain regional, social andsectoral aids); and Article 93 gives to the Commission the initial responsibility for deciding whether any particularaid is compatible with the Common Market, subject to review by the Court of Justice or by a unanimous decision of theCouncil.Regional Policyhad3.     The Commission, have/ intensive discussion with us andas.a result have with other Member Governments,, and/ jaroducea a communicationformulating the principles under which they will implement their role in the co-ordination of regional aids.   In doing so theyhave established a hierarchy of assisted areas, which conformswith our own.   No forms of national aids are ruled out inprinciple, and there is no interference with our existingregional aids.   There is a particular problem relating to assistance given by the Highlands and Islands development board, for which a derogation is being obtained.   In discussing the way in which regional aids might be changed to meet new/circumstances11 -CONFIDENTIAL
circumstances, the Commission have furthermore aclaiowledgedthat national Governments are the best judges of what isrequired in their own country, and that the Commission willhe prepared to consider changes in national aid systemscompatible with the Common Market, when they are justified by problems of employment, unemployment, migration, and by&quot;other valid requirements of regional development policy which constitutes essential national problems&quot;.     The commission have further accepted that urgent action by Governments maybe necessary and that Treaty procedures will not hold this up.4.     The Cabinet considered this Communication at their meetingon 27 February.   They concluded that subject to the overalljudgement on the outcome of renegotiation, the text met our requirements.Industrial Policy5.     We have not met with any serious difficulties from the eec in the conduct of industrial policy during the past year.We have reported aids given under Articles 7 and 8 of theIndustry Act 1972.   The proposals in the Industry Bill for setting up the national Enterprise Board and for planning agreements are in no way incompatible with the Treaty providing that the powers are not exercised in a way which damages theinterests of other Member States.   Article 222 of the Treatyof Rome specifically permits nationalisation; and government participation in the equity of a firm does not in itself raiseproblems under the Treat3r.   The Commission have accepted thatin urgent cases we will provide aid without first giving them/an opportunity- 12 -
an opportunity to comment.   In such rescue cases they havewhensuggested thatytte prepare a plan to restore the firm concerned to viability we should discuss it with then withinthe following six months.   This is not an onerous require-ment.it-6.     The Commission have not yet commented on the industry bill.   The powers in it relating to the veto of foreign take-overs., would have to he exercised with regard to treaty obligations.    But membership of the Community would not interferewith the broad thrust of our industrial policies.   The proposalsfor the national Enterprise Board and for Planning agreements have much in common with arrangements in other Member States;they are in no way incompatible with the Treaty, provided-.1.that the Government&apos;s powers, are not exercised so as to damage the competitive position of undertakings in other member states - a principle which we accept..- 13 -/STEEL
STEEL1.     Although our renegotiation aims for industrial policy applyto steel also, there are additional considerations arising-fromthe Treaty of Paris, which is more tightly drawn than the Treatyof Rome and gives the Commission greater authority.     This is primarily of significance in relation to the private sector of the steel industry.     The Government1s direct control over private sector steel investment was removed by the repeal by the previous government of Section 15 of the Iron and Steel Act.2.     In the light of the Secretary of State for-Industry&apos;s ECSpaper of July 1974, which drew attention to problems in relationto steel prices, mergers and the control of private investment,and of subsequent correspondence on these problems, I instructed the uk Representative in Brussels to explore the Commissions reaction to the reinstatement of powers equivalent to those in Section 15.The Commissions response was that in their view the reinstatementof these powers would not be compatible with the ECSC Treaty.     Inour discussion in the Cabinet on 27 February we took account ofthis response and of the experience we had accumulated over thepast year of the handling of prices and mergers under the ECSCTreaty.   I was invited to report back to Cabinet on how our requirements for the steel industry should be pursued in theCommunity.3. I told the Council on 3 March that we had encountered practical problems in relation to control over private investment in the/   steel- 14 -
steel industry and that we should be pursuing further in theCommunity the changes necessary to deal with these problems.   Ireferred also to difficulties over prices and mergers.   I saidIthat we intended to take the matter up with a view to securing asatisfactory solution, assuming that the UK remained in theCommunity.     I indicated clearly that we might conclude that theonly answer was to propose some changes in the Treaty.     ThePrime Minister reaffirmed in Dublin the position which I had setout to the Council.,4.     I propose to continue to pursue this matter by consultationwith the Member States in advance of the Referendum, even thoughit will not be possible to bring it to a conclusion until later.I shall explain the powers which we wish to re-assume in relationto the control of private investment.     I propose to explorewith other Member Governments whether in their view there is apossibility of securing our objectives within the ECSC Treaty,taking account of how they handle the problem of steel industryinvestment in their countries.   In the light of these discussionswe shall be in a position to decide whether it would be best toreinstate powers comparable to those previously enjoyed underSection 15 by legislation and subsequently to secure acceptanceof this in the Community, or whether to seek a derogation or a specific Treaty amendment before legislating.   We can also decide what action is necessary on prices and mergers.   These are,however, matters which we cannot resolve until after the referendum./   5.- 15 -I j ...
5.     The practical difficulty which was referred to in our previous discussion about the effect of the BSC closure programme on present basing points used in the Community pricing system is one which will not arise for a considerable time.     But I see no reason to suppose that the BSC&apos; will not be able to adjustits pricing to meet our practical requirements as it has donein the past.     This is a problem which could be considered beforethe BSC closure programme is finally settled and we can judgewhat the effects will be in the regions.     If we encounterdifficulty we could press for necessary changes in the rules. ,6.     To summarise, the loss of direct control over private investment is unsatisfactory;   and there could also be certainproblems over prices and mergers in the private sector.     Weshall explore with other Member Governments what practical stepscan be taken to deal with these difficulties and we have put theCommunity on notice that we shall be seeking a solution.     Itis not yet certain whether this will necessitate Treaty amendment,but we have said clearly that it may.     This is a matter whichwill have to be pursued outside bhe timescale of renegotiation.-16-
FISCAL POLICIESNo problems have arisen in relation to fiscal policies_There.arc proposals for certain measures to harmonise tho sCjfS&apos; somej)/indirect taxes but we shall be in. a position to block anywhich we consider unacceptable,- 1.7 -:
CAPITAL movements the Manifesto commitment reads as follows:&quot;We/ieed an agreement cn capital movements whichprotects our balance of payments and full employment policies.&quot;We have made use of the relevant Articles of the Treatyof Rome to revert to broadly the same exchange control regimeas applied before entry.     We can continue to take action under those Articles to protect our balance of payments.T 18 -
TIDE COnKOITVEALTH AND THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: TRADE AND aid.     The Manifesto said: &quot;The economic interests of the Common-wealth and the developing countries must he safeguarded.   this involves securing continued access to the British market and,more generally, the adoption by an enlarged Community of tradeand aid policies designed to benefit not just ,:associated over-seas territories&quot; in Africa. but developing countries throughoutthe world&quot;.2.     In renegotiation substantial changes have been secured inCommunity policies on a number of fronts.   Continued guaranteedaccess on fair terms has been secured for sugar from the developing countries of the Caribbean and elsewhere and for.dairy products from New Zealand.   Under the Lome Convention theCommunity has agreed to provide access on an indefinite basis for up to 1.4 million tons of sugar from the AGP sugar producing countries (mainly Commonwealth countries).   The price will be no less than e.c. beet sugar prices.   For 1975 the countries concernechave negotiated with the buyers (ie the UK) a price substantially higher than the Community price.   From the standpoint of theCommonwealth countries the new arrangements as a whole are atleast as satisfactory as those previously available under theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement; and for ourselves as consumers andfor our sugar refining industry there is now an assurance of continuing supplies of cane sugar at reasonable prices,:   /The Government. confidential
5^    The Government have made it clear to other Member Statesthat any new Community arrangements for mutton and lamb would &apos;have to take satisfactory account of our interests, and inparticular would have to provide adequate and continuing accessfor imports of New Zealand lamb at fair and remunerative pricesWe have also given notice that we intend to seek a reduction inthe Community&apos;s current tariffs on UK imports of lamb at theearliest appropriate time.4^     Improved access to Community markets has also been secured by means of reductions in Community tariffs.   The negotiationsunder Article XXIV.-6 of the GATT for compensation of theCommunity&apos;s GATT partners for the alignment of the new member states to the Common Customs Tariff and the CAP were finallyconcluded in February 1975-   These negotiations have led to a/range of concessions- 20
range of concessions of particular in&apos;ter&apos;e.j.i to Commonwealtt.producers, including tariff reductions on wood and paper prccuctscanned pineapple and fresh and canned salmon as well as improve?;access for frozen beef and cheddar cheese.   The United Kingdomtook a prominent part within the Community in securing thesuccess of these negotiations without which the multilateral trade negotiations, now effectively in train, could not have started.5,     Some useful reductions in Community tariffs are also in prospect on imports from certain Mediterranean countries.    Oneof the provisions of the Accession Treaty was that we should join, with necessary adjustments, the preferential agreements which the Community had concluded with these countries (including in particular Spain and Israel), which are major suppliers tothe British food market and provide an important and growingmarket for our industrial goods.   The Government have.successful!;insisted in these negotiations that food imports from theMediterranean must be allowed continuing access to our market onsignificantly better terms than are available under theCommunity&apos;s existing tariff regime.    And the Community has nowoffered substantial reductions in Certain of its present tariffs on imports from these countries, for example, fresh oranges,orange Juice, canned fruit salad and tomatoes.6.     Improvements in access to Community markets should alsoresult from the GATT multilateral trade negotiations formallylaunched in Tokyo in September 1973*   la February 1975 theCouncil of Ministers agreed on a negotiating directive whichoi . /represents a
represents a considerable advance on the &quot;global approach&quot;adopted by the Community in June 1973*   In the new directivethe Community has undertaken to seek to negotiate a substantial(25% to 50%) reduction in industrial tariffs with otherparticipants.   On agriculture a detailed and comprehensive mandatehas been agreed providing in particular that, for the bulk of world agricultural trade not covered by commodity agreementsdiscussions should be entered into between&apos; importers andexporters with a view to agreeing on conditions for orderlymarketing.   The mandate also provides for negotiated reductions in tariffs on agricultural products.   And the mandate attachesparticular importance to dealing with the problems of the developing countries. -7,     At the outset of renegotiation we made it clear that theCommunity needed to adopt a better balanced and more broadlybased approach to its relations with the developing; world.   a major step in this direction is represented by the Lome Conventio:signed on 28 February 1975*   Under this 22 developing Common-wealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, togethwith 24 other developing countries have entered into a special relationship with the Community.8.    The main features of the Convention are:&apos; a)     the ACP countries will have free entry for all their products except for a few agricultural items (the mostimportant of the agricultural products is sugar; thedetails of these arrangements were set out in para 2 above);- 22 - /b)   they will
b) they will not have to give any reciprocal tradepreferences to the Community in return;    (this provision -secured at our insistence - meets the wishes of our commonwealth partners and has removed a major potentialirritant in our relations with the United States);c) they will have access to a European Development Fund of around  1,600 million over a five-year period;d) there will be a new scheme for the stabilisation offluctuations in their export earnings from certain(mainly agricultural) primary products;   (e) there will be new opportunities for industrial cooperationwith the e.c.. .   - -m9.\   In parallel with the negotiations leading up to theLome Convention, we have pressed the Community to do more forthe other developing countries, particularly the commonwealth countries of Asia, covered by the Joint Declaration of Intent(JDI) annexed to the Treaty of Accession.   In the trade field the most important instrument for improvement is the Community&apos;sGeneralised Scheme of Preferences (GSP).   Major improvements have been secured in both the structure and coverage of thescheme for 1975* many of which will particularly benefit theCommonwealth Asian countries.   There has been a marked reductionin the list of sensitive products where there are limits topreferential access.   The products on which there have beenspecific improvements include tobacco, plywood, jute and coirproducts and (from the middle of 1975) tropical oils.   A usefulfirst step has also been taken towards ending discrimination- 23 - /in the scheme
in the scheme against Hong Kong.10.   On 3 March 1975 the Council of Ministers agreed to work for continuing improvements to the scheme, with particular emphasis on the interests of the poorest developing countries, including those of the Indian sub-continent.   The Council also agreed thatthe scheme should be extended after 1980 - the first public declaration by any of the developed   countries of an intentionto extend generalised preferences beyond that date.11.   The Community are negotiating Commercial Cooperation Agree-ments with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, following the entry into force of a similar agreement v/ith India on 1 April 197Z;These agreements will provide for Joint Committees to considerthe development of trade between each country and the e.c..12.   In addition to the wide coverage of the Development Fundoperated under the Lome Convention, the Community has agreed tothe principle of financial and technical aid for non-ACPdeveloping countries and we are pressing for early implementation of this commitment.   The Commission have made some useful proposal which are shortly to be considered in the Council.   The countries of the Indian sub-continent have already benefited substantiallyfrom Community food aid and from the Community&apos;s contribution tothe UK Emergency Measures for the developing countries hardesthit by the rises in oil and other commodity prices.Summary .13.   These changes represent major improvements in the Community&apos;iapproach to its relations with the outside world.  More   remains to be done.   But renegotiation has established that our essential- 24 -v /objectivesCONFIDENTIAL
objectives can be secured and we Can be confident in our ability as members of the Community to ensure that the momentumof future change is maintained.- 25 -
VALUE ADDED TAX    (VAT)The Manifesto commitment reads as follows:&quot;Ho harmonisation of Value Added Tax which wouldrequire us to tax necessities. &quot;The proposals now being discussed in the Community areconcerned with agreeing a uniform assessment base for VAT.   they provide for our system of zero-rating.     We Will be able to resist any proposals which are unacceptable to us.- 26 -
ANNEX BCONSEQUENCES AND implications of WITHDRAWAL FROM THE COMMUNITY1.     In circulating this paper I wish to say that I think it represents the worst case that could arise following a decisionto withdraw.   Obviously, if this position arises   we wouldfight our corner   as hard as we could knowing that consider-able advantages would accrue to the Community from our being a large market for their exports and that we would have a bargaining counter.2.     Nevertheless, I cannot disguise my view that the impact of withdrawal would be much greater than if we had originallytaken a decision not to enter and the consequences to thepolitical morale of Western Europe would be extremely grave.3.     The withdrawal; its impact and the consequential processesa. Following a referendum decision against membership, weshould be faced with the need to -i.     negotiate our withdrawal from the Community andthe terms of our future relationship with theCommunity;ii.     frame new policies over a wide range of international and domestic matters;iii.     thereafter enact legislation, both to repeal theEuropean Communities Act and to substitute domesticlegislation to give effect to the new policies,especially on such matters as agricultural support arrangements.All this would take time.   However much contingency planningwas done, there would be a protracted period of uncertainty about our future course at home and in the world.b. A considerable number of complex issues would have to besettled in the withdrawal negotiations.   The scale and difficulty of the operation could not be assessed until we could discuss the problems with the Community.    Some time would elapse before the withdrawal was completed, but wecould hardly take a full part in normal Communitybusiness during that period.    The Community might be reluctant to negotiate   before our formal withdrawal,about permanent post-withdrawal arrangements, for exampleon tariffs.    The Community&apos;s main concern would be withits own continued cohesion.    There would be bound to bebitterness about our withdrawal.   The withdrawal negotia-tion could not avoid taking on the character of aconfrontation between the Community and ourselves, on different sides of the table;c. The crucial subject for the withdrawal negotiations would be the future trading relationship with the-   i   . /Community.
Community.   We would badly want a free trade area, butthe necessary unanimity for this in the Community may notbe forthcoming; as an industrial competitor we are in adifferent class from such countries as Norway.   If theCommunity were to contemplate a free trade arrangement,they would probably insist on major transitionalexceptions and on rules enforceable by the Community toensure proper competition.    The prudent working assumptionshould be that agreement will not be reached on a free trade arrangement.   The pre-1973 tariffs on both sideswould then be restored;d.     The decision to withdraw and the uncertain prospects for the future would give a major shock to the system.It is a matter of judgement as to how long theseeffects would continue, but there is little doubt that because the business community believes that membership is greatly to our economic advantage, and because of the poor prospects for a free trade arrangement, the referendum decision would itself lead to a sharp fallin business and financial confidence.    This effect would continue during the period of confusion and uncertainty about our future relationships and policies.There could he serious short term effects on invest-ment, depending on how long it took us to renegotiatenew arrangements.   Confidence effects would also tendto depress the sterling exchange rate and make itharder to finance the UK deficit   by attracting funds from abroad.4.     General Consequencesa. We should cease to be bound by the Treaties and byCommunity Secondary Legislation.   Directly applicablecommunity law would cease to have effect in thiscountry and with the repeal of Section 2 of theEuropean Communities Act 1972 the &quot;Sovereignty&quot; problemof Parliamentary control of community decisions would disappear.   We should be free of the specialCommunity arrangements, involving the Commission andthe Court, for supervising and enforcing treaty obligations;b. Our practical freedom of action would still be limited by political, military and economic realities as wellas by numerous international obligations under GATT, etcaffecting many areas of domestic, trade and foreignpolicy;/c.     An- 2 -
An important question is to what extent our influence in major economic negotiations (eg overinternational tariffs and monetary questions) wouldbe diminished.   Our absence from the e.c. discussions could lead to a hardening of e.c. positions,    we should clearly not take part in political consultation amongthe Nine.   Our withdrawal would be regretted by theUSA and by the Commonwealth, and there is no meansof knowing whether we could develop our economic andpolitical relations with either in a way which wouldcompensate for the consequences of withdrawal.   TheCommunity (with the Germans and French in the lead)would increasingly be treated by the US and othersas the spokesman for Western Europe;We should be free to offer preferential trade and aid,links to the Commonwealth and could seek to revitalisethe political link.   But there is no prospect of returning to our earlier trading arrangements with the Commonwealth.Commonwealth countries, including those of the Indian   vsub-continent, would regret the loss of their indirectinfluence over Community policy which would result and thebenefits to them which we have been securing.    They would continue to attach major importance to the Community asa source of aid and trade benefits.   The Lome convention has transformed the Community^ relations with a large part of the developing world to the benefit of theCommonwealth;There would be some setback to the political cohesionof Western Europe.   While the Six would probably sticktogether, the position of Denmark and Ireland would be doubtful.    There would be demands for a second referendumin Denmark and the likely result is unclear.    The Irishquestion is more important to us.    The Irish Governmentwould want to stay in; but with Britain out and ireland in the Community, the strains and political complicationswould be considerable./5.     Specific
5.     Specific ConsequencesSubject to the above points, the specific consequences of withdrawl may be assessed, sector by sector, as follows:a.   Payments and Receiptsi. The Community BudgetThe most recent published estimates are for a gross United Kingdom contribution in 1979 of 550 million (net  310 million) at 1974 prices.These figures would be reduced by artotal refund of 125m under the corrective mechanism agreed in Dublin.They are highly speculative and depend on uncertainfactors: future food prices, future Communitypolicies which could bring us net benefits etc.ii. European Investment BankWe should recover our initial contribution to theEIB ( 58 million) and repay outstanding loans tous ( 136 million to date).   If we stay in, we might be receiving  150 million annually in loansby 1977 ( 300 million by 1980); we should alsocontribute and pay back loans but there would bea net inflow.iii. ECSCWe should forego resettlement allowances and researchgrants ( 6.4 million in 1975) and access to cheaploans ( 91.5 million, in addition to about 50 million out of our EIB loans - ii. above).We should no longer pay the direct levies/( 7.5 million
( 7-5 million for 1975).   We should be free from limitations on our control on prices, private investment and mergers in the steel industry.iv.       Regional policy we should lose our share in the Regional development fund (estimated net return  47-60 million forprojects begun in the next three years),v.       Credit facilities in present circumstances we should not lose from being excluded from the present short and medium-term facilities.   The Community facility for joint borrowing from OPEC (maximum $5 billion in capital and interest) could become of interestto the United Kingdom.Capital Movementsi.     some increase in investment in the e.c. by theUnited Kingdom industrial companies;ii.     a net switch of investment by non-e.c. (particularlyAmerican) companies from the United Kingdom;iii.     some reduction of United Kingdom portfolio investment in the e.c.;iv.     continuation, as of right, of the present exchangecontrols.InvisiblesThere could be a significant loss in the field of insurance.   Other effects are unlikely to be substantial./d.     Industrial- 5 -
Industrial Development and investment for industry the importance of the e.c. lies in its long-term aim of developing a single common market free from all internal tariff and other barriers.   If we withdrew, we would have - in addition to possibletariff barriers - little influence on the standardsetc adopted in the Community in the future and couldnot benefit from the opening up of public procurement,which is a long-term aim.   Relative rates of inflation and exchange rate movements are also important, butthere has been widespread expectation in Britishindustry that joining the larger market would bebeneficial.    In the short term the effect of withdrawalon exports, investment and confidence is likely to beadverse and substantial.Tariffs and TradeIf tariffs between the Community and United Kingdom wererestored to pre-1973 levelsthis would inhibit totaltrade.   There is no conclusive evidence whether itwould benefit our balance of payments or the reverse.We assume that we could safeguard the free trade withthe EFTA countries which we now have, but our industrialexports would be at an increasing disadvantage in spain, Israel, Greece and Turkey (a market comparablein total with Australia and New Zealand); we could endtariffs on their food exports to us.   We should probably/lose- 6 -
lose our preferences under the Lome Convention in commonwealth countries.    Other Commonwealth countries might phase out our pre-accession preferences moreslowly than if we stayed in.   Customs barriers betweenIreland and the United Kingdom could be a major problem,f.    and the  Lome Convention would probably have to be re-negotiated and the consequences for the commonwealth countries concerned cannot be foretold.:6*   agriculture the consequences of withdrawal in this sector are particularly difficult to assess.    Both the world food situation and the CAP have&apos; recently undergone changes.A return to cheap world food is unlikely.   While EECprices have fallen in real terms for all majorcommodities except beef, world prices have risen.If we withdrew, we should introduceour own support and import regimes.Overallwe must expect as members to be net contributors underthe CAP, but the size of the contribution seems likelyto be lower than was earlier estimated.    If we stayedin, we might face higher prices than outside, but thisis not certain and we could reasonably expect moresecurity of supply and more stable prices than if webought freely on world markets./h.     Fisheries- 7 -
FisheriesIf the UN Law of the Sea Conference extends nationalfishing rights to 200 miles, it is uncertain whether we shall secure modifications of the common fisheriespolicy which would compare satisfactorily with the exclusive control over home waters which we couldexercise outside the Community.Energy.Within the Community North Sea oil will remain our national asset and we should find ways of ensuring that within the provisions of the IEP we control itsdestination.   We might  lose by withdrawal opportunities for cooperation on for example nuclear developments and research and development projects or in the event of falling oil prices.Freedom of MovementReciprocal arrangements for employment, social security,recognition of professional qualifications etc would beended.
