ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1975INTRODUCTION1. The Annual Review continues to have an important role in agricultural policy. It is an opportunity for the Government and the Farmers&apos; Unions totake stock of the agricultural industry and the prospects for the coming year.2. This year the Annual Review, in addition to providing an opportunityfor a comprehensive stocktaking of the industry&apos;s condition and prospects, has reserved two purposes. First, the Review has made available full information andthe views of the Farmers&apos; Unions, which, together with the views expressed onbehalf of agricultural workers, landowners and the food industry, the Govern-ment took into account in determining their negotiating position on the fixing of the common agricultural prices for 1975/76. Secondly, it has providedinformation and views on national measures not directly determined in theCommunity price fixing. These include, in particular, the guaranteed prices for sheep, wool and potatoes products not subject to a common organisationof the Community market.3. In order that the Annual Review can fulfil these two functions more effectively, it may be desirable to consider bringing forward the 1976 Review,so that it precedes the common price fixing by a reasonable margin.4. Parts I-ffl of this White Paper describe the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdom agricultural industry considered in thisAnnual Review. Part IV sets out the Governments determinations on the guaranteed prices and on other national support for agriculture for 1975/76.PART I-STATE OF THE industry. Since the last Annual Review there have again been large increases infarmers&apos; costs. The aggregate cost increases, estimated to be  692 million, areslightly below last year&apos;s  712 million but are substantially above the figuresrecorded in any other year. Net product was maintained and labour productivitycontinued to increase, although at a lower rate. The net income of the agricultural industry, after increasing rapidly in recent years, has declined in 1974/75 bothin the aggregate and on average per full-time farm, principally as a result of thedifficulties of cattle and other livestock farmers. This represents a sharp fallback in real terms.6. Arable farming generally did well in 1974. The cereal harvest was a record16 million tons. Prices remained high, although they have eased in 1975. Potatoyields were also good and the market price has remained above the guaranteedlevel. The sugar beet crop was reduced severely by bad weather and disease.7. Livestock farmers had a difficult year. The dairy herd fell back slightly,but in October the Government raised milk producers&apos; prices for the six winter months by 7.7p per gallon above what they would otherwise have been. Cattleprices in the autumn were very low, as substantially more cattle than usual weremarketed in anticipation of winter feeding difficulties. In August the Governmentintroduced a fixed premium to support beef producers&apos; returns and in Novemberthis was supplemented by a new method of support through a variable premium
assuring a floor in beef producers&apos; returns. Thereafter, market prices began to recover. Beef rearers and breeders who sold their store stock or calves in theautumn received low prices. In response to this the Government advanced the1975 payments of the hill cow and beef cow subsidy in order to improve the cashposition during this winter. Beef cow farmers are receiving in early 1975  22per eligible animal instead of  11 and hill cow farmers are receiving during this autumn and winter  49 per eligible cow instead of  24.50. Sheep prices fellduring the year: deficiency payments were made from July to November.Prices for store lambs and ewes from the hills at the autumn sales were low andthe hill sheep subsidy was increased from December at a cost of some  9 million.Pig prices also fell in the first half of 1974 and the breeding herd was cut back,particularly in Northern Ireland, but prices improved in the autumn. from march to November a special pig subsidy was paid. This injected  29 millioninto the industry over a difficult period. Egg and poultry producers also haddifficulties with high feed costs and depressed market prices especially in thefirst half of the year.8. The fodder shortage in parts of the United Kingdom has also given cause for some concern that the needs of the cattle and sheep populations might notbe met by the feed available. Nonetheless, the introduction of a floor in beefproducers&apos; returns now offers livestock farmers a prospect of more stable andprofitable production. The Government are confident that, if the United Kingdomremains within the European Community, United Kingdom milk and livestockproducers will be able to benefit increasingly from higher returns as the transi-tional stage is passed and to make good use of their structural advantages andof a climate well suited to grassland production.9. Both in the fixing of the common agricultural prices for 1975/76 and in thedeterminations made following this Annual Review, the Government havetaken full account of the problems of certain sectors of the agricultural industry which have affected the confidence of farmers generally. The decisions also have regard to the need to reduce the cost of our imports of food and to makethe best use of efficient food production from our own resources. While thedifficulties of the last year have led to some setbacks in output, the emphasismust now be on steady progress for the medium term.PART II  COMMODITY TRENDSCereals (Tables 2, 5, 7 and 27)10. The area of cereals harvested in 1974 reached nearly 9.3 million acres,about the same level as in the previous year. Production is expected to be 16million tons, well above the previous record of 15.3 million tons in 1972. Wheatyields rose sharply and wheat production from the larger acreage was 1 million tons higher than in 1973. Barley and oats yields were also up. Prices of bothwheat and coarse grains remained high, reflecting the tight supply situation on world markets.11. The prospect for 1975 is that there will be no marked change in the cerealsacreage. The wet autumn is likely to have reduced the winter wheat acreage.Wheat and barley yields, if average weather is assumed, may be lower than in1974. Production is expected to be slightly lower than in 1974.
Potatoes (Tables 2, 5, 9 and 27)12. In 1974 the target acreage of 575,000 acres was underplanted by 43,000acres but, despite harvesting difficulties, the average yield was about i ton per acre higher than in the previous year. A further small rise in consumption islikely but supplies are expected to be sufficient to meet home requirements.The average market price for the season is expected to be above the guaranteed price of  22 per ton. For the 1975 crop the target acreage has been set at 565,000acres.Sugar beet (Tables 2, 5, 10 and 27)13. In 1974 the British Sugar Corporation contracted to purchase the beetfrom 484,000 acres. Because of poor weather and disease, only about 450,000acres were harvested and average yields were the lowest for many years. Con-sequently production was 40% below that of 1973. However, as a result of theadoption by the United Kingdom of the full e.c. prices from 1 January 1975and of other changes, growers should on average receive about 50 % more perton for their beet in 1974 than in 1973.14. For 1975 the British Sugar Corporation hopes to contract for the produce of 500,000 acres. Given a normal yield, this should be sufficient to produce theUnited kingdom&apos;s  basic sugar quota, which has been increased from 900,000to 1,040,000 metric tons (refined basis).Oilseed rape (Tables 2, 5, 8 and 27)15. Production of oilseed rape increased in 1974 for the fourth consecutiveyear to a new record level. Producers have received better prices for this year&apos;scrop as a result of the continued increase in world oilseed prices during 1974.A further increase in acreage is expected in 1975.Hops (Tables 2, 5, 12 and 27)16. The hop acreage continued to decline in 1974. Yields have also droppedbut are expected to increase again in 1975/76. The continuing trend to new andmore productive varieties and the improved utilisation of hops in brewing have led to a reduction in demand by the United Kingdom brewing industry.Horticulture (Tables 2, 5, 11 and 27)17. The total cropped acreage devoted to horticulture in the United Kingdomrose in 1973/74 and again in 1974/75. The total cropped area is now estimatedat 762,000 acres.(a) Apples. The area of apple orchards (excluding cider apples) continuesto fall slightly and in 1973/74 was 91,000 acres. Poor growing conditionsin 1974 caused the output of both dessert and culinary apples to fallsharply. Yields are expected to be below average at 3.7 tons per acrefor dessert apples and 4.4 tons per acre for culinary apples; this compares with 5.0 tons and 5.1 tons respectively in 1973/74. Dessertand culinary apple prices for 1974/75 are higher due to the shortfall in the home crop.
(b) Pears. The slight fall in the acreage of pears (excluding perry pears)has continued and the acreage in 1973/74 was 13,400. Both yields and output were a little better in the 1974/75 crop year but output remainedbelow average. There has been little change in pear prices.(c) Cauliflowers. The acreage under cauliflowers had been increasingslightly until 1973/74 when it reached 41,000. In 1974/75 it is estimated to have fallen back a little to 39,000. Yields are expected to showlittle change but output may increase, as less wastage is anticipated.Prices for 1974/75 are expected to be substantially higher than in1973/74.(d) Tomatoes. The tomato acreage was about 2,500 in 1973/74 and shouldbe just over 2,400 in 1974/75. Yields are estimated to be better than inthe previous season and little change in output is likely. Growers&apos;prices for 1974/75 are expected to be higher than in 1973/74.Herbage seeds (Tables 13 and 27)18. The cropped acreage of certified herbage seed in 1974/75 showed a small increase over that for 1973/74. However, production of herbage seed is expectedto be below average for most species owing to unfavourable weather; home production as a percentage of total supply remains at just over 50%. Pricesrose sharply two years ago, mainly because of a world shortage of herbage seed.The trend has been maintained for the 1974 harvest for most species exceptperennial ryegrass; overproduction of this species has been reflected in a smallerprice rise.Beef and milk (Tables 2, 5, 14, 16 and 27)19. The total cattle breeding herd continued to expand during 1974 and inJune was 3 % higher than a year earlier. Within the total, the beef breedingherd had increased by 13% and the dairy herd had decreased by 1%. Thetotal breeding herd at June 1975 is expected to remain at about the June 1974level, with perhaps a further small increase in the beef herd and a decrease inthe dairy herd.20. Home-fed cattle marketings increased substantially, particularly in thelatter half of 1974. The Beef Premium Scheme was introduced in August as anencouragement to orderly marketing but, largely because of the cold and wetlate summer which affected autumn grazing and the production of winterfodder, very large numbers of cattle were marketed from September onwards.During October clean cattle slaughterings were about 40% higher than a yearearlier. Market prices fell rapidly. On 18 November guaranteed returns wererestored with the introduction of variable premia. Thereafter market pricesrecovered despite a continuing high level of slaughterings, although difficultiespersisted in Northern Ireland. In early December a scheme was introduced to enable pensioners to purchase additional amounts of beef or veal.21. Because of the increase in home production, total beef supplies in 1974/75should be about 10 % higher than in 1973/74, despite a drop in imports resultingfrom e.c. restrictions on supplies from outside the Community. During 1975/76there should be a slight increase in home production of beef but total suppliesmay be somewhat lower.
22. The dairy herd showed a small decline in the year to June 1974. Thecontinued high cost of feedingstuffs has kept the average yield per cow at about the same level in 1974/75 as in 1973/74. Consequently total sales of milkthrough the Milk Marketing Schemes are expected to fall slightly. A small increase in the amount of milk sold for liquid consumption is expected and production of cheese should reach record levels this year. As a result of the fallin milk production and increased utilisation for other purposes, butter produc-tion has been much lower than in 1973/74.23. The increases in the guaranteed price for milk and the standard quantityat the 1974 Annual Review and the further special increase in producers&apos;prices from October 1974 have given a greatly increased average producer price for milk in 1974/75. The prospects for 1975/76 are subject to the generaluncertainties over rising costs but some recovery in yields and in total salesseems likely.Sheep and wool (Tables 2, 14, 18 and 27)24. The United Kingdom breeding flock has continued to expand and inJune 1974 was 2% greater than in June 1973. Assuming that ewe slaughteringsremain at similar levels to last year, some further expansion in the breedingflock may be expected by June 1975. Production of mutton and lamb in 1975/76will be affected by the spring lambing rate following the wet autumn but a small increase is likely. Imports of mutton and lamb in 1974/75 are expected to beabout 10% less than in 1973/74 so that, in spite of the increase in home-fedproduction, a reduction of some 5 % in total supplies is expected. Fat sheepprices, which had been at high levels at the beginning of the year, fell steadilyuntil October 1974. Deficiency payments became payable for the period fromthe end of July to the end&apos; of November. Prices then recovered and fat sheepprices by January 1975 were comparable to those of the previous January.Prices paid for hill lambs and draft ewes fell heavily in the autumn. The hillsheep subsidy was substantially raised with effect from 1 December 1974.25. Production of wool in 1974 remained static and auction prices fell,as a result of the fall in world prices, to below the guaranteed price of 26p a lb.Pigs (Tables 2, 14 and 27)26. Towards the end of 1973 and during 1974 there was a decline in theUnited Kingdom pig breeding herd and at June 1974 it was 12% below the high level reached in the middle of 1973, with a bigger fall in Northern Ireland.In recognition of the difficulties facing producers, the Government introduced a special subsidy of 50p per score which applied to all certified marketingsfrom March until October and then at a reducing rate until November 1974.Market prices began to recover in September 1974. The reduction that has takenplace in the herd will be reflected in lower output of pigmeat in 1975/76.poultry meat (Tables 2, 14 and 27)27. Total production of poultry meat in 1973/74 remained virtually unchangedfrom the record level of 1972/73 with an increased share of the market beingtaken by turkeys. Production is expected to fall in 1974/75. Prices fell duringthe first half of 1974 but recovered in the later months of the year.
Eggs (Tables 2, 5, 17 and 27)28. The size of the average laying flock over 1974/75 is expected to be about1 % lower than in 1973/74 but an increase in yield per bird is forecast to increase production by about 1 %. A further increase in yields is forecast for 1975/76,but this is not expected to offset the likely reduction in the size of the layingflock, so that a lower level of production is forecast. The average producerprice in 1974/75 is expected to be significantly below the high prices reached inthe previous year.PART m-GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFarnfstructure (Table 3)29. The number of farms in the United Kingdom continues to decline. Thetotal number of significant units and the number of full-time farms at 278,000and 176,000 in 1974 are respectively some 12% and 7 % lower than in 1969. Thefall in numbers has been most marked among the part-time and smaller full-timefarms. Businesses capable of providing full-time work for at least one manaccount for over 94 % of total output, though in Northern Ireland and wales the output of small part-time farms is rather more significant than in otherparts of the United Kingdom. About one third of holdings have businessescapable of providing work for at least two men (ie those of 600 standard man-days or more) but they account for 80% of total output. Large businesses(1,200 standard man-days or more), though only about 15 % of the total number,produce rather more than a half of total output.30. The average size of farms is increasing. Full-time businesses averaged 239acres (total area including rough grazings) in 1974 compared with 223 acres in1969. Individual enterprises are also expanding as the number of units declinesand the trend to greater specialisation continues. Between 1969 and 1974 theaverage cereal acreage has increased from 61 to 74 acres; the average dairy herd has risen from 28 to 39 cows and the average beef breeding herd from12 to 18 cows; the average ewe flock has increased from 128 to 162 breedingsheep; and the average pig breeding herd from 13 to 21 sows.31. In Great Britain 60% of the holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1974/75 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion of thetotal acreage held by owner-occupiers has increased from 52% in 1960/61 to55% in 1974/75. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers are owner-occupiers.Index of net product (Table 19)32. For 1973/74 the index is now put at 117 (average of 1968/69-1971/72^100), instead of 114 as previously forecast, and it is estimated to be the same in1974/75. Greater cereals output in 1974/75 is expected to be offset by a fallin sugar beet output^ and increased cattle sales by falls in pig and poultry salesand a lower end-stock valuation for livestock.Labour productivity (Tables 4 and 19)33. The latest estimates indicate an average annual rate of increase in labour productivity (the volume of gross product per head) of about 6% for the
period of 1964/65 to 1974/75 though the rate in the last few years has been rather lower at about 4%. The outflow of regular whole-time workers isestimated to be currently running at about 2 to 3 % annually. This compares with an average rate of outflow of about 5 % in the late 1960s.Net income of the industry (Tables 19, 21 and 24)34. Aggregate net income of the industry rose in 1973/74 to  1,283 million, 422 million (49%) higher than in 1972/73. A fall of  150 million (12%) to 1,133 million is forecast for 1974/75. Adjusted for normal weather, income isexpected to fall by 3% from  1,194 million in 1973/74 to  1,159 million in 1974/75.35. In real terms aggregate net income shows an upward trend over the 10 years to 1973/74 and, allowing for the continuing fall (about 2 % a year) in the numberof farms, real net income per full-time farm almost doubled over the sameperiod. The increase in both instances was particularly marked in 1972/73 and1973/74. In 1974/75, however, aggregate net income in real terms is forecast to fall by 26% compared with 1973/74. Real net income per full-time faim isexpected to fall by 25%, to the level of 1972/73, though remaining a thirdabove the average for 1968/69 to 1971/72. In each of the three years 1972/73to 1974/75 there were, however, substantial elements of increased tenanfsvaluations predominantly attributable to higher input costs; in 1974/75 this increase amounted to  442 million. Excluding this element in net farm income,farmers&apos; net returns are estimated to have fallen by 17% in money terms in1974/75. The decline in real terms is 30%.36. In both 1973/74 and 1974/75 there have been widely divergent trends in net income between the different sectors of the industry. The samples of farmaccounts for 1973/74 show that average incomes on cropping farms rosesubstantially. On cereal farms they more than doubled. In the hill areas, incomeson sheep farms, which had approximately doubled in 1972/73, increased furtherby about a quarter in England and Wales and 17 % in Scotland. Pig and poultryfarms also showed improved incomes. On the other hand, higher costs, particu-larly for feedingstuffs, and low cattle prices in the later part of the year, reducedincomes on dairy farms, despite higher milk output, and also caused a fall in incomes on cattle and sheep farms.37. Although average incomes for all types of farm taken together rose in money terms in England and Wales in .1973/74 by 18%, the increase in real terms was 7%, while in Scotland and Northern Ireland real income fell by12 and 30% respectively.38. The differences in income trends continued in 1974/75, when net incomeon all types of farm taken together is expected to fall. On cropping farmsnet income seems likely to increase again though by much less than in 1973/74.Cereal farms are expected to fare better than general cropping farms withsugar beet. In the livestock sector, however, a general fall in net income isexpected and, for some types of farming, the reduction could be substantial.Higher milk prices in the second half of the year are expected to have preventeda major decline (except in Northern Ireland) in incomes of specialist dairyfarms in the face of higher costs. Incomes of pig and poultry farmers are expectedto fall. Low prices for cattle and sheep in the autumn, together with higher costs
and shortages of fodder, are expected to have caused substantial reductions in incomes in hill and upland areas, particularly on sheep farms, despite higherpayments of hill sheep and hill cow subsidies.Cost changes (Table 26)39. Cost increases since the last Review (including the cost increases of some 153 million referred to in paragraph 31 of the 1974 Annual Review white paper) are provisionally assessed at  692 million for all products, the chiefitems being  184 million on the costs of labour,  150 million on machinerycosts (of which  50 million relates to fuel cost increases),  116 million in feedcosts and  103 million in the costs of fertilisers and lime. These figures for costchanges do not allow for changes in the volume of resources, including labour,used by the industry.Gross capital formation (Table 23)40. A further increase in the value of investment is estimated to have occurred in 1974. Total gross capital formation in landlord and tenant-type physicalassets together is estimated to have reached  1^005 million in the calendar year 1974, an increase of some 20% over 1973. Of this investment,  266 million was in buildings and works (an increase of 27 %) and was the responsibility oflandowners;  309 million was in plant, machinery and vehicles (an increase of34%); and  430 million was for additions to stocks and work in progress. Thevolume of investment in 1974 in buildings and works is expected to be about% higher than in 1973 and that in plant, machinery and vehicles 12% higher.The volume of new investment in stocks and work in progress, however, isexpected to be below that in 1973., V;-:&quot;.&apos;v.&quot;&apos;.:.:       &apos;     :    I&apos;:&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;,:&apos;y &apos; &quot;     &apos;;.&apos;: ; &quot;:;     &apos;:.&apos;-;Agricultural Land Prices41. After a period of relative stability between 1969 and 1971, the price ofagricultural land in the United Kingdom rose dramatically in 1972 and the first part of 1973 and in many aieas doubled or trebled. However, since then therehas been some evidence that prices have begun to fall and there has been areduction in the number of completed sales.Rents (Table 22)42. Under Stage 2 of the Counter Inflation Programme (November 1972 to november 1973) agricultural rents were frozen (except for improvements bylandlords) and rents rose in Great Britain by approximately 41 % appreciablyless than the 6 to 7 % of recent years. Under Stage 3 landlords have been allowedto charge half the increase agreed between tenants and themselves or determinedby arbitration. As a result of this relaxation, rents rose in 1974 by 11^% on average in Great Britain. The Government have announced that the currentrestrictions on agricultural rents in Great Britain will cease to apply with effect from 28 May 1975Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 20)43. The average earnings of full-time men in the United Kingdom were  31.95per week for the year ended 30 September 1974. In money terms this is some21 % higher than in 1972/73 but in real terms the increase is about 6%. These
higher earnings reflect partly the increase, which was effective from 22 January1974, of  2.30 per week in the minimum wage and partly the effect of seventhreshold payments between 27 May and 19 August 1974.Public expenditure (Table 25)44. In 1974/75, the estimated outturn for expenditure on United Kingdomprice guarantees, grants and subsidies (excluding payments connected with the milk guarantee) is about  296 million. The comparable figure for 1973/74 isabout  203 million. The increase of about  93 million reflects mainly the largeinjection of support for beef and pig producers and the additional help forproducers in the hills.45. Expenditure under the common market organisation of the e.c. isestimated to rise to about  193 million in 1974/75 compared with  86 million in 1973/74. This expenditure by the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produceis made up of several elements. These include aids for private storage and animalfeed, the Beef Premium Schemes, certain production subsidies, import and exportrefunds on third country trade, import refunds (net of export levies) on intra-Community trade and the net cost of commodities bought into intervention andsubsequently sold. The figure for 1974/75 includes the special import subsidy on sugar which is estimated to cost about  40 million. This and some of the other expenditure benefits consumers rather than producers. Of the estimated experidi-ture of about  193 million for 1974/75, about  147 million is expected to be financed from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, thebalance being financed from the Exchequer.PART IV THE DETERMINATIONS FOR 1975/7646.

(a) It was announced on 17 July 1974 that the 1974/75 guaranteed prices for wheat, barley and oats were raised to  41-27,  37*26 and  35-67 respectively in the light of increases in CAP prices agreed in March. Theseguaranteed prices have been further raised in the light of the decisions of the e.c. Council of Ministers inSept/Oct. 1974.(A) The revised determination is effective from 28 October 1974.(c) The pig guarantee is to be terminated after 27 July 1975 in accordance with the Act of Accession(d) This is the estimated average effective level of the guarantee, taking account of the increase in the guaranteed price to 29*79p per gallon at the beginning of October, 1974 following the 5 % increase in CAP prices then agreed,and the introduction of a special additional payment of 4-18p per gallon at the same time.(e) Average. The determination is intended to assure the Boards an average price of 34*0 pence per gallon forsales during the period 1 April-15 September 1975 and 35-5 pence per gallon on the remainder of their shareof the standard quantity (see para 48 below) or on the residue of sales whichever is the less.Production Grants	Rate following the Annual Review 1974	Rate as determined at the Annual Review 1975Hill sheep subsidy (a)		(per eligible ewe)		Basic rate............	 1-20(6)	 2-85Supplementary rate       ......	 1-75(6)	 3-60(o) All figures include the winter keep supplement of 25p.(6) Rates were increased with effect from 1 December 1974 to  2-25 at the basic rate and  3-00 at the supplementaryrate.Fat pigs47. The pig guarantee will be terminated after 27 July 1975 (see paragraph 46,note (c)).Milk48. The standard quantity for the United Kingdom in 1975/76 has been fixed at 2,950 million gallons (see paragraph 46, note (e)).Production grants49. A temporary increase of  10 per head on the calf subsidy was announced in March 1974. This took effect in July 1974. The subsidy is now being restored to its previous level.50. The decision to terminate the lime subsidy on 31 July 1974, which was announced at the 1974 Annual Review, was reversed during the year and thesubsidy is being continued in 1975/76 at the same rate.Grassland51. It is intended that there should be further study, in consultation with theinterests concerned, of means of encouraging the better use and conservationof grass.
Statistical Tablesthe tables follow the pattern of those in last year&apos;s white paper but a new table 1 has been added to show the position of agriculture in relation to the united kingdom economy as awhole and the table on market prices has been replaced by a new table on commodity pricetrends.an additional column showing a calculated metric equivalent has been included in sometables. this is intended simply to give an indication of what the tables will contain aftermetrication. statistics have not been collected in metric units. the metric units used are asfollows:some of the figures in this appendix differ from those in previous annual review white papers because of later information, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statistical methods. forecasts for 1974/75 are as at mid-december 1974.all figures relate to the united kingdom unless otherwise stated.figures for imports from and exports to the eight relate throughout to the countries of the enlarged e.c. (belgium, denmark, france, west germany, the irish republic, italy,luxembourg and the netherlands).significant items of channel islands trade are shown separately in the tables.figures for exports include re-exports.figures for total new supplies take no account of changes in opening and closing stocks which can considerably affect net off take for consumption.in some cases figures may not add to the totals shown because of roundings.volumeareaweighthectaretonnekilogram (kg)litre.symbols:  means &quot;nil&quot;  ;... means &quot;negligible&quot; (less than half the last digit shown)..   means &quot;not available&quot;

(a) The coverage for 1973 and 1974 includes all known holdings in the United Kingdom with 40 standard mandays or more (a standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours productive work by an adult male worker underaverage conditions). All holdings with less than 40 smd in Scotland are excluded; in England and Wales andNorthern Ireland, holdings with less than 40 smd are excluded only if they have less than 10 acres of crops and grass and no regular whole-time worker. The same criteria applied in Great Britain in the years1970 to 1972 except that the threshold for standard labour requirements in those years was 26 smd; prior to1970, the figures related to all known agricultural holdings exceeding one acre in extent. The figures for NorthernIreland, before 1973, related to holdings of one acre or more, except for numbers of livestock which were collected from all owners irrespective of the size of the holding as well as from landless stockholders. Theintroduction of the changes of definition in Northern Ireland in 1973, following similar changes in GreatBritain, (which excluded some 14,000 statistically insignificant holdings in 1970 and about 8,000 in 1973)resulted in the elimination of about 6,000 or so holdings from the Northern Ireland census.(b) For threshing.(c) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales.(d) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(e) Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by theglasshouse area.(/) Includes acreages of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.(s) Includes lucerne.(h) Includes common rough grazings.(j) Returns of &quot;other land&quot; were collected for the first time in England and Wales in June 1969. From June 1969to June 1973 &quot;other land&quot; in Great Britain was collected as woodland and areas under roads, yards, buildings,etc., the use of which was ancillary to the farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it included land withinagricultural holdings which was under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not used for agriculture. In June 1974 the definition was changed in England and Wales to include all other land forming part of the holding and in Scotland it was extended to include ponds and derelict land. The Northern Irelanddefinition is unchanged.(k) Figures for years earlier than 1964 are for fowls six months old and over in Great Britain and five months oldand over in Northern Ireland.

(a) To preserve comparability between the two years, the figures for 1969 have been adjusted to take account ofthe exclusion from the census in 1970 of about 16,000 holdings in Scotland classified as statistically insignificant.Adjustments have also been made to take account of the raising of the threshold of insignificance from 26 smdto 40 smd in 1973 which resulted in the exclusion from the census of about 14,000 holdings. These changes would have only a marginal effect on the data given in the enterprise analyses. There are still some discon-tinuities in the figures resulting from other smaller changes made between 1969 and 1974 (e.g., statisticalamalgamations and the inclusion of statistically significant holdings on one acre or less of agricultural land)but they have not significantly affected the trend in the average size of enterprise. The figures included for northern Ireland in the first two sections for both years relate only to holdings with 50 smd or more.(b) These figures include holdings with no crops and grass acreage which are excluded from the first section of this table.(c) 250 smd in Scotland; 200 smd in Northern Ireland.(d) The figures relate to the total area including &apos;other land&apos;, the definition of which has changed slightly between1969 and 1974-see footnote (j) of Table 2.(e) Includes an estimate of upwards of 14,000 full-time farms which have under 275 smd (or equivalent) based ontheir cropping and stocking and assuming average labour usage. Adjustments have been made for holdingswhich, though run as separate farming units, are in the same occupancy.(/) Includes maize for threshing in 1974 not included in 1969.(.S) Figures relate to England and Wales only.(h) Figures included for Scotland and Northern Ireland relate to the December censuses in 1968 and 1973,(i) Figures included for Scotland relate to the December censuses in 1968 and 1973.

They include some estimates for figures not directlyobtainable from the Scottish census results and for that reason they differ slightly from some of the publishedUnited Kingdom census results. Because of changes in the census categories in England and Wales in 1970and 1972, numbers returned for earlier years are not available on the same basis as those for the most recentyears.

The occupiers&apos; investmentincludes all tenant-type physical assets in livestock, crops, machinery, etc., but excludes any financial assets and all landlord-type assets such as land and buildings. The estimates of aggregate net income include a profitin recent years of about  5 million on the production of food for consumption in the farm household. Inother industries the corresponding sums are not treated as profit and are relatively much smaller (in manycases non-existent). These figures are not directly comparable with incomes in other sectors of the economysince farm income also includes elements of wages and changes in stock valuations as well as profits. (Seeparagraph 35 of Part III.)(b) This is net income at current prices, adjusted for those changes in works-in-progress and stocks which areascribable to changes in costs.(cj Net Product (Net Output) measures year-to-year changes in the value-added at constant prices by farmers,landowners and farmworkers to all the goods and services purchased from outside the agricultural sector.(d) Labour productivity is here defined as gross product per person engaged in agriculture. Gross product isgross output less all inputs other than depreciation, labour, net rent and interest. It is here measured at constant prices. In order to be consistent with national economic conventions, gross product as used in the calculation of labour productivity covers agricultural contractors as well as all commercially significant holdings. Thetotal number of persons engaged in agriculture comprises the number of employees, employers and self-employed recorded in the annual June census taken by the Agricultural Departments. Before 1971, however,the trends in numbers of employers and employees were estimated respectively from the Population Censusesand the Department of Employment count of national insurance cards.(e) As presented in the 1974 Annual Review White Paper.Table 20Average earnings and hours of agricultural workers (a)Years ended September 11	1970	1971	1972	1973	1974Earnings   per week (b) Hours per week (c)    ......	18-14 47-9	20-25 47-3	22-60 47-2	26-42 47-6	31-95 46-2(a) For all hired regular whole-time men.(6) Earnings include pay for statutory holidays and payments-in-kind which are valued at rates set down by theAgricultural Wages Boards and comprise houses, milk, potatoes, etc. (the principal one being houses, most ofwhich were, in England and Wales, valued at 30p before 17 January 1972, and 50p thereafter).(c)  All hours worked and statutory holidays.Net income, net product and labour productivity

In practice, however,there are many variations in the division between the two responsibilities. Investment in plant and machinery is normally tenant-type. Investment in buildings and works is normally landlord-type.The figures in the table represent gross expenditure before crediting any grants which reduce the cost to theowner or occupier. Annual charges in the form of depreciation are made for these items in calculating aggregatefarming net income.(6) Closing value minus opening value (Table 21) adjusted to approximate calendar year basis.if) Flowers, bulbs and nursery stock, seeds and other minor products.(g) Breeding animals exported, poultry for stock and export, rabbits and game, knacker animals and other minorlivestock.(h) Honey, goat milk, export of eggs for hatching and other minor livestock products.(0   Own account capital formation, timber, osiers, peat and turf.(y ) Deficiency payments on cereal retentions, Potato Marketing Board compensation payments, animal diseasecompensation, co-operative society dividends and interest and other miscellaneous receipts.(k) Growing crops and livestock numbers: closing level minus opening level, each valued at estimated cost.(/)   Sales included in Output but subsequently repurchased and so reappearing as Input.(m) Cereals, potatoes, beans, hay and dried grass.(w) Including landlord-type.(o)  Electricity, veterinary expenses, pesticides, rates and miscellaneous costs.(p) Expenditure is netted of all VAT, which is reclaimed in the normal way, but includes that tax paid withoutrecovery by, for example, unregistered producers. This unrecovered tax is estimated at  1 million for 1972/73, 10 million for 1973/74 and  12 million for 1974/75.(q)  Feed (including retentions) and fertilisers. Opening stock minus closing stock.(r) Gross rent is the sum of net rent and the landowner share of maintenance and depreciation. The figures forgross rent were  161 million in 1970/71,  168 million in 1971/72,  180 million in 1972/73,  191 million in1973/74 and  213 million in 1974/75.(s)   On commercial debt for current farming purposes.

They are weighted averages based on census distribution of agricultural holdings by type of farming and size of business. More detailed figures for England and Wales will be published in &quot;Farm Incomes in England andWales 1973/74&quot;, for Scotland in &quot;Scottish Agricultural Economics 1975&quot;, for Northern Ireland in &quot;The Northern IrelandFarm Management Survey 1973/74&quot;, and for Wales in the &quot;Supplement to the Annual Digest of Welsh Statistics 1973/74&quot;.Net income is defined as for the aggregate net income calculation (Tables 19 and 21), except that here net income is calculated before deduction of interest on any commercial debt. AH farms are treated as rented and an imputed rentalvalue is charged as an expense in the accounts of owner-occupiers. The accounts relate in the main to calendar years or tothe year ending 5 April. The average year-ending date is about mid-February.(b) Includes &quot;mixed&quot; farm type.(c) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings. As rents cannot be imputed withreference to tenanted farms, the rental charges entered for owned land and buildings have been assessed in relation toestimated sale value. Where land was taken in conacre, the actual rents paid have been included. For these reasons theaverage net incomes per farm are not on the same basis as those for Great Britain.(d) Includes &quot;cattle, sheep and pigs&quot;, &quot;pigs and poultry&quot; and &quot;cropping&quot; farm types.

The figures for 1975/76 areprovisional. They are subject to Parliamentary approval of the Estimates and do not take account of the review determinations.(b) Payments in respect of cereals, wool and potatoes relate partly to the crops or clip of the year indicated andpartly to the crops and clips in the preceding year or years. The figures shown in brackets reflect repayments of surpluses under the British Wool Marketing Schemes.f c) Payments on milk reflect the Government policy of holding down the retail price of milk. For public expenditurepurposes, they have been attributed to expenditure under the price guarantees in 1972/73 and 1973/74 and shown in the body of the table above, but for 1974/75 and 1975/76 the estimated expenditure ( 331 million and  270 million respectively) has been attributed to the new food subsidies programme.(rf) Farmers in special areas are also eligible for additional assistance under the Farm Capital Grant Scheme.The estimated additional benefit is shown separately in section III of the table.(r) Includes grants in respect of investment on self-propelled machines (agricultural and horticultural), co-operation and credit, small horticultural production businesses, small farmers and farm business records.(/) Includes grants for improvement of hill land and livestock rearing land, rural roads, producers in the ScottishIslands, crofting improvements, and hill cattle agistment subsidy.(g) The figures shown are total expenditure before allowing for receipts from FEOGA which are shown separatelyat the foot of the table. The figures are made up of several elements and include aids for private storage andanimal feed, the beef premium schemes, certain production subsidies, import and export refunds on thirdcountry trade, import refunds (net of export levies) on intra-Community trade and the net cost of commoditiesbought into intervention and subsequently sold. The figures for 1974/75 include the special import subsidy on sugar. This and some of the other expenditure benefits consumers rather than producers. Consumer subsidies on social beef and general butter are not included.( /i) Includes eggs, poultry meat, fruit and vegetables, oilseeds, hops, seeds and fisheries. Also includes expenditureon products covered by the CAP but not produced to any significant extent in the U.K. (rice, wine, tobacco,cottonseed, flax, hemp and silkworms).Public expenditure under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and on national grants and subsidies (a)
