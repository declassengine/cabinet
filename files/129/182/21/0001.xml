HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 government(75) 46 COPY NO   828 April 1975CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1976-77Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. At our meeting on 25 March, the Cabinet accepted my proposals fora reduction of about  1, 000 million (at 1974 Survey prices) in plannedpublic expenditure in 1976-77, and I was invited to report the result of the bilateral discussions which the Chief Secretary and I have had with individual spending Ministers about the distribution of the overall reduction.2.        I attach a note (Annex A) which summarises the outcome of thevarious bilateral discussions.    In these discussions, my colleagues havegenerally recognised the need for savings of the order which I proposed inC(75) 39.    In particular, the overall percentage reductions on current and capital expenditure (items 3 and 4 in C(75) 39) appear to be broadly acceptable;  and also items 5, 6(1),, 6(iii) and 7 (subject to the Minister^desire to spread half of the proposed aid saving forward into 1975-76).With regard to item 2, I am not at this stage proposing to allocate specificreductions to particular nationalised industries, but only to make a general statement as suggested in Annex A.3. The main points which remain outstanding after the bilateraldiscussion are:-a. Defence Budget.    The Secretary of State was not preparedto accept the full reduction of  200 million, but would accept a cut of  100 million, together with an undertaking to attempt to achieveearlier the savings resulting from the recent Defence Review(see Annex A).b. Environment.    The Secretary of State for the Environmentis prepared to accept the other reductions totalling  241 million onhis services; but not item 6 (ii) (local transport subsidies and newbus grants) on which I proposed a reduction of  33 million, orItem 8 (postponement of community ownership of development land)which was not costed in the White Paper and does not thereforecount towards the  1 billion saving.1
c. Scotland and wales    A small sum is outstanding in respectof Scotland and Wales (see Annex A, paragraphs 14 and 15).4.        An additional saving of  15 million in 1976-77 could be found if wewere to abandon the mid-term census, but consultation with the ministers primarily concerned has shown support for it,5. In some cases, there may also be some &quot;lead-in&quot; savings in1975-76, but these have not yet been quantified.    I am bound also to beasked what the implications will be for later years.    In dealing with such questions, I will need to indicate that Cmnd 5879 is now out of date, andthat the reasons which have led to the proposed reductions in plannedexpenditure in 1976-77 will also call for continuing restraint in the later years, so that the scope for overall growth in public expenditure will at best be very restricted,,    But I would also indicate that this is something which we will be reviewing in the 1975 Survey, and that within whatevertotal we can afford, we will aim to ensure that the needs of the mose essential services will be met as far as possible,6. During the course of the bilateral discussions, a number of mycolleagues have made points about presentation, and I will take due accountof these in my statement.    I will also need to publish a table summarising the savings in 1976-77.    The latest version of this is at Annex B (thisassumes that the savings mentioned in paragraph 3 will still be found in full).I also propose, if the relevant proposals have been approved by the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy, to indicate in my statement theintention to set up a new consultative council, which will clearly be of greatimportance if we are to obtain the necessary savings in 1976^77 in localauthority expenditure.conclusion. If the saving were reduced as indicated in paragraph 3 above, ie ma. Defence 100b. Environment 33c. Scotland and Wales, say 7we should only have saved about  870 million at 1974 Survey prices.    it remains my view that our economic situation requires a saving of the order which I proposed in C(75) 39, and which was endorsed by the Cabinet on25 March.    If my colleagues do not feel able to press for the fullreductions originally proposed I invite them to consider how the gap shouldbe closed.D treasury Chambers8 April 19752secret

ANNEX A

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1976-77: BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS

The following paragraphs summarise the outcome of the bilateral discussions held with the spending Ministers mainly concerned since the Cabinet decision on 25 March (CC(75) 16th Conclusions, Minute 6).

Defence

2. As compared with my proposal for a £200 million reduction in the White Paper figure of £3,800 million for the defence budget in 1976-77, the Defence Secretary has represented to me that this would create a critical situation in our relations with our allies and that a cut of £100 million is the maximum which he could accept. It has seemed to me that, if this is the maximum further saving which we can achieve without another defence review, then there is no alternative to such a review. The Defence Secretary, however, has put forward the alternative that, for the years after 1976-779 he should undertake to attempt to achieve earlier the savings which were produced over a period of ten years in the recent defence review; and that, as further detailed studies will be required to identify what could be done and what the extra savings would be, the required decisions would be taken within the timescale of the 1975 Public Expenditure Survey.

Overseas aid

3. I proposed in C (75) 39 a reduction of £20 million in overseas aid in 1976-77. The Minister of Overseas Development has agreed to a cut of this size provided that £10 million is taken in 1975-76 and £10 million in 1976-77. This should be achievable without endangering the existing commitments on aid.

Prices and consumer protectionlu     The Secretary of&quot; State for Prices and Consumer Protectionis willing to accept the proposed cut of  150 million in food subsidias part of the total savings package for 1976-77.     She has,however, asked that in presenting this cut - which, with others will affect the poorest members of the community - emphasis should beplaced on the close link between the need for such severe constraintson the public expenditure programme and the level of wage settlements,5.     The proposals I made in C (75) 39 envisaged that a substantial part of this programme (about  1,200 million out of the total forGreat Britain shown in Cmnd 5879 of about  ii.,t00 million for1976-77) would be exempt from the general percentage reductions on current and capital expenditure.     My proposals would thereforemean an expenditure saving of  75 million for Great Britain, ofwhich  62-jr million relates to England.     These proposals were discussed with the Social Serviee-sr-Secretary before she left on anUJ-j.iOj.aju   vj.Dj.0   uvcrBcao   j. ruui  vuii^ii   ofi.^  Aietu. jiuii   i-c ourucu vciiwu jf^i&apos;^was circulated.     But I believe them to provide, in the circumstances;a basis for agreement subject to re-arrangement between the component parts at her discretion^Education and libraries, science and arts6.     The Secretary of State for Education and Science has undertaken?provided that other Departments make their due contribution, tofind the savings of  76 million proposed on the programme for education and Libraries, Science and Arts (England and Wales,including universities).     He points out however that, although the&quot;basic needs&quot; school building has been exempted, the cuts in capitalexpenditure will involve a considerable reduction in the particularprogrammes for replacing old schools, and for colleges and universities - and that in consequence there may be a shortage of places in relation to demand for higher education.      On current expenditure the cuts may mean that there will be fewer teachingposts than the potential supply of teachers and therefore someteacher unemployment.Environment7.     There will no doubt be difficulty in persuading localauthorities to reduce the rate of increase in their current2
expenditure in 1976-77 to if per cent or less, as implied by theproposed reductions.       Exclusive reliance on the mechanism on therate support grant to force local authorities down to this levelof increase might entail, in the DOE view, an average increase in domestic rates in 1976-77 of around hO per cent.     My proposal.,,however, is for sustained action from now onwards to induce localauthorities to exercise restraint.     Departments should take action,wherever they can through exhortation, advice and instructions onthe services for which they are responsiblej    and this should becounlcd with general advice to local authorities c?bou*t the state ofthe economy and the need for restraining public spending as a whole.,8.     The Secretary of State for the Environment did not, feel ableto accept the following proposals in C (75) 39.  million(England)6 (ii)   Subsidies - Reduction in localbuses;    and abolitionof the new bus grants to private operators 338 Postpone introduction of community    ^/&quot;&quot;Claim onownership of development land &quot; contingency reserve^/9.

The total reductions of 9*5 million include  5=9 million in respect of the Thames TidalDefence prelect,,     The latter v/ould lead to some deferment in thecompletion of the overall project (though not the barrier itself)by delaying some of the protection work on downstream areas.Law and Order11.   The Home Secretary has agreed to find the full amounts proposed for his services in C (75) 39? subject to a degree of flexibility in their allocation between his services, and to one proviso -
which has appeared in successive White Papers - namely that if(in spite of new provision for earlier retirement on pension) netrecruitment to the uniformed police within authorised establishmentsexceeds the reduced provision, extra provision will be madeaccordingly.     But in that event, I understand that the Treasury andthe Home Office would explore the possibility of alternative sources of savings*12,    For my part, however, I doubt whether it is wise to take the 1-!- million cuts which the broadcasting authorities would need tofind, since we cannot now reduce the total revenue available fortheir spending.13. The Lord Chancellor has agreed to find that part of the re duct iin this programme ( 1.6 million) which is attributable to higher comScotland.1        The total which I have asked the Secretary of State to find is 51 million.

The Secretary of state has particular difficulty in making the 10 per cent reduction on 30 million of expenditure on the MJLl motorway, because this isregarded by him as crucial to the economic prospects for Wales,

I attach much importance to ensuring reasonable stability innationalised industry investment programmes, and I am not thereforeproposing any percentage formula cuts under- this heading j    nor doI intend to specify particular reductions for individual industries&quot;eNone the less, it will be my intention to obtain an overall net reduction of  100 million from the total provision in Cmnd 5G?9Fby a generally more rigorous scrutiny of the proposals that come forward from the Industries and the deferment of less essentialexpendituresCivil Service Department16.

It has not been possible, in the time available,to holdbilateral discussions with the other Departments, for whom thegeneral cuts on current and capital expenditure would fall primarily on central Government manpower and other current expenditure on goods and services.     The saving   involved for each of these departments is relatively small, amounting to about  10 million forthem all.     If my colleagues agree in principle, I propose that theTreasury and Civil Service Department should explore ways ofSECRET5
