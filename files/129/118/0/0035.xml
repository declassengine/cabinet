Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1964CP. (64) 135 Copy No.     6113th July, 1964CABINETELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION LINE BETWEEN BOLNEY ANDLOVEDEANMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate this memorandum as Chairman of the Economic Policy Committee.2. The Central Electricity Generating Board has been working for some timeto a policy of centralising power generation in large stations and transmitting thepower to consuming areas by a &quot; supergrid &quot;. This is a different conception fromthe old grid, which was mainly intended to connect the smaller stations of thatperiod; and it needs heavier transmission lines (400 kV.) and taller lattice towers(165 feet high). The Board has to apply to the Minister of Power for consent to the route which a line is to follow. He may give consent (and if he does itamounts to planning permission), or withhold it, or order a public enquiry.3. Consent for most of one such line from Dungeness to Cornwall has beengiven. A gap is left across West Sussex, from Bolney to Lovedean. (A map isattached showing the place of the line in the general 400 kB system.) The board are proposing a particular route on the advice of a distinguished landscapearchitect. Miss Sylvia Crowe. A public enquiry has been held. The inspectors ofthe Ministries of Power and of Housing who conducted the enquiry reportednine months ago. In their report, which has not been published, they suggestedthat an alternative route for part of the way should be considered. (A further mapis attached showing the proposed and alternative routes.)4. The first question which the Economic Policy Committee considered (last march E.P. (64) 10th Meeting) was whether 15 miles of line across the finestcountry should be put underground. This would have cost some  20 million, or over twenty times as much as for an overhead line; and it could have set a precedent.The Committee commissioned a full study. In the light of it the Minister of Powerrecommended in May against putting the line underground (E.P. (64) 19th Meeting).The Committee agreed with him. What route was the overhead line to take?5. The Minister of Power asked the Committee to agree to the Board&apos;proposal. But this crossed an area only recently designated by the Minister of housing as one of &quot; outstanding natural beauty&quot;. The general opinion in theCommittee, however, was that it would be contrary to the spirit in which planningdecisions are made and a possible ground for severe criticism if we ignored the inspectors&apos; suggestion that alternatives on particular sections of the route shouldbe studied by the Board. The Committee asked the Minister of Power to cause the study to be made and to report back to them. Meanwhile the Board&apos;s applicationfor approval of their proposed route was to be held in suspense. To avoid causinganxiety which might in the end prove to have been needless, the Minister was askednot to announce the examination of an alternative route unless circumstancesrequired him to do so.6. The Committee did not, hov/ever, appreciate that the study could be made only after the inspectors&apos; report was published since, in accordance with practicesince the Franks Committee on Administrative Tribunals, the contents of such a4583HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
report are not made known to one interested party without being made known t^iall; and the study could only be made by the Board who were one of the interested parties.7. The Minister Of Power brought the matter back again to the committee this month (E.P. (64) 29th Meeting, Minute 2). He explained that the study would entail publication of the inspectors&apos; report (but the Committee still did not realise that the contents of the report remained unknown to the Board). He pointed outthe objections to publication at this stage:(a) It would arouse anxiety among those affected by the alternative routewithout relieving the minds of those affected by the Board&apos;s proposedroute, who would, however, see fresh hope in pressing their objections;and others elsewhere who cared for the beauty of the area would doubtless join in.(b) A deficit of power in South-East England will begin to show in the winter of 1965-66. At best, even with immediate consent, the Bolney-Lovedeanline would be completed only in time for the following winter. If theline is not operating by then, supplies to most of Sussex and part of Kentwill be in serious hazard. There will be a demand in these areas of over1,000 megawatts and local generating capacity of 500 megawatts. Forthe residual 500 megawatts the area will depend on four existing lineswith a capacity of only 400 megawatts and on a new line from Lydd toBolney, already approved. But if that line were to fail the Bolney-Lovedean line not being available to bring support from the west complete power failure in large parts of Sussex and Kent could quicklyfollow.(c) Faced with this risk the Minister was anxious to avoid further delay. Evenif publication of the inspectors&apos; recommendation that their alternativeroutes should be studied did not give rise to a new public inquiry,6-12 months delay was likely to result; and if there were a public inquiry, the delay would run to 12 to 18 months.8.   The alternatives which the Minister put to the Committee were:(i) to postpone a decision until the autumn. He advised the Committee against this, because of the risk of subsequent criticism of the postponement;(ii) to announce at once a decision in favour of the Board&apos;s route, with anoverhead line;(iii) as in (ii), except for the stretches for which the inspectors had suggestedstudy of alternatives, together with an announcement that the board would investigate those alternatives.9. The Minister favoured (ii). In the Committee (which the Minister couldnot attend-his position was reserved) while some Ministers thought that theBoard&apos;s route would turn out to be the best in any case, some thought that we shouldbe in a weak position if we appeared to ignore the inspectors&apos; suggestions, andothers thought that examination of alternatives would arouse wider anxiety. Wewere inclined to think, however, that while it would have been practicable to publish the inspectors&apos; report in May, it was not desirable to do so now. Yet anannouncement at this stage of consent to the Board&apos;s route, with the inspectors&apos;report apparently ignored, seemed no less objectionable. Finding these difficultiesin courses (ii) and (iii), the Committee asked the Minister to reconsider his proposal.10. The Committee did not realise that the Board cannot investigate any alternative route recommended by the inspectors until we disclose their report.This reinforces the objection to course (i) and my colleagues may well think that ittips the balance back in favour of either (ii) or (iii).11. At the public inquiry opinions were as follows:. (a) The central section of the route recommended by Miss Sylvia Crowe andadopted by the Board was supported by the National ParksCommission. The County Council and the Council for the preservation of Rural England prefer a southerly route, while the inspectors havesuggested an alternative to the north, which has, of course, not yetbeen surveyed because the recommendation is in the report which hasnot yet been published.
* (b) The western section of the board&apos;s route, from Petworth to Buriton, was supported by the National Trust and the Council for the preservation of Rural England but opposed by the Society of Sussex Downsmenand the Vigilant Association. The National Parks Commission gave it welcome but regard it as the least damaging. The County Councilexpress no preference. The inspectors have again suggested analternative to the north which has not been surveyed.12.   Other relevant factors are:(a) The question is already a live one in the local Press. It is difficult,therefore, to leave it on ice.(b) The Minister of Power is becoming increasingly embarrassed by hisinability to explain the delay in reaching a decision.(c) The local Member of Parliament considers that immediate announcementof the Ministers consent to the Board&apos;s route would be the best course.13. I invite my colleagues to choose between the courses (i), (ii) and (iii) set in paragraph 8 above.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,13th July, 1964.
