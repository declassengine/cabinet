SECRET &apos;        299(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. P. (64) 15421st July, 1964COIY NO. .  0 ICABINETPROTECTION OF IMPORTANT VISITORS FROM ABROADMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department at their meeting on 16th July the Cabinet (C. M. (64) 38th Conclusions)invited me to consider whether any action was required to intensify theprotection for visitors to this country against molestation or embarrass-ment.Protection from molestation2.       When an important official visitor is known to be coming to thiscountry, the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police prepare a plan for his protection according to their estimate of the likely risk.    they take into account their own information about dissident groups of thevisitor&apos;s own nationals, any likely opposition from extremists, and any information from the Government Department primarily concerned.3.       The degree of protection afforded varies considerably.    the visits of some - for example, Khrushchev, Tito and the Greek royal family - involve a major effort with plans concerted in advance both withthe Departments concerned and with a senior security officer of thecountry concerned.    Where there is no special reason to expect trouble,a single bodyguard is provided.    In general, these arrangements have successfully ensured that individual visitors are not molested.    There is,of course, no way of providing an absolute insurance against a determined4.      At the recent Conference of Prime Ministers five officers wereassigned to Dr. Nkrumah, two to Mr. Kyprianou and one to each of theremaining sixteen, including Mr. Kenyatta.    In addition Special Branchofficers covered the outside of Marlborough House (four seargeants and four constables under a Chief Inspector), and uniformed constables wereassigned to each of the places at which Commonwealth Prime ministers were staying (two in the case of Mr. Kyprianou and Dr. Nkrumah).Apart from the attempted assault on Mr. Kenyatta, there was no untowardincident.5.       The use of uniformed officers to form cordons between the entrance to a hotel and a waiting motor car would be out of keeping withthe way in which important foreign visitors have customarily been treatedhere.    Such protection is usually provided only for Royalty, and then only when there are crowds that have to be kept at a reasonable distance.Short of this, incidents would be less likely if additional Special Branchofficers covered the entrances of hotels before every movement;  and inthe light of the recent experience the Commissioner proposes, when wehave an eminent visitor whose record may lead to demonstrations, toprovide - in addition to the officer or officers attached to him personally -at least one Special Branch officer and one uniformed constable at the entrance of his residence whenever he leaves or enters it.    I agree withthe Commissioner that this modification of our well-tried and normallyadequate methods of protection is appropriate.-1-secret
Protection from embarrassment6.      In this country the right of peaceful demonstration is of longstanding and    must obviously&apos; be firmly maintained.    The police caninterfere with demonstrators only if they believe that the will be able -if necessary - subsequently to satisfy a court that they had grounds forapprehending a breach of the peace or obstruction.    Even if posters orshouted slogans are offensive, the offence under section 5 of the public order Act 1936 will be committed and the arrest of the demonstratorsjustified only if they are using threatening, abusive or insulting wordsor behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned.7.      In general, the police regard their present powers as adequate;and if ever there are demonstrators outside embassies or buildingswhere distinguished visitors are living or meeting, they usually succeed in keeping them on the opposite side of the road, allowing only two orthree to approach a building to deliver a letter.    To give the policestronger powers would mean controversial legislation to curtail the rightof peaceful demonstration.    It would, in my view, be wholly against ourtraditions of civil liberty.K.
