&apos; CABINETCOMPENSATION FOR FORMER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICEOF THE FEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NY AS ALANDMemorandum by the Lord chancellor was invited by the Cabinet on the 18th June (CM. (64) 32nd Conclusions,Minute 3) to consider with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Minister ofState for Commonwealth Relations and the Secretary for Technical assistance by what means the Government could secure the most favourable presentation of our attitude towards the Federal Public Service settlement in the expecteddebate on this subject in the House of Lords on the 27th July.2. We have come to the conclusion that the only course in the debate is forthe Government to stand firm in defence of the Federal Public Service settlement,as agreed and accepted by all five Governments concerned last September: andthat a sound and logical defence of the settlement as a whole can be presented.3. There is, however, the risk that this defence may not be sufficient to prevent an adverse vote: and we have also considered whether, in that event, there is any concession which the Government spokesman could offer, by way of promotingan improvement of the settlement.,4. The possibilities of concession are set out in the Annex. It will be seenthat they are extremely limited. We do not consider that any initiative involving the reopening at this late stage of the agreement reached with the otherGovernments concerned is practical politics. The only move that could be made byus without disturbing the settlement is to provide some form of additional cashcompensation, at our expense, for redundant officers. This, however, would havewide repercussions, in opening the way for review and challenge of other aspectsof the whole dissolution settlement, as well as of our attitude towards thecompensation of locally based officers in other territories which have achievedindependence or may do so in the future.5. I should welcome the views of my colleagues as to whether in thecircumstances any concession ought to be contemplated.D.Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office, S.W.1,22nd July, 1964.4619Printed for the Cabinet. July 1964CP. (64) 153 Copy No.   5822nd July, 1964
POSSIBILITIES OF IMPROVING THE FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICESETTLEMENTThe essential elements of the settlement are as follows:(i) Comparable conditions of employment were secured in Northern and southern Rhodesia, on which pensionable officers could reasonably be asked to continue to serve.(ii) If an officer did not wish to do so, he could leave immediately withearned pension.(iii) If there was no comparable employment available for an officer, he wascompensated by enhanced pension.2. The general underlying principles were that, in circumstances where&quot; comparable employment&quot; under the territorial Governments was available tothe great majority of the officers concerned, recompense for the changes occurringshould be confined to officers rendered redundant: that fair and reasonablecompensation for such officers would be provided by the extra one-third pensiondue to them in the event of abolition of their offices: and that, in a serviceemployed on locally-based terms throughout, there could be no discrimination inthe matter of compensation on grounds of race, origin or source of recruitment.3. This was judged by all five Governments to constitute reasonable treatmentof the officers concerned. The territorial Governments, as successor States, agreedto share the financial liabilities involved: and the British Government, withoutaccepting liability, agreed to contribute towards the costs by paying a share (sincefixed at 25 per cent) of any deficit in the Pension Fund resulting from the additional burden of the agreed terminal benefits.4. In general the weight of argument is strongly against reopening thesettlement in any particular.5. Any suggestion to extend compensation to ex-Federal officers generally,whether redundant or not: or to give better terms than earned pension to officers who declined &quot; comparable employment &quot;: or to discriminate between officers on grounds of origin or source of recruitment, would:(a) entail revision of the whole settlement with the territorial Governments;(b) involve alteration of the conditions upon which officers made their choiceson dissolution and hence widespread reopening of individual affairsalready settled;(c) call for amendment of Schedule II of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland (Dissolution) Order in Council, 1963.This would not appear to be practicable or politic.6. Some form of cash compensation, in addition to the enhanced pensiongranted under the settlement, could be considered for redundant officers, whonumber about 400. If the British Government were prepared to pay for this, itcould be introduced without disturbing the settlement or reopening negotiationswith the territorial governments: and it would help to counteract invidiouscomparisons with the treatment, for example, of H.M.O.C.S. officers, or of non-designated officers in Northern Rhodesia (who are now being offered, if losingtheir jobs through Africanisation, half the lump sum compensation paid with.M.O.C.S. officers).7.   On the other hand,(i) For the British Government to take the initiative in altering one aspect ofthe whole dissolution arrangements, as agreed after five months of hard and detailed negotiation between the Governments concerned, could have wide repercussions. Other parties (e.g., a territorial Government,or the creditors of the Federation) might be encouraged to reopen other issues, such as the apportionment of the Federal debt: and the implication that the British Government was prepared at this late stage to accept direct financial liability for the consequences of dissolutionwould also be dangerous.Annex
We should be paying compensation for the first time to officers for whom the British Government had never accepted responsibility (the redundant officers include Southern Rhodesian Europeans, possiblySouth Africans also, and even a number of Africans born in theFederation).The precedent could be used to challenge our previous attitude towardscompensation for locally based officers in other territories, whetheralready independent or becoming independent in future.8. The British Government might also consider offering to supplement, at its own cost, the funds available for relieving hardship among redundant officers.This too would be done without disturbing the general settlement. But the hardshipscheme has not been defective for lack of funds, which are available by agreementof the Governments from the &quot; dissolution account&quot; operated by the LiquidatingAgency (and in the final accounting it is likely that the British Government willmeet half the costs charged to this account). If any further British contributionto the hardship scheme were to be considered, it would be necessary to re-examinethe whole basis and operation of the scheme in consultation with the territorial governments. The extent to which payments to individual officers under thescheme could be substantially increased without disturbing the balance of treatment as between one redundant officer and another is limited : and, if the whole scheme were to be broadened, it would begin to take on the aspect of general additional compensastion for redundant officers.9. Perhaps the most that could be done would be to undertake to consult the territorial Governments about the working of the hardship scheme, withoutimplying that any major change is called for in the principles on which it has beenoperated or the way in which the Special Commissioner appointed to administerit has exercised his discretion.(iii)
