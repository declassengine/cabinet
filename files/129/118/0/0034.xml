V/. 1.9th July, 1964
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH THE PRIMEMINJTEROF MALTA WOULDBg WILLING TO WRmfTO. THECOIONIAL secretary in the course of the useful discussions we had yesterday andtoday, you and your officials told me in confidence that:-(a) apart from the temporary storage of nuclear weapons in transit you have at present no plans to establish and use Malta as a nuclear base or for the storagetherein of nuclear weapons and that it is most unlikely that Malta will be so used;(b) Malta is really unsuitable for such use;(c) the non-exclusion of nuclear matters from theAgreement is necessary in order not to create a precedent in relation to Singapore, Aden andother places and that for obvious reasons theBritish and American Governments have never been willing either to confirm or deny thatnuclear weapons are or are not in anyparticular place;(d) that it is most unlikely that a situation would arise in which nuclear operations might ta-keplace without Commonwealth Prime Ministersbeing aware of it beforehand.In view of the above and only in order not to create a precedentand not to weaken the effectiveness of the nuclear deterrent, I am prepared not to insist on the proposed exclusion of nuclear mattersfrom the draft Agreement on the clear understanding that, should there be a change of circumstances affecting the considered  -ations at (a)to (d), I shall continue to hold the same views as already clearlyexpressed and the Malta Government must then be free to raise any objections they may have to the establishment and use of Malta as a nuclear base or to the storage therein of nuclear weapons, in the lightof the international situation obtaining at the time.
PUBLIC STATEMENT WHICH THE PRIME MINISTER of malta WOULD PROPOSE TO make as we all know, nuclear weapons have become a fact of life in the modern world.    It may well be that ships and aircraft carrying such weapons have called at Malta in thepast.    For reasons that ought to be obvious to all it is theinvariable practice never to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons in any particular place.    The government can be trusted to look after the best interests of the island.
