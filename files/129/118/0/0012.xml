Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1964CP. (64) 112 Copy No.   C Q2nd June, 1964CABINETSTATIONING COSTS IN germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for defence with reference to the memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury[CP. (64) 105], my colleagues will wish to see the attached copy of a letter whichI have written to Herr von Hassel, the Federal German Minister of Defence.P. T.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,2nd June, 1964.Ministry of Defence,2nd June, 1964At dinner on Wednesday I explained to you the difficulties which I felt aboutthe proposals for a Stationing Costs Agreement which had been referred to theirrespective Governments by Dr. Dahlgruen and Mr. Boyd-Carpenter. Not only didit seem to me to be liable to severe criticism as being less favourable to the UnitedKingdom than your Agreement of 12th May with Mr. McNamara is to the UnitedStates, but it also seemed to offer insufficient lasting relief to us in respect of the severe and rising burden of our balance of payments.You for your part explained that, owing to budgetary cuts imposed on Federaldefence expenditure in the next two years, it was difficult for you, so far as defenceprocurements were concerned, to undertake in advance to make purchases in theUnited Kingdom for the two years referred to in the negotiations on the basishitherto pursued of stating specific targets in Deutschmarks.I think it seemed to both of us that our difficulties would be eased if theAgreement were to refer to other efforts which would be made during the two-year period but which would not bear fruit until later. I now therefore enclose a draft of anadditional paragraph which Mr. Boyd-Carpenter and I would be prepared torecommend to our colleagues if it were acceptable to yourself and to Dr. Dahlgruen.I very much enjoyed meeting you again and rejoiced to see you looking somuch better after your recent illness.PETER THORNEYCROFT.Herr Bundesminister Kai-Uwe von Hassel.Additional Paragraph to Stationing Costs agreement it is also the intention of the two Governments to direct their militaryprocurement planning during the financial years 1964-65 and 1965-66 in such away that over the longer term the cost in foreign exchange of maintaining british forces in Germany be offset by German purchases in the United Kingdom.4427
