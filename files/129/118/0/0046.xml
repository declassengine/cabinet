CABINETDEVELOPMENT OF A SMALL SATELLITE LAUNCHERMemorandum by the Minister of AviationBlue Streak has been fired successfully. The French and German stages aremaking good progress. We can expect the European Launcher development organisation (E.L.D.O.) to have an operational launcher capable of putting heavysatellites into orbit by 1967.2. In our negotiations with the United States about the setting up of aninternational satellite communications system, we have successfully secured rights to provide a share of the equipment including launchers and satellites. The existingdesign of the E.L.D.O. launcher, however, would need certain modifications and improvements before it could launch communications satellites into suitable orbits.The members of E.L.D.O. are due to consider in the autumn whether thesemodifications should be undertaken. They will also be considering what the next stage in the E.L.D.O. programme should be. At the same time the EuropeanConference on Satellite Communications will be considering whether to embark on the development of communications satellites for supply to the world system.3. In the next few years the European Scientific Research Organisation(E.S.R.O.) will be letting contracts for satellites of increasing complexity for scientific research.4. Staff studies in the Defence Department suggest that there may also bedefence requirements for satellites, probably in conjunction with the United States.All this suggests that over the next few years we are likely to be concerned with international space projects to an increasing extent. The question is whether weshould equip ourselves to influence their character and benefit from themindustrially.5. The Ministry of Aviation and industry have already done considerablepreparatory work on rocketry and satellites. At the present time the Ministryof Aviation&apos;s contracts with industry on space activities are running at about 11 million a year. On the basis of currently approved programmes, this would reduce to  7 million in 1966-67 and  5 million in 1967-68. Apart from Blue Streak,this expenditure mainly goes on the Black Knight programme to study missilere-entry problems including the penetration of anti-missile defence ( H million);civil space studies of the upper atmosphere with the Skylark sounding rocket( 600,000); an all-British research satellite Mk. Ill to be launched from a LmitedStates launcher,  400,000; and basic satellite component development,  J million.In addition there is a considerable intramural effort consisting of 150 qualifiedscientists and engineers at an estimated cost of about  1 million a year.6. But before we could expect to influence international programmesconnected with E.L.D.O., E.S.R.O. or the Communications Satellite Corporation(COMSAT), or before we could hope to win contracts we should need to testcomponents and instruments under actual space conditions and be seen to havedone so. We should also need to demonstrate experience of launching, injectingsatellites into orbit and controlling them in orbit. Theoretical studies would notbe enough.4610IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. July 1964CP. (64) 146 Copy No.  5820th July, 1964
Ministry of Aviation, S.W.1,17th July, 1964.7. The E.L.D.O. launcher is too expensive to be used as a development todffor these purposes. It costs about  2 million per launch. We have, therefore,considered how we could put experimental satellites into orbit most cheaply.8. We have in Black Knight a small but powerful rocket which has beenfired 16 times, always successfully. We are now using it on a joint programme withthe United States in a study of defence penetration. A detailed project study hasbeen carried out and shows that Black Knight could be converted into a smallsatellite launcher without difficulty. The estimated cost is a total of  8- 10 million.The launcher would be ready by 1968-69. The development cost would thus be some  2 million a year. A subsequent programme of operational firings couldcost  2 million a year.9. I conclude that this additional expenditure of  2 million a year to our existing space efforts would enable us (1) to carry out in actual space conditions the experiments which will benecessary to test the design of instruments and components for use insatellites; and to gain the necessary experience of injecting satellitesinto orbit and controlling them;(2) to put our industry in a position to compete for contracts for spaiceprojects;(3) to enable us to influence the development of E.L.D.O., E.S.R.O. andCOMSAT programmes in our favour.10. I accordingly recommend that we should undertake the developmentof a small satellite launcher based on the existing Black Knight rocket at an estimated cost of  8- 10 million.J. A.
