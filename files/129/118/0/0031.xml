CONFIDENTIAL141Draft White paper the SCHOOL BUILDING- SURVEYINTRODUCTIONThis White Paper records the results of official surveys of the buildings of maintained primary and secondary schools and of special schools for handi-capped pupils in England and Wales.*   The surveys were carried out in 1962 andthe analysis of the returns was completed late in 1963.    The results are summarised in the tables in parts II and III.   Many of the sub-standard premisesthen listed have since been improved or replaced.The surveys enable assessments to be made of school building since the war,and of priorities for future programmes.   In the first part of the White Paper,these are set in the context of past and future school building programmes, whichin turn are a part only of the wider programme of public investment.* The surveys covered all primary and secondary schools (including special schools) maintained by local education authorities, and non-maintained special schools.    They did not cover other direct grant schools (i.e. schools receivinggrant direct from the Department of Education and Science) or independent schools;they excluded nursery schools, but not nursery classes in primary schools.MEN!

CONFIDENTIAL143The post-war task1 .Since the war, 6,700 new schools and over 3.5 million new school places have been completed, and a furtherLi&amp;t-flOO places are under constructionat a total.cysst of about  1,000 million.   Until 1958, the school building programme was dominated by the task of matching pupils with school places.At first this was hampered by the war damage and the severe shortages of labourand materials of all kinds.   But from 194-6 onwards the increase and distributionof the school population became increasingly decisive.    In 1946 the primary schools began to feel the effects of the rise in the birthrate.   In 1947, theG-overnment of the day raised the school leaving age to 15.    Throughout theperiod there began to manifest itself the welcome tendency of senior pupilsto stay on voluntarily after 15.   Moreover   the population moved into newareas and housing estates, and new school building had to move in step withthe building of houses.2, In 1958, the opportunity occurred for the first time to concentrateresources upon objectives beyond the range of basic needs.   The age groups born in 194-6 and 194-7 were due to begin leaving the schools in 19^1, and this gave a pause in the sheer pressure of numbers.    This was the background to thepublication in December 1 958 of the White Paper entitled &quot;Secondary education for All - A New Drive&quot;, * which announced a  300 million major school building programme covering the fitre years beginning in ^^G$/6^ .    In addition to thestill over-riding priority of &quot;roofs over heads&quot;,  the White Paper identifiedtw$ immediate tasks,  - the completion of re-organisation of the all-age schools in both rural and urban areas, and the replacement or improvement ef the worstsecondary school buildings, with particular regard to facilities for teaching and technical subjects.    Lower priority had at that stage to be given to the replacement of primary schools.*   Command No. 6^4-.3.
oF!DENTIALThe last of the projects needed to complete re-organisation has nowbeen included in the 1 964-65 programme and a large number of otherimprovement projects programmed in the five-years&apos; period, many of whichare not yet finished, will greatly improve facilities for secondary education.These projects, which will now exceed the original  300m, will provide an estimated 340,000 primary and 630, D0d:;&apos;-secondary places in new schools and extensions, and adaptations and remodellings of many older schools.The SurveyPaper.   It was clear that there would be bigger demands for new accommodationthan in the early 196*&apos;.-s since greater numbers continue to enter and to stayon at school ** and new areas continue to be developed for housing.   But otherpriorities were less clear than in 1958.   Nevertheless it seemed probablethat, after the emphasis on secondary school projects between 196O and 1 965,the next stage should be a general attack on obsolete building.5. It was necessary first to obtain a new assessment of the state of ourschools to serve as a guide for future policy.    The local authority associations readily recognised the need, and the primary and secondary schools survey was begun in the summer of 1 9^2 and extended to special schools in the autumn of that year.    The results are summarised in Parts II and III ofthis White Paper.6. The surveys emphasise a number of important facts.   By the summer of1962 56 per cent of secondary school pupils, 30 per cent of primary schoolpupils and 57 per cent of special school pupils were accommodated in buildings which had no unsatisfactory features as listed on the questionnaires.   Theseproportions would go up as new&quot; projects were included within oarrent major and minor works programmes.    On the other hand, it is clear that after 1964/65there will remain a formidable accumulation of inadequate school accommodation,** Excluding the effect of the raising of the school leaving age to 1 6 in1 970, the latest estimates suggest that the maintained school population will rise from the present figure of 7,000,000 to 8,009,000 by January 1972, and to,00C,00i \en years later.4.By 1962 the time had come to look in detail beyond the 1 958 White
wMch will require a steady programme of improvements year by year.   Inparticular, the survey has brought out the desirability of regular re-placement within the major programmes of old primary school buildings in-capable of satisfactory improvement by means of minor projects.The programmes for 1 965/66-1 967/68.7. To meet the double need to improve our schools and to provide for increasing numbers, the Government decided last autumn to raise school building starts on major projects in 1965-66 and 1966-67 to  84 million ayear, including about  4 million for special schools.   Local educationauthorities were accordingly asked to submit proposals.    They were asked todo so on the basis that, as hitherto, first priority should be given to themeeting of basic needs for new places arising from increases in the school population and new housing.   In addition the replacement and improvement of secondary schools was to continue and for the first time as a regular featureprovision v/as to be made for the replacement and improvement of primary schools.8. Early in 1964 programmes for these years were announced, together witha proportion of the 1967-68 programme.   The longer notice was intended toassist authorities and the promoters of voluntary school projects to maintainthe higher rate of building now contemplated.9. The effect of the new policy can be seen from the following tables whichanalyse the 1965-66 and 1966-67 programmes announced to local education authorities at Easter 1 964.    The 1 965-66 primary and secondary programme is virtuallycomplete at  78.4 million; that for 1966-67 stands at  64.6 million, leaving 15.4 million to be allocated,   Complete programme for special school building for 1965-66 and 1966-67 have also been announced.5.

Since the war, the number of children in maintained schools has risen by almost two million, as the following figures show:Maintained Primary and Secondary School Population (thousands)1947 - 5,034 1959 - 6,9*11950 - 5,651 1962 - 6,9651 953 - 6,206 1963 - 6,925195* - 6,649Three factors have contributed to this increase: the consequences of thesteep rise in the birth rate beginning in 1946, the decision that, the school leaving age should be raised to 15 in 1947, and the higher rate of voluntarystaying on after 15.   To meet this school population growth and to improveexisting accommodation, by the end of 1963-64 3.5 million new s hool places(including temporary places) had been completed in England and Wales since 1945,about evenly divided between primary and secondary schools.    Over  1,600million had been spent or committed in terms of major and minor building projectsstarted during this period, excluding the cost of site purchase, professionalfees, furniture and equipment.11.     Despite this rapid rate of progress, there are many real inadequacies tobe tackled.    These are brought out in Part III of this Paper.   Some are theinescapable results of obsolescence.    Our school buildings make up a large,complex, and costly capital plant,and it would be unrealistic to expect that,at any given point in time, all will conform to the highest standards currentat that time.    This is not a problem peculiar to schools; a survey of other forms of building, public and private, would certainly reveal a similarsituation.12.     A high rate of investment in the public services as a whole is essential for developing a social environment acceptable to a modern society.   In thepost-war years there have been growing demands in such fields as housing,roads and hospitals, and the total pressure on resources is now very great.  Even.so, educational building work .started in Great Britain has ircreased^from -just over 100 million in 1959/60 to  166 million in 1963/64, and will further increase to about  228 million in 1965/66, as the larger programmes for schools,further8.
education and the universities get under way*.   Within these totals,major school building projects started in England and Wales(includingspecial schools) will grow from  44.5 million in 1959/60, to over  68 million in 1963/64 and to a projected  Q+ million in 1965/66.* including university figures for the calendar years 1959 and 1963,and the fifteen month period 1st January, 1965-31 st March, 1 966.9.
CONFIDENTIAL , -.A15013.     Since 1945, the major effort both in educational building and in other forms of public investment has necessarily been devoted to meeting immediatebasic needs, although significant progress has been made in raising generalstandards of accommodation and in modernizing older buildings.    Much still remains to be done, but the total amount which can be attempted each year is inevitably limited, and has to be shared among competing and increasing claims in all public service fields.   The overall requirements have also to beoonsidered in relation to estimates of the physical and financial resources which will be available to meet them.14.     Nevertheless, the facts set out in this Survey bring out very clearly the importance of continuing high annual rates of expenditure on schoolimprovements as part of the Government&apos;s general policy of levelling-upeducational opportunity; for it is the least favoured section of our communitywho gains most from this aspect of social capital expenditure./&quot;The speed at which future progress will be made cannot be preciselypredicted, but, as the figures quoted above indicate, the Government haveshown their determination to bring about a more rapid rate of progress inschool building, despite all the other pressures of demand.   The announcedprogrammes of  64 million for school budilding in 1965/66 and. 1 966/67represent a real and substantial advance on previous years, and an acceleration of progress in replacing bad accommodation that will be pressed forward over the next few years./The Treasury propose to substitute for the passage in brackets thefollowing paragraph:/&quot;The speed at which future progress will be made cannot be preciselypredicted, but, as has been emphasized, the announced programmes of  84 million for 1 965/66 and 1 966/67 are considerably larger than those in previous years,despite all the other pressures of demand.    The size of these programmes willmake possible a real acceleration over the next few years of the rate of progress in replacing bad accommodation and building new schools^
JS.151II.    The 1 962 SurveyMaintained Primary and Secondary SchoolsBackground.15.     The information contained in Part II of this Paper is derived fromanswers received from local education authorities to a questionnairedistributed to them in May 1962.   Authorities were asked to list specificinadequacies in existing schools and to indicate their probable futureintentions regarding schools to be (i) closed and not replaced, (ii) rebuilt,(iii) remodelled or extended and (iv) left without further building.   Theywere assured that the future proposals recorded on the questionnaire wouldbe regarded as provisional and without commitment.    It was originally intended that the survey should provide data to enable an estimate to be madeof the cost of building work which would have been necessary according to authorities&apos; proposals in 1962 to bring all school buildings up to the standards of the present Building Regulations.   This basis did not, however,prove practicable.16.     To ensure objectively and to save undue work, the questionnaires were designed with three principles in mind:-(a) subjective judgments would not be called for;(b) no physical surveys of buildings would be necessary;(c) the information provided should lend itself to automaticprocessing.These principles inevitably imposed restrictions on the informationcollected.    It was eventually decided to concentrate on thirteen factors which could be objectively and readily identified and which singly, or stillmore, in combination would tend to make a school unsatisfactory for pupilsor teachers, though no such criteria will be invariably reliable.   For example,most schools with adequate heating arrangements have central heating, butthere are no doubt seme without it which are satisfactory.   Schools withbuildings on more than one site are certainly inconvenient, and the buildingsoften include some of poor quality.    Sometimes however they include buildings of good quality which can be retained.   Similarly, while schools which have11.
ial -    152m&quot;If or more of their accommodation in temporary building are usually in need of improvement or replacement, this is not always so.   Much purposebuilt temporary accommodation of recent design and construction is of high quality and can hear comparison with permanent buildings.17,     After the completed questionnaires had been checked for internalconsistency the information was analysed (i) regionally and (ii) by type of school.   The regions used were the divisions into which H,M, Inspectorate is organised.   A list of the local education authorities falling within eachregion is at Appendix A and they are illustrated by the map at Appendix B,For the analysis by type of school, primary schools were distinguished fromsecondary and voluntary from county schools; voluntary schools were furthersub-divided into status-controlled, special agreement and aided - and intoreligious denominations - Church of England, Roman Catholic and others.18,     The information obtained about the state of the schools is tabulatedin Part III, and a summary of the main findings is given in tbhe following paragraphs *The Survey of jfeildings^19.,     The table following this paragraph shows the number of schools whichhad one or moie of the features specified in the questionnaire and the numberof pupils attending them.   The limitations outlined at (a) and (b) in paragraph   1 above made it necessary to specify these factors in a simple form notcorresponding exactly with the requirements of the School Building Regulations5&quot;:for example, the Regulations do not explicitly require indoor sanitation orelectric lighting, but &quot;the standards laid down are such that in the greatmajority of cases it can be assumed that sanitation or lighting not of this character also fall short of modern requirements.    Some of the features noted* The Standards for School Premises Regulations, 1959(S.I. No. 890, H.M.S.O. 1/-)12,
9also arise from unavoidable local circumstances,  such as the absence in thelocal ty of electricity, water or sewerage services; and it has to beaccepted that in some densely built-up towns sufficient land for theextension of school sites to the minimum area required by the Regulationsis not available and there is no prospect that it ever will be013.

CONFIDENTIA!155Age of. Schools20.   It was recognised that nany schools have buildings dating from more thanone period, including post-war extensions, but it was decided to classify themaccording to the age of the oldest main building still in use for teachingpurposes.     This means that many schools classified in one period havebuildings of more recent date.     Generally speaking, the age of buildings ismore useful as an indication of accommodation which is probably out-of-date interms of current teaching ideas than as a guide to the condition of the structure.     Though some schools built before 1900 are in poor condition the usefulness of most of them as places for teaching has declined primarilybecause they are simply outmoded.     The analysis of schools on this age basisgave the following picture;Age of		Schools		Pupils (thousands) on roll in 1$62		oldest main building	Primary	Secondary	All	Primary	Secondary	All1.

CONFIDENAL156Background22.   The survey of special schools was carried out in the autumn of &apos;^962,It followed the same general lines as the survey of primary and secondary schools, but was extended to cover both special schools maintained by localeducation authorities and non-maintained special schools (i.e, schools run bybodies other than local education authorities which are approved as special schools under Section 9(5) of the Education Act, 1944, and form part of thenational provision for handicapped pupils).23.   The questionnaire used followed closely that used for primary and secondary schools.     It was designed with the same principles in mind and related to special schools in use on the 30th June, 1962.     Because asubstantial proportion of all special schools are boarding schools, the formincluded questions about inadequacies in the residential accommodation.24.   After the completed questionnaires had been checked the information wasanalysed by the category of handicap for which the school is approved, dayschools being distinguished from boarding schools and maintained schools from non-maintained schools.     No regional analysis was carried out, ho?rever, both because the number of schools involved is relatively small and because the major part of the provision in non-maintained special schools is nationalrather than regional or local in character.     For the analysis by category ofhandicap the schools were divided as nearly as possible into the handicapsand combinations of handicap used in the Department&apos;s published statistics;complete conformity was not possible because of the limitations of the punchedcard system used for analysing the information.25.    The information obtained about special schools is tabulated in Part III,and a summary of the main findings is given in the following paragraphs.The Survey of Buildings26.

In case of doubt, a building was classed as temporary if the loan period given was less than 30 years.(2) This covered schools using separate sets of premises on a temporary, makeshift basis, not those whose buildings had been deliberately designed to be dispersed.(3) i.e., excluding playing fields.   A school site was regarded as seriously sub-standard if it was two-thirds or less of the minimum area prescribed in the Building Regulations for the school at its existing size.(4) Excluding primary schools for less than 100 pupils.

In case of doubt, a building was classed as temporary if the loan period given was less than 30 years.(2) This covered schools using separate sets of premises on a temporary, makeshift basis, not those whose buildings had been deliberately designed to be dispersed.(3) i.e., excluding playing fields.  A school site was regarded as seriously sub-standard if it was two-thirds or less of the minimum area prescribed in the Building Regulations for the school at its existing size.(4) Excluding primary schools for less than 100 pupils.
