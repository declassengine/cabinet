Printed for the Cabinet. June 1964CP. (64) 113 Copy No.   -f?4th June, 1964CABINETREBUILDING THE FOREIGN OFFICE BLOCK-CONSEQUENTIALACCOMMODATION CHANGESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for DefenceIt is agreed that the Foreign Office is to be pulled down. It is also agreed thatthey will need to be rehoused in the central Whitehall area during the period whenthe new Foreign Office is being constructed. It is also agreed that none of these things will start to happen, even on present plans, before 1970.2. The paper by the Minister of Public Building and Works (CP. (64) 114)proposes that we should decide now at least 6 years before the event that thedisplaced Foreign Office staff should be housed in the Old Admiralty Building forthe three or four years while they are waiting for their new building to be completed.3. A large part of the defence staff is of course already decentralised. Furtherdispersal of the staff housed in the central Whitehall area, including the OldAdmiralty Building, would, on our present organisation, which is just in the processof completion, cause administrative chaos. I would emphasise that we are justcompleting one of the largest reorganisations ever attempted in Whitehall, and Iwould ask for a few months before we plan the next one.4. It may be that further dispersal could take place of defence staff in London,but this is less likely in the case of those staffs who are located in the Old AdmiraltyBuilding in order to ensure proximity to the planning and policy staffs in the maindefence building, of which in many cases they form an integral part.5. None of this need, however, in any way hold up the planning of the newForeign Office. It is quite clear that additional accommodation will have to befound during the period of rebuilding and some of it may have to be hired. Whetherit will be found more convenient to move both the Foreign Office and a large partof the Ministry of Defence at that period six years from now will depend on anumber of factors which will be much clearer then than they are to-day. I therefore suggest that planning proceeds; that we accept the need for the Foreign Office tobe given accommodation in the central Whitehall area during the period before theygo into the new Foreign Office; but that the precise buildings which are occupiedat that time should await both the completion of the reorganisation we are atpresent engaged upon, and the study of future dispersal possibilities.P. T.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,2nd June, 1964.4432
