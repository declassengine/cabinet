CONFIDENTIAL 108[THIS r-&quot; 7UM2NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&amp;^Ed^l2Il, COPY NO.       0 616th June, 196^CABINETEARNINGS-piATSD SHORT-TERM benefits memorandum by the Chencellor of the Exchequerand the Chief Secretary to foeJTreasury andFajyjrna^ter^GenejalThe paper (CP. (64) 118) circulated by the Chancellor of theExchequer as Chairman of the Committee on Pensions and national insurance recommends as the majority view of the Committee.(i) that we should accept the policy of incorporatinginto the National Insurance Scheme a system of earnings related short-term benefits;(ii)  that we should publish in the near future a white paper containing the outlines of such a scheme.2.       This memoraadum sets out our reasons for believing that weshould not take any such decisions.3.       The decision sought on policy involves both a major recasting ofa large part of the National Insurance Gcherne and a commitment to additional expenditure of the order of  50 million a year.   In our view agreat deal of further thought is needed before committing the Governmentto steps of this kind.4.      Socially, it seems a doubtful proposition to give priority inrespect of this large expenditure to improving the provision for highly paid industrial workers who suffer a limited period of unemployment.If this provision were contemplated from the point of view of improve-ment in sickness benefit, it would seem more sensible from the social and human point of view to move to a higher rate after the sicknesshad been prolonged rather than, as suggested hy the Ministers, toreduce it to the basic rate after six months.   From the point of view nowadopted by those interested in social matters inside and outside our &apos;Pa,rtythat social policy should concentrate additional resources on the area.sof greatest need, the proposals would appear to involve a retrograde step.   For although obviously a short interruption in the earnings of a highly paid worker involves him and his family in some difficulties,these difficulties are already mitigated in a number of ways.   Apartfrom employers&apos; red.unda.contingency payments which it is stated in paragraph 5of the draft White Paper circulated with C. F. (64) 118 now cover 4j million workers, there are rebates of P. A, Y. 2. made by the Inland B.evenue.The higher the worker&apos;s previous pay the more significant these are.And above all, he will have a fully equipped household, and in these days in which all Governments seek to maintain the high level of employment,early opportunity for further work.   His problems are nothing like so-1-
grim as those of very old pensioners or the chronic sick, who.will beold or sick until they die.   Socially, sums of money of this order couldbe far better expended in other directions, and we have little doubt thatthis will be the view of most social thinkers and workers.5.      But it is argued in paragraph 4 of G. P. (64) 118 that there areeconomic arguments related to the mobility of labour in favour of wagerelated unemployment benefit.   Although these arguments plainly donot apply to sickness benefit, it appears that the proponents of thisscheme feel that they cannot provide one without the other.   But we arevery sceptical about these alleged economic benefits.   It does not seem tous likely, for example, that a married man with two children, who isearning  18 a week will accept redundancy cheerfully because his incomedoes not as a result fall below  10 8s, 6d. a week.   And if there is anyforce in this contention, it is double-edged in that in so far as it makes the acceptance of unemployment easier, so it must diminish the willing -ness to accept new&apos; if different and less highly paid employment.   after all, the main consideration in favour of assisting mobility of labour isnot so much getting people out of the jobs in which they are not neededas in getting them into the ones where they are required.   We do not therefore see in these proposals any such advantage from the point ofview of the efficient running of the economy as to compensate for the substantial burden on industry whose competitive position is not strong,and neglect of social priorities which they involve.6.       There are a number of other major difficulties involved in theseproposals to vhich we will refer only briefly, but which our colleagues may wish to consider further:-(i) in order to accommodate a system of general graduated contributions for short-term benefits within a scheme whichat present allows the contracting out of the State graduated scheme of workers covered by satisfactory employer schemes,it is necessary, as the Minister of Pensions and national insurance has explained to us to recast the whole system of graduated contributions under the National Insurance Act, 1959.This involves abolishing contracting out so far as graduated contributions are concerned and putting in its place a system under which it would be possible to contract out instead froma small part of the flat -rate contribution.   Not only will thischangeover involve a major administrative upheaval for employers but it may well diminish their desire to contract out and so weaken the growth of private occupational provisionfor old age which it has been the object of the present government to encourage.   The number of workers in con-tracted out schemes is now about 4f; million;(ii) C. P. (64) 118 leaves obscure what would be the likely effect ofthe introduction of these proposals on the Industrial InjuriesScheme.   In that Scheme, benefit is related to loss of faculty.To convert it to one related to earnings would be to revert to one of the features of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Scheme,which the Industrial Injuries Act, 1946, superseded.   On theother hand, it is difficult to see how the Industrial InjuriesScheme based on loss of faculty could continue as analternative to sickness benefit based for a limited time onloss of earnings;-2-
CONFIDENTIAL(iii) the scheme proposed in Co P. (64) 118 is likely to be criticised on the ground that unlike the present National Insuranceshort-term benefits, the additional provision, being related to earnings and not to family circumstances, would give the biggest proportionate benefit to a single man.   As single menare, on the whole, those vh o find it easiest to move to findother employment, this would seem to be a feature alsoworking against mobility of labour;(iv)the proposed four weeks1 gap before sickness benefit is paid ona wage related basis will be difficult to justify against the gap of only one week in respect of unemployment benefit,   C. P. (64) 118makes it clear that nearly ha.lf the workers are not yet coveredby employers&apos; short-term sickness schemes, and those not so covered will not understand their exclusion;(v)the scheme will be very costly to administer in relation to thebenefits paid.   Whereas the National Insurance scheme as a wholeis administered at a cost of 3. 7 per cent of the benefits distributed,,it is estimated that to administer benefits under these proposalsof  50 million a year the administrative cost v/ould be  4 million a year;(vi)the exclusion of the self-employed from the benefits of the scheme,although it follows the 1959 Act in this respect, will revivecriticisms on that point, and is somewhat harder to justify inview of the fact that very few of the less well off self-employedare likely to carry sickness policies;(vii) politically, the proposals are unattractive in as much as they do not seem to be really wanted by any section of society.   The money which they they would cost could be expended in other directionsattracting greater popular approval and support.   For example,the T. U. C. are known to be in favour of increasing family allowances, and employers are unlikely to be enthusiastic abouteither the cost of the complexity of these proposals.   Our own supporters increasingly favour greater concentration of resources on those in need,7.       For these reasons we do not think that the case has been made out for the acceptance by the Government of a commitment to adopt such asystem.   Nor, even if so convinced, would we think it prudent to embodyproposals and publish them in a White paper.   The experience of thepublication of the various Grossman plans provides a warning.   Theprovision proposed could be made to seern small compared with whatthe Opposition would promise and the limitations of the scheme, particular-1;those set out above, would provide damaging grounds of attack.   Moreover,,as demonstrated in paragraphs 18-26 of C. P. (64) 83, the timing of theintroduction of National Insurance changes is crucial.   In our view there isno prospect whatsoever of keeping expenditure on benefits and assistanceroughly in line with the forecast in last year&apos;s White Paper on public expenditure unless we can defer the next general increase in benefits-3-
 ANFlftPMTIAIuntil the spring of 1966.   We do not think it is realistic to think this canbe done if the Government commits itself to specific improvement in national Insurance benefits (arid increase in National Insurance contri-butions) at this stage.8. We shall shortly be submitting to our colleagues the outcome of thecurrent public expenditure survey which will indicate that the White Paperforecasts of expenditure in 1967-68 will be substantially exceeded, unless there are substantial modifications in the government&apos;s present policies.The White Paper put the annual rate of increase in public expenditure between 1963-64 and 1967-68 at 4.1 per cenfea but the new costingssuggest that it will be of the order of 5 per cent.R.
