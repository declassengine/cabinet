Annex a text OF LETTER DATED 21st JULY, 1964, FROM SIR RICHARD WAYTO Mr. FERRANTIYou will remember that during the period October to December 1963, wehad several discussions about the profits made by your company on certaincontracts for the production of components for the Bloodhound Mark I missile system. When Sir John Lang was asked to carry out an inquiry into this matter,however, we agreed that any further discussion should be deferred until after his report.This has now been received and I enclose a copy herewith. In the light ofits observations I must ask you whether you are now prepared to make a refundto public funds in respect of the contracts covered by Sir John&apos;s report.Yours sincerely,% sfc % 4: $TEXT OF LETTER DATED 23rd JULY, 1964, FROM Mr. FERRANTI TOSIR RICHARD WAYThank you for your letter of the 21st of July, 1964. As you know when thismatter was first raised with me I said that we had never had any desire to make more than fair and reasonable profits on defence contracts, and that our aimhas always been, and will continue to be, to perform those responsibilities which her Majesty&apos;s Government might choose to place with us in the most efficient and economical manner. I also indicated a readiness to make an ex gratia payment to settle the matter.There are a number of factors to be considered in arriving at what wouldbe a proper repayment. The contract was for the production of an entirely new type and design of weapon system of which neither we nor the officers in yourDepartment had had previous experience. Exceptional inspection standards weredemanded. An exacting time schedule was set. The work therefore carried specialrisks, but it was nevertheless completed on time and met the very high performancestandards which the Department required.We were able to achieve exceptional production efficiency by closing another department of our business and transferring its technical and production teamto the Bloodhound work as soon as production could be started. When theBloodhound work comes to an end we shall be faced with heavy terminalexpenditure. Neither of these factors is taken into account in calculating the costscharged to the contract, but which nevertheless represent substantial expenditure which we have to incur.The profit allowance by the Ministry of Aviation included in the contractprice was  810,353, but, as you pointed out in your evidence to the SelectCommittee, contractors are entitled, and are expected to augment the profit figuresallowed in fixed price contracts by achieving economies in the operating costsallowed for by the Department at the time when the prices are agreed. WhilstI cannot accept all the findings of the Lang Committee either so far as theyconcern my own company or the Ministry officials, I recognise that the profitarising on the Bloodhound I contracts was greater than we expected when thosecontracts were negotiated.
0TEXT OF LETTER DATED 24th JULY, 1964, FROM SIR RICHARD WAYTO Mr. FERRANTIDear Mr. Ferranti,Thank you for your letter of 23rd July, 1964.I fully understand the points you make regarding the unique productionproblems which you faced in carrying out these contracts; and I recognise thesuccess you achieved in overcoming them.I am glad to know that, in order finally to dispose of all aspects of theBloodhound I contracts, you are prepared to make a refund to public funds of 4,250,000.In answer to your last paragraph, I can assure you that the Department hasconfidence in you, your Company and its technical ability, and that there will beno discrimination against Ferranti Limited so far as future contracts are concerned.In order finally to dispose of all aspects of the Bloodhound I contracts betweenis we are willing to make a refund in respect of those contracts of  4,250,000.I would be grateful if you could assure me that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentcontinues to have confidence in me, my company and our technical ability andthat there will be no discrimination against Ferranti Limited so far as futurecontracts are concerned.
Annex B draft STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF aviation will with permission make a statement about Sir John Lang&apos;s interim reporton the circumstances of the Ferranti Bloodhound I contracts. Copies will be in the vote office when I sit down.Sir John Lang has concluded that on 40 contracts relating to Bloodhound Iproduction, Ferranti Ltd. made a total profit of some  5,772,000. This represents a profit of 82 per cent on cost. Over-estimation of the direct labour costs andthe resulting excessive recovery of overheads accounted directly for the bulk ofthis profit.Sir John finds that my Department placed undue reliance on Technical Costestimates, failed to ensure effective collaboration between the Technical Cost andAccountancy directorates, and did not make the best use of its resources. Sir Johnalso found that Ferranti Ltd. submitted quotations and agreed prices which they knew were likely to yield profits that could not be regarded as fair and reasonable.When we received Sir John Lang&apos;s report, my Department re-opened withFerranti the question of a refund of part of these profits. Messrs. Ferranti Ltd. haveagreed to repay a sum of  4,250,000. This would reduce their profit on theBloodhound I contracts to 20 per cent on cost. Having regard to the punctual and efficient fulfilment of the contract and bearing in mind that there is no provision in the contract for a refund of profits, we regard the Company&apos;s proposal as areasonable one in the special circumstances and have accepted it. I am publishing the correspondence with Ferranti regarding the refund in the Official Report.I would like to take this opportunity to thank Sir John Lang and his colleagues for carrying through this very detailed investigation in time to make their reportavailable in the present Session.. The second part of his report, which will deal with my Department^ contract organisation, will be ready in the autumn.
