Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1964CP. (64) 156 Copy No.    g24th July, 1964CABINETCOMPANY LAWMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional development and President of the Board of TradeIn reply to a Question in the House of Commons on the 11th March about theReport of the Committee on Company Law I said that I hoped before the end ofthe Session to inform the House of the Governmenfs proposals on the principalissues which the Committee had raised. The question is in what form I should do this, whether by means of a White Paper or in some other way.2. In E.P. (64) 91 I submitted the draft of a White Paper to the economic policy Committee setting out conclusions on the main issues of principle and explaining the background against which they have been considered.3. The Economic Policy Committee agreed that a White Paper on the lines proposed could, subject to relatively minor amendments, be made suitable for publication. On the other hand since legislation is not in any case possible beforethe 1965-66 session, they were inclined to doubt the wisdom of spelling out indetail the Governments attitude and exposing the areas where no decision had yetbeen reached, so far in advance of legislation. They took the view that publicpressure for a statement of the Governmenfs intentions might be adequately met by a statement to the effect that the Government broadly accepted the Committee&apos;conclusions and would introduce legislation to enact them in the course of the nextParliament.I was invited to reflect further on the arguments which had been presented for and against publication.4. I have considered this matter further and I have reached the conclusionthat the arguments against the publication at this stage of a White Paper (includingparticularly the absence of a firm decision on the question whether all limitedcompanies should be required to publish accounts) must prevail. I proposetherefore that instead I should make a statement before the House rises for the recess.5. In the circumstances such a statement can only be in general terms. i submit a draft for the approval of my colleagues. There will no doubt be pressure for a more explicit statement of the Governmenfs intentions on the particularmatters mentioned and it will be necessary to decline such explanations and toask Members to await the draft legislation. In dealing with Press inquiries it willbe necessary to say that the statement is as far as the Government are at presentprepared to go.E. H.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,24th July, 1964.4629
COMPANY LAWDraft statement the Government have now completed their study of the chief issues of policyraised by the Report of the Company Law Committee. Though some of the implications of the Committee&apos;s recommendations will need to be considered further before the legislation is drawn up, the Government fully support the general approach to company law on which the Report is based.Proposals for legislation will be introduced at an early stage in the life of thenew Parliament. These will include provisions designed to promote theGovernments objective of greater industrial efficiency, notably by ensuring thatinvestors, creditors and the general public are given fuller information about theactivities of companies. There will also be provisions for disclosure of beneficialshare ownership and of the shareholdings of companies in other companies; forthe amendment of the law relating to unit trusts; for securing greater responsibility in the formation of companies; for permitting equity shares of no par value; andfor improving the procedure relating to circulars containing takeover offers.The Government have decided that there are not sufficient grounds at thisstage for them to seek powers to restrict the use of non-voting shares.The Government intend to enter into early discussions with banks, discounthouses and shipping companies on the exemptions from certain of the accountingprovisions of the Companies Act which these institutions now enjoy.
