CABINETTHE CONCORDMemorandum by the Minister of AviationIntroductionOn the 20th November, 1962 (C.C. (62) 70th Conclusions, Minute 2), theCabinet decided to undertake with the French Government the development and production of the Concord supersonic airliner. An Agreement between the twoGovernments (since published in the Treaty series) and an accompanyingMemorandum of Understanding was signed on 29th November, 1962.2. Since the Cabinet decision was taken, British and French engineers have carried out detailed designs of the aircraft and preliminary structural work. Therehas also been close consultation with B.O.A.C. and Air France as to the operationalrequirement. The time has now come to &quot; freeze &quot; the design of the two prototypeaircraft which we have agreed to develop.Modifications Required3. The greater part of our original calculations have been confirmed byexperimental work undertaken in the past 18 months. Some modifications, however,are required and I attach at Annex A a report agreed by British and french officials about them. They provide in essence for a strengthening of the enginepower and an increase in the wing area. They are necessary because:(a) The original design under-estimated the weight of the aircraft and soprovided insufficient power to carry it over the necessary range incertain conditions.(b) B.O.A.C. and Air France have asked for larger reserves of fuel than hadbeen originally catered for.By strengthening the engine and enlarging the wing we shall also enable the concord to fly direct to New York not only from Paris and London, but fromBrussels, Amsterdam and Frankfurt.Cost of Development4. I am advised that the provisional forecast of  150-170 million for thedevelopment of the Concord which we made in 1962 must be increased by some 65 million. This is to cover adjustment to 1964 prices, alterations in programme and original under-estimation. To this must be added the cost of strengthening the engine and enlarging the wing. It would be inadvisable to allow less than some 40 million for this. Any forecast of this kind inevitably contains a substantialmargin of error but, on the basis of our present information, the initial cost ofdevelopment is likely to be around  275 million; i.e., a contribution of 137-5 million from the United Kingdom or some  50 million more for this4503aPrinted for the Cabinet.

Operating Economics5. We also estimate that the unit price of the Concord will have to beincreased from  3/4 million to about  5 million. This compares with  3 million for a VC-10 or S2\ million for a Boeing 707. This increase adds substantially tothe operating costs of the Concord. It is very difficult at this stage to forecastconfidently the operating economics of the aircraft. The sea-mile costs will be greater than those of subsonic aircraft. But this disadvantage should be offsetinitially by the passenger appeal of the Concord leading to higher load factors.This load factor may decline as the numbers of supersonic aircraft increase, butthere is no reason to doubt that, as with other transport aircraft, subsequentimprovements will bring down seat-mile costs.Radiation6. I am advised that the problems of radiation to passengers and aircrewflying at 55,000-60,000 ft. are no longer regarded as a cause for concern.Noise and Sonic Bang7. By contrast we are still concerned about the effects of noise. The levelof &quot; fly-away &quot; noise, i.e., noise in the path of the aircraft near to the airfield,will be less than the Boeing 707 or the VC-10. Lateral noise is, however, likelyto be higher. There will also be the sonic bang at supersonic speeds. Much of thiswill be over the seas or deserts. Nevertheless, there is still a problem here whichcould involve some economic or operating penalty in respect of flights overpopulated areas.The Essential Problem8. Should we go on with the Concord in view of the increase of development costs of at least  100 million ( 50 million for the United Kingdom); and of unitprice by  1-2 million? The British and French officials whose report is attachedare unanimous in recommending that we should. I agree with them.United States Competition9. In asking my colleagues to support this view I am influenced by the lack of progress in United States competition. I attach at Annex B a note onthe recent history of the United States supersonic transport programme. Thisshows that the Americans are unlikely to select a design before the beginningof 1965. It also shows that they are likely to go for a Mach 3 aeroplane built oftitanium which would probably cost over twice as much as the Concord per unit.Such an aircraft could hardly be in airline service before 1975. It also shows thatthey have a number of -organisational problems to resolve, including the shareof the cost of development to be borne by industry. These problems are likelyto add still further to delay. The Americans had forecast that the Concordwould capture 125 of the world-wide requirement for 300-400 supersonic transport. This forecast was made on the assumption that they themselves would start work on their own supersonic transport aircraft (SST) in May of this year.Now that their programme is delayed we should be able to increase our shareof the market correspondingly. There are already provisional orders for 43Concords with the prospect of more to follow.Russian Competition10. Our enquiries show that the Soviet Union have made considerable progressin design work on a supersonic transport designed to fly at Mach 2-2. We doubtcountry than was originally anticipated. The spend for the United Kingdom overthe next years would be: I1964-65 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68     Thereafter  million...... 11        22        25        22        RemainderSome further expenditure must be allowed for development of the aircraft after its first certification. The amount and its division between the Governments andthe manufacturers cannot be determined now.
whether they have sufficiently reliable engines to introduce an aircraft into regular[service in this decade but it is quite possible that their prototypes will be flyingsoon after ours. If we were to abandon the Concord the Soviets would probablybe first in the SST field.Contributions by the British Firms11; At the meeting of the 20th November, 1962, the Cabinet invited me, inconsultation with the Chief Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade,to consider further the question of contributions by the British firms to the costof the project. The firms have so far agreed to be responsible for the &quot; educationcosts &quot;, i.e., the extra cost of building early production aircraft which might amountto about 10 per cent of the total United Kingdom share of launching costs or some 14 million. I am still in discussion with B.A.C. about a further contribution but itseems unlikely that they could further increase their stake. This is because of theburden they are already carrying in relation to the VC-10 and because of the special efforts which they are making to promote the sale of the BAC-111.Recovery of Government Contributions12. It has been agreed in principle with the French authorities that a levyshould be charged on the proceeds of sales of the aircraft, engines and spares, butit is important that this should not have a restrictive effect on the market. TheFrench proposal is that the rate on the aircraft itself should be low, e.g., 2 per cent of the sale price, but that the rate on the sale of spares (which can be expectedover a life of 10 years to amount to roughly the same value as the aircraft itself)should be 10 per cent. In addition to these percentage levies I would propose tonegotiate with the main United Kingdom contractors an arrangement for sharingany remaining margin between sales price and the cost of their production. On this basis, and with a sale of, say, 150 aircraft, we stand to recover a substantial part about one third of our initial investment.Conclusion13. I ask the Cabinet to approve the continuance of the Concord project onthe basis described above and in continued collaboration with the French. I am advised that the French Government have already decided to go ahead. They are anxious to make a joint announcement with us as soon as possible.J. A.Ministry of Aviation, S.W.

Annex ACONCORD 131 of 14th May, 1964REPORT OF THE ANGLO-FRENCH COMMITTEE OF OFFICIALSCHARGED WITH THE SUPERVISION OF THE CONCORDPROJECTState of the Project and Proposals1. On 29th November, 1962, the United Kingdom and the French Governmentsigned the Agreement for the development and production of a civil supersonic transport aircraft (later named Concord) to cruise at about twice the speed of sound.The Agreement envisaged the construction by Sud Aviation and B.A.C. of along-range version (3,250 n.m.) and a medium-range version (2,400 n.m.), the twoversions being derived from two indentical prototypes, one assembled in each country. The engine was to be developed by Bristol Siddeley Engines Ltd. andSNECMA from the BS Olympus 320 engine.2. Since the signature of the Agreement a great deal of work has been carriedout. As is normal in the case of an advanced project, much design and development work has been done to define the general configuration, the structure, the propulsivesystem and the various equipments of the aircraft. This has been accompanied byintensive experimental work in aerodynamics and materials testing and other areas.As a result, the design of the aircraft and engine has been refined and improved.3. The Official Services (including in the United Kingdom the Air RegistrationBoard), as well as carrying out research and technical studies in government establishments, have made good progress in the joint preparation of the additionalairworthiness requirements necessary for supersonic aircraft. They have also studiedoperational and commercial aspects such as fuel reserves, airport noise, sonic bang,air traffic control requirements, operating economics and the nature of the market.4. As a result of these studies, the Official Services and the manufacturers have concluded that:(a) The importance of the Concord having good trans-Atlantic capability has grown. This is borne out by the number of provisional orders alreadyplaced by international airlines for the long-range version of the aircraft.(b) The long-range version in the form envisaged in the Anglo-FrenchAgreement of November 1962 would not be likely to be capable of operating the London and Paris-New York stages with the regularityrequired by civil airlines; the principal reasons for this conclusion arethe increase in the estimated empty weight of the aircraft, higher fuelreserves than previously allowed and new estimates of the performance and weight of the propulsive system.5. The firms therefore propose to alter the design of the Concord bothairframe and engine to improve its performance and provide for adequatedevelopment potential. They have made the following recommendations:(a) The increase in the weight of the aircraft requires modification of the engineto increase the basic thrust by about 10 per cent. (This recommendation was accepted in principle on 6th December, 1963, at a meeting between mr. Julian Amery. United Kingdom Minister of Aviation, andM. Jacquet, French Minister of Public Works and Transport.)(b) The increase in the weight of the aircraft also requires an increase in wingarea of about 15 per cent to ensure adequate performance, in particular on takeoff and landing. Increasing the thickness as well as the area ofthe wings will give an important addition of tankage capacity.
6.  The firms&apos; proposals have been examined by the experts of the two^Asountries. As a result, the Committee of Officials submits to the United Kingdom^and French Governments the following conclusions:(a) The aircraft now proposed by Sud and B.A.C. with an increased basicwing area of 15 per cent and weighing about 150 tons on take-off and equipped with four Bristol Siddeley/SNECMA engines with increasedtake-off thrust of 10 per cent constitutes a sound basis for thedevelopment of a long-range aircraft capable of performing the Londonand Paris-New York operations with the regularity required by civilairlines and carrying at least 100 passengers. Under certain operatingconditions it will be necessary to use a small amount of reheat attake-off.(b) The two prototype aircraft should be constructed in accordance with thenew definition. The first flight is now planned for the end of 1967.(c) The aircraft now proposed has significant development potential since the modified engine offers prospects of further increases of power as aresult of which the range may be increased or extra passengersprovided for.(d) Manufacture of production aircraft will not start until the end of 1966.This gives plenty of time to decide upon the best definition of theproduction aircraft.(e) Full certification of the production aircraft should be achievable by theend of 1970 with entry into airline service in 1971.(/) The new version of the medium range aircraft has not yet been studied in detail. It can, however, reasonably be estimated that the capacity ofthis version could be appreciably increased beyond the figure envisagedfor the long-range aircraft by a further fuselage lengthening.(g) At this stage of development it is very difficult to forecast operatingeconomics. On its first entry into service, it is clear that the Concordwill require a higher load factor than the Boeing 707 in order to breakeven. However, the fact that the seating capacity of the Concord issmaller than that of the Boeing 707 and the halving of flight timeoffered by the Concord should enable it to achieve a significantlyhigher load factor than the Boeing 707 at any rate in its first years of operation. When the development potential referred to in (c) above hasbeen realised, the Concord&apos;s operating economics will improve so thatthey will be more nearly comparable with those of the Boeing 707.(h) The sonic bang will be louder than has been previously estimated.Although much experimental work has been carried out on this subject in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, it is not possible at present to define limits of public acceptability. Obviously, everythingpracticable must be done to keep this noise to a minimum. In order toincrease knowledge on this subject, the Committee may wish in thenear future to recommend tests with supersonic military aircraft overa British and/or French town to supplement those now being carriedout by the Americans over Oklahoma City. Meanwhile, the Committeeconsiders that it would be right to proceed in the belief that the bangcan be kept within acceptable limits and that severe overland operatingrestrictions will not have to be imposed.(/) During the initial climb, the noise of the Concord below the flight pathshould be less than that of current big jets but during take-off lateralnoise is likely to be rather higher.(/) The costs of development are much higher than originally estimated. Thisarises in part from under-estimation of the provisional figures arrivedat at the time of the Agreement of 29th November, 1962, in part fromadjustment of the figures to current economic conditions, and finallyfrom the modifications now proposed. Until the full detailed revisedcost plans have been prepared by the firms and thoroughly examined by the officials it is impossible to put forward precise estimates. Theinformation so far produced by the firms, however, suggests that thetotal cost to Certificate of Airworthiness may be of the order of 275 million spread over the next seven years. It should also berecognised that after C. of A. some further expenditure will be incurred
to meet the cost of introduction of the aircraft into service. Moreover,^the further development of the aircraft and engine, mentioned in (cjjjyabove, will require supplementary expenditure, the amount of whichcannot be estimated at this stage; nor can the incidence of thispost-C. of A. expenditure between the firms, the airlines and theGovernments yet be defined.7. The Committee has also considered the competitive position represented by the United States SST programme, although this is, as yet, far from beingclearly defined. However, it seems likely that the Americans will eventually go ahead with an aircraft built of titanium and larger, faster and much more expensive than the Concord. It is also very difficult to estimate the possible dateof entry into service of the American aircraft. In view of the recent postponement of the date by which a decision is to be taken, it seems unlikely that an american aircraft could be in service before 1974, and a later date seems to us more realistic.The sonic bang of the United States aircraft is likely to be similar to that of the concord. At present there is no reason to believe that its long range operatingeconomics will be better.8. The market for supersonic transport in the 1970s is variously estimatedat between 300 and 400 aircraft. The Americans have themselves stated thatConcord may capture 125 of this market. The Committee considers that if all goeswell Concord will achieve a sale of 150 or more. Production of this order would ensure a workload of the highest technological quality for the industries of thetwo countries, and a substantial part of the Governments expenditure could be recovered over sales of the Concord and its engines, equipment and sparesthroughout the operational life of the aircraft. A detailed examination of this latter question is in hand.9. The Committee of Officials recommends to the United Kingdom andFrench Governments that the Concord project should proceed on the basisdescribed above. In particular, the firms should be instructed immediately toproceed to the construction of the two prototype aircraft in accordance with thenew proposals set out above.Signed on behalf of the Committee of OfficialsROBERT VERGNAUD,ChairmanMORIEN MORGAN,Vice-chairman
Annex BTHE AMERICAN SUPERSONIC TRANSPORT programme . The United States have done considerable research into the problems ofsupersonic flight. They also have extensive military experience on which to buildincluding the production of the B-58 and B-70 bombers and the A-11reconnaissance/strike titanium aircraft.2. The Federal Aviation Agency, which was put in charge of the UnitedStates SST programme in 1963, issued last August a Request For Proposals. Thisinvited industry to submit designs for a supersonic transport which would be larger and faster than the Concord. The proposals stipulated that the manufacturersmust contribute 25 per cent of the development costs.3. Three aircraft manufacturers (Boeings, Lockheeds and North American)and three engine manufacturers (Pratt and Whitney, General Electric and CurtisWright) submitted various designs of aircraft and engine. These were designed tocruise at speeds of Mach 2-5/3 (involving the use of titanium and advancedmetallurgy) and carry 150/200 passengers. The production price of these aircraft was variously estimated at between $25 million and $40 million per aircraft. the manufacturers, however, refused to contribute 25 per cent of the development costs, estimated at upwards of $1,000 million ( 357 million).4. President Kennedy then appointed Mr. Eugene Black, former Presidentof the World Bank, to report on the F.A.A.&apos;s proposals. The principal conclusionsof Mr. Black&apos;s report were that(i) the United States should go ahead with an SST programme if they wishedto retain their place as leaders of the world&apos;s aeronautical industries;(ii) the United States Government must be prepared to pay some 90 per cent of the development costs;(iii) the aim should be to produce an aircraft larger and faster than the concord even if this meant bringing it into service some years later;(iv) the two most difficult questions to be solved were the acceptability of thesonic boom and the economic viability of the aircraft in airlineoperations;(v) the management of the programme should be taken out of the hands ofthe F.A.A. and entrusted to a new and separate agency of Government.5. Following the Black Report and the examination of the manufacturers&apos;proposals by a 210-man group representing United States Government interests,manufacturers and airlines, the types. reported to President Johnson that none of the designs submitted met the objectives of the programme and in particular the economic viability of the aircraft. On 25th April the President announced thathe had decided that &quot;the next phase of the programme, which had envisaged twomanufacturers working in competition on their designs for a further year from 1st May, should be postponed. He has referred the whole subject to a committeechaired by Mr. McNamara and consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, theSecretary of Commerce, the Central Intelligence Agency Director, the NationalAeronautics and Space Administrator, the types. Administrator and Mr. Blackhimself. More recently the President has authorised certain study contracts, but all the indications are that the Americans will not now take a firm decision until after the Presidential election.
