Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1964CP. (64) 102 Copy No.   7012th May, 1964CABINETGAULLISMMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsLast year the Master of Sidney Sussex College in Cambridge, Dr. DavidThomson, was asked to write a study of Gaullism as a political phenomenon,covering both its history and its future. I thought that my colleagues would liketo see what Dr. Thomson has now produced, and I am therefore circulating acopy of his analysis for their information. A summary of his study is annexedbelow.2. As far as our future policy is concerned, I think Dr. Thomson&apos;sanalysis and Sir Pierson Dixon&apos;s recent despatches point to the same conclusions.I have just sent Sir Pierson Dixon a despatch setting out what I think the broad principles of our policy should be. What it boils down to is that in dealing with president de Gaulle we have to weather a storm which should gradually subsideafter he disappears. We must go on treating him as a tricky kind of ally, butwe can no longer think in terms of an Entente Cordiale. That is a relationship which we must hope to restore gradually with his successors. Meanwhile we mustprevent him having his way with the Western alliance while avoiding, if at allpossible, a head-on clash with him.R. A. B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,11th May, 1964.AnnexDr. THOMSONS STUDY ON GAULLISM: OUTLINE SUMMARYDr. Thomson sees Gaullism as a new and unique phenomenon, the product of events in France between 1940 and 1958, rapid social and technological change and de Gaulle&apos;s own political outlook and experience. He warns against thedanger of trying to trace non-existent historical parallels and roots and of assumingrecurring patterns in French political history. Gaullism has three especialcharacteristics: it reflects Jacobin and revolutionary ideas; it contains a strongmessianic element, arising from its birth and formation in periods of nationalcrisis; and it is founded upon the bedrock of French nationalism. &quot;It is a republican nationalism, strongly fortified with the heady spirit of popularsovereignty and heroic leadership.&quot;2. Dr. Thomson goes on to discuss the various elements of the Gaullistpolitical approach and programme. He has a very high opinion of de Gaulle&apos;political ability and experience (see pages 10 and 24). De Gaulle, essentially a&quot;non-party &quot; man, saw the implications of the popular dissatisfaction with theexisting political parties and the technological and social revolution in France,4328
and exploited them to appeal successfully direct to the French people over tillheads of institutions. Naturally, the Gaullist substitute for the old system was a&quot;system of technocrats. The elections of 1962 were a political triumph, based uponthe lessons of de Gaulle&apos;s worst political mistake: the rise and fall of the R.P.F.The &quot; non-party &quot; Gaullist regime depends for its national appeal upon a positive,forward-looking State policy (hence the extensive powers of the President);corporative ingredients (syndicates, Comites d&apos;Organisation, etc. Dr. Thomsontraces an interesting historical evolution from the organisations established underVichy); support and participation of the technocrats; support from the &quot; notables &quot;of the Patronat and agriculture; and &quot; depolitisation&quot; of the nationaladministration. At the same time, the reign of the technocrats, after Monnet, andthe encouragement given to pluralism, after Proudhon, may constitute in the longer term an obstacle to the propagation of certain Gaullist ideas, notably theirpredilection for centralisation and State authority.3. Dr. Thomson then considers the influences playing upon Gaullism. Hediscusses in some detail the significance of syndicalist and other corporativemovements, which he calls proletarian pluralism, pointing out in particular theirappeal to the voter who is inclined to vote Communist and the fact that any&quot; polarisation &quot; of political influences, for instance the rallying of anti-Communistand Right Wing groups in support of de Gaulle, would also tend to combinethe Left. Conversely, insofar as de Gaulle succeeds in appealing to the Leftishvoter over the heads of the political parties and profits from &quot; depolitisation &quot; ofnational activity and &quot; embourgeoisement &quot; of the proletariat, the Left and Centreparties will remain weak and divided, and the growing army of State and publicemployees will remain loyal. As Dr. Thomson sees it there is a triangular pullbetween the central authority, the technocracy, and pluralist elements. Powerfulinfluences determining the future of Gaullism are also of course the personalityof de Gaulle himself his flexibility, his opposition to &quot; institutions&quot;, hisemphasis upon consolidating the general lines of policy without trying to legislate for the future and the present yawning gap between party and State.4. Dr. Thomson analyses de Gaulle&apos;s foreign policy in terms familiar to us from Sir Pierson Dixon&apos;s despatches, the central strand being the quest for&quot; independence &quot;. He quotes a particularly revealing passage from de Gaulle&apos;smemoirs about the role of Europe as a Third Force (page 26) and describes thevalue of the nuclear force de frappe as a &quot; detonator &quot;, not as an independentstrategic striking force. In matters affecting the Colonial and under-developed countries, de Gaulle&apos;s outlook is genuinely idealist. His foreign policy as a wholeis a blend of Realpolitik and empiricism. The phrase &quot; Atlantic to the Urals &quot;does not, in Dr. Thomson&apos;s opinion, have any precise meaning.5. As regards the future, Dr. Thomson discusses the various possibilities inunderstandably cautious terms. He thinks it probable that de Gaulle will die inharness. After his death there will be no willing relinquishment of power by theGaullist &quot; notables &quot;, and someone may try to inherit his mantle. This, however,will result in less flexibility and a degree of political polarisation so that at some stage possibly in the election after next there may be a swing back in the opposite, i.e., Leftist, direction. At the same time, the effects of five plus more years of de Gaulle&apos;s own regime must be taken into account, and it is possible thatthese will be so deep and lasting as to transform French political life and resultin the formation of an entirely new pattern, revolving round the technocrats.Meanwhile, de Gaulle can be expected to promote his various designs asvigorously as possible, especially his foreign policy designs after the death of president Kennedy (page 34). The student of French policy must therefore keep under continuous examination the nature of the relation between the &quot; structural &quot;changes already occurring and foreseeable in French life, political, economic and social, and the &quot; conjunctural &quot; changes brought about by changes in the world situation as a whole-American-Soviet and Soviet-Chinese relations, internationalcrises, the imponderables of the Kennedy Round, etc. It should also be rememberedthat de Gaulle likes springing surprises. Dr. Thomson concludes with some briefcomments about President de Gaulle&apos;s attitude towards Franco-British andFranco-German relations, which he regards as essentially empirical.

GAULLISMI-HEREDITYWhen studying France, where the past so often weighs heavy on the presentand events are liable to form strangely repetitive patterns, it is tempting to assume that everything has distant origins. The history of France after 1789 especiallyencourages an expectation that patterns will recur. The names of successive regimeshave nostalgic echoes: the Restored Monarchy, the Second Republic, the SecondEmpire. The numbering of Republics, having reached the Fifth, seems potentiallyendless. Moreover General de Gaulle has an acute sense of history, and it is reasonable to suppose that his frequent references to past glories, victories andeven errors reflect a desire to claim deep historic roots.As a young native of Lille living in Paris, nothing struck me more thanthe symbols of our glories: night falling over Notre Dame, the majesty ofevening at Versailles, the Arc de Triomphe in the sun, conquered coloursshuddering in the vaults of the Invalides ... As an adolescent, the fate ofFrance, whether as the subject of history or as the stake in public life,interested me above everything^1)Friends and critics alike have delighted to affix to Gaullism conventional labels.De Gaulle himself evoked the mystique of St. Joan when he accepted as symbolthe Cross of Lorraine. His opponents have variously seen him as an exponent ofLouis XIVs absolutism (UEtat c&apos;est Moi), of neo-Bonapartism (with its cult ofmilitary glory, national prestige and plebiscites), of boulangism (combining nationalself-assertiveness with demands for constitutional revision), and even of Fascism(exploiting popular fears of Communism and chauvinistic resentments).The prerequisite for a realistic analysis of Gaullism is to break free from thispresupposition of distant origins. There is, in a sense, no Gaullism of history onlya gaullisme de nos jours. It is almost entirely a product of the years since 1940.More profound understanding of it, and of its probable future, can best be gainednot from fanciful quests for long-term historical origins but from closer scrutiny of its genesis since 1940 and of the manner of its development, in opposition and in power, since 1945. Gaullism should be seen not as a modern variant of old familiarthings such as strong monarchy, Bonapartist dictatorship or boulangist nationalism,but as sui generis, a special and highly significant product of the mid-20th century,demanding fresh efforts of comprehension if it is not to remain merely paradoxical,puzzling and unpredictable.Certain ingredients of Gaullism, such as the ideas and personal modes of thought of de Gaulle himself, or the attitudes of individuals and the expectationsof social groups that have rallied behind Gaullist banners since 1940, may indeedhave longer ancestries. The contribution of these ingredients to the eventualcomposite phenomenon now loosely called Gaullism will be examined in this paper, and one of its central theses is that Gaullism is explicable only in terms ofthe coming together since 1940 of specific events, conditions, personalities andideas. The kind of &quot; historical&quot; interpretation which seeks earlier parallels oranalogies for recent events without establishing direct continuities is toounsophisticated to be very useful, and can be positively misleading.The General&apos;s cult of historical allusions is, however, one clue to a significantcharacteristic of Gaullism: its mood of defiance and dissent, of repudiation ofthe immediate past and even of the present in favour of a romanticised remoterpast and of the future. As Edmond Michelet put it, de Gaulle is &quot; un homme d&apos;avant-hier et d&apos;apres demain &quot;. In a sense he seeks to short-circuit both the era of relative(x) Charles de Gaulle, Memoires de Guerre (3 vols., 1954-59), Vol. I, pp. 1-2. This work is hereafterreferred to simply as Memoires. Quotations from it in English are normally taken from the Englishversions published by Collins (Vol. I, 1955, 2 vols.), and by Weidenfeld and Nicolson (Vol. 11, 1959,2 vols., and Vol. Ill, I960, 2 vols.), but have been occasionally amended to make them closer inmeaning to the original.
decline which France experienced during the 100 years before 1950, and the difficultpresent, and to link the future destinies of France direct to its more glorious past.Because Gaullism is a complex and not a simple phenomenon, and because it is still fluid enough to assume novel features in new circumstances, it is easier to describe than to define. An analysis of it will be attempted below. It is in some respects ill-defined because it is still evolving. A semantic analysis might be made,which would reveal the echoing undertones of nationalism involved in the veryname of &quot; Gaulle &quot;, and the undoubted fact that there were Gaullists before therewas Gaullism. Admiral Leahy, President Roosevelt&apos;s Ambassador at Vichy, wroteof mid-1941:At this time there was still no indication in occupied France that the self-styled &quot; leader of French resistance&quot; had any important numericalfollowing. There was a group who called themselves &quot; Gaullists &quot;. They wereFrench, apparently attaching to themselves the ancient name of France, butthey were not &quot; de Gaullists &quot;.It is evident from his book that the Admiral was by no means well informed about what went on in France, but this distinction he made had reality in 1941.0) the concept of a &quot; Gaullism &quot; which meant more than resistance to the Germans and toVichy, and which could be identified with an organised theory of government anda coherent set of policies, arrived very late on the scene. It needed the arrival ofCharles de Gaulle and the U.N.R. in the seats of power in 1958 to precipitate thatcoming together of hitherto disparate elements which made &quot; Gaullism &quot; oneidentifiable phenomenon. Even then the word was not widely used until the 1960s,when the atmosphere of temporary emergency dispersed and left behind it something that looked more durable and more definable.It is a central thesis of this paper that the essence of Gaullism, as a movement and as an ideology, is the ambivalence it derived from its fluctuations of fortunebetween 1940 and 1958. Before he withdrew from office in January 1946 general de Gaulle had come to be associated mainly with ideas, movements and parties ofthe Left. As the symbol of internal resistance movements, as the first national leaderto admit any Communists to ministerial power, as head of a Leftist coalition, hecould not escape the aura of Leftism. After his formation, in April 1947, of theRassemblement du Peuple Frangais (R.P.F.) and its highly opportunistic exploitingof anti-parliamentary and anti-Communist fears, Gaullism could reasonably beregarded as having turned itself into a movement of the Right. It had some backingeven from men of the extreme Right. This reputation was to win for de Gaullethe support of the extremist army leaders and the Algerian colons in 1958. It wasthe inconsistent expectations of both Right and Left which gave him his secondopportunity to serve as the saviour of France. It was, significantly enough, not long before the Right were complaining bitterly of having been &quot; betrayed &quot; by theliberal policies he pursued in French Africa and especially in Algeria, whilst the left, which had opposed the extensive powers accorded to the president of the fifth Republic, were grateful to them for affording protection against attemptedcoups in Algiers and the threat of paratrooper dictatorship in France. His ownconcern, throughout, was to symbolise and preserve national unity despite themore extreme elements of either wing.Gaullism as analysed in this paper will be taken to mean the end product ofthis complex evolution, and as the phenomenon which carries within it all theambivalences and inner tensions of a curiously paradoxical history. Just as thisunconventional many-sidedness is one source of its strength, for men of all shades of political opinion can find in it something to attract their support, so it could alsobecome a major source of weakness, for a movement that seems to be all things to all men may cease to command the loyalty of any.(2) It is unlikely, however, thatthis transformation of strength into weakness will occur while Charles de Gaulleremains at its head. There is a sense in which his active continuance in power is indispensable for the cohesion of the whole movement: though it could also be true that, after being long enough in power, it might acquire cohesion and impetusC1) Admiral W. D. Leahy, / Was There (1950), p. 56.(2) The political ambiguities of Gaullism are perfectly epitomised by the brilliant cartoon ofJacques Fagzant in Fiancoise Parturier&apos;s skit, Marianne rrCa dit (1963). It depicts de Gaulle doing thetwist with Marianne &quot; Pour garder 1&apos;equilibre: un coup a gauche, un coup a droite . . . il ne part paset continue a danser le twist . . . meme tout seul, au besoin &quot;.
enough of its own to remain an important force in French life for some considerable time after his departure. This ultimate assessment of Gaullism will form the culmination of the present analysis (Section VI below).Gaullism was born of one momentous act of insurrection. In June 1940 alittle-known junior ex-Minister, after only 10 days in office, flew to a foreign capital and raised the standard of revolt against the decision of the new French Governmentto seek an armistice with Germany. The fervour with which the Free French tried to prove that the Vichy Government of Marshal Petain was illegitimate andusurping, when formal legitimacy was the weakest conceivable ground on which to take their own stand, revealed a passionate need for some source of authority.Such a source could not, in the nature of things, be found until after liberation.Then it inevitably took the form of endorsement and acceptance by the wholenation of General de Gaulle&apos;s measures and proposals. In preparation for thisindispensable confirmation, the Free French had meantime taken a stand onindigenous Jacobin republican traditions and doctrines: sovereignty of the people,and the French Revolutionary ideals, supplemented by such demands for a &quot; moresocial democracy &quot; as were embodied in the &quot; Resistance Charter &quot; of 1944.(1)Gaullism has never been able, nor has its leader seriously tried, to repudiate or livedown its revolutionary origins. Reinforced from the support accorded to theFighting French by the internal resistance movements and the mystique whichthey engendered, its revolutionary origins have probably remained the mostimportant wellspring of its energies.Before 1940 de Gaulle had had a moderately distinguished military career.By his writings and by his semi-political activities he had acquired a certainreputation as a critic of the official strategy and policy for national defence. He hadcontended for a strategy of greater mobility .and attacking-power, based on theuse of mechanised armoured forces. He had found no influential support in french military circles and political backing only from M. Paul Reynaud. In retrospect his military theories were to prove wise, though it seems true that he failed to appreciate the new role of air power in combination with motorised columns, as it was evolvedby the German strategists. He remained, however, a figure of no national eminenceuntil Reynaud, on 6th June, 1940, confronted with invasion, summoned him toserve as Under-Secretary of State for War. Had Reynaud&apos;s efforts to win officialattention for de gaulle&apos;s arguments borne fruit earlier, or had de Gaulle assumedpublic office considerably sooner, there might indeed have been a pre-1940&quot; Gaullism &quot; of some historical importance. There was none.Even after de Gaulle&apos;s historic flight to London on 17th June, and hisinsurrectionary radio appeal of 18th June, the whole future of the young generalcould still have been altered profoundly by one circumstance, and that a mostprobable one: the arrival in London of any one military or political leader ofeminence such as President Lebrun or the Presidents of the Chambers. Jeanneneyand Herriot; Reynaud (who had resigned on 16th June) or Leon Blum; or evenGeneral Weygand (whom de Gaulle actually approached on 20th June.(2) The promptarrival of any one such figure to assume political leadership would presumably have left de Gaulle with at most a purely military authority. Whatever schisms mightthereafter have occurred within the Free French, General de Gaulle&apos;s lonelyeminence and much of his personal mystique would surely have been destroyed.The defiant gesture of de Gaulle on 18th June was much more than a patrioticrefusal to accept defeat. It was an act of military subordination, for since Reynaud&apos;resignation his former Under-Secretary had been a mere professional soldier underthe command of his military superiors, Weygand and Petain. It was also an act ofpolitical insurrection, for it involved inciting other French soldiers and citizensto join in acts of disobedience to the existing French Government. A military court(x) The present writer has previously discussed the revolutionary tradition and its strength in french politics, including the significance of the Resistance Charter of 1944. See Democracy inFrance: The Third and Fourth Republics (1958), pp. 9-38, 299-301.(2) Memoires, Vol. I, p. 269. It was striking that no other member of the Reynaud government appeared in London, and a premier less impulsive than Churchill might not have been ready to grantde Gaulle recognition as le Chef des Frangais Libres as early as 28th June, 1940. But from these strangecircumstances all else followed. The astonishing incident of the proposal for complete Anglo-FrenchUnion in which de Gaulle took a crucial part only a few days before may explain Churchill&apos;s readiness to accept de Gaulle.
at Clermont Ferrand sentenced him to military degradation and death for desertionin time of war and for acts of treason against the State. Henceforth there could beno compromise with Vichy-OAt first, in his radio speeches, the General had been very cautious in his choice of epithets about Petain and the other men of Vichy. He had even referred to &quot; theFrench Government&quot;. After its conclusion of the armistice (22nd June) and theacts (10th July) by which the National Assembly conferred emergency powers onPetain, he increasingly referred to them as le soi-disant gouvernement de Vichy(22nd August) and as downright traitors.(2) The spectre of a dual sovereignty,reminiscent of the anti-Popes, haunted the rest of his career until he could claim the formal endorsement of free popular choice in 1944. The urge to secure a seriesof interim endorsements of the legitimacy of his claims led to such devices as theConseil de Defense de 1&apos;Empire (27th October, 1940) and the erection of the ComiteNational Frangais (23rd September, 1941). Announcing the latter de Gaulle said:Nous sommes done obliges d&apos;improviser une autorite de fait que nousdetenons en notre qualite de gerants provisoires du patrimoine national. Cetteautorite est une sorte de delegation interimaire de la nation, que nous exerconsprovisoirement et que nous remettrons a la representation nationale des qu&apos;ilaura ete possible d&apos;en constituer une.(3)Some of his colleagues, being less concerned with the quest for legitimatesovereignty than with the immediate tasks of fighting Germans, were correspondinglyready to see some validity in Vichy. Vice-Admiral Muselier in March 1942 resignedfrom the post of National Commissioner for the Navy in the French national committee because of violent quarrels with de Gaulle. He tended to regard&quot; Gaullism &quot; as a mystique of national resistance transcending the personality of de Gaulle: as witness the very title of Muselier&apos;s book, published in 1946, De Gaullecontre le Gaullisme.The urge to find an irrefrangible basis of authority and to counter any chargeof usurping power led the Free French leader into a long series of further measures:especially his close alliance with internal resistance organisations which led him onthrough co-operation in the National Council of Resistance (June 1942), the french committee of National Liberation (June 1943), and creation of the ProvisionalConsultative Assembly in Algiers (November 1943) to the Provisional Governmentof 1944. The quest for the Holy Grail of legitimate sovereignty not only mouldedmuch of the character of Gaullism during and immediately after the war. It left itsmark in an affection for dramatic bestowals of popular confidence throughreferenda, direct presidential elections, and systematic tours of the provinces. Bylinking Gaullism to Leftist movements it saved it from becoming after 1947exclusively a Right-wing movement.The Gaullism that attained power in 1958 was moulded by the whole sequence of events between 1940 and 1958. But already by the end of 1940 it contained aninescapable genetic inheritance. Three essential elements were so derived.(1) It pre-supposes moments of supreme national crisis, in which the nationfaces humiliation and the State collapse.(2) It postulates the emergence of a &quot; saviour &quot;, defying despair and evadingcollapse by rallying the nation to action, evoking fresh energies byinterplay between his own personality and the community as a whole.(3) It invites the nation to an act of faith of faith in itself as well as confidence in the new leadership. It thus moves beyond the usual calculations andrationalities of politics and appeals to a collective consciousness.These three elements recurred most strikingly in 1944 and in 1958. Gaullismhas remained throughout a product and beneficiary of national crisis; it is activist(x) The sentence is reprinted in the English version of Alfred Fabre-Luce, The Trial of Charles de gaulle (1963), Appendix A.(z) Discours et Messages du General de Gaulle (18 Juin, 1940-31 Decembre, 1941), 1942, whereinthe shift of vocabulary and the hardening of attitude can be interestingly traced. Rene Cassin stated the Free French case for Vichy being illegitimate in Un Coup d&apos;Etat: La soi-disant Constitution deVichy (1941), but the technical arguments were flimsy.(3) Discours et Messages, p. 69.
^and messianic; and it is part of a larger psychological change in French life.0^Despite its fluctuations of fortune, Gaullism has played a continuous andpre-eminent part in French life for nearly a quarter of a century. Any assessment of its strength, impetus and durability must, therefore, start from a presuppositionthat it is likely to remain of some importance in France for some years to come,even should General de Gaulle himself leave the stage and original circumstancescease to prevail.The impact of his personality and his ideas has been accentuated byremarkable repetition. Even in France, where so many things happen twice, he hashad a unique experience. He served as both the midwife and the gravedigger oftwo Republics; he was twice given an opportunity to establish himself in dictatorialpower and twice he refused to take it; he twice had to disarm former supportersto re-establish law and order; he twice remodelled the whole relationship betweenmetropolitan and overseas France. If the history of Gaullism does not repeatprevious history, it undoubtedly repeats itself. It may be that this internallyrecurrent pattern offers further clues to sharper definition and understanding.The only significant historical parallels to Gaullism are the appeals ofLeon Gambetta in 1870 and of Georges Clemenceau in 1917. On both theseoccasions the three essential elements of Gaullism were also present. Both, verysignificantly, fall within neither the monarchical nor the Bonapartist traditions.They fall completely within the republican tradition of Jacobin nationalism thenation in danger, la guerre a entrance, the Republic at bay. There is no evidencethat the General thinks in other than resolutely republican terms, even when hemost trenchantly criticises parliamentary forms of republicanism. Suggestionsmuch canvassed during 1963, that he was grooming the Comte de Paris as his ownsuccessor, had no ring of truth and little of verisimilitude.(2) More significant is his often-repeated homage to the memory of Georges Clemenceau: the message of armistice-day 1941, addressed to Clemenceau; the recurrent references to him.in speeches and the Memoires, as the model of a leader of national resistance; thegenerous gesture to Winston Churchill in November 19440; the curious incidentof the first anniversary of victory in May 1946, when de Gaulle absented himself from the big parade to visit the tomb of Clemenceau at Mouchamps and to paysilent and solitary tribute to the other Pere la Victoire who had also been discardedby an ungrateful country. Such homage from a devout Roman Catholic to anotorious anti-clerical patriot is some measure of how much, for de Gaulle,nationalism outweighs religion.For ail these reasons the bedrock of Gaullism is nationalism. Much of the popular appeal of Gaullism in France of the 1960s is that it chimes very closely with a certain mood, compounded of relief at escape from shattering nationalcrises, jubilation at finding the nation resilient and expansive, fear of any reversion to the circumstances which bred disaster. It is a republican nationalism, stronglyfortified with the heady spirit of popular sovereignty and heroic leadership. InCharles de Gaulle&apos;s unique ability to appeal to the people over the heads of allinstitutions, parties and even sectional interests lies his capacity to command thisstrange dynamic force. His success rests upon certain techniques which he haspersonally perfected the radio appeal, the television appearance, the press conference, the provincial tour. He has hit upon, adopted and perfected thesetechniques because of his experience between 1940 and 1958. In any eventualO It might be regarded as involving, necessarily, a fourth element too: a satanic enemy to match the messianic saviour. Thus the issue of the legitimacy of Vichy in 1944 was settled, in the secondvolume of the Memoires, by the argument (about Petain) that &quot; the legitimacy which he claimed to embody was denied absolutely by the Government of the Republic, not so much because he had oncereceived the abdication of a hysterical parliament as because he had accepted the enslavement of France,practised official collaboration with the invader and ordered armed opposition to the French and allied soldiers of the liberation. Not for a single day had he allowed his countrymen to fire on theGermans&quot;. (Vol. II, p. 321). There follows the sublime remark: &quot;no French Government couldbe legitimate when it has ceased to be independent&quot;. The corresponding satanic elements were theGermans in 1940, the Communists in 1947, and the men of the Systeme in 1958.(2) The most elaborate exposition of the thesis was that by Jean Ferniot in VExpress (23 May, 1963),and that was contrived and unconvincing.(3) &quot; The Prime Minister laid a bouquet at the foot of Clemenceau&apos;s statue while, on my orders,the band played Le Pere la Victoire &apos; For you !&apos;, I said to him in English. And it was only hisdue &quot;. (Memoires, Vol. Ill, p. 49). See also Discours et Messages (1942), p. 92; Memoires, Vol. II,p. 313; and, in general, his propensity to include Clemenceau in his enumerations of heroes andsaviours of France alongside Joan of Arc, Carnot, Gambetta and Foch.
assessment of Gaullism these years will appear as years of apprenticeship to *politics and statecraft. Even his interludes of high authority as the leader of thewFree French or the Head of the Provisional Governments, when his exercise of power had immediate effects, may be seen in retrospect as contributions to the eventual total situation which gave rise to modern &quot; Gaullism &quot; after 1958.The development of Gaullism between 1940 and 1958 falls naturally into three main phases:(1) The struggle for recognition as the voice of France, involving increasinglyclose contacts with internal resistance movements and complexrelationships with the belligerent allies. This phase, which culminatedin liberation and the Provisional Government of 1944, was essentiallyrevolutionary, with strong Leftist associations but equally strongnationalist republican overtones.(2) The phase of Provisional Government itself, during which de Gaulle andhis Ministers (drawn from the three Left-wing parties of the communists, Socialists and M.R.P.) worked in conjunction with the newly-elected (first) Constituent Assembly and won recognition for france among the major Powers of the post-war world. This phaseended abruptly with his retirement in January 1946.(3) The era of opposition, 1946-58, including first the experiment of the R.P.F.and then the interlude of seclusion and reflection, when the Generalwrote his Memoires.Taken together, these three consecutive phases constitute a varied andstrenuous preparation for eventual power. They were a hard school, in bothdomestic and external politics, teaching lessons that were fully learned. The first two of them were Leftist in associations, the third Rightist, but all were in spiritdefiant, revolutionary, republican and nationalistic. The man who came to power in 1958 was no mere &quot; soldier in politics &quot;, certainly no amateur politician. Healready had wide experience of governmental power and of top-level diplomacy;and his philosophy of political action, as well as his perception of French nationalconditions, had been matured and made ready for use. His exercise of almostabsolute power for the last six months of 1958 was a fitting prelude to the highpresidential authority he was to wield under the Fifth Republic.II-ENVIRONMENTFor at least two generations before 1940 there had been laments about signsof decline or stagnation in France. For the last 20 years or so, there has beenaccumulating evidence that French society has turned a sharp corner and isembarked upon a new phase of speedier growth and enrichment. The decades ofthis change happen to have coincided with the development of Gaullism, whichderives thereby many uncovenanted benefits. Yet in one or two specific ways itdeserves some of the credit, and this undeniable partial connection betweenGaullist leadership and the happier fortunes of France has bearing on the durabilityof Gaullist popularity even after de Gaulle.Throughout the whole first half of the 20th century France as a nation livedunder a cloud of war and the risk of defeat. The devastations of two world warsin which France was a major participant and her soil a battlefield need not belisted here. More relevant are the long-term tendencies to a stagnation or declinein population, in the national economy, and in the system of government. these three trends, in combination, brought France of the forties to the verge of collapse.France in the time of Napoleon had a population larger than that of any other european Power except Russia. During the following century it increased only very slowly at a time when the population of France&apos;s neighbours grew exceptionallyfast. France was overtaken by the new Bismarckian Reich about 1870 (as wellas by the United States), by the United Kingdom about 1900, by Italy about 1930.
The European Powers, and indeed the preponderance of power in Europe, &quot; grewaway &quot; from France. The French economy reflected similar tendencies to slowdown in its growth and to cling to traditional units and modes of productionwhen her larger neighbours were enthusiastically developing new industries andnew technologies. In politics, too, old issues continued to hold the stage and the chronic Ministerial instability of the Third and Fourth Republics prevented firmgovernment and the execution of coherent, long-term policies. These three trends,together with the consequences of the First World War, fostered a fretful,backward-looking, defensive kind of nationalism. French foreign policy wasobsessed with the aim of security, French military strategy with the doctrines ofstatic defence. The &quot; Maginot Line mentality &quot; extended far beyond purely military matters. The appeasement of the later 1930s was challenged much less in Francethan in Britain, and in many ways French reactions to world crises were thoseof a frightened and enervated people.After liberation came a new upsurge of vitality. In a highly dramatic wayall three trends were abruptly reversed. The birth-rate rose and it became normalto have larger families. During the 1930s deaths each year had exceeded birthsby 20,000. During the 1950s births each year exceeded deaths by some 300,000.The rate of natural increase per thousand inhabitants per annum varied between  and 7. This had familiar social effects on schooling, housing, and the labour market. France became a nation of children and acquired the spirit and outlookof a young and virile people. The French economy, despite the immensedislocations and destructions of the occupation and the liberation, enjoyed speedyrecovery with the support of Marshall Aid, concerted national effort, and theMonnet Plans. Productivity increased as farming became more mechanised and scientific. The standard of living rose fast if unevenly. Political improvements were more sporadic yet quite real. The Provisional Governments ruled with strengthof purpose and to massive effect. Even the much-abused Ministries of the FourthRepublic were strong enough to survive the joint Communist and Rightistonslaughts, and kept Communism at bay without selling out to the anti-CommunistRight. But by 1958 it had become apparent that the immobilisme of parliamentary government was endemic, and that social and economic advance were not yetmatched by any corresponding strengthening of the political and governmentalsystem. The Fourth Republic, men said, was dead, and had given way to the Third.This lag of politics behind economics bred a mood of impatience and especially as regards the war in Algeria exasperation. This mood was the essential condition for the sequence of events in May 1958 which brought de Gaulle outof retirement to become, for yet a third time, the &quot; saviour of France &quot;.C)General de Gaulle was the man of the hour because he spoke as no othercould to the condition of the French people, both material and psychological.He had no conceivable rival. In a remarkably complete way he representedopposition to the long era of weakness and decadence in France. He had opposedboth the strategy and the defence policy of the Maginot Line. He had spurned theacceptance of defeat in 1940, opposing alike the armistice, the policy of collaboration, and even the tendencies of attentisme. He had condemned theschisms and manoeuvres of political parties and the system of gouvernementd&apos;assemblee which had favoured the mediocre and the indecisive. By the sametoken he was closely associated with the forces of revival and uplift of spirit which France had experienced since liberation. He symbolised resistance, liberation,reconstruction, return to the circle of the great Powers, forceful and successfulleadership. He had so consistently voiced a spirit of national identity and self-assertion that men of the most contrary political affiliations and aspirations could resonably expect him to serve their views. In the manner of Thiers in 1870, ofClemenceau in 1917, he held in fee the hopes and confidence of men whoseonly common ground was agreement to his accession to power at that time.To attribute the success of de Gaulle in 1958 to his status as a symbol ofnational revival and national unity would not, in itself, be to carry the argumentvery far. What is significant for the future development of Gaullism is, rather,the co-existence of this fact with his capacity, already noted, to attract partisansupport from opposing political camps.(!)

0) The elections of October 1945, produced a Constituent Assembly in which roughly four-fifths of its 586 seats were shared, almost equally, between the three well-organised parties of the Communists,Socialists, and M.R.P. This made it imperative for de Gaulle to include in his new Ministry equal numbers from all three parties, along with a leaven of more Centrist or non-party men. The factthat Communists held Ministerial posts for nearly three years continuously after liberation dominatedthe whole political scene.(2) Memoires, Vol. Ill, p. 643.In any form of national leadership there must always be a subtle yet )important difference between a leader (or a coalition Government) which is all-party and one which is non-party. An all-party combination like the Britishwartime Cabinet headed by Winston Churchill meant a sinking of partydifferences in one immediate common task-winning the war against the Axisand Japan. Such a combination can be reinforced by non-party men as expertsor &quot; technicians &quot;, or it can be modified into a multi-party combination which,though excluding marginal groups, represents a wide arc of the whole politicalhemicycle. But in all its forms it differs in character and in operation from anon-party Government. A Government formed in defiance of all parties, andomitting them as such, must aim at splitting them, attracting members as individuals and not as party men, and must normally rely very heavily on non-political figures drawn from the public services, the professions or frombusiness and industry.The original appeal of Charles de Gaulle in June 1940, was of this secondkind: above and apart from all party loyalties, it was addressed to all Frenchmen and women who were able and willing to support him in carrying on thewar against Germany and Italy no matter what the men of Vichy might do orcommand. The organised Resistance, by 1944, had come to be a mixture of partymovements and non-party movements, with a tendency for the Left-wing party organisations and certain trade unions to win the ascendancy. By liberationthe composite forces of &quot; Gaullism &quot; were this same mixture: and, after theelections to the first Constituent Assembly, the Provisional Government which general de Gaulle led was very largely an all-party coalition that was stronglyLeftist in character^1)It was thus the course of events, rather than free choice or intent, thatturned de Gaulle into the leader of an all-party construction in 1945. The great difficulties he encountered, the demonstration that his temperament and modeof working were ill-fitted to such a medium, and above all his growing conviction that the Communist Party was opposed to French national interests, did muchto bring about his dramatic withdrawal from a position of power in January1946. In his formal letter of resignation, dated 20 January, he declared: &quot;Ialways bore in mind that my task would be finished as soon as the representativesof the nation had been elected and the political parties were in a position totake up their responsibilities. . . . The period of transition is now over. France,after immense trials, is no longer in danger.&quot; But in his more crucial statement to the Constituent Assembly on 31 December, 1945, he struck a different andmore ominous note:We have started to rebuild the Republic. You will carry on the goodwork. However you carry this out after me and I tell you this from the heart, for this is without doubt the last time I shall address you in thisChamber if you do not take into account the lessons learnt in the last50 years of our political history and in particular what happened in 1940,and if you fail to take note of the absolute necessity for authority, dignity and responsibility on the part of the Government, I predict that one dayyou will find yourselves in a situation that will make you bitterly regretthe road you have chosen.(2)It was experience that the all-party combination did not rest on asubordination of party interests to national, and was indeed regarded by the communists as merely a good chance to &quot; colonise &quot; important departments ofadministration with their own supporters, which brought about his strongrevulsion. If this was the indispensable medium of government, he decided, itwas not for him. The discovery that the Constituent Assembly, so rent alongparty lines, was preparing for France a Constitution which would perpetuatethe same kind of situation, forced him into active opposition and led to his
campaign against the second draft Constitution. The campaign succeeded inmaximising the number of abstentions, if not of direct negative votes, so thatthe Constitution of the Fourth Republic was approved by an actual minority of the whole electorate. Encouraged to hope that he might, even yet, find a newmedium of political action within the weak Republic, de Gaulle sponsored theR.P.F. and embarked upon the third phase of his political career prior to 1958.The main point about the R.P.F. was supposed to be that it was not apolitical party at all it was a patriotic non-party rassemblement to fight andovercome all parties. On this ticket it won its spectacular electoral successes inthe municipal elections of October 1947, and the parliamentary elections ofJune 1951. But in the process it changed its character considerably. The moreit became an organisation adapted for winning power by electoral proceduresthe more it became merely another political party and therefore useless for theGeneraTs intrinsic purpose. &quot; The R.P.F. was established in the first place as a movement to revise the Constitution (which remains one of its primary purposes).But instead of a rally comprising members of all parties and working for oneessential but limited objective, it became a disciplined movement seeking power,a new party in everything but name/V)Thus the R.P.F. began as a &quot; nationalist movement&quot; in the sense that itset out to achieve national objectives and serve national interests over the headsof the squabbling political parties. It became, within a few years, a &quot; nationalistmovement&quot; in the very different sense of a political party dedicated to thetraditionally conservative aims of French nationalistic parties: authoritariangovernment, strong administration, resistance to social revolution, self-assertionabroad. When it became evident that it had undergone this sea-change general de Gaulle renounced it and dissolved it as a parliamentary organisation. Itquickly disintegrated.It seems probable that the GeneraFs successive experiences of a non-partyResistance movement which turned into an all-party Leftist coalition in 1945, andof a non-party Rassemblement which turned itself into a schism-ridden Rightistpolitical party by 1953, made him resolve to keep aloof in future from any onepolitical combination or organisation. It is the main historical reason why he refusedeven the successful U.N.R. of 1958 his open sponsorship, and why in constructinghis Governments (e.g., in 1962) he preferred a mixture of both party men and non-party &quot; technicians &quot; to a Cabinet drawn exclusively from the devoted membersof the U.N.R. majority in the Assembly. One recalls the phrase used of LordChatham by Edmund Burke, that he wanted &quot; to keep hovering in air, over all parties, and to souse down where the prey may prove best &quot;. President de Gaulle&apos;conduct of government under the Fifth Republic was shaped by his experience ofthe previous 20 years: and the character of Gaullism was correspondingly affected.Meanwhile, too, the substance and reputation of Gaullism had been stronglyaffected by the political complexion of the supporters and social interests attractedto the advancing bandwaggon of the Rassemblement. This raises two important issues: what sorts of people have become Gaullists, and how have they been organised?Ill-ANATOMYOrganisation has never been the most important feature of Gaullism: its spiritor mood and its deep personal appeal to sentiment have always been moreimportant. But structure and forms of organisation may be conveniently consideredfirst.Because of its origins and its spontaneity, its earliest forms were peculiarlyfluid and personal and left a permanent mark on subsequent organisations. its first formal constitution was set out in the Memorandum that came into force on1st July, 1940. It embodied the agreement between Churchill and de Gaulle on the(J) Philip Williams, Politics in Post-War France (1954), p. 134; this work, together with FrancoisGoguel&apos;s France under the Fourth Republic (1952), provides the clearest account in English of theplace of the R.P.F. in French politics. See also below, Section III, for its composition.
organisation, employment and conditions of service of the French volunteer force.Already, however, de Gaulle had formed a Committee notified to the BritishGovernment on 26th June.C) Among those who rallied to the call in these earliestdays were several of the Compagnons who were to play a continuous role in the subsequent organisation and fortunes of Gaullism. They included Geoffroyde Courcel who accompanied de Gaulle in the aircraft on 17th. June as hisaide-de-camp, Gaston Palewski, Maurice Dejean, Christian Fouchet and MauriceSchumann. Those five are surely the General&apos;s most devoted disciples. Theyincluded activists like Andre Dewavrin (&quot; Colonel Passy &quot;) and Gilbert Renault(&quot; Colonel Remy &quot;), and service chiefs such as Admiral Thierry-d&apos;Argenlieu andGeneral Fourquet. They comprised a few who sooner or later broke away fromGaullism Admiral Muselier, the Socialist Protestant Andre Philip, the futurePremier Rene Pleven, and the dynamic Jacques Soustelle. The original small bandof Compagnons was backed by leaders of internal resistance who later rallied toGaullism and brought to it some of its most forceful supporters: Rene Capitant,Jacques Chaban-Delmas, Louis Joxe and Edmond Michelet. Others joined laterforms of the Gaullist movement, notably Andre Malraux, Michel Debre, LeonDelbecque, Leon Noel. The ranks of Gaullism have always divided into an innercore of continuity and devotion and more fluctuating outer rings. For this veryreason the highest Gaullist virtue is fidelity. There lingers about the original fewwho have remained faithful an aura of special virtue; for those who have disloyallyleft or have &quot; betrayed &quot; the cause there is stern anathema. The many vicissitudesof the movement between 1940 and 1958, and the variety of different political formsit assumed, made loyalty the quality most prized among its adherents.(2)The great diversity of forms of organisation within which Gaullism took shapeis more significant than the details of any one form. The feature common to the mall is their political character. Any image of an initially military organisationbecoming unexpectedly political is mistaken. From the outset, the Free french committee was devised as a de facto substitute for the non-existent governmentin exile; and as early as August 1940, when French Equatorial Africa rallied tode Gaulle, the Committee became responsible for the administration of largeterritories, as well as of the volunteer fighting-force. It now had economic resourcesof its own. On 24th September, 1941, de Gaulle instituted the National Committee,consisting of &quot; Commissioners &quot; directing the different &quot; departments&quot; of free french activities.(3) He was its President, and appointed eight Commissioners. an eventual Consultative Assembly to yield &quot; as wide an expression of national opinon as possible&quot; was envisaged, though it was more than two years before thismaterialised. The National Committee met at least once a week at Carlton Gardens.No member, save de Gaulle, had held political office before. In May 1943 theNational Council of the Resistance came into being, to represent the unification of the many different internal resistance movements. By its support for de Gaulleit helped to determine his supremacy over General Giraud &quot;in the new french committee of National Liberation.Based on Algiers, this Committee formally claimed to &quot; exercise Frenchsovereignty&quot;.(&quot;) On 3rd June, 1944, it assumed the title of the &quot; ProvisionalGovernment of the French Republic &quot;.(&quot;) This Provisional Government collectivelyresigned on the 26th August, 1944, after liberation, and on 9th September de Gaulleannounced the formation of a broader-based Government comprising M. Jeanneneyand representatives of the resistance movements.(G) Its 21 Ministers included eightwho had just emerged from the Resistance. When de Gaulle propounded hispolicies to a mass meeting of supporters at the Palais de Chaillot on 12th September,he already, it seems, sensed the old unanimity leaking away. His reaction was significant for the whole future of Gaullism: &quot; More than ever, then, I had to seeksupport from the French people rather than from the &quot; elite &quot; groups which tendedQ Texts in Memoires, Vol. I, pp. 279-283 and 273-274. The GeneraPs comments on the firstCompagnons are in ibid., pp. 82-85.(2) Works especially informative about the structure and personalities of Gaullism are JacquesDebu-Bridel: Les Partis contre de Gaulle (1947): Andre Wurmser, De Gaulle et les siens (1947); PierreViansson-Ponte, Les Gaullistes: Rituel et Annuaire (1963).

to come between us. My popularity was like capital with which I could pay offthe disappointments that were inevitable among the ruins. To begin with, I would use it to establish the State&apos;s authority in the provinces as I had done in Paris.&quot;!1)This reaction at the very climax of political achievement and official recognitionhas great retrospective importance.m Gaullism, as conceived in 1940, had now &quot; arrived &quot;. Resembling a regularnational Government more completely than ever before, established in Paris (asPetain had never been) and enjoying diplomatic recognition, it might have been expected to satisfy Gaullism&apos;s immediate needs. But for the hero of crisis even this&quot; return to normalcy &quot; bred immediate misgivings and an urge to find fresh springsof popular support from direct contact with the people. This unease with regulargovernmental institutions and procedures was intensified by the experience, already mentioned, of heading the Provisional Governments and having to work with theConstituent Assembly. De Gaulle had no party of his own, and in handling thetripartisme of the time had to draw heavily on his personal popularity and prestige.He had to represent the nation in spite of the parties and over against the parties.He considered carrying out a coup d&apos;etat, and later repeatedly said so.(2) But herejected the idea and chose, instead, to retire from the scene to brood in histent. He wanted to preserve his personal magic intact, lest France should need it again.This second moment of need came, we now know, in May 1958. But meanwhile,swayed no doubt by the pleas of the Compagnons and reluctant to remain passivein crisis, de Gaulle made the greatest single error of judgment in his career. Hetried to seek direct contact with the people and yet to preserve intact his non-partynational status by means of the highly organised Rally of the French People(Rassemblement du Peuple Francois), or R.P.F.The General has always been reticent about this six-year interlude in his political career, and its precise origins remain obscure. It sprang from his attackon the regime of the parliamentary parties and on the type of Constitution whichthey were preparing for France. After the referendum of 5 May, 1946, had rejected the first draft Constitution, he made a speech at Bayeux on the anniversary of18 June. He put forward his own recipe of a stronger presidential Republic.Rene Capitant promptly formed a new Gaullist Union, to propagate this &quot; BayeuxConstitution &quot;, but de Gaulle refused to sponsor it and it made little headway.(3)On 7 April, 1947, at Strasbourg, he appealed to all Frenchmen to support a newnon-party movement, the Rassemblement, which was to reform the Constitution,fight Communism, and regenerate national life. The Gaullist Union merged into it.In the autumn it set up an &quot; inter-group &quot; in Parliament which deputies of all partiesexcept the Communists were invited to join. As the Socialists and most of theM.R.P. did not join, its parliamentary membership was predominantly Right wingand numbered only 80. In this way the new Rally quickly became, in effect, a newRight-wing group in Parliament, not the all-party national alignment which he hadenvisaged.General de Gaulle&apos;s association with the R.P.F. lasted some six years, andconstitutes one of the unhappiest and least inspiring episodes in his whole career.But it was a very revealing one. The decision to fight first the municipal elections of October 1947, then the cantonal elections of March 1949, converted it into a real political party which, moreover, polled just over 26 per cent of the total vote in 1949 as against 40 per cent in 1947. It won its greatest triumph in theparliamentary elections of June 1951, when it gained 120 seats. But the tide offortune turned sharply. It lost heavily in by-elections within the year. Repeateddissensions and splits within the party, followed by heavy losses in the municipalelection of May 1953 led the General to dissolve the Rally as an electoral and parliamentary organisation. The remaining Deputies, rechristened the Union desrepublicans et d&apos;action sociale (U.R.A.S.) survived as a regular group long enough for its leaders to claim a share in office.Who were these Gaullists? Apart from the small band of faithful personalfollowers, and some members of the M.R.P. who deserted their old party for thenew, they belonged to the other half of the political spectrum: to the social classes(^Memoires, Vol. Ill, p. 8; and see ibid. p. 287.(2) See references in P. M. Williams, op. cit., p. 17 (note) and Memoires, Vol. Ill, p. 239.(3) See Rene Capitant, Towards a Federal Constitution (1946). The Gaullist Union attracted only300,000 votes and won only six seats in the elections of November 1946.
and political groups which had not hitherto backed de Gaulle through Resistanceorganisations or as colleagues in the Provisional Government. They werepredominantly men of the old Right and the Right-Centre-including even somewho had supported or at least accepted the men of Vichy. It was the ironic fate of Gaullism, in its new guise, to be the vehicle by which many former Vichysympathisers found their way back into political activity. What safer and morerespectable aegis, after all, than that of the Hero of the Resistance himself? Themost eminent servant of Vichy who now became active in the R.P.F. was, perhaps,M. Leon Noel, President of the Constitutional Council. But a variety of businessmen,industrialists and service leaders found their way into it despite their formerPetainism. Its electoral supporters included a large number of well-to-do people who saw in the R.P.F. the best hope of a firmly conservative and authoritarianregime. Its vehement anti-Communism was, undoubtedly, a powerful attraction forthese people.() The same appeal, together with the attractions of any form ofactivism, brought to it Jean-Baptiste Biaggi, who had in turn supported the Actionfrancaise and Petain&apos;s Legion des Combattants, and the volatile Maxime Blocq-Mascart, founder of the resistance movement Organisation civile et militaire(O.C.M.).0The R.P.F. evolved an elaborate party organisation in the country. Its localunits were grouped into federations for each departement, and at the national levelan annual congress with a national council. Power was highly centralised in theexecutive committee over which de Gaulle, as President of the movement, hadcomplete control. Its imposition of discipline on members caused secessions andschisms. Parliamentarians not unnaturally resisted their exclusion from the policy-making organs of the movement, and in July 1952 30 rebels resigned in protest.By the time de Gaulle was prepared to relax his own control and allow greaterrepresentation of the rank and file, in November 1952, the Rassemblement was fastdisintegrating. It lacked natural unity of purpose or social cohesion: disciplineimposed from above was no substitute in so heterogeneous a body. At the end of1950 M. Jacques Fauvet estimated its total membership at about half a million.In the elections of June 1951 it won some 4J million votes and 120 seats, out of atotal vote of nearly 19 million votes for 627 seats. It seems likely that the rapidityof its rise to prominence, combined with its diverse support, prevented it frombuilding up from below an organisation with the toughness and resilience of the olderparties. It had something of the fragility of a forced hothouse plant.Many have already given social &quot; profiles &quot; and electoral sociological &quot; maps &quot;of the R.P.F. and only the salient features need be listed here.(3) It appealed toyouth, and at least its Parliamentary membership included a higher proportion of young men than most of its rivals. Rather more than half its voting supportprobably came from women, but this was no less true of the Conservatives ingeneral and of the M.R.P. Geographically it drew its main support from the traditional strongholds of the Right: the old Conservative west and east and the paris basin, nearly all north of the Loire, with very little support from the southern half of the country. In 1951 it won support from more than 20 per cent of thetotal electorate in 23 departements. In 21 of these, parties of the Right had gained30 per cent of the total in 1932. In addition it made heavy gains in the big cities,including Paris itself, and in these industrial areas its support seems to have been more Leftist. It attracted votes from the M.R.P. and the Radicals, at least before1949. This electoral basis helped to equip it with a policy of social reforms and state concern for social welfare and economic growth which did not chimecompletely with its strong conservatism. Internal leadership was throughoutpredominantly in the hands of professional men, civil servants, industrialists,engineers and &quot; technocrats &quot;. In this respect, particularly, the R.P.F. representedforward-looking forces expecting from the modern State a more positive policy,more vigorous action and greater efficiency in executing agreed measures. Thiswas to remain a highly influential element in the Gaullism of the future.(J) On the relevance of the R.P.F,. interlude to the relations between Gaullism and Communism,and on the affinities and continuities of other kinds between Vichy and Gaullism, see below, pp. 17-18.The hesitant and ambivalent attitudes of service chiefs are well expressed in such books as LucienGalimand, Vive Petain! Vive de Gaulle! (1948) and General Serrigny, Trente Am avec Petain (1959).(2) See M. Blocq-Mascart, Chroniques de la Resistance (1945).(3) F. Goguel, Geographic des elections fvancaises de 1870 a 1951 (1952); C. Moraze, Les Francoiset la Republique (1956); P. M. Williams, op. cit., pp. 416-421; A. Werth, France, 1940-1955 (1956),pp. 362-421. Francois Mauriac later regarded the R.P.F. as &quot; the biggest mistake he ever made &quot;.
The relationship to the R.P.F. of former Vichyites, already noted, calls torcloser examination in determining the physiognomy of Gaullism. Even before theformation of the R.P.F. the possibility of some common links between Gaullismand Vichy had been from time to time given open expression. Admiral Leahyclaimed that as early as 1942 he had observed such similarities: &quot; Like Laval andDarlan, he thirsted for power. Although his political philosophy appeared to belittle different from that of the Government of&quot; Petain, when I arrived back in theUnited States in May, de Gaulle was the &quot; hero &quot; of the so-called Liberals &quot;.(&apos;)Before the war Marshal Petain and de Gaulle had had frequent contacts, bothrespectful and querulous. The highly-charged issues of epuration after liberation,and the political trials of Pierre Laval, Marshal Petain and others, exhaustedsomething of the wartime bitterness and left exposed some of the common bedrock.In April 1950 when &quot; Colonel Remy &quot; wrote in Canefour an article asserting thatthe Vichy shield had been as necessary for the survival of France as the Gaullistsword, and the Marshal should therefore be rehabilitated, he had to resign fromthe executive of the R.P.F. But the &quot; sword and buckler &quot; view had existed duringthe war, and many had believed that de Gaulle had a secret understanding withPetain to outwit both Germans and collaborators. The R.P.F. shifted its groundtowards a more lenient treatment of former Petainists and an end of futilerecriminations. Even Charles Maurras was released from prison on compassionate grounds. Former Vichy men became more daring and overt in their criticisms ofthe Fourth Republic.Besides these simple and explicable tokens of a new rapprochement betweenwartime antagonists, there were deeper evidences of something more resemblingcommon ground. At Vichy Marshal Petain had drafted a new Constitution, againstthe day when he should be free to proclaim it and so to fulfill the undertaking hehad implicitly given in July 1940, when the National Assembly entrusted to himpower &quot; with a view to promulgating, in one or more decrees, the new Constitutionof the French State. This Constitution should safeguard the rights of labour,family and fatherland.&quot; The draft, never in fact promulgated, bears quite remarkablesimilarities to the Fifth Republic^2)There is, in principle, a separation of legislative, governmental and judicial functions. The Head of State, who along with Ministers and Secretaries of Stateexercises governmental power, is elected for a 10-year Presidency by a national congress consisting of all &quot; les elus de la Nation et les delegues des collectivitesterritoriales qui la composent &quot;. His attributes are closely parallel to the Presidentialpowers of the Fifth Republic.II personnifie la Nation et a la charge de ses destinees. Arbitre desinterets superieurs du pays, il assure le fonctionnement des institutions enmaintenant s&apos;il est necessaire, par 1&apos;exercice du droit de dissolution !ecircuit continu de confiance entre le Gouvernement et la Nation.The President is effective head of the executive power as well as Head of State,for he appoints and dismisses the Prime Minister and, on the Prime Ministersrecommendation, other Ministers and Secretaries of State; Ministers areresponsible to him, and he presides over the Council of Ministers. When headdresses messages to the Chambers, they are read for him by a Minister. He ishead of the armed services and can declare a state of siege. He has power to dissolvethe Chamber of Deputies (in stated circumstances), and can summon both houses in emergency sessions. A Supreme Court of Justice is set up to ensure that theConstitution is preserved and political justice carried out. It can declare lawsunconstitutional, and it alone can try the Head of State, Ministers, Secretaries ofState, or persons whom the Head of State charges with offences against public safety. The President is not, however, endowed with reserve powers as drastic asthose of Article 16 of the Fifth Republic^ Constitution.There is a further significant similarity between the provision that the Senateshould include some corporative ingredients, and the ideas of both the R.P.F.and the Gaullism of the Fifth Republic. Petain&apos;s Constitution envisaged 30 Senatorsdesignes par le chef de VEtat parmi les representants elus des institutionsP) Admiral W. D.

professionnelles et corporatives and another 20 parmi les elites du pays. The R.P.F. -at first included professional groupings within its own structure and the Generalhimself talked vaguely about the need for association between capital and labour.During 1962 and 1963 there was frequent discussion of reforming the Senatealong more corporative lines, M. Michel Debre came out in favour of such ascheme, and even M. Mendes France saw merit in a variant of the corporativereconstruction of the upper housed1)In addition to these general affinities and similarities between Vichy, theR.P.F. and latter-day Gaullism, there were many other significant continuitiesbetween the actual achievements of the Vichy Governments, the post-warProvisional Governments, and the two subsequent Republics. Vichy was onceinterpreted as a mere interlude in republican development, as a temporary hiatusdue to the misfortunes of war which had permitted out-dated reactionary andtraditionalist forces to enjoy a brief St. Martin&apos;s summer. It must increasingly beseen as having an organic place in the continuing historical development of Frenchpolitical and social institutions. Two examples may here serve to illustrate theshift of interpretation required. They also help to place modern Gaullism in its total setting.One important continuity is the evolution of the comites d&apos;organisation and occupational intermediate groups created by Vichy partly for ideological reasons(Roman Catholic influence, the &quot; National Revolution &quot; or even the corporatisttheories of the &quot; Labour Charter &quot;) and partly from sheer necessity. Defeat and occupation forced on the French economy severe shortages and restrictions. Todeal with these, and to administer the regulations imposed by stringencies, the menof Vichy set up Organisation Committees in business and industry which becamethe basis for the post-war Conseil National du Patronat Francois. A PeasantCorporation, associated with the cult of the peasant family and the &quot; Back to theLand&quot; movement, and therefore ousted at liberation by the ConfederationGenerate Agricole (C.G.A.), these bodies gave rise eventually to the much moreconservative Federation Nationale des Syndicats d&apos;Exploitants Agricoles(F.N.S.E.A.) to which men of Vichy returned as the key men. Other cadres created by the Labour Charter, and the new professional bodies of lawyers and doctors,were preserved and consolidated during the early post-war years during whicheconomic conditions more closely resembled those of war-time than those of thepre-war Third Republic. The influence of Catholic Democratic movementsreinforced the fashion for pluralist ideas of society. It is occupational groups,whether trade unions (e.g., coal-miners or railwaymen) or trading associations(e.g., butchers or retailers) that have proved most resistant to the authority of president de Gaulle in the Fifth Republic. It is desire to tame and win them over that prompts much of the talk of corporative reforms among the U.N.R.(2)The other, and parallel, development is the new power accorded in society and in politics to the &quot; technocrats&quot; the economic planners, the expertadministrators and financial officials, the leaders of modernisation and the MonnetPlan. The story of their rise is studded with paradoxes. To it both Vichy and the resistance contributed one by its demonstration that &quot; Back to the Land &quot;movements, traditionalist regionalism, and old-fashioned paternalism held nofuture for France; the other by its drastic modernisation and reorganisation of the economy which, far from bringing about the decline of the bourgeoisie as itsLeft-wing supporters hoped, gave enhanced power to the new, enterprising elements of the industrial and business world. Gaullism, with its acceptance of planning and technocrats as indispensable for the government of modern France, has madeitself in this respect simultaneously the heir of both Vichy and the Resistance.It is some indication of the strength of this whole movement towards morethoroughgoing planning, and away from the little man laissez-faire liberalism ofthe Third Republic, that by the 1960s the Gaullists and their main opponents (e.g.,0) Michel Debre, Au Service de la Nation (1963), pp. 212-214; Pierre Mendes France: La RepubliaueModerne (1962), Chapter V. *O The argument is put at length in H. W. Ehrmann, Organised Business in France (1957) and inthe essays contained in France: Change and Tradition (1963). On the Catholic groups see W. BosworthCatholicism and Crisis in Modern France: French Catholic Groups at the Threshold of the Fifth Republic(1962), and on the peasant organisations, G. Wright: Rural Revolution in France- The Peasantry inthe Twentieth Century (1964).
Pierre Mendes France or the &quot; Europeans &quot; led by Jean Monnet) were outbiddingone another in homage to the aims and benefits of a comprehensive national plan for economic growth and social development. This whole tide of movementoriginated in the wartime and post-war conditions and derives little impetus fromthe pre-war system. Such continuities clearly give Gaullism a powerful impetus ofits own, beyond the departure of the General himself, provided that the Gaullistscan show evidence of their commitment to this trend and of the benefits it has,under their aegis, brought to the nation. The point has been summarised by theHarvard Professor, Mr. Stanley Hoffmann:The transformation of the French economy and society since 1952 is dueto the combination of the wills of a statist, de Gaulle, and a Saint-Simonien,Monnet; they used instruments prepared by Vichy and strengthened them by adding quite a few of their own, such as nationalizations, the PlanningCommission, and a reform of the civil service . . . The process is far fromcompleted, and no transformation of French political life has resulted from it so far.(*)Such a transformation of political life may, however, be still in process ofhappening, and could become abruptly manifest before the General departs. Theproliferation and power of trade associations and groupes de pression in the FifthRepublic, coupled with the decline in appeal and effectiveness of the traditionalpolitical parties, may indeed be just the beginnings of this corresponding politicaltransformation.Some of the reactions of Communism to these trends are illuminating. Thegroup of the &quot; New Left &quot; concealed behind the nom de plume &quot; Jean Dru &quot; seeks to reunite the Left on a programme of democratic reform in resistance to&quot; neo-capitalism &quot;, by which they mean economic planning as so far practised inFrance, with its managerial and bureaucratic control of the nationalised industries and the survival of a large sector of the economy in private control.(2) They regardGeneral de Gaulle and his Ministers as the agents in politics of these forces ofneo-capitalism: and contend that Communism must retort by appealing to the skilled technicians, younger professional leaders and managers, who have hitherto been treated as bourgeoisie. Such arguments are, at least, a sign of growingawareness of new alignments of social forces, and of the outdatedness of olderways of thought. The process of realignment in politics is likely to proceed much further during the next five years, especially if President de Gaulle remains in power and the political mores of the Fifth Republic harden into more durableshape.It is likely that the men and the interests who support the U.N.R. now doso, frequently, for the same reasons as they once supported the R.P.F. (or, forthat matter, the M.R.P.). They see it not only as a party of resistance toCommunism or of social conservatism, but rather as the party of the future ofeconomic growth, technological progress, firm administration and broad national interests. M. Jacques Bloch-Morhange. one of the intellectuals of Gaullism whoapproaches all history in a Carlylean spirit of respect for &quot; great men &quot;, produced in 1963 an illuminating analysis of Le Gaullisme. He began by pointing out that,between 1943 and 1962, Gaullism had had on French history an influence paralleledonly by Richelieu or Napoleon. He placed, in the forefront of his analysis of it,the achievement of real universal suffrage in October 1945, by the first extensionof the national vote to women. Twice, he claims, for women voters was Gaullismidentified with the coming of peace and the return home of the men-folk: in1945-46 and again, by 1962, with the making of a settlement in AJgeria. TheGenerafs flair for simplifying political issues to the extreme point of the referenda-asking, in effect, &quot;Are you for or against me?&quot; appeals directly to the newfemale voter. There is certainly some evidence that women give more solid support to him than men.(3) He is the impeccable husband and father, a complete &quot; fatherfigure &quot;.(0 France: Change and Tradition (1963), p. 58.(2) Jean Dru, Le Pari Democratique (1962): see also below, Section IV.(3) At Lyons, in the referendum of 8 January, 1961, on the organisation of public powers in Algeria,the votes of men and women voters were collected separately. In the four arrondissements, whereasmen polled only 72-1, 67-8, 70-7 and 64-7 per cent, for de Gaulle, women polled respectively 83-1,79-1, 80 and 78 per cent.
IV.-PROLETARIAN PLURALISM&quot; Are our parties moribund &quot;, asked Francois Mauriac in January 1962, &quot; orwill they revive? In any case they have made little use of the respite they owe tode Gaulle, whose regime is ... a transitional Government whose job is to dealwith immediate problems. That is what de Gaulle has done and is doing. We are living in a strange and contradictory regime a liberal dictatorship in which one man carries the whole burden of the State, yet cannot act as a dictator and imposehis will by force, because he is a liberal and a Christian.&quot;!3)It is tempting to discuss the future of Gaullism in terms of a counter-resurgenceof the Left, whether as a new &quot; Popular Front&quot; coalition which the Communistswould have liked in 1962, or as a reinvigoration of the Left-Centre behind a dynamicpersonality of the Left capable of rivalling General de Gaulle if not a PierreMendes France, then perhaps a Gaston Defferre. Certainly, if parliamentary life is to recover its former character, a revival of the Left and the Centre, apart from the communists, is indispensable. But it is arguable that even should this not happenthe working classes will find alternative methods of action, comparable with theOIn France: Change and Tradition, p. 382: see also R. Aron, France Steadfast and Changh(1960), Chapter 3.(2) cf. H. W. Ehrmann, op. cit., with Jesse R. Pitts in France: Change and Tradition, p. 286(3) Quoted in Dorothy Pickles, The Fifth French Republic (2nd edition 1962), p. 227.But much of the active support and collaboration which the GaulUst regime Jk\has found in France comes, according to M. Bloch-Morhange, from les notables wof industry, finance and the progressive farmers, as well as from the younger public servants and forward-looking fonctionnaires. The Centre National des JeunesAgriculteurs (C.N.J.A.) of Michel Debatisse, formerly general secretary of theJeunesse Agricole Chretienne, provided a drive for wide agricultural reforms and forremembrement at the very moment when de Gaulle returned to power in 1958.The result, evident in the policies of the Gaullist Minister of Agriculture, EdgarPisani, was that le Gaullisme en action est fortement influence par les theories de cesjeunes Turcs audacieux. M. Franyois Goguel echoes the same view, and endorses its importance for realignments of political forces in France. &quot; The very existence ofthis offensive by the younger generation, usually representing poor regions of mixedagriculture, means that the old political divisions between organisations of right and Left are losing much of their importance &quot;O The activities of the youngergeneration of industrialists, as manifest through the Centres des Jeunes Patrons(C.J.P.), reflect a comparable shift of emphasis. This body, neo-Catholic ininspiration, was founded before the war and remains predominantly paternalist inits attitudes to problems of industrial relations. Its members employ about 10 percent of the labour force engaged in middle-sized firms. Experts differ as to whether their influence exceeds their numbers: (2) they represent in any case, a moreinnovating spirit in French industry that finds little to quarrel with in the paternalismof the Gaullist regime. Willingness to admit to membership salaried executives(cadres) alongside the patrons themselves shows a widening of outlook, political aswell as social.The longer-term destiny of Gaullism as a coherent political movement inFrance depends, doubtless, on how completely it wins and holds the support of organisations such as these. Their attachment to the M.R.P. has been in many instances loosened, their readiness to accept a semi-authoritarian and technocraticregime such as that of Gaullism has been strengthened, by experience of the first five years of the Fifth Republic. No alternative political party yet on the horizonseems more likely to attract their backing. The so-called forces of neo-capitalismand of neo-Catholicism are at least complacent towards Gaullism, at mostenthusiastic. What of the workers and the so-called neo-syndicalists?
M corporative groups of the professions and the technical experts. There may develop indeed there is already evolving a proletarian pluralism miscalledneo-syndicalism.A constant difficulty of interpreting the Fifth Republic, and therefore also ofassessing the future of Gaullism, is to escape from the presupposition that the onlyalternatives to it would be either a return to the weaknesses and immobilisme ofthe parliamentary regimes, or an accentuation of dictatorial tendencies to produce an even more authoritarian (and perhaps even totalitarian) regime. If parliament in the Fifth Republic is weak, it could be made stronger: if the Gaullist State isnot yet a police State, it could likewise become one. But the future might comeneither by retracing steps nor by accentuating authority. It might emerge from thenew, unfamiliar yet powerful tendencies stimulated by the social transformationof France during the &apos;fifties and Sixties. And this is as likely to be true of theworking classes and the Left as it is of the patrons and the technocrats. The futurecould lie, in short, with proletarian pluralism.Any assessment of the probabilities must begin with consideration of how farand for what reasons political apathy and inactivism have spread among the peopleof France, with or without positive dissemination of it by the Gaullists. &quot; Leave itto Papa &quot; is the jibe of the Left: but there are many who prefer this to either areversion to Leftist ineffectiveness or the risks of polarisation between Gaullismand a Communist-led &quot; Popular Front&quot;. Popular enthusiasm for a parliamentarysystem is far from fervent. Has the Left lost its political appeal for the Frenchworkers?French political scientists have engaged in a protracted but illuminatingdebate about the meaning, extent and significance of depolitisation under the fifth Republic.O The word itself seems to have come into usage (along with itsopposite, politisation) during the later 1940s, especially in relation to the contestbetween Left and Right for influence over the trade unions. The main syndicalisttradition in France, dating from the Charte d&apos;Amiens of 1906, was that labour organisations must remain distinct from all political parties, and must seek theirends more by direct economic action than by political action. The power of the communists over the C.G.T. after liberation led, in 1947, to the split from it ofthe Force ouvriere group, and the separate continuance of the independentChristian and other trade unions. It may even have been General de Gaulle whoinvented certainly he gave currency to the word depolitiser. In his press conference of 16 March, 1950, he spoke of the need to depolitiser les syndicats, thestock example quoted in Le Petit Larousse from 1959 onwards. The theme loomedlarge in R.P.F. propaganda in the elections of 1951, for it matched well theircondemnation of Communism and its recent role in organising strikes for politicalends. In his widely read Ces princes qui nous gouvernent (1957) Michel Debreexpounded a general theory of &quot; unpolitical&quot; democracy, wherein good citizenswere preoccupied most of the time with their own private affairs. And in his firstspeech as Premier to the new National Assembly, in January 1959, Debredeclared : // est necessaire, dans Vinteret national, de faire echapper nos problemesvitaux aux discussions partisanes en quelque sorte de les &quot; depolitiser &quot;. . . .La &quot; depolitisation &quot; de Vessentiel national est un imperatif majeur.The Gaullists thus evolved their own idea of depolitisation as somethingdesirable. It meant a process, to be encouraged, of not only eliminating CommunistParty control over trade unions but of raising national issues above partysquabbles a notion that comfortingly chimed with the claim, already noted, tovoice national interests against all other political parties, and to represent unityagainst separatism and schism. The Left, however, widened the term whilstlamenting what it stood for: the spread of political apathy and indifference, apropensity to leave governmental decisions to experts and officials, a decline in both parliamentary power and party loyalties. Such tendencies had preceded therise of Gaullism, but had been welcomed and reinforced by it for its own ends.The recession of politics even from legislation is, indeed, envisaged in Article 34of the Constitution of 1958, which makes an innovation in French republicanhistory by prescribing specific topics for parliamentary legislation and leavingall others to the executive power.O See especially La Depolitisation Mythe ou Realite (1962) (editor Georges Vedel): La Democratica Refaire (Collogue &apos; France-Forum &apos; January 1962) (1963).
There is something violently paradoxical, if not farcical, in the assumptionthat depolitisation was spreading fast just when recurrent national crises were caused by the French Army becoming actively engaged in politics, by the terroristactivities of the colons and the extremists for Algerie frangaise and by the fear of communism winning support from revulsion against the excesses of the Right.The range of &quot; politics &quot; that was being diminished was that of parliamentarypolitics, and partisan issues of a conventional kind. It was true, as many critics ofGaullism admitted, that the great classical issues-a class-war, clericalism, theconflicts between liberalism and dirigisme or between nationalism andinternationalism had lost their force and no longer seemed to matter. Certainlythey seemed irrelevant to the great new issues of the mid-twentieth century:decolonisation, the cold war, the need for economic growth, a comprehensivesocial plan, automation. It was this mounting sense of old issues fading whilst newissues had not yet coalesced into new party attitudes, that underlay much ofthe discussion of depolitisation. The Gaullists, in the advantageous position ofbeing able to pose as a new party uncommitted to outdated shibboleths, made themost of their opportunities. Tendencies based not upon theories but on necessitiesand events were turned, by them, into a wider policy to be promoted even theblueprint of a new order to be created in which national interests should beexalted above sectional demands through the rule of technocrats.One factor especially influencing the attitudes of the trade unions is theexistence of the Fourth Plan (1962-65) and the fast progress in industrial techniqueswhich has accompanied the Plan. Francois Goguel has remarked:Indeed, technical progress has transformed the physical conditions ofmanual labour in many branches of industry. The new techniques, whetheror not they extend to the point called automation, seem to be giving riseto a new type of working class, whose members, instead of performingundifferentiated tasks which make them interchangeable, are becoming moreand more specialized professionals. This recalls the old artisan class, but the framework is totally unlike that of the small workshops of the nineteenth century. 0)This growth of a more technically skilled class of workers has led to muchdiscussion, comparable with that described above, about the deproletarisation orembourgoisement of the workers in a welfare state and an affluent society. Whilstthese and similar pretentious labels for fairly simple processes may be discountedas misplaced ingenuity, they at least reflect an awareness of some aspects of thechange which has been taking place and which still continues. This change helpsGaullism on its way, accelerates its advance whilst making difficult any movements in the contrary direction, but is of use to it only so long as it wishes to move inbroadly that direction.More important, perhaps, for the future of Gaullism than any such tendencyis the trend, which the workers share with professional and other occupationalgroups, towards a more pluralist society. Syndicalism in France has always been more fragmented and small-scale than trade unionism in Britain. The schismswithin organised labour, and the rise of various other new groups within whichworkers can satisfy their needs for leisure, recreation, discussion have also made for a pluralist pattern of society. It has the advantages indicated by the protestant Socialist, Andre Philip: le travailleur, au lieu de se laisser absorberexclusivement par un groupe, participe aujourd&apos;hui a un grand nombre de groupesa buts specialises. Or, je dis que c&apos;est la une liberation de l&apos;homme.(2) Nor mayPhilip be wrong in suggesting that there is a shift here, in political theory, fromMarx to Proudhon: provided the contention be modified by the fact that manyCommunist voters in France never have been Marxists. The large Communist vote,as detailed analysis shows, is essentially a protest vote an amalgam of real urbanworking-class discontent with ultra-Jacobin traditions of insurrection and provincial self-assertiveness against Paris. But so far as orthodox Marxism has given way to native traditions of working-class independence and self-help, the trend towards pluralism may prove to be the most powerful check on GaullistC1) In France: Change and Tradition, p. 383.(2)La Democratic a Refaire, p. 38.
advance towards a strong centralised authority in the State. As one Frenchmanwho had deserted Marxism remarked: &quot; What I am looking for now is still asynthesis of Marx and Proudhon, a policy of administrative and economicdecentralisation, the unity of the working class in a large trade union movement,and the idea of a federated Europe &quot;.(*)Post-war nationalisations made this trend more important.The fate of Gaullism may come to depend, for example, more than seemed likely in the heyday of its power on whether State employees and officialsacknowledge greater loyalty to their occupational interest-groups or to theGaullist State. By the end of 1963, despite recent Gaullist legislation designedto restrict the right of public employees to strike, the Government was challenged by a mounting tide of organised protest stoppages from all categories of publicemployees in transport, post office and civil service. The post-war State inFrance had ostensibly secured most of what Lenin would have called the&quot; commanding heights &quot; of the national economy, either by nationalisation or through control by public authorities. The issue still unresolved was who shouldcommand the commanding heights: and when the successive challenges of thearmy, the political extremists and even the security forces had been safelyovercome, there remained still the challenge, yet more difficult to face, of the organisations of public servants on the civilian front. Here, as in other sectors of French politics, the personality of de Gaulle was probably more immediatelyimportant than any statutory powers of the Government or any specific measuresopen to it. To de Gaulle the people as a whole would still listen, especially when he appealed for national solidarity in face of adversity: should it lack thatcircuit de conftance, could Gaullist authority long withstand the pressures of organisations on whom the functioning of the economy now so largely relied?These challenges and tensions existed, it must be noted, with little support from the more traditional tendency, evident enough in the days of the R.P.F.,towards a &quot; polarisation &quot; of politics. Then, Communism and the anti-Communistforce of the R.P.F. flourished in unison, each extreme driving large segmentsof public opinion on to the opposite side in a form of watershed. The strengthof Communism in France waned with the breakdown of the R.P.F., the comingof greater affluence, and the major diversion of the struggle between Algeriannationalists and the fanatics for Algerie francaise of the O.A.S. Much of it was always a protest vote. Until 1958 Communist electoral strength had remainedconsistently at about one-quarter of the vote, which meant roughly one-fifth of the whole electorate. In the elections of November 1958, the Communistvote fell sharply from 5-1 millions in 1956 to less than 3f millions, whilst theseats held by Communists fell disproportionately from 145 to 10.(2) But in theelections of 1962, which returned a Gaullist majority, the Communists wonback a good part of this loss in electoral support (nearly A\ millions on the firstballot) and held more than 40 seats. They gained the even more importantstrategic advantage of emerging from the political purdah in which the other parties had kept them since 1947. To this extent &quot; polarisation &quot; recurred, thoughto a more modest degree than in 1951, when almost half the voters had backedcandidates (whether Communist or Gaullist) representing parties that rejected the existing parliamentary system. Together they constituted the time-honoured&quot; disloyal Opposition &quot; of French politics since 1789, being alike opposed notonlv to the Government of the day but to the regime itself. The strength oftendencies to &quot; polarisation &quot; in politics will, clearly, be one element in determining the future of Gaullism.The strength of such forces was in turn affected by the relative weaknessand divisions of the other parties. The schism most commonly accepted as the chronic weakness of the opposition was the schism of the Left the irreconcilableC1) Quoted in G. A. Almond, The Appeals of Communism (1954), p. 358; see also M. Einaudiet al., Communism in Western Europe (1951), pp. 60-151; A. Rossi, La Physiologie du parti commu-niste francais (1949). The contrast between Marx and Proudhon has been put by John HampdenJackson: &quot;Not only is there an anarchist, mutualist, anti-State tradition which is the opposite ofMarxism, but there is also in the essence of the socialist creed a moral doctrine with which Marx . . .had nothing to do . . . and of this ethos Proudhon, though not the originator, was the majorprophet&quot;.

O Charles A. Micaud, Communism and the French Left (1963), is the most recent, if somewhatdisappointing study of this subject.(2) John Pinder, Europe against de Gaulle (1963) is the most extreme statement, so far, of the viewthat monnet  Europe and de gaulle&apos;s are in headlong collision.animosities between Communists and Socialists which prevented the revival^of anything like a &quot; Popular Front &quot; and which kept the working-class voteas a whole partially neutralised as a power in parliamentary politics. So muchhas been said about that elsewhere that little need be added here:!1) save tosuggest that if a &quot; Popular Front&quot; were to appear more immediately feasiblein France than it has appeared so far under the Fifth Republic, there wouldcertainly be a corresponding reinforcement and rallying to Gaullism and theconservative parties. The probability of a Popular Front would simultaneouslyincrease the probability of more massive polarisation.No less important, moreover, than the split between the two major working-class parties of the Left, is the fragmentation of the Centre parties and theirfrictions with the Left. Centrifugal forces operating in public life naturally left allCentre parties weaker Socialists, Radicals, M.R.P. and Independents as well asincreasing the proportion of abstentions. It is this fact that President de Gaulleexploited with such devastating success in his electoral tactics in 1962. By choosingas the field of battle the double dispute about the revision of the Constitution (tomake future presidents popularly elective) and about the manner of effecting the revision (by referendum), he chose especially favourable ground. On both disputeshe could mobilise popular feeling and could appeal over the heads of the parties,evoking sovereignty of the people against the sovereignty of Parliament. Byprovoking his opponents to try to combine against him he demonstrated, both tothem and to the electorate, their inability to combine. The achievements of de Gaulle in the autumn of 1962, which virtually refounded the Fifth Republicon a solid Parliamentary majority, were no mere stroke of good fortune or fluke.They rested on an astute appreciation of the whole working of political life aswell as of the peculiar structure of French politics under the Fifth Republic. Theyproved the President to have, in high degree, a penetrating grasp of Frenchparliamentarians as political animals. To encourage the middle-of-the-roadpoliticians and parties to expose their dissensions in public was to remind everyoneforcefully of the discredited Fourth Republic. This created an atmospherefavouring the swing of electoral opinion and feeling back to the side of Gaullism.The U.N.R. bloc emerged from the contest with 219 seats, requiring the adherenceonly of the 33 Independent Republicans to ensure a safe Gaullist majority in theNational Assembly. The results took most expert observers by surprise, and suggested that the President had a more perceptive understanding of politicalrealities than had his followers.It is characteristic of the Gaullist Fifth Republic that alignments in domestic affairs should sometimes be at variance with the affinities most natural in foreignaffairs. Those who regard the internal Monnet Plans as producing the&quot; neo-capitalism &quot; which nourishes Gaullism may see in Monnet&apos;s &quot; European &quot;federalism the chief antagonist of Gaullist chauvinism. Certainly in any historicalperspective it will be Jean Monnet alone who will rank near de Gaulle as themaker of post-war France: and they have seldom seen eye to eye.(2)In assessing the future of Gaullism in France it is not enough to measure the inherent organisational strengths and qualities of leadership in Gaullist groups andin their rivals. Its fate will be the outcome, more likely, of triangular &quot; pulls &quot;than of a straight tug-of-war: the Gaullist pull towards a centralised nationalauthority striving for direct rapport with the people as a whole and for greaterindependence abroad; the technocratic pull of the Plan and the planners, directed towards producing a highly technological society guided by scientific use of resources and aimed at achieving continuing economic growth; and, as a restraint on both, the complex pluralist pulls of French society itself. French society,undergoing considerable changes yet, and accepting, no doubt, the nationalist andmaterialist benefits of both these other tendencies, is likely to remain stubbornlyresistant to them wherever they seem liable to sacrifice the individuals freedom,or tastes, or special interests to the demands of collective power and operational efficiency. In this sense, the rival influences of Jean Monnet and of Pierre-JosephProudhon may indeed both moderate the influence of Charles de Gaulle.
V.-EXTERNAL relations the foreign policy of Gaullism, which is virtually identical with the policiespursued by President de Gaulle, may be usefully examined under three mainheads: policy towards the two world Powers, the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates; policy towards France&apos;s European neighbours, especially Great Britain and western Germany; and policy towards the &quot; third world &quot; of the underdevelopedcountries.In a world where the Powers envelop their real purposes and policies inwrappings of ideology or protestations of piety and altruism, Gaullist policy isremarkable for its outspokenness, its frankness, and its realism. The mostconspicuous feature of it is that as regards aims it is clear, avowed and at timesstark. It is only as regards tactics that it indulges in mystification and deception.Its failures have been due to a harshness of method and a certain insensitivity,rather than to any lack of coherence or strength of purpose.De Gaulle&apos;s policy towards both the major world Powers is based on distrustand dislike, but also on an interpretation of their motivations and purposes whichleads him to regard them as mutually balancing. The distrust and dislike derive inpart from his war-time experience of them as allies, in part from his views on theirbehaviour after the war. Neither, he believes, paid more heed to the wishes and interests of France than he compelled them to pay. The account of french relations with the United States and the Soviet Union given in the Memoires,especially in the third volume, is infused with a spirit of resentment against thescant attention given to French needs and susceptibilities, and also with a resolveof defiance and self-assertion which, he claims, paid off in terms of loftierinternational status. His comment on the belated recognition of the ProvisionalGovernment by Washington, London and Moscow on 23 October, 1944, reflects the mood:To save face the White House and Downing Street stated that Eisenhowernow thought it possible to transfer his authority on French territory to thede Gaulle Government, as if the Supreme Commander had ever exercisedauthority for a moment over anyone but his soldiers. Seeing that the &quot; great powers &quot; bowed before the inevitable, the other States who had lagged behindnow fell into line in turn. We naturally refrained from thanking any of themfor this formality performed in extremis. At a Press conference I held on25 October, when I was asked &quot; my reactions to the recognition of theGovernment by the Allies&quot;, I confined myself to replying: &quot; The FrenchGovernment is pleased that it is to be called by its name! ()This mixture of injured pride and haughty disdain was to remain a significantingredient of Gaullist attitudes towards the major Powers, and every student ofGaullist foreign policy under the Fifth Republic is well advised to study the thirdvolume of the Memoires. It is, in many respects, the Gaullist counterpart toMein Kampf, in the frankness of its aims. De Gaulle made a bid for closeAnglo-French partnership a bid made the more persuasive since it was he andChurchill who had, in June 1940, contrived together the abortive proposal for complete Anglo-French Union.(2) There is one key paragraph, describing his efforts to persuade Churchill to cement a close alliance in November 1944.&quot; The equilibrium of Europe &quot;, I added, &quot; the guarantee of peace along the rhine, the independence of the Vistula, Danube and Balkan States, the creationof some form of association with the peoples all over the world to whom wehave opened the doors of Western civilisation, an organisation of nations whichwill be something more than an arena for disputes between America and Russia,and lastly the primacy accorded in world politics to a certain conception of mandespite the progressive mechanisation of society surely these are our greatinterests in tomorrow^ world.

Moreover, we shall have the support of many States and of wworld-wide public opinion, which instinctively shies away from giants. ThusEngland and France will create peace together, as twice in 30 years they havetogether confronted war.&quot;!1)President de gaulle&apos;s attitudes to Britain vis-a-vis the Common Marketnegotiations must be interpreted with this passage in mind. Similarly, his attitude to Russia remains entirely in line with his account of his negotiations in Moscow in1944.(2) He then convinced himself, by experience, that toughness and intransigencepay when negotiating agreements with the leaders of great Powers: on verifia . . .que de toutes les influences la plus forte est celle du succes. His account of how hedefeated the Russian negotiators by departing for his train has a Disraelian flavour,not inappropriate to the Bismarckian behaviour of Stalin. Coupled with his alreadyprofound animosity to Roosevelt, these experiences seem to have led him to think of Russia, America and only to a slightly less degree Britain, as all alike incorrigibly-self-seeking and insensitive to the aspirations of France: and so to have reinforcedhis already strong proclivity to think and act with unlimited self-assertion in foreignpolicy. The only limits to a chauvinistic policy are imposed by the need to succeed.Within the severities imposed by the iron laws of the jungle into which de Gaullebecame convinced the world was again moving he clung, however, to a fewlife-lines of idealism. It is these which explain his handling of French colonialproblems, and the policy of emancipation which entitles him to be regarded as thegreatest &quot; decoloniser &quot; of the twentieth century. There is a stern nobility about hisattitudes to fallen enemies, even to Laval and Hitler. &quot; Laval had played and lost.He had the courage to admit that he was answerable for the consequences. In hisgovernment, deploying the limitless resources of guile and the last resorts ofobstinacy in order to support the insupportable, he sought, somehow, to serve his country. Let that be left to his credit! &quot;(3) And of Hitler: &quot; Until the last hours ofagony in the depths of a Berlin bunker, he remained unquestioned, inflexible,pitiless, as he had been during the days of his supreme glory . . . The Titan that triesto lift the world can neither bow nor bend. But conquered and crushed, perhapshe becomes a man again, just long enough for one secret tear at the moment whenall is at an end.&quot;C) There is little magnanimity, it may be objected, in shedding a&quot; secret tear &quot; or admiring courage once the enemy is safely dead. Somewhat greatermagnanimity towards Laval whilst alive, in the form of a reprieve which lay inde Gaulle&apos;s own hands, might have offset the farce and discredit into which LavaFstrial brought the Provisional Government. It might even have paid politicaldividends. But the characteristic Gaullist severity came uppermost, whenever hecould convince himself that it was essential for the welfare of France.This Gaullist tendency to bracket Russia and America as comparable Powers&quot; hobbled by their rivalry &quot; is of immediate diplomatic significance in relation totheir nuclear policies. The partial nuclear test-ban treaty of July-August 1963inevitably appeared to de Gaulle as full confirmation of all that he had ever believedof the two major Powers, and of Britain in her &quot; special relationship &quot; with theUnited States. In his Press conference on 29 July he recalled Franco-Americantensions of &quot; the heroic days &quot;. He pointed out, too, the historical facts that Franceand Russia are the only major Powers with which the United States has never&quot; exchanged a cannon-shot&quot; and that France alone among nations has foughtalongside America in three great wars (the first being the War of Independence).But the nub of his policy was insistence that &quot; France cannot subscribe to any arrangement concerning Europe, and particularly Germany, which would be carriedout over her head &quot;.0This aim, that explains so well his reactions to the nuclear test-ban treaty,had been formulated in 1945 and stated clearly enough many times, not least in theMemoires (1959).I intended to guarantee France primacy in Western Europe by preventing the rise of a new Reich that might again threaten its safety; to co-operate withEast and West and if need be contract the necessary alliances on one side or the
other without ever accepting any kind of dependency; to transform the FrenchUnion into a free association in order to avoid the as yet unspecified dangers of upheaval; to persuade the States along the Rhine, the Alps and the Pyreneesto form a political, economic and strategic bloc; to establish this organisation as one of the three world Powers and, should it become necessary, as the arbiterbetween the Soviet and the Anglo-American camps. Since 1940, my every wordand deed had been dedicated to establishing these possibilities; now that france was on her feet again, I tried to realise them.C)Such passages and there are others in the Memoires or in the GeneraFs public utterances express unequivocally the principles that normally guide his decisions in foreign policy. He has never made the slightest secrecy of them. There is,therefore, little need to be taken unawares by his aims despite the elaborate enigmavariations with which he is prone to accompany any actual operations.In relation to defence strategy, the political notion of an equilibrium betweenthe major Powers created by their very similarities and rivalries gives way to the doctrine of mutual deterrence and nuclear stalemate. The strategic justification ofthe force de frappe as an independent force in French hands is that, since no majornuclear Power could be relied on to use its deadly weapons in an issue not directly and immediately involving its own self-defence, France must possess an independent&quot; detonator &quot;. This, known to be available and certain to be used in need, woulddeter Soviet use of nuclear power because French retaliation, however less fearsomein itself than Russian, would be likely to precipitate that nuclear war which boththe major Powers realise to be suicidal. To the charge that such a strategy is highly dangerous, the General would no doubt retort that Britain has consistently strivenfor its own nuclear deterrent so must presumably accept the same logic; and thatanyhow to equip oneself to &quot; live dangerously &quot; in the second half of the twentiethcentury is the only way to survive.There is abundant evidence that in 1959 de Gaulle could accurately lay claimto have conceived the notion of an equilibrium of world power in the immediatelypost-war years. On 28 July, 1946, he remarked at Bar-le-Duc: Quoi done retablir1&apos;equilibre sinon Vancien monde entre les deux nouveaux? In his speech atStrasbourg in April 1947, he repeated the view that French independence required a reconstructed Europe as a balancing factor between the two massive Powers.Furthermore, the idea of arbiter, which he applied to the domestic position of thePresident in the Constitution, he applied also to the role of Europe in the world.The freedom of action so gained he proposed, with characteristic world-vision,to use not only for the defence of France but also to preserve European freedomand civilisation as a whole and to benefit the deux milliards d&apos;affames in the under-developed countries.His case for seeking a &quot; special relationship &quot; with Western Germany underChancellor Adenauer, as the core of a more concerted European ensemble, hasbeen often stated and is familiar enough to need no repetition here.(2) The firmaims were decked out in more flamboyant phrases during his wooing of Germanyprior to the conclusion of the Franco-German treaty of January 1963, but they remained unaltered, in essentials, and the treaty subsequently proved to haveeffected little substantial change in Franco-German relations. There is little reasonto doubt that de Gaulle&apos;s desire for some warmer and closer relationship with western Germany was and is perfectly genuine. His disregard for Germansusceptibilities, when he withdrew French naval units from NATO forces without such prior consultation as was required by the treaty, was much more characteristicclumsiness and insensitivity wherever anti-American prejudices and Frenchinterests are involved, than any conscious reversal of attitude towards Germany.The Berlin question and the severance of East Germany from West is, after all,an automatic assurance that any Western German Government will be anti-Soviet:and this makes Western Germany, with its great and expanding economic strength,a natural ally of Gaullist France. Nor should it be forgotten how muchGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s earlier life was preoccupied with German affairs. He learned(and speaks) German; he was a prisoner of war in Germany and wrote his firstbook about Germany; his military career rested on the study of how to defend(x) Memoires, Vol. Ill, pp. 179-180 and see A. J. Rieber, Stalin and the French Communist Party,1941-47 (1962), pp. 9, 123-5.(2) e.g., Roger Massip, De Gaulle et VEurope (1963) or in Andre Passeron, De Gaulle Parle (1962).CONFIDENTIAL3779 D 2
France against Germany. Conflict does not prevent a concern, long sustained,,from fostering a deep understanding and knowledge which, in turn, breed someaffinities and even attractions.One of the most revealing documents concerning Gaullist policies is thestatement of de Gaulle at his Press conference on 14 January, 1963, dealing withhis opposition to the entry of Britain into the Common Market. His central thesiswas that Britain, by geography, trade, traditions and cast of mind, was insularand maritime rather than continental. Her earlier refusal to participate in theCommon Market, her lead in forming EFTA, her insistence on Commonwealthlinks and obligations, were all adduced as evidences of her real character. Herefforts to enter the Common Market belatedly, on terms that would prove acceptable to all these other interests, showed her further failure to appreciate the needs ofthe continental peoples. As a spearhead of &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; influences in Europe,her entry would widen the Community until it lost coherence. But some form ofco-operation with the Common Market would be both possible and advantageous,and one day evolution might bring England nearer to the continent and she could then join without reserve. It was a veritable manifesto of exclusion, an effort todepict France and Germany as the only conceivable leaders of Western Europefor some time to come, and a clever ex post facto defence for the harsh and abruptmanner in which he had vetoed the negotiations and united his partners in irritationand resentment against him. UEurope des Etats (he had repudiated the aim ofL&apos;Europe des Patries formerly attributed to him) was to be a concert of power highlyfavourable to French interests and Gaullist purposes.There is little doubt, too, that de Gaulle&apos;s judgment was much affected,in January 1963, by the whole sequence of events of the previous few months. Ithad included the Cuban crisis of November-December 1962 which appeared tofurnish final proof that his own diagnosis of the nuclear stalemate as well as of the inherent self-sufficient nature of United States policy was correct. It hadincluded, also, his own remarkable triumph in the referendum and theparliamentary elections of October-November, which encouraged a mood ofimmense self-confidence and even arrogance. At his Press conference of Januaryhe analysed the outcome of the Cuban crisis to show that the United States would,in emergency, deploy her weapons exclusively for her own defence and withoutany consultation with her allies, who in Europe would inevitably have had to bear the burden of conflict had one broken out over Cuba. He accordingly spurned theproposal for a multilateral atomic force which had been mooted at the Nassauagreement. France must keep its deterrent force at its own disposal; and, as withthe Nuclear Test-ban Treaty later, he resisted any agreement among the &quot; Anglo-Saxons &quot; in which France had had no say.De Gaulle&apos;s behaviour (and manners) in January 1963, even allowing for anunusual mood of exhilaration fostered by his impressive political victories at homeand the completion of his treaty with Germany, raise the problem of whether he islikely to be reckless in foreign policy: is it wrong to regard him as the cerebralstrategist in politics, the highly intelligent (and intellectual) calculator, masterfullyweighing the components of the situation and shaping his course of action in accord with well-considered principles and well-publicised aims? Is he not especially perhaps as he gets older-a man of deep passions and stubbornprejudices, swayed too much by set judgments framed in obsolescent terms, orby rankling recollections of personal slights and national rebuffs? Assessment ofthis issue is increasingly crucial, as he acquires solitary control of nuclear weapons and as advancing age may bring deeper rancour and greater recklessness.It would be rash to neglect the possibility that the worst could happen: thatan ageing, stubborn, irritable President could become more paranoiac (or, as some would say, more megalomaniac) in tendency than he already is. Shouldthe next five years bring this exigency, European diplomacy would indeed entera phase in some respects reminiscent of Hitler in the later 1930s. But there isnot evidence enough for supposing that this is a probable eventuality. De Gaulle&apos;sexasperating behaviour in the winter of 1962-63 was coloured, as already suggested,by exceptional circumstances, including what he regarded as several simultaneousvindications of his own principles, predictions and policies. It seems possible thatsubsequent developments have modified that rapture, the difficulties encounteredsince then by the Common Market and the internal difficulties of France itself,combined with the unexpected boom in Britain, have softened somewhat the
acerbities of January. Possession of an independent nuclear weapon is more likelyto lessen the urge to anxious self-assertiveness (which came from a sense ofinsecurity) than to intensify it. And the whole of de Gaulle&apos;s character and careerdemonstrate a remarkably consistent desire to control wayward impulses orintractable conditions by rational purpose and intelligent, conscious will-power. all this militates against the probability of senile degeneration into reckless vanity.Since, however, the resignations of Adenauer and Macmillan and the assassinationof President Kennedy, de Gaulle remains the veteran statesman of the world andhis personality is correspondingly enhanced in importance.The above analysis of de Gaulle&apos;s policy towards other States presupposesRealpolitik and a neglect of ideologies. His attitude to Communism rests on the simple denial that its ideology is meaningful, and on conviction that the foreignpolicies of Communist Powers rest on exactly the same kinds of consideration as those of other Powers: that is, on needs of national defence and on powerrelationships. Uetendard de I&apos;ideologic ne couvre en realite que des ambitions.C)This is as true of the Sino-Soviet quarrel as of the personality-cults under Lenin,Stalin, Khrushchev or Tito. The anti-Communist fervour of R.P.F. days hasdissipated: though even then his favourite epithet for them, &quot; the separatists &quot;,implied objections that were nationalist more than ideological.Precisely because he refuses to take ideologies seriously, he is ready to see in a deal between the ideological &quot; opposites&quot;, the United States and the soviet union, a certain danger to French and European interests. If nuclear war betweenthem is ruled out as known to be suicidal, and if for both the interests of lesserallies weigh as nothing compared to their separate self-interests, then commonpurposes could conceivably be served by an agreed sacrifice of awkward allies: abargain, perhaps, like the partitions of Poland in the 18th century, or as recently as 1939.De Gaulle&apos;s counter-plan for such a contingency is his much-discussed visionof the iron curtain abolished leaving an independent Europe &quot; from the Atlanticto the Urals &quot;. The phrase in variant forms recurs in speeches delivered on16 March, 1950, 7 April, 1954, 22 November, 1959, and on 25 April and31 May, 1960. It is, therefore, an element in Gaullist thinking of at least thelast 13 years and a continuity between the R.P.F. days and the Fifth Republic.Just what it signifies is less easy to analyse. The idea nearly always occurs indisquisitions on the unity and extent of European civilisation, as something distinct from both East and West. Does it envisage a split between European Russiaand Asiatic Russia, the former accepting links with Europe and the latter with china? Does it imply a &quot; liberated &quot; bloc, freed from both American influence inthe West and Communist influence in the East, massive and united enough withinitself to be a truly independent &quot; third force &quot; in the world? It may be unwise, inview of the frequency with which the phrase comes from his lips in speeches, to read too precise a meaning into so recurrent a rhetorical phrase. In its mostconsidered context (e.g., in a radio-television speech of 31 May, 1960) it is, plainlyenough, an ultimate and remote vision, with little immediate hope ofimplementation^2) It is usually linked with the idea of equilibrium alreadyoutlined, and would seem to mean little more than an ensemble of European Statessufficiently large and powerful enough to be able to defend itself independently andto preserve a large margin of independence for its members within its owncompass.It is in his attitudes and policies towards the under-developed countries, andespecially former colonial territories, that de Gaulle&apos;s broad humanism becomesmost evident. His transformation of the former French Empire first into the FrenchUnion of 1946, then into the Communaute of 1959, and ultimately into the veryloose &quot; New Community &quot; of 1962, is a story of rapid and extensive emancipationcoupled with far-sighted plans for economic and social development as the basisof future relationships with France. His handling of the Algerian war was alsoP)Le Monde, 31 July, 1963.(2) Sur notre ancien continent, Vorganisation d,un groupement occidental, tout au moins equivalenta celui qui existe a VEst, pourra permettre un jour, sans risque pour Vindependance et la liberte dechacun et compte tenu de revolution vraisemblable des regimes, d&apos;etablir Ventente europeenne entreVAtlantique et 1&apos;Oural. (R. Massip, op. cit., p. 186). One is reminded of Rousseau&apos;s statement of theeternal Jacobin dilemma: to find a form of association par laquelle chacun, s&apos;unissant a tous, rtobeissepourtant qu&apos;a lui-meme, et reste aussi libre qu&apos;qu&apos;auparavant. De Gaulle has Rousseauist moments.
guided from an early stage by recognition (which could not be proclaimed fortactical reasons) that self-determination, preferably with some continuing link with france, would be the most likely solution. Gaullist attitudes to colonial connectionshave always been flexible, and kept firmly subordinate to wider issues of national security and interest. The shift of policy which took place during de Gaulle&apos;sjourney round the African territories in August 1958 whilst the Constitution of the fifth Republic was itself taking shape, was remarkable evidence of how empiricaland flexible his policies can be.The draft Constitution already (Title XII) provided, albeit in somewhatambiguous and vague terms, for the liberalising of the old French Union. It laiddown that &quot; In the Community set up by the present Constitution, the States enjoyautonomy; they administer themselves and manage their own affairs freely anddemocratically. There is in the Community only one citizenship. All citizens areequal before the law, whatever their origin, race or religion. They have the sameduties.&quot; The Constitution as first drafted offered the 18 Overseas Territories threechoices: by Article 76 they could choose to &quot; keep their status within the Republic &quot;or could become &quot; Overseas departments &quot; or, grouped together or separately,they could become member States of the Community. If they chose the latter course,de Gaulle further made it possible, by adding Article 86 before the final draftingbut after his return from Africa, for them to become independent by a prescribedprocedure for &quot; change of status &quot;. But meanwhile, in the course of his tour, hehad also added yet a fifth possibility: any territory which, by a majority, voted against the new Constitution in the referendum of September, could claim itsindependence immediately. Only Guinea did so, but it would appear that before he went to Africa he had no serious thought of offering facilities for secession. Itwas only at Brazzaville, in the heart of Black Africa and amid strongly Gaullisttraditions dating from 1940, that he dropped his &quot; bombshell &quot; of offering complete independence to any territory that chose it.OWhen, one after another, member States showed a desire to claim independence,de Gaulle in June 1960 amended Articles 85 and 86 of the Constitution to enablemember States to remain in the Community after full independence, and to enableindependent States to join the Community. This change of structure, of whichmember States quickly made ample use, was tantamount to yet a thirdreorganisation of the whole relationship between France and the overseas territories.An unrepentant deooloniser, de Gaulle proceeded, in effect, to apply the same principle of full self-determination to Algeria.His handling of the Algerian problem itself revealed extraordinary powers of long-term timing, manoeuvre and skilled manipulation. At an early point in his efforts to end the Algerian war, which he rightly took to be the basic task of the fifth Republic, he realised that a substantial grant of self-determination wasultimately inevitable. Unable to announce such an aim, because it would haveprecipitated revolt among the colons and probably the army leaders, he movedstealthily forward in a smoke-screen of ambiguities and obscurities, until he couldrally behind him mass support in France for a solution certain to be unwelcome to the extremists of both camps. Even so, insurrections had to be quelled and asequel of terrorism overcome. No critic of the time he took to end the war could put forward any alternative scheme that was more likely to avoid either insurrectionor terrorism. As a mode of leading a country out of an impasse de Gaulle&apos;s policyin Algeria will remain a classical example. As the triumph of empirical statecraftover fanaticism and ideology it throws powerful illumination on his political genius.But no less important than its triumphant empiricism was the wider context of new relationships with the &quot; third world &quot; in which it was the centre-piece. Whatmattered most of all, he maintained, was co-operation with under-developed countries, and aid to them, and the prerequisite was decolonisation carried outgenerously. In September 1961 he commented: La decolonisation est doneau)ourd&apos;hui necessaire. II s&apos;agit de la faire, et nous la faisons. Bien entendu, avechonneur et sans reculer, et en particulier, sans perdre la bataille. II s&apos;agit que&apos; nousla faisons comme les gens pleins de force, tels que nous somm.es. The bitterness ofIndo-China, Syria and Algeria bore sweeter fruit than had ever seemed possible:and the man who carried through this vast change cannot plausibly be charged with(*) A. Werth, The De Gaulle Revolution (1960), pp. 250-259. For relevant excerpts from his speeches in Africa, see De Gaulle Parle, pp. 451-483.
any hardening of the mental arteries or any invincible nursing of prejudices. Hehas, at his best, a soaring vision of the world scene worthy of Churchill or Kennedyat their best. The lesson for interpreting Gaullist foreign policy is both constructiveand hopeful. His growing interest in the Far East in the possible recognition of communist China and in the fate of Vietnam and in Latin America, may bring this world vision more into operation. It need not be assumed to involve the narrowest chauvinism sometimes evident in his European policies.VI.- PROGNOSISA useful distinction can be made between what have been called the structuralchanges which, since about 1950, have transformed the whole nature of the economy and much of society, and the conjunctural changes, brought about by the crises andevents of the French-Algerian war, and such world circumstances as the cold war,nuclear stalemate and the colonial revolution.!1) The former have been consideredabove (Sections III and IV); the latter have been considered mainly in Section V.The structural changes are likely to continue and to have far-reaching effects uponthe French nation&apos;s material prosperity, outlook upon life and modes of behaviour.The conjunctural changes are not only more beyond the control of any one State,but are also more liable to abrupt changes. The future of Gaullism, as the productboth of French and of world conditions in the second half of the twentieth century,will be shaped by the mutual impact of these two sorts of change. president de Gaulle is, by natural bent, more interested in the second than in the first, though he shows every awareness that the first have brought him and his regime greatuncovenanted benefits and a welcome upsurge of power. Gaullism after de Gaullewill have to rely more completely on the flow of technological change, less onmastery of conjunctural events, to retain its appeal.It has been contended above (Sections I and II) that Gaullism lacks deeptaproots in French history, such as are usually claimed for other authoritarianor nationalistic movements like bonapartism, boulangism or monarchism. It maybe noted that such taproots, if they existed, did not give great permanence to either the revived bonapartism of Napoleon III or the abortive follies of GeneralBoulanger; nor did monarchists like Charles Maurras, even at Vichy, establishdurable authority. The most long-lived regime of all, the Third Republic, had noprecedents or pedigree. The impetus, authority and power of Gaullism owe little to any links or affinities with such earlier movements. Those with which it hasclosest affinities the republican nationalism of Gambetta or Clemenceau matteredmore in the years of war and liberation than they matter now, in the days of the fifth Republic. But lack of such taproots does not imply impermanence, anymore than a claim to them ensured permanence. To derive its impetus, as hasbeen argued in this paper, from the peculiar combinations of circumstances and changes of the mid-20th century, may be for Gaullism a more potent guarantee of longevity than any ancient pedigree. If, as is here contended, Gaullism is notto be dismissed as a mere transient consequence of one man&apos;s idiosyncracies, but is the product of a whole phase of recent history, as novel in its nature as thatphase of history itself, then certainly its transience cannot be taken for granted.To see it in this focus is prerequisite to any effort to assess its future; to gaze intothe crystal ball, even with this help, still leaves ample scope for highly disputable anderroneous personal guesswork.The most temporary element in Gaullism is also its most important Charlesde Gaulle himself. He has been content to make ad hoc arrangements necessaryto achieve his ends without being eager to institutionalise and perpetuate his&quot; system&quot;. Even the tailor-made Constitution has been roughly treated andamended in several ways without scruple about niceties of procedure. ministers have been changed with a frequency unrivalled by the two previous Republics,(2)(J) The distinction is suggested by a political theorist, M. Pierre Fougeyrollas, in La Democratic dRefaire (1963), pp. 32-36.(2) M. Mendes France has pointed out that in its first five years the Fifth Republic had seven ministers of Education, three Finance Ministers, seven Ministers of Information, and three Keepers of the Seals,as well as two Prime Ministers: A Modern French Republic, p. 44 (note).
and even Prime Ministers have been treated curtly, more as lightning conductorsfor unpopularity than as key men in a durable regime. The majority party itself is treated with small respect, its congress at Nice in November 1963 not even beingattended by its own hero: and it is plain that the General would, if advantageoffered, discard it and disown it as readily as he shed the R.P.F. If the regimeseems to hang perilously much on the slender thread of an old man&apos;s life, that mustbe assumed to be a fact or at least an appearance which de Gaulle has himselfwilled, for he has made conspicuously little effort to prevent it. One illuminatingline of enquiry is to determine why he has not shown more anxiety to consolidateand perpetuate the system identified with his name.The General has indeed, at times, expressed some anxiety about the fortunesof France after he goes. But such steps as he has taken to provide for successors-most obviously his revision of the procedure for electing Presidents in future-have patently been more concerned with his own manoeuvres to remain in power for a further term than with securing a strong replacement. He has refused even to have a Vice-President. The explanation of his indifference to the future isprobably threefold. On the short run, it greatly strengthens his position that thewhole survival of the regime should depend on his own presence. Secondly, thenational and world problems that press upon him keep him fully preoccupied with the strategy for dealing with them and with the detailed tactics and timing(to which he obviously devotes immense care) of the next moves in the game. Thecommander in the field, fully engaged in conducting the battle, does not greatlyconcern himself with his successor. Thirdly, he believes in empirical methods andknows from his own experience, the wisdom of flexible and pragmatic solutionsfor complex world problems. He regards directions of movement and adeptimprovisation as more important than precise long-term planning. The hazardsof the future remain, after all, concealed from even the greatest of men. De Gaulleis just humble enough to know this, and not to attempt to dictate beyond the grave. His only &quot; political testament&quot; will be the record of his own experiencesand achievements. He will leave no blueprint for the Republic of the future.There are wider reasons, too, why the General is content for the present regimeto keep its curious air of the provisional and the indeterminate. If the forces of authority are left somewhat disparate and unconsolidated, so too are those of opposition: and it is as the supreme &quot; arbiter &quot; that he most likes to see himself,presiding over national destinies, hurling occasional thunderbolts in bouts ofJupiterisme. Not only is the U.N.R. left amorphous in its composition and organisation, not only are the main &quot; public powers&quot; kept loosely jointed, but little effort is made to confirm the grip of one upon the other. Party and Stateare not in any way fused, as they usually were at top levels of the single-partydictatorships. Prefects have not been removed, nor more than normally moved.De Gaulle has a horror of totalitarian arrangements and would vigorously resist any move for a parti unique, just as he condemns any tendencies towards a police State. It is hardly adequate to speak of a &quot; personality cult&quot; in GaullistFrance. His uses of radio, television, Press conference and provincial tours arenever for mere self-publicity, but always serve some specific ends of policy and ofgovernment. They have been turned into intensely practical and efficient devicesof government, enabling the President to enter into direct rapport with the nation as a whole, and even with world opinion. His speech-making tours, in particular,with their sudden plunges into the crowds and his obvious delight in such bainsde joule, bring him evident refreshment of spirit and confidence.It is hardly conceivable that any successor to de Gaulle would or couldperpetuate quite these techniques of government. They, at least, are highly personal and idiosyncratic. What is most to be feared is that any successor to his formidablePresidential powers, who also had aspirations to emulate de Gaulle in his&quot; dialogues&quot; with the people, would produce a mere parody of his methods andwould then relapse to the crudities of a single-party dictatorship lacking theliberality or intelligence of Gaullist rule so far. Clearly such eventualities are possible. It is less clear that they are probable.In a strict sense, there can be no successor to de Gaulle. His personality is asunique as his career is unrepeatable, and there is nobody in sight who couldapproach his stature as a figure of national resistance, authority and power. Thereal Gaullist mystique is not transferable, and it dies with.him. But there will,presumably, be someone who succeeds to his formal Presidential powers and
someone (though not inevitably the same person) who follows him as the realleader of the U.N.R. There will certainly be many who will strive to inherit themantle of Gaullism as a fetish for opening the doors to national support andpolitical authority. But now that Presidential elections will be plebiscitary and notParliamentary, and it is probable that France will have known a decade or more of U.N.R. rule, a swing of the pendulum towards a man of the Left-Centre is farfrom improbable. A Gaston Defferre might win not next time, but next time but one.Although President de Gaulle, and perhaps some eminent Gaullists, accept the regime as impermanent compared with the enduring vitality and supremesignificance of the French nation, they would not concur with the view, assiduouslypropagated by their political opponents,C) that the Fifth Republic is a mere transientinterlude, a personal stop-gap between the collapse of the Fourth and the emergence of a Sixth Republic. The Gaullist notables at least wish it to endure in a form thatwould favour their own prospects of power. To ensure this, they are ready enoughto envisage considerable reforms and adjustments after de Gaulle departs.(2) one must, therefore, expect no willing surrender of power, no ready acquiescence in theabrupt overthrow of a system that will be hallowed by the name of a man by then,because of retirement or death, being acclaimed as the greatest Frenchman of thecentury and the supreme saviour of his country. Both the constitutional measures and the political victories of 1962 indicate every likelihood that de Gaulle means to run again as President, that he is resolved not to subject himself to the fate of aClemenceau or a Churchill in old age, and that he is therefore most likely to die inharness. This would give the immediate political advantage to the party at that moment in power. Presumably (but not certainly) it would be either the U.N.R. ora coalition of amenable and Gaullist-minded parties, anxious to prolong the regime.Unless, therefore, political events should meanwhile force de Gaulle to retire before he would choose to, or precipitate quite unforeseen crises, the probability is that thecircumstances of his going would favour perpetuation of the regime.On the other hand, a further five years or more cf Gaullist rule, in France completing a decade in all must be expected to have brought about considerablechanges of forces and attitudes, quite apart from the chance of some majorupheaval. The speed of social change anywhere is great in the 1960s, and as has been shown France is well advanced along a course of rapid social and economic change which is unlikely, within five years, to have reached its end. So far as the trends ofsuch change can now be determined, they are as described above (Section IV). Theyfavour a continued decline and dissension among the political parties of the Leftand the Centre, as of parliamentary power within the Constitution as a whole: andan increasing reliance on professional, occupational and syndicalist organisationsacting less through political pressure than through direct action upon the workingof the economy and of the executive authorities. There is, as yet, no evident reason why these trends should be checked, still less reversed, within the next few years.If this be so, French opinion would have become inured to parliamentary powerbeing in abeyance, to a more bureaucratic and technocratic system of government,to a certain depolitisation of national administration and public life. But much ofpublic opinion would also be likely to have become accustomed to practices of direct action and pressure, unless de Gaulle had meanwhile reversed this tendency by seeking to canalise occupational pressures into politics by granting them directrepresentation in the Senate, as was at one time contemplated. As the moment ofinevitable relinquishing of power drew nearer, it is likely that even de Gaulle would begin to take steps to ensure a peaceful succession and the survival of the regime;and a reform of the Senate along such lines (or its replacement by a Social Council)would certainly be among the most obvious measures to adopt. On all recentshowing, once de Gaulle resolved to carry through any such reorganisation, hewould be little hampered or outwitted by the Opposition parties, and little resisted by the country as a whole.All such speculation must be inconclusive: but at least one can deduce that theonly safe assumption to make is that Gaullist power and influence will not end withthe departure of de Gaulle; and that Gaullism without him might be more rigid,less empirical, less intelligent, than Gaullism has been under his leadership.(x) e.g., P. Mendes France, op. cit., pp. 19-24.(2) e.g., M. Debre, Au Service de la Nation (1963), Part V.
It is very likely that de Gaulle is trusting to the hope and expectation that,before he gives up power, most of the determining decisions of the near future willhave been made, and the shape of things to come cast into such a mould that theshortcomings of weaker French Governments or the misjudgments of lesser men will not change the essential directions of French national policy at home or abroad.He has already made several such irreversible decisions: the emancipation of the overseas territories, the ending of the war in Algeria and the grant of completeAlgerian independence, the development of nuclear power and weapons in France.Other decisions, if not equally irrevocable, have altered the whole course of events in directions that he wished the reorganisation of the armed forces and of nationaldefence, the rapprochement between France and Germany, the rebuff to Britain&apos;first attempt to enter into membership of the European Economic Community. as has been shown above (Section V) he has various designs in foreign policy which he must be expected to promote as vigorously as circumstances permit in the yearsremaining to him. After the death of President Kennedy he might well feel freer topress on with the implementation of some of these aims : especially, perhaps, since they are among the most basic and irreversible aims, the winning of greater Frenchpower in Europe and greater independence for Europe in the world, and a revival of French interests and importance in the Far East vis-a-vis China and Indo-China,including the formal recognition of Peking by France.On the above analysis and prognosis, the short-term future of Gaullism will depend upon the interaction of the structural and conjunctural changes foreseeablein French life (to use the distinction mentioned at the beginning of this section).The structural changes, being more under control, might well include a reform orreplacement of the Senate along corporative lines, and an attempt to broaden thebasis of parliamentary Gaullism by seeking support or sympathy from neighbouringpolitical groups. There is no reason to suppose that de Gaulle is wedded to theU.N.R. as dependently as it is wedded to him, and he could find positive advantage(and no hesitation) in accepting backing wherever else he chooses within the politicalspectrum. As already shown, his own sympathies and attitudes are cross-bench, and non-party rather than all-party. The structural changes in economic and social life,subject always to governmental success in checking inflation and overcoming theeconomic malaise which raised its head in the fall of 1963, will doubtless follow the pattern laid down in the Fourth Plan for the years 1962-65.0 The effects are likelyto be on one hand a strengthening of those occupational groups already active(Section IV above), on the other a more urgent need to define and develop external relations with France&apos;s European neighbours (Section V above).The conjunctiva! changes, naturally much less controllable or predictable thanthe structural, will for a time yet be strongly influenced by de Gaulle&apos;s majorachievement, the end of the Algerian struggle and the consequent repatriations,military reorganisation, financial aid and so forth. Among the new sets of circumstances within which de Gaulle must frame his policies are the fluctuatingtensions of the triangular relationships of the United States, the Soviet Union and communist China liable to such temporary shocks as American-Soviet incidentsabout Berlin and such crises as the coup in Southern Vietnam in late 1963; and,in Europe, the imponderables of the &quot; Kennedy round &quot; of tariff negotiations ofJanuary 1964 after the death of President Kennedy himself. Given de Gaulle&apos;capacity to keep the large objectives in mind even when apparently engrossed withthe details of short-term and carefully ambiguous operations, policy towardsFrance should rest on a constantly revised analysis of the inter-action between the structural changes outlined above (which are relatively more calculable) and theconjunctural changes brought about by developments in the world situation as awhole. To assume that de Gaulle is fully alive to such interaction, that he hasintelligent measures in mind to take advantage of it, and that he is likely to gethis own way so far as his ministers and public opinion in France are concerned,is the only safe assumption.Even so, there remains a characteristic quality about Gaullism, and aboutCharles de Gaulle himself, which requires that anyone dealing with them must expect the unexpected. No prognosis that is realistic can leave out this dynamicand disturbing element. As suggested above (Section I) Gaullism was born of supreme national crisis, its mood is messianic and it thrives on traditions of heroicO See F. Perroux, Le IVe Plan Frangais, 1962-1965 (1962).CONFIDENTIAL
republican defiance of adversity. As the child of times of troubles, it must beexpected to have a lurking desire that troubles should continue in order to promoteits own vigorous health. So long as de Gaulle sets its tone and dominates its policies,there is sure to be some element of this kind in its make-up. It would not lead tomere adventurism; but it reinforces his preference for the empirical, flexible policyrather than the rigid and doctrinaire strategy. He shows little desire to unify theGaullist party, or to consolidate its hold on the levers of power, or to ensuresuccession to himself, or to substitute for his personal will (which gives it allcoherence and purpose) any more lasting organisation of group control. He haschosen, indeed, to keep Gaullist policy personal, secretive and unpredictable inmethod, almost whimsical in spirit, to an extent that presupposes a deliberateintention to create uncertainty and instability. Such freedom so carefully safeguardedmust be expected to be used. On past experience, it is likely to be used not to launchpolitical adventures but as a tactical political asset, for disconcerting and deceivinghis antagonists (who may include allies engaged in negotiations no less thanrepresentatives of more hostile States), for timing his own moves with great skillin deployment and surprise, and for achieving his own ends without too subtle acounting of the cost in terms of frayed tempers or sense of outrage among nominalallies.Paradoxically, some of this inherent element of uncertainty would be dispersedwhen de Gaulle went. The Gaullists as a whole would have a much more direct interest in consolidating the system, reassuring the public by greater certainty about what they sought to do, and convincing other States that they could continue in power and with well-defined policies. The uncertainties which would doubtlessprevail in the early days of a post-de Gaulle regime would be the inevitableindeterminacies of all history, not the calculated ambiguities of a political tacticianof great skill. They would, accordingly, pass more quickly into calculable factors.Towards Great Britain as such Gaullist policy has some of the inherentambiguity of a love-hate relationship. It seems likely that the General was genuinelysurprised by British reactions to his rebuff of January 1963. That lesson, in itself,may have sunk in and had some effect yet to be seen. Behind the oft-repeatedcharges that Britain remains too insular, maritime and uncontinental to join withallies who, in turn, find France too autocratic, self-centred and insensitive, lies a genuine admiration for British achievements in peace and even more in war.Realisation that France had dangerously isolated herself by de gaulle&apos;s treatmentof not only Britain and her North Atlantic allies, but of the other five within theCommon Market, brought vocal misgivings in France and apparently made someimpact, at least temporarily, on the President himself. His ultimate complaint aboutBritain remains that she is an &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; Power, too prone to claim a special relationship with the United States and to act as a tool of American influence in western Europe. Any evidence that Britain does value links with Europe no lesshighly than her links with North America could bring some real change of heartand mind: and should opportunity arise to give such evidence in any form, it couldchange the present mood of Anglo-French relations.So, too, might any substantial change in Franco-German relations. the succession of Dr. Erhard as Chancellor is sure to bring some change, and could give President de Gaulle the opportunity to readjust the terms of relations betweenthe two countries in closer conformity with those of the Franco-German treaty ofJanuary 1963. The best British counterpart to de Gaulle&apos;s own empirical policy in european affairs is doubtless a no less empirical policy of making the best termspossible with each of the European States, including France, and refusing to nursegrievances about his past policies.
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTEThroughout this paper footnote references have been given both to sources ofthe main evidence and to works quoted or directly relevant to the matter underdiscussion. It may, however, be useful to append a bibliographical note on twolarger themes: the crisis and circumstances of 1958 in which de Gaulle returnedto power, and biographical works about the General himself.A. The Crisis of 1958The two best French accounts, so far, of the crisis of May 1958 are. R. Tournoux: Secrets d&apos;Etat (1960) and the more sensational and pro-Gaullistbook by Merry and Serge Bromberger: Les Treize Complots du Treize Mai (1959).They can be supplemented by several first-hand accounts: e.g., A. de Serigny, LaRevolution du 13 Mai (1958), J. A. Faucher, UAgonie d&apos;un Regime (1959), but thewhole sequence of events is still wrapped in some obscurities.There are valuable accounts in a few American and English books: inJ. H. Meisel, The Fall of the Republic: Military Revolt in France (1962) andE. S. Furniss, Jr., France Troubled Ally: De Gaulle&apos;s Heritage and Prospects(1960); or in P. M. Williams and Martin Harrison, De Gaulle&apos;s Republic (1960);A. Werth, The De Gaulle Revolution (1960); D. Pickles, The Fifth French Republic(1960, 2nd ed. 1962). The special role of the French Army in the whole development is made more comprehensible by Jean Planchais, Le Malaise de VArmee (1958);P. M. de la Gorce, The French Army: A Military-Political History (Eng. trans.1963); and E. Behr, The Algerian Problem (1961). There are shrewd observations on the larger issues in Raymond Aron, France Steadfast and Changing: the Fourthto the Fifth Republic (1960); and in M. Duverger, La Cinquieme Republique (1959),and La Sixieme Republique et le Regime Presidentiel (1961).B. Biographical StudiesThere is a good (but not complete) bibliography of books about General de gaulle in Georges Cattaui, Charles de Gaulle: 1&apos;Homme et son Destin (I960);Cattaui being almost the &quot; official&quot; and accredited biographer, who publishedearlier studies of de Gaulle in 1944 and 1956. The earliest to appear was by PhilippeBarres Charles de Gaulle (1941), rapidly followed by several others, no lesslaudatory, during the war years. All are now out of date. There appeared otherstudies, as hostile as these are laudatory, and equally out-dated. The first Englishstudy was that by the present author (David Thomson, Two Frenchmen: PierreLaval and Charles de Gaulle (1951)), but the 1960s brought a spate of them, none of them entirely satisfactory: S. Clark, The Man who is France (1960); D. Grinnell-Milne, The Triumph of Integrity: A Portrait of Charles de Gaulle (1961) andE. Ashcroft, De Gaulle (1962). His own Memoires remain one of the clearestself-revelations.
