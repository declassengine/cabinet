RATESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the reason for this paperThis subject was last considered by the Cabinet on 5th March (CM. (64) 17thConclusions, Minute 3) when we approved the general lines of a statement whichthe Prime Minister made on that date.2. The Chief Secretary and I have been considering with the Minister of housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland whetherthe fact that a General Election will not be held until the autumn calls for anychange in the Governments approach.Points to be taken into account3. Since 5th March the rate demands for 1964-65 have gone out in Englandand Wales (though not yet in Scotland) and they seem so far to have causedsurprisingly little heat, although this state of affairs may not last and we need tohave our line ready.4. The report of the Allen Committee on the impact of rates cannot now beexpected until the end of July at the earliest. Even then it will only provide us withthe factual information on the impact of rates, and until we know what theproblems in this field are it is of course only possible for the internal Governmentreview on Central and Local Government Finance to make limited progress.5. The scope of the general review is wide-ranging in any case and coversexamination of the likely trend of local expenditure, study of possible improvements in the way in which the main Exchequer Grants are distributed toLocal Authorities and of possible new sources of revenue, and examination ofthe basis of assessment for rates to see if it can be improved either generally orin detail.6. In the light of these factors it should be possible for us to put conclusions to the Cabinet towards the end of this year with a view to legislation in 1965-66.This means that (apart from a straight increase in the total of general grant, whichwould be a very expensive and inappropriate way of seeking to relieve the limited amount of hardship) the changes would not affect rate bills until 1967-68: butthis represents the quickest timetable that is practicable. We could not legislatenext session. We are bound, once we have reached provisional conclusions, to consult local authority opinion which will entail long discussions; and we shall need to publish a substantial White Paper to show that the ground has been thoroughly covered. We have been much criticised for having made only aperfunctory study of the subject in 1957, simply because the resulting White paper was a slight document; we must not make the same mistake again.7. My colleagues and I feel that in these circumstances the only course is tohold firmly to the line which the Prime Minister took in his speech on 5th March,the relevant extract from which is attached. We must decline to be rushed intopremature decisions. And we need to bear in mind that there is no solution to therates problem which will please everyone.

conclusion. We invite the Cabinet to agree that we maintain the line on rates takenby the Prime Minister in his speech on 5th March. I am addressing the CountyCouncils&apos; Association on 27th May at a public meeting, and this will provide asuitable opportunity for me to reiterate Government policy in the context ofnational financial prospects.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,14th May, 1964.EXTRACT FROM THE PRIME MINISTERS SPEECH of 5th MARCH, 1964The Government know very well that many people are worried about theamount they have to pay in rates.2. It is true that the proportion of rates to the national income is less than before the war, and that rates have risen a great deal less than national taxation,but they have nevertheless risen substantially in the last few years. And there is theprospect ahead of large increases in local authority spending, particularly on education. That was emphasised by the Robbins proposals for the expansion of higher Education which we have adopted. I think everyone agrees that this isworthwhile.3. For the immediate future, we have been able to assist the worst cases of hardship caused by revaluation through the Rating (Interim Relief) Bill. Theproblem, however, goes much deeper than this.4. The Government recognise this and we are proceeding towards a solution in two ways: by collecting all this information on hardship from the committee under Professor Allen and simultaneously reviewing within the government machine the relative balance between local and national taxation, with expenditureon education particularly in mind.5. It is clear that some alterations are going to be needed though on whatscale and by what method we cannot judge until we have had the result of theAllen Committee, and the Government review. The object of these operations isnot delay, but to make sure that when we do make a proposal as to the share oftaxation borne by the local and national taxpayer and remember most people are both it will be seen in the light of all the facts to be right and fair.the Exchequer means a greater burden on taxpayers, large numbers of whom would find themselves paying more in rates and taxes than they did before. Evenif we limited the increase in rates in real terms it is virtually certain that ratepayerswill be asked for more in money terms. And whether or not further relief from theExchequer is given we shall almost certainly have to alter the incidence of the rate burden on the taxpayer. This will mean discrimination which will be unpopular with the disappointed.
