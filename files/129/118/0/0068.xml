Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1964CP. (64) 1688th September, 1964CABINETANGLO-FRENCH  MISSILE AGREEMENTNote by the Minister of AviationBy way of background to Press discussion following my signature on 3rd September of a Memorandum of Understanding with the French, my colleagues may wish to see the attached note on the air-to-surface tactical strike weaponA.J. 168.J. A.Ministry of A aviation, W.C. 2,8th September, 1964.BACKGROUND NOTE ON A.J. 168Purpose and Scope of Weapon1. A.J. 168 is an air-to-surface tactical strike weapon with a stand-off range of 20 miles at sea level and twice this at altitude. It will be carried by the TSR. 2,Buccaneer and possibly by the P. 1154 and the Phantom. There are two versions ofthe weapon. One with TV. guidance is for visual homing on to quiet targets (e.g.,parked aircraft, bridges) in fair weather, daylight conditions. The other is an anti-radar weapon for passive homing on to radars in all conditions of weather and light. They form part of the same United Kingdom Operational Requirement(JNASR 1168) to provide strike aircraft with a precision weapon which can be launched without exposing the aircraft to local defences. They are for use primarily in limited war. Both versions will carry high explosive warheads. The UnitedKingdom Requirement calls for the design to be such as to permit subsequentnuclear application if required. This aspect has not been discussed with the Frenchand is not referred to in the Memorandum of Understanding.2. In the anti-radar missile, the homing head will be locked on to the targetbefore launch. In the T.V. missile, visual homing will be provided by a T.V. cameramounted on the missile relaying the picture back to the controlling aircraft by radiolink. The missile will be 14 ft. long with a body diameter of 16 ins. and a high explosive warhead of 330-350 lb.Anglo-French Collaboration3. Anglo-French collaboration on this project stems from discussions last summer between the Secretary of State for Defence and the Minister of Aviationwith M. Messmer, the French Minister of Defence. At that time the Frenchalready had a requirement for an anti-radar weapon for use with their Forcede Frappe while we had an interest in a television guided bomb for use in the tactical strike role. We also had an interest in an anti-radar capability. On therecommendation of the Defence Research Policy Committee, the Secretary ofState, the Chief Secretary and the Minister of Aviation agreed in the autumn of 1963 that a detailed United Kingdom project study should be undertaken Copy. No.   554788
but only as a precursor to an interdependence collaboration with France. shortly after approval of our project study (late 1963) the French began to showincreasing interest in our T.V. proposals and in concluding a joint financialprogramme covering both weapons (A.R. and T.V.), designed to secure themaximum of parts common to both. By early 1964 a satisfactory framework of collaboration had been negotiated. This was embodied in the Memorandum of understanding which the Minister of Aviation signed on 3rd September, 1964.The arrangements provide as far as possible for equal sharing of the development cost and work, the French having prime responsibility for the A.R. weapon andthe United Kingdom for the T.V. weapon.United Kingdom Approval4. Following consideration by officials in May and June 1964 of developmentproposals based on the project study there was an exchange of correspondence between the Secretary of State for Defence and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.Approval to proceed with the development of the project in collaboration with theFrench was given on 27th July, 1964, subject to:(i) United Kingdom not entering into any commitment as regards productionof the weapon.(ii) Development of the T.V. version being subject to rigorous periodicalscrutiny.These provisos have been accepted by the French and taken account of in theMemorandum of Understanding.Estimated Cost and Dates5. The confidential policy estimate of cost to the United Kingdom ofdevelopment in collaboration with the French is  20-24 million; this includes alarge contingency margin which we have disclosed neither to the French nor to united Kingdom industry. The confidential policy date for introduction of the anti-radar missile into service is late 1969 and for the T.V. missile early 1970.United Kingdom Contractual Position6. Project studies have been completed. Holding contracts have been placed to cover the interim development phase. Negotiations for the full developmentcontracts are now in train. Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Ltd. are the co-ordinatingcontractor for the T.V. missile with Marconi W.T. Co., responsible for the T.V.guidance.Recent Publicity7. Mr. Cronin, in a speech on 1st September, referred to the imminent signing of an Anglo-French agreement to develop at a cost of  100 million a medium rangeair-to-surface missile carrying a nuclear warhead. The Minister of Aviation at hisPress conference on 3rd September corrected the misconceptions about the range and nuclear warhead. He made it clear that the warhead is to be conventional andthat the development cost to the taxpayer will be less than  25 million.Ministry of Aviation,8th September, 1964.
