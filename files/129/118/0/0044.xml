cabinet supply EXPENDITURE, 1965-66Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and PaymasterGeneralIn CP. (64) 143, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I draw attention to theserious increase in expenditure now forecast in the next few years. In this paper i should like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the more immediatequestions raised by the forecast of Supply expenditure in 1965-66 which has beenmade, based on costings as submitted for the Defence Budget now being discussed between the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury and the forecasts prepared by departments as part of this year&apos;s survey of public expenditure. Taking into accountthese figures, and the experience of recent years, it appears that the budget estimates for 1965-66 are likely to total about  7,100 million when they are presented next February, an increase of about  550 million, or 8 - 4 per cent, overthe Budget Estimates for 1964-65.2.   The following is the basis of this forecast:  millionDepartmental forecasts (see Annex)       ...... 6,914Allowance for increases in pay and prices, policy changes, etc................      175-200say   7,1003. The departmental forecasts and the defence costings are on the basis ofthe rates of pay and prices used in preparing the 1964-65 Budget Estimates. Inaddition an allowance must be made for increases in pay and prices, policy changes and the miscellaneous additional items of expenditure which experience showsinvariably arise between this time of the year and the presentation of the following year&apos;s Estimates. In previous years the total of the departmental forecasts madeat this time of the year has invariably been less than the subsequent budget estimates.4. Increases in the provision for public service pay next year seem likely to total some  95 million. An allowance must be made for price increases of the orderof 3-3^ per cent on that part of Supply expenditure likely to be affected, and forsome policy changes and miscellaneous items. In addition, in order to put B.O.A.C.on a commercial footing,  30- 60 million, depending on the decision taken, will berequired from Votes to meet the additional cost of flying Super YClOs. In all itseems reasonable to assume a total addition to the submitted forecasts of the orderof  175- 200 million.IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

5. The forecast for 1965-66, in terms of size and increase over the previoyear, compares with recent years as follows:Budget      PercentageEstimates   increase over  million   previous year1956-57         .......	3,960	2-61957-58         .......	4,070	2-81958-59        .......	4,259	4-61959-60        .......	4,490	5-51960-61         .......	4,907	7-21961-62        .......	5,187	5-71962-63         .......	5,612	8-21963-64	6,139	9-41964-65        .......	6,549	6-71965-66 (forecast)	7,100	8-46. The likelihood of total Budget Estimates totalling  7,100 million in 1965-66,an increase of 8-4 per cent, shows that the current rate of increase in supply expenditure from year to year is being maintained at a level substantially higherthan that assumed in our calculation of total public expenditure over the next fourt five years. The increase of 8 - 4 per cent represents an increase of about 6 per cent at constant prices. This compares with the annual average increase in total public expenditure of 4 -1 per cent at constant prices over the period 1963-64 to 1967-68which we showed in last year&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd. 2235). It would also be the biggest percentage increase since 1951-52 (Korean War), if one excepts 1963-64when in very different economic circumstances certain expenditures were deliberately increased.7. Last year, in my paper on the forecast for 1964-65 (E.A. (63) 115) I asked mycolleagues to accept that constraint of the growth of the Estimates was a majorobjective of Government policy. I must again appeal for the utmost economy to beexercised in the framing of the Estimates for 1965-66, and in particular for restraint in the putting forward of proposals for new services.J. A.
