Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.22nd July, 1964CP. (64) 155 COPY NO. j5]L22ndJuly, 1964CABINETSTATIONING COSTS IN germany memorandum by the Chief Secretary to J&amp;gJTj^sutjland Paymaster general at their meeting on 17th July (CM. (64) 39th Conclusions,Minute 2) the Cabinet authorised further discussions with representativesof the Federal Government of Germany on stationing costs &quot;to seek toreach agreement for a two-year period on the basis of a formulawhereby the Federal Government would undertake in general terms to do their best to offset by their military and civil purchases the continuingburden on our balance of payments arising from our military expenditurein Germany, together with, an additional undertaking that the federal government would so direct their defence procurement planning in the longer term that their defence orders might offset this expenditure. &quot;2.       These discussions have now taken place and have resulted in adraft Agreement and a draft of a confidential exchange of letters on theuse of the Arms Deposit Account - both attached.    These documentshave been worked out by United Kingdom and German officials and theyare now being submitted for consideration by the two Governments.3.       The Federal German Cabinet considered them this morning andI understand that they approved them without amendment.4,       The draft Agreement is not as good as it might be, but it is better than having no Agreement at all.    It meets the two objectives which the Cabinet had in mind at their last discussion as set out inparagraph 1 above.    It also avoids any reference to a limit on theamount of German offset expenditure, i. e. the Germans have nowdropped their previous proposal that there should be a confidentialexchange of letters whereby v/e would recognise that they were unlikely to be able to make purchases at a higher level than DM. 350 million(approximately  30 million) a year.5.       In my view this is the best Agreement that v/e are likely to getand I recommend my colleagues to approve it.J.A.B-C.
