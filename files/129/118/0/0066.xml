A NEW INITIATIVE ON INCOMES policy memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster GeneralRecent economic events have underlined the dependence of our economic policies upon a vigorous increase of exports and the necessity for our costs and prices to remain competitive. The most important of the many factors determiningour costs is the rate of increase of incomes; but progress to date in securing an agreed incomes policy has been disappointingly slow. The deterioration of our balance of payments makes it essential that we should move forward more rapidly,and it seems inevitable that we shall have to approach both sides of industry afterthe Election with a view to getting a more precise basis for the implementation of incomes policy. Up till now the approach to industry has been made through theNational Economic Development Council (N.E.D.C.). But it seems doubtful ifthis body, whose members do not serve as representatives and which has many other tasks to perform is capable of taking the matter much further. In order tomake solid progress we shall need to deal with representatives who are in a positionto make a bargain.2. It has been suggested that since incomes policy has unpleasant associationsthere would be more chance of success if the subject were treated as part of a wider theme improving industrial efficiency and productivity, getting rid of restrictive practices and modernising the economy generally. But the study of thiswider subject is the proper job of the N.E.D.C., whose prestige would be severely damaged if it were by-passed by a direct approach to industry on so wide a front.Moreover, the need to make progress with incomes policy is urgent and the moresubjects with which it is associated the longer the job will take. For these reasons,my conclusion is that our best course would be to invite representatives ofboth sides of industry to join the Government in a conference confined to thesubject of incomes policy as such.3. If it is accepted that an initiative of this kind will need to be taken afterthe Election, the question arises whether it should be announced beforehand. Infavour of such an announcement is that it would fill a gap in the presentation ofour economic policies. Moreover, if we say nothing about it, but none the lesscall a conference immediately after the Election, we may be charged with havinghidden something unpleasant which we knew we were going to have to do. against an announcement now, is the argument that if the intention to call such a conference is announced in the present Election atmosphere, the unions may react against it and crystallise their attitudes to such an extent that it would be most difficultto move them later on. On balance I am in favour of an announcement beforethe Election. This was also the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ view and the draft statement annexed to this memorandum was prepared on the Chancellor^instructions before he left for Tokyo.4. If it is agreed that an announcement should be made before the Electionwe have to consider its form and timing. Undoubtedly the maximum impact wouldbe secured if the announcement were made by the Prime Minister at the Party Rallyon the 12th September. So direct an association with the Election atmosphere might,however, increase the risk that the trade unions would react badly. Moreover someof my colleagues feel strongly that nothing should be said before the Election dateCopy No.57Printed for the Cabinet. September 1964CP. (64) 1668th September, 1964CABINET4785
has been announced. The alternative would be for the Chancellor of the exchequer to make the announcement, either as a statement, with an accompanying press conference, or in a speech.5.   I seek the views of my colleagues on: -(a) Whether the intention to call a Conference on Incomes Policy should be announced before the Election. s   a(b) When and how such an announcement should be made: &apos;      &apos; r* ,J. A. B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.7th September,. 1964.. ..  annex draft STATEMENT ON INCOMES policy. I have repeatedly emphasised that steady expansion will depend upon a vigorous increase of exports and that this can be achieved in the growing marketsopen to us if, but only if, our costs and prices remain competitive. Recent eventshave underlined these facts.2. The most important among the many factors that determine our costs isthe level of incomes. It is undeniable that success in overseas markets will dependon achieving an effective incomes policy, that is a policy under which incomesrise, but prices do not rise as a result, because the increase in money incomes is related to the growth of productivity. Such a policy cannot in a free society be imposed by the Government. It must depend on conscious acceptance of theprinciples involved by employers and trade unions as well. The only alternative is deliberately to run the economy at a much lower level of demand and a much higher level of unemployment. This policy has its supporters, but I do not agreewith them. To accept it would be a counsel of despair, the deliberate acceptanceof wasted resources and inadequate growth because we could not as a countrymeasure up to the responsibility and self-discipline required by vigorous and continuous expansion.3. So far the Government have made considerable efforts in N.E.D.C. and elsewhere to achieve agreement on such a policy. The results have not beennegligible. Prices in the United Kingdom have risen a good deal less in the last twoyears than on the Continent. There is a much wider understanding of the natureof the problem. N.E.D.C. and N.I.C. have both in their respective spheres madea contribution to this, N.E.D.C. being concerned with the general principles and in.I.C. with particular cases. But they cannot be expected to carry all theresponsibility for finding a solution. N.E.D.C. is limited by its constitution and incomes policy is only one among the many problems it has to tackle: N.I.C. hasbeen greatly handicapped by the trade union boycott. The Government therefore consider that a new step is needed to tackle the problem on a wider and moresystematic basis.4. The Government intend therefore as soon, as the Election is over to calla National Conference and to invite representatives of the T.U.C. and of employers&apos;bodies to join in it with Ministers with the object of reaching agreement on theprinciples of an effective and acceptable incomes policy and on a system to carry it out in practice. It will be clearly in the interests of all parties to the Conference andof the nation as a whole that this Conference should succeed.5. The problems to be considered by the Conference fall under two heads.First the principles involved and secondly the best methods of ensuring in a democratic society that these principles are implemented in practice.
6. Clearly the basic principle must be to try and ensure that incomes as awhole do not rise faster than national productivity. The same general principles should apply to all categories of income, even though some categories have agreater share of total incomes than others. There are two sets of problems: first the relative movements of different types of income, and secondly, the relative position of different groups within each category of income. Under the first headit is necessary to take into account the fact that different types of income are determined in different ways and that some fluctuate while others do not. Underthe second head, it is necessary to consider how to bring about, consistently withthe basic objective, those changes in relativities which experience shows become necessary to maintain essential services, to permit the more efficient developmentof the economy as a whole, and are in the interests of fairness.7. Principles would be useless unless they were made effective in practicalterms and unless the results of applying them were generally agreed to be fair and desirable. Here responsibility rests on all three parties, Government, employersand unions. The Government has already accepted responsibility for creating ageneral environment conducive to the success of incomes policy by maintaining apolicy of steady growth, by encouraging competition as a means of keeping downprices and by a readiness to use the tax system to redress the balance if, for example,restraint on the part of wage-earners should lead to a relatively unfair growth of profits. Employers must accept responsibility for using increases in productivity tobring prices down and for resisting the temptation to increase wages and salarieswhere this would merely mean higher prices for the public. Unions must accept that an effective incomes policy, which is compatible with our national needs andwith the fair treatment of particular groups, requires new priorities in the field of wage bargaining as of income determination generally.8. The Government proposes to set in hand immediately the preparations for this Conference. There is a great deal of work to be done to produce thenecessary agenda. The Conference will clearly take some time on the problems involved and may wish to set up special working parties. It will be essential asthe basis of its work to have available all the information possible from experience in this country and abroad; for example the recent movement of prices, costs and incomes in this country; a clear analysis of the various factors that influenceprices, and the lessons to be drawn from the work of N.E.D.C. and N.I.C.There is also a great deal to be learnt from experience in other countries. MostWestern industrial countries are engaged in the same search for an effectiveincomes policy. The Government intend to prepare a thorough study both ofwhat has been happening in individual countries in Europe and elsewhere andalso of the results obtainable from studies by such international bodies asO.E.C.D. A full analysis and digest of all this information will be prepared asthe basis for the work of the National Conference.
