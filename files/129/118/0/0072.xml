M, (64) 48th Conclusions, Minute 4), theChancellor made in a speech at Barnet on 24th September.(Signed)  BURKS trend cabinet Office, S.W. 128th September, 1964
ECONOMIC situation the last ten years have seen great economic progress, more,in  act, than in the fifty years that went before,   But it is theGovernments determination to ensure that our progress is evenfaster and that the rate of advance is steady.   It was with this end inview that we readily accepted in the spring of last year the target of a 4 per cent growth rate that had been worked out by the national economic Development Council which includes representatives ofunions and management as well as Government.   Since then our progress has been encouraging.   Between the first half of 1963 and the first half of this year output rose by some 6 per cent - well ahead of target.At the moment the rate of advance is less, as indeed was inevitablewhen we no longer had so much slack in the economy to take up.   But,in my judgement, the rate of expansion by the end of this year shouldbe round about 4 per cent.   There is evidence on all sides to confirmthis:  the continuing high level of employment: the great increase in output of steel, for example: the record level of orders for theengineering industry, which is the biggest single element in our economy: the excellent harvest prospects this autumn - all this andthe big build-up of work in progress in the heavier sections of industry,together with record levels of investment in factories, plant and machinery, is clear evidence of a country still vigorously expanding.The Government believe therefore that the N. E.D. C. target of an average rate of growth of 4 per cent can be attained.   We havedone our part.   Since we accepted the target we have, for example,greatly improved tax incentives to new investment! revolutionisedthe situation in the development districts by a new system of grants and tax allowances; introduced our new Industrial Training Act and continued the great emphasis on education, particularly technical education.   In addition my two Budgets of 1963 and 1964 were bothdeliberately based on the work of the N.E.D.C.:  the 1963 Budgetbeing designed to achieve expansion at a vigorous rate and to take upthe slack in the economy, and the 1964 Budget being designed tomaintain expansion and to relieve the danger of renewed inflation.   Ithink it can be fairly claimed that while the economy is very heavilyloaded there are not the acute bottlenecks and widespread labourshortages there have been on previous occasions.   In other words,though the economy is running full out, there are not yet signs ofoverheating.But to maintain this position a number of conditions must be fulfilled.   In the first place we must resist the temptation to heapfurther loads upon an economy already carrying as much as it can beexpected to bear.   Secondly the present high level of savings is makinga great contribution to the stability of prices and must be maintained and indeed encouraged, and we have plans for further stimulatingprivate saving.   Third, and most important of all, we must ensure thatour costs and prices remain competitive.   This has always been thecondition of economic success.   We can maintain the momentum ofour advance:  of that I have no doubt: but we can maintain it only ifwe take vigorous action to keep our industry competitive.   This means a constant drive for greater efficiency; a new effort to sweep away-1-comf&amp;BEMT1AL
unnecessary restrictions on output and efficiency such as the over-manning of some industries or restrictions on entry into differentoccupations and a further determined national effort to establish an effective incomes policy.   No Government can, in a democraticsociety, produce an incomes policy by itself.   A Government cannotcompel or settle by law the level of incomes.   It must be a jointeffort by Government, management and unions.   We have made itclear that we accept that the principles of any incomes policy - andby this I mean a policy designed to ensure that real incomes rise,but that prices do not as a result also rise - must apply to all formsof income.   We have stated categorically that, if as a result of restraintby other sections of the community profits should rise unduly, v/ewould restore the balance if necessary by fiscal means.   We have set the stage for expansion and we will, after the Election, ask manage -rnent and unions once again to join with us in adding this essential part to our economic structure.   So much depends upon it.   So muchcan be achieved by the people of this country with the knowledge thatscience is bringing us, allied to our traditions of invention andtechnical excellence.   But it will not be achieved without effort.I have made it clear on more than one occasion that the launchinand maintenance of our 4 per cent growth target would involve in 1964a deficit on our balance of payments.   Imports were certain to riseearlier than exports.   Moreover as I said in my Budget Speech, thisyear of 1964 will also be a year of relatively high capital investmentabroad.   In fact it has been much affected by one very big and quiteunique transaction that took place in the first part of the year andhas now been completed.   We expected to see the rise in importsslackening off, as indeed has happened.   It must not be forgotten that import prices rose 5 per cent since we accepted the growthtarget.   Fortunately this rise is now flattening out.   It seems clearmoreover that some of the high level of imports is due to stock-building.But the key to success lies in our export performance.   I have said that the figures for some months this summer were disappointing:,Last month showed a definite improvement.   There is much evidence to support the belief that exports will be rising in the months ahead.The level of export orders in the engineering industry, which covers a very important part of our total export trade, has never been as high as it is today.   Export orders for British steel are at a recordlevel and industries such as chemicals and motor cars are reportinggood export prospects.   There are therefore solid grounds for belief that exports will expand and it is upon this expansion of exports thatour success depends.   I have said that this will be a testing time.It is.   It is a testing time of our determination and our confidence inourselves and our success will depend upon our ability to deliverexports and to maintain competitive prices.   There is no doubtwhatever that success lies v/ithin our own grasp if we have the energy and determination and the self-restraint to achieve it.24th September, 1964-2-
