SECRET^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF MER BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1964CP. (64) 103 Copy No.    7 212th May, 1964CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME, 1964-65Memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Future Legislation Committee have considered the Bills suggested by ministers for inclusion in the Legislative Programme for 1964-65 and have discussed them with the Ministers concerned. Wherever possible, particularly in list B of the Main Programme of Bills, the Committee have tried to includeBills which contribute to the industrial and economic modernisation of the country.In the list annexed the Bills have been provisionally classified under the following heads:A.l. EssentialA.2. ContingentB. Main ProgrammeC. Bills in reserveD.-Other BillsP. Bill suitable for a Private Member2. It has been assumed that all the Bills already introduced will be obtainedthis Session and that no provision need be made on this account. On the otherhand, we must expect that as policy develops some fresh Bills will emerge whichit will be imperative to add to the programme.3. On the best estimate that can be made at present the Essential, Contingentand Main Programme Lists would provide us with a full programme for the session, even allowing for the fact that we might not in the event be in a positionto do Fugitive Offenders or Channel Tunnel, and that until policy decisions havebeen taken some doubt must attach to National Insurance and redundancy payments.4. The Secretary of State for Industry would like to see provision made inthe Main Programme for the Bill on Local Employment. Some of my colleaguesthink that the Bill on Companies (to implement recommendations of the JenkinsReport on Company Law) should be preferred. Both these Bills are at the moment in List C, and we can perhaps consider further whether room can be found for either in the programme when we have decided our policy on the two matters.5. The programme will be considered further when the terms of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament are being settled. Meanwhile I seek theapproval of the Cabinet for the provisional programme I have described.S. L.Whitehall, S.W.1,12th May, 1964.4329
