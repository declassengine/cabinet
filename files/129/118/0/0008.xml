/ SECRET/    -    .(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. P. (64) 108&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;25th May, 1964CABINETBEEF, prices memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food the Present PositionPrices of beef have been rising since the end of 1963 and havereached record levels in the past week.   But the recent rise has notbeen nearly so spectacular as some of the press reports might suggest.   The wholesale price of both home-killed and Argentinebeef last week was Zjd. a lb. above the average for April and about1. Od. a lb. above the very low prices ruling just over a year ago.2.       The rise is due to a combination of two circumstances.   Thefirst is a shortage of Argentine exports caused by the drought of1962-63.   Since mid-February our imports from the Argentine havebeen short by about 1, 000 tons a week.   Secondly, in western european countries, where demand for beef has been rising with increasing prosperity, there has been a drop in production in the early months of this year.   These countries, formerly highly restrictive of meat imports, have removed restrictions and are now seeking supplies in all parts of the world.3.       Until recently, our exports of beef were too small to have a significant effect on prices.   In January-March, for example, exportsto the Continent (both as carcase meat and on the hoof) amounted tothe equivalent of 650 tons of beef a week, compared with a total consumption of beef in the United Kingdom of around 25, 000 tons aweek.   In April, the average rose to about 800 tons a week, and itmay now have reached about 1, 000 tons a week.   If so, exports cannot longer be passed off as insignificant.4.      My estimate of supplies of beef and other carcase meat inthe present April-June quarter compared with a year ago is asfollows:1963       1964April-June (thousand tons)Beef 314. 8(1)  297.5(2)Other carcase-meat and offal 314.1      327.6Poultry 64.0     j66.j)Total supplies 692. 9     691.1(1)   After allowing for exports to Continent of 1. 5 aslive cattle and 0.5 as beef.(2)   After allowing for assumed exports to Continent of 7. 8as live cattle and 1. 5 as beef.-1-SECRE?
So, although beef supplies are down by 5 per cent, total supplies ofcarcase meat and poultry are virtually the same as a year ago.   Onthe other hand, we would like to have seen another 10-15, 000 tons to allow for the upward trend in consumption.The Outlook5.       The shortage of Argentine beef seems likely to continue for mostif not all the present year, though I believe Argentina will makestrenuous efforts to keep the trade going and preserve their long termposition in our market.   Continental demand is less easy to predict,but prices here are still much lower than on the Continent and continental buying is not likely to be reduced before the autumn andmight easily increase.   Home production between July and December islikely to be seasonally lower than in the first half of the year, but up tothe level of the corresponding period in 1963.   YiTe would expect the preselevel of imports to be broadly maintained.   In the immediate futurethere will be the usual temporary shortage of home supplies until thegrass fed cattle begin to come out in greater numbers towards theend of June and prices may well continue to rise in the meanwhile.Our best guess is that they should then steady and start to fall.   Butif Continental countries should step up their buying over here thiswould not happen and prices would remain uncomfortably high.Y/hat Can We Do About It ?6.      In recent months I have seen, or sent messages to,representatives of all our traditional suppliers urging upon them theimportance of maintaining regular supplies.   For the time beingsupplies from Iron Curtain countries have been freed from quota.Our importers are, I know, seeking supplies wherever they can befound.   We might get some from theU.S. A. but I doubt our total supplies will be higher than the figure in paragraph 4 above.7.      Ought v/e to ban or discourage exports ? As I see it, thearguments in favour of doing so are:-(i) Exports are no longer insignificant in supply terms and to restrict them v/ould have a steadying effecton prices.(ii)    The export of British cattle or beef enables foreignconsumers to benefit from our agricultural supportsystem which has maintained relatively low prices and a free market at the expense of the taxpayer.8.       The General arguments against taking such action are:-(i)   It would be contrary to general trade policy and toour general trade interests which are to keepmoving freely.SECREY
(ii)    It would, at least in the longer term, divert Continentalbuyers to countries supplying us with imports (e. g.the Irish Republic) and thus reduce our imports, sothat in the end we should be little better off.Nevertheless, in the short term we might have a netgain, since supplies could not be diverted immediately,and in some cases (e.g. Southern Hemisphere suppliers)it might take some months before fresh arrangements could be made.(iii)    We want to keep our foot in the door, since exportscould have a valuable firming effect on the market in times of glut.(iv)   Very considerable difficulties would arise if it were decided to stop the exports of cattle from NorthernIreland to the Irish Republic or the small but valuabletrade from Northern Ireland to the U.S.A.   On theother hand, if exports to the Irish Republic were notrestricted, there would be a considerable loopholethrough which British cattle could still go to theContinent.9.      Any attempt to obtain a drawback of the subsidy on exportedcattle would be ineffective and troublesome for the following reasons:-(i)    The subsidy is already small and will get smaller overthe coming weeks,(ii)   Only a minority of cattle exported to the Continentattract subsidy.(iii)   Once the principle of a drawback had been accepted,there would be difficulty in discontinuing it although itwould be against our interests to discourage exportswhen prices were low.(iv)   The subsidy varies considerably from week to weekand it would be impossible to recover exactly thesubsidy paid on each animal.(v)   It would be impossible for Her Majesty&apos;s Customs to distinguish between subsidised and unsubsidisedcarcases at the point of export-3
(vi)   Legislation -would be required - though it might bepossible to do it through the Finance Bill i  adecision were taken immediately,10.     Some of these difficulties would be overcome if a somewhatarbitrary tax were levied on exports.   But this would require legislation too, and if any action had to be taken, I would prefer a straight prohibition (or quota) which could be operated under existing legislation and with existing machinery, which would be morepredictable in its effects and which could be lifted as soon as it wasno longer required.Conclusion11.      On the present assessment of the supply situation for meatas a whole, it does not seem to me that placing restrictions or a prohibition now on the export of beef would be justified^   But it willbe necessary to keep a close watch on the position and if the levelof exports to the Continent show signs of increasing much further, or if prices rise very far above their present levels, we would haveto take action.   I have arranged to get through my vets at the portsweekly reports on the numbers of live cattle exported to theContinent (unfortunately weekly figures for exports of carcase meat from Her Majesty&apos;s Customs and Excise seem to be impracticable).I will of course refer to my colleagues again if the situation lookedlike getting out of hand.C.S.Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food, S.W. i25th May, 1964-4-
