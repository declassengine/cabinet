FIRST REPORTOF the inquiry INTO THE PRICING-OFMINISTRY OF AVIATION CONTRACTS15th July. 196U(Cmnd. )
Qe Rt. Hon. Reginald Maudling, M.P.,ancellor of the Exchequer.The Rt, Hon, Julian Amery, M.P.,Minister of Aviation.1.     On 24th January, 1964, you appointed me, in conjunction withMr. H.W. Hobbs, C.B.E., M.I. Mech. E,, Deputy Controller of royal ordnance Factories and Mr. J.D. Russell, M.A., F.C.A., of messrs. Binder, Hamlyn &amp; Co. to conduct an inquiry into certainMinistry of Aviation contracts with Ferranti Ltd.     Our terms ofreference are:&quot;To investigate the circumstances in which the prices agreed by the Ministry of Aviation for a contract for the supply ofguided weapons may have allowed an excessive pr^ofit to the firm concerned j    and to recommend v/hether any changes in organisation or procedure are necessary to ensure betterassessment of prices for similar contracts in future.&quot;We were appointed when the Comptroller and Auditor General&apos;s Reporton the Ministry of Aviation Appropriation Account, 1962-63,indicated that for certain guided weapon contracts the sum totalof the amounts included for direct labour and overheads in the agreed prices, relating to production up to 31st March, 1 961 ,exceeded by 70 per cent, or  2.7 million, tho total direct labour andoverhead costs for that period as furnished by the Ministry&apos;saccountants, although the accountants&apos; figures had been availablewhen the prices were fixed.     The guided weapon contracts to whichthe Comptroller and Auditor General was referring were fivecontracts placed with Ferranti Ltd. for the production of equipmentconnected with the Mk. I Bloodhound guided weapon system.2.     We have interpreted our terms of reference as relating to allthe contracts placed with Ferranti Ltd. by the Ministry of Aviation(or its predecessor in this respect, the Ministry of Supply) forthe production of Mk. I Bloodhound equipments;    there were fortysuch contracts,3.     Much as we welcomed the decision of Ferranti Ltd. on27th April, 1964, to open their books and records to us because itenables us to be more definite in our findings, this development has prevented us from covering the full scope of the Inquiry beforenow.     We were aware of the desire of the House of Commons for as early a report as possible and we undertook to produce an interimreport covering the first part of our task by mid-July.     This was announced in Parliament on 3rd June, 1.9.64.     Accordingly, thisreport deals primarily with the circumstances which led to the highprofit on these contracts:    some reference is made to improvements in organisation or procedure which are being made or will have tobe made but in general we shall cover the second part of our termsof reference in a second report which is unlikely to be ready beforethe autumn.Conduct of the,Inquiry4.     From the outset we were given complete access to the papers and personnel of the Ministry of Aviation who have collaboratedwell with us.     Since 27th April, 1964, we have had access to the books and records of Ferranti Ltd.     We have taken written and oral evidence from both parties and from the Ministry of Defence (navy department).     It is right to record that Ferranti Ltd. have1
(Collaborated well with us in our investigation of their books and records making available to us all the information we have demanded,save in a few instances, in which, as they explained, the informa-tion never existed or no longer exists.5.     Our findings are summarised in paragraph 6e     The remainder of this report falls into three parts:    in paragraphs 7-38 wereport facts;    in paragraphs 39-6U. we report the views we have formed and our conclusions;    and in paragraphs 65-71 we reportour observations on the conduct of the Ministry of Aviation andof Ferranti Ltd.Summary of Findings6.     Our findings can be summarised as follows:(a) Factors contributing directly to the excessive profitwere:(i)    estimates of direct labour costs were too high(paragraphs UO-Uh).     Taking overheads intoconsideration this accounted for nearly  5 million of the profit.(ii)    the overhead rate was too high (paragraph k5) *(iii)    basing of prices on estimated costs at a latestage in production (paragraphs h6-U8)B(iv)    failure of the Ministry to use information avail-able to it on the level of actual direct labour costs (paragraphs h-9-51).(v)   Ferranti Ltd. did not disclose that direct labourestimates were too high (paragraphs 52 and 53).(b) Factors that might have contributed to the excessiveprofit were:(i)    insufficient attention was given to the division of costs between direct and indirect charges(paragraphs 55-58).(ii)    failure to show on the Allocation Sheet theexistence of a productivity bonus chargeable as&apos;indirect&apos; and careless verification of the earnings rates (paragraphs 59 and 60).(iii)    failure to bring to notice the profit information contained in financial statements relating toFerranti Ltd. (paragraph 61).(iv)    lack of knowledge in the Contracts Directorate ofthe bases of the technical cost estimates andoverhead rates (paragraph 62).(v)    staffing difficulties (paragraphs 63 and 6U).(c) Criticisms of the Ministry:(i)    undue reliance was placed on technical costestimates (paragraph 66).2
(ii)    lack of effective collaboration &quot;between the directorate of Technical Costs and the directorate of Accountancy Services (paragraphs 66 and 67).(iii)    lack of direction and lack of drive to make the best use of the Ministry&apos;s resources (paragraphs 66-68).(d)    Criticisms of Ferranti Ltdo:(i)    submission of quotations and agreement of prices which they knew were likely to yield profits that could not be regarded as fair and reasonable.This applies especially to the quotation for thefinal batch of missile equipments (paragraphs 37?52 and 71).(ii)    we do not accept as valid the arguments by whichFerranti Ltd. have sought to justify a profit whichwe can only regard as excessive (paragraph 53)*PART I - The TactsThe ..si2e^of the profit7.     Our examination of the records of Ferranti Ltd. has revealedthat the firm made a profit of  5,772,96h on forty contracts forwhich the total value of the agreed prices was  12,82h,073.     Thisprofit represented 82% on costs and h5&apos;p on selling prices.Appendix 1  to this report shows how the costs on these contractsdiffered from the composition of the agreed prices, resulting inthe profit mentioned.     A ppcndix 2 shows similar information forthe two biggest contracts       These figures of costs and profit(l)have been agreed with Ferranti Ltd. who have, however, urged thatit is not right to consider the profits on a project of this kindin isolation from consequential costs which might arise after its completion and from profits on other work within the company.The, two main contracts8.     We have concentrated our attention on the two contracts whichare mentioned in Appendix 2, one for the manufacture of equipmentcontained in the Mk. I Bloodhound missile itself and the other forthe manufacture of ground equipment associated with the launching of the missile.     We shall refer to these as the missile contract and the ground equipment contract.     Together they accounted for about 75^ of the value of the forty contracts.     Both contractswere placed in the second half of 1956:    they contained the clause(reproduced at Appendix 3) which says, in essence, that the contractor will be paid fair and reasonable prices which will beagreed between the Ministry and the contractor.     At the time thatthese production contracts were placed development work was still proceeding on separate contracts with Ferranti Ltd.     In view ofthis the production contracts stipulated that there was to be nomanufacture or purchase of parts and components without the writtenauthority of the Ministry.     The Ministry gave its authority in comparing the figures in this report with those previouslypublished it should be remembered that the earlier figuresrelated to production up to 31st March, 1 961.3
(gPece-meal as development work, progressed and designs becamefrozen.     It was not until the second half of 1957 that a sufficiently large part of the design had been frozen as to enablethe Ministry to start estimating the costs of the materials and the direct labour that would be needed to fulfil the contracts    this,in effect, v/as when the price-fixing process started.The Ministry&apos;s price-fixing, machinery9.     The Ministry of Aviation places the responsibility for theagreement of contract prices upon its Contracts Directorates.These are staffed by members of the Executive and Clerical Classesof the Civil Service:    the negotiation of prices falls to theExecutive Class staff.     To assist them in determining whetherprices are fair and reasonable they can call upon the services ofthe Directorate of Technical Costs and the Directorate ofAccountancy Services.     The Directorate of Technical Costs, staffedmainly by members of the Engineer Class and the Technical Class ofthe Civil Service is principally concerned with estimating, at therequest of the Contracts Directorates, the costs of the materials,bought-out parts and direct labour that are likely to be incurred in the production of equipment against specific Ministry contracts.These estimates are supplied to the Contracts Directorates.     the directorate of Accountancy Services, staffed mainly by professionalaccountants who are members of the Accountants Class of the CivilService, is principally concerned with accountancy investigationsaimed for the most part at establishing the relationship between a contractor&apos;s direct labour costs and his overhead costs.     Theresults of these accountancy investigations are reported to the contracts Directorates and an overhead rate recommended, thisusually being the overhead costs expressed as a percentage of the direct labour costs.     The Contracts Directorates negotiate prices with contractors having regard to the advice which they havereceived on the estimated costs of materials, bought-out parts and direct labour and on the overhead rate that should be applied toallow for a proper recovery, in prices, of a firm&apos;s overhead costs.The Contracts Directorates also negotiate a profit margin to beapplied to costs.10.   There are two Contracts Directorates;    only one of them was concerned with the Mk. I Bloodhound contracts.     Both of the contracts Directorates and the Directorate of Technical Costs form part of the Ministry of Aviation&apos;s Contracts Division which is controlled by an Under-Secretary (Contracts).     The Directorate ofAccountancy Services has been brought into the Contracts Divisionsince 1st July, 196U:    until then, and at the time of theMk. I Bloodhound pricing, it was in the Ministry&apos;s Finance Divisioncontrolled by an Under-Secretary (Finance).     Some details of the staffing of the Directorates of Contracts, Technical Costs andAccountancy Services are at Appendix h.Technical cost estimating: for jak^I Al?J?also^nA;^^^-JEpQ^A1^!^11.   We were told by members of the Ministry&apos;s technical costestimating staff that the preparation of their estimates for theMk. I Bloodhound equipment took place in three stages.     The firstv/as the preparation of estimates for materials and bought-out parts and of what they describe as ideal basic estimates for direct labour.     The ideal basic estimates are estimates of productiontimes which would be incapable of achievement in practice becausethey take no account of delays and difficulties that could beexpected to arise in the course of manufacture.     The second stagek
vjMk the conversion of the ideal basic labour times into money by applying to the times an average hourly earnings rate.     The third stage was the addition, to the ideal basic labour costs, ofpercentage allowances that would take account of the conditions to be expected during manufacture which had been deliberatelyexcluded from the ideal basic estimates.12.    Technical Grade staff prepared and agreed^1) with the firmthe estimates of cost for materials and bought-out parts and oftimes for the ideal basic direct labour estimates.     They alsoassessed and agreed with the firm average hourly earnings rates to convert the ideal basic times to money.     Engineer Grade staffsupervised the work of the Technical Grade officers and assessed,and agreed with the firm, the percentage allowances to be appliedto the ideal basic labour costs to convert them into realisticestimates.Estimate.^.....of, costof materials and, .bought-out parts13.   We were told by the Ministry&apos;s technical cost staff that theyproduced their estimates of materials and bought-out parts by reference to drawings, planning sheets, invoices and price-lists.They included allowances for scrap in these estimates.     our examination of the costs incurred by Ferranti Ltd. indicates thatthe estimates made by the Ministry&apos;s technical costs staff for materials and bought-out parts were (with the exception of gyrosand transformers) close to the firm&apos;s recorded costs.     Over thewhole of the contracts the firm suffered no loss on materials.The apparent under-estimating revealed by Appendices 1 and 2 is dueto the fact that after the Ministry&apos;s technical cost staff and the firm agreed-their estimates the firm,put out to sub-contrabtcertain work which the Ministry&apos;s estimators had assumed would be performed by the Perranti Guided Weapons Department.     This work,which amounted to some  123,000, is shown in the accounts ofPerranti Ltd. as &quot;materials .Estimates of cost of gyros and transformers1h.,    The Guided Weapons Department of Perranti Ltd. treated gyrosand transformers, which formed part of the main missile and groundequipments, as bought-out items, but they bought them from otherdepartments in the Perranti Ltd, organisation.     The Ministry&apos;stechnical cost officers produced estimates for these items andthese were used as the basis for agreeing the gyro and transformerprice elements in the prices of the main equipments.     Ourinquiries have shown that the firm&apos;s costs of gyros and transformersv/ere lower than the estimated costs;    the extent of the difference is revealed in Appendices 1 and 2.Estimates of ideal basic^ times ^for direct labour15.    The Ministry&apos;s technical cost staff told us that they producedtheir estimates of ideal basic times for direct labour independently of the firm&apos;s estimators.     But in order to minimise the area ofAny agreements which the Ministry&apos;s technical cost staff reachwith contractors are not binding.     They are understandingsbetween the two parties on figures which the Ministry&apos;s technicalcost staff are prepared to recommend, to their ContractsDirectorates as a basis for fixing prices and which the contractor is prepared to use as a basis for quoting prices tothe Contracts Directorates.     A technical cost investigation bythe Ministry does not necessarily result in an agreement, orunderstanding, of this kind.5
disagreement with the firm when estimates for complete equipmentswre eventually produced they first discussed with the firm&apos; sestimators the times that it would be reasonable for both sidesto apply to certain fundamental repetitive operations:    and, later,as estimates for parts of the complete equipments were prepared,they discussed these with the firm to see whether differences ofopinion existed, and could be resolved.     Our examination of the firm&apos;s production costs showed that the times which the Ministry&apos;stechnical cost staff were using for repetitive operations were much higher - of the order of 100/j or more higher - than the timeswhich the firm achieved in production.     Repetitive operationssuch as wiring, soldering and associated assembly work represented a large part of the work involved on the ground equipment contract -it has been assessed as between 50fo and 70/o of the whole - and rather less on the missile contract.     The Ministry&apos;s staff havetold us that when they discussed times for repetitive operationswith the firm&apos;s estimators the latter claimed times which were generally 20^ - 25/o higher than those which the Ministry&apos;s staffused in their estimates.     We were informed that the Ministry&apos;staff used the same time for an operation regardless of the frequency with which the operation was repeated.16.   We have made comparisons of the firm&apos;s recorded costs, the firm&apos;s estimates and the Ministry&apos;s estimates and we have also had regard to such information as we have been able to obtain of piece-work times issued to operatives:    these comparisons indicate that both the firm and the Ministry over-estimated the ideal basic timesfor direct labour and that this over-estimate stemmed partly frominflated estimates for fundamental repetitive operations.The conversion of direct labour ;times to costs17.   In October, 1959 for the ground equipment contract and inJanuary, 196O for the missile contract a technical cost officer ofthe Ministry agreed with the firm the average hourly earnings rates to be applied to ideal basic direct labour times.     He told us thathe first assessed, empirically and independently of the firm, whatthe average hourly earnings rates should be having regard to basicwage rates and bonuses and the proportions of male and femalelabour employed.     He said that he knew that productive workers atFerranti received a productivity bonus as well as a pieceworkbonus and he allowed for all bonus earnings in his independent,empirical calculations.     His calculations indicated that hs.3d.per hour and hs.8d0 per hour would be appropriate average earningsrates to apply to the ground equipment and missile contractsrespectively.     We were told that he then asked the firm to let himknow the average earnings for the ground equipment and missilecontracts.     The firm presented him with two pieces of paper, one for the ground equipment contract which showed, for a three-weekperiod to 1hth August, 1959, the total wages, total hours and theaverage rate per hour - which was hs.3d.:    and the other, for themissile contract, which showed similar information for a one-weekperiod to 8th January, 196O - and this produced an average rateof hs.8d. per hour.     It is not clear to us why these particularperiods were chosen or what influenced the selection of periods of this length.18.   From our examination of the records of Ferranti Ltd, we foundthat the estimated average hourly earnings rates of hs.3d. andhs.8d. had (subject to some later adjustments to reflect wageawards) proved to be very close to the actual rates.     Taking thetwo major contracts together the estimated rates had proved to be slightly too high and accounted for about  5,000 of the  562,h52difference between the total direct labour estimates for these6
Contracts ( 971 ,529) and the actual direct labour costs ( h-09,077).if his relatively slight advantage to the firm was, of course,magnified by the application of the overhead percentage.19.   The actual rates, however, exclude the productivity bonuswhich is a charge to overheads whereas the empirical calculationsof the Ministry&apos;s technical cost officer assumed the inclusion ofthe productivity bonus.     We do not criticise this officer for making this assumption, which stemmed from the matter referred tolater in paragraphs 2h and 25.     On the other hand the technicalcost officer did not question the figures which the firm gave himto cross-check his own calculations and he took no stops toascertain tho bases of the figures.     Had he done so he should havediscovered at that stage that the firm&apos;s calculation of hs,3d, andhs,8d. per hour excluded productivity bonus whereas in his calcula-tions it was included.     He should also have discovered, what wehave subsequently discovered, that the firm&apos;s figures of totalwages and total hours covered a wider range than the wages and hoursexpended on the ground equipment and missile contracts.Allowances, added,Jtojideai^bjasie ^sjb^mates for^direct  labour20.   At the same times as the average hourly earnings rates were agreed with the firm, agreement was also reached on the allowances to be added to the ideal basic estimates in order to convert them into realistic estimates.     Two categories of allowance were agreed as is usual with new equipmentst    a continuing allowance tobe applied to the ideal basic estimates throughout production tocover the effects of wastage, rework, training, labour turnover and modifications, and an additional allowance - a learner allowance -to be applied to initial production.     For the ground equipmentcontract tho ideal basic estimates were increased by a continuingallowance of 33 1/3% and the resultant estimates were further increased, in respect of the first half of the order, by learnerallowances falling quickly from 200% down to 25%.     For tho missilecontract the ideal basic estimates were increased by a continuingallowance of 25% and the resultant estimates were further increased in respect of the first quarter of the order by learner allowancesranging from 68% down to 20%.21.   According to the Directorate of Technical Costs the firmclaimed much higher allowances than were eventually agreed.     the firm have told us that they have no record or recollection of whatthey claimed:    but they do not dispute what was agreed.22.   Our examination of the firm&apos;s records has shown us beyond doubt that the learner allowances were generally too high, verymuch so in tho case of the missile contract.     We were unable toestablish with any certainty whether the continuing allowances were fully justified or, on the other hand, whether they were on thelow side but the percentages were, of course, applied to ideal basicfigures which were much too high.23.   The Ministry1s Directorate of Accountancy Services becameresponsible for accountancy investigations at Ferranti Ltd, onbehalf of Government Departments in September, 1959.     Prior tothat time the Admiralty&apos;s professional accountants had borne this responsibility.     The only aspect of the Admiralty&apos;s work that hada direct bearing on the price-fixing of the Ferranti Mk. IBloodhound contracts was the agreement of an Allocation Sheet whichset out Ferranti Ltd.1s method of allocating costs as betweendirect charges and overhead charges.     The Allocation Sheet is a7
questionnaire which lists headings of cost and asks the firm toiHKLcate against each heading whether it treats the cost as adirect charge or a charge to overheads.     The firm complete the questionnaire and the firm&apos;s accountant and the Government&apos;saccountant both sign a statement saying that the completedquestionnaire represents the contractor&apos;s normal method of alloca-tion and that this method will be followed on all government work.A copy of the Allocation Sheet is sent to the Directorate of technical Costs so that there shall &quot;be a clear understanding betweenthe staff of that Directorate, the Government accountants and the firm as to the costs that are to be charged direct and allowed forin the Ministry&apos;s technical cost estimates and those that are to becharged to overheads and so taken into account when the Governmentaccountants assess overhead rates.2k *   We found that the firm and the Admiralty had signed an allocation Sheet in December, 1957, which set the pattern for theallocation of costs on the Mk. I Bloodhound contracts.     When theMinistry of Aviation took over the accountancy investigations atFerranti Ltd. an identical Allocation Sheet was signed by the firm and the Ministry accountant in November, 1959.     A furtherAllocation Sheet was produced in August, 1963? but this revealedthat a heading &quot;Bonuses - Productive Workers&quot; was not being treatedas an entirely direct charge, as it had been on the two earlierAllocation Sheets, but was now regarded as covering both a directcharge and a charge to overheads, the element chargeable to over-heads being in respect of a productivity bonus.     We established with Ferranti Ltd. that a productivity bonus had been paid to bothdirect and indirect workers - and had been charged to overheads -for several years before the Mk. I Bloodhound production contractswere placed.     The firm explained to us that they did not mention the productivity bonus as an overhead charge in the 1957 and 1959Allocation Sheets because the heading &quot;Bonuses - Productive Workers&quot;did not seem to them to relate to a productivity bonus that is paidto both direct (productive) and indirect workers.25.   The Admiralty accountant has told us that he was not aware ofthe existence of the productivity bonus.     The Ministry of Aviationaccountant has told us that he knew of the existence of the productivity bonus but he could not now remember why he followed the previous practice and did not mention it on the AllocationSheet.The assessment of overhead rates26.   The accounting system used by Ferranti Ltd. provides for coststo be collected into Product Groups.     Three Product Groups hadbeen allocated to guided weapon production which, up to 31st March,1961, was synonymous with Mk. I Bloodhound production.     The costscollected into these Product Groups related to all production ofthe Mk, I Bloodhound but as there were only two relatively smallexport orders the bulk of the costs could be attributed to theMinistry of Aviation&apos;s contracts.     From time to time the Ministry&apos;saccountants recommended to the Contracts Directorate overhead rates to be used in price-fixing.     The accountants had assessed these rates from the actual costs of direct labour and overheads bookedto the guided weapon Product Groups or, in respect of future periods,from estimates of these costs which they made in conjunction withthe firm.     In December, 1959 the Ministry1s Accountants recommended to the Contracts Directorate an overhead rate of 527^ to be appliedto productive labour costs in respect of Mk. I Bloodhound production from the inception of the contracts until 30th September, 1959.This rate was derived from the actual costs of direct labour and ofoverheads for guided weapon production as ascertained by the 8
ministry1 s accountants.     In February, i960, a rate of 512% was recommended for application to production up to 30th September,1960, this rate being derived from the actual costs of direct labour and of overheads for guided weapon production up to30th September, 1959, coupled with an estimate of the likely costs for the next twelve months to 30th September, i960.     In July,i960, a rate of 558% was recommended for application to productionup to 31st March, 1961, this rate being derived from the actualcosts of direct labour and of overheads for guided weaponproduction up to 31st March, 1960, coupled with an estimate of the likely costs for the next twelve months to 31st March, 1961.     Theestimated labour and overhead costs for this twelve monthsproduced a rate of 630%.27.   The 558/0 overhead rate was used on the two main contracts forpricing production up to 31st March, 1961.     Wo were told that theactual overhead rate for the twelve months to 31st March, 1961 ,worked out at 562% and not the 630% that had been estimated.     Asa result the overhead rate applicable to production from the inception of the contracts up to 31st March, 1961, has been shown to be 535% and not 558% which had been used in pricing.Ferranti Ltd. thus  &quot;benefited  from the application of an overheadrate which was proved in the event to be too high.     The causes ofdisparity between the estimated and actual overhead rates in the twelve months to 31st March, 1961, were that the Ministryaccountants and the firm had. under-estimated direct labour costsby i+% and over-estimated overhead costs by 7%.     Both of these factors had worked in the same direction to produce a lower over-head rate.     We do not think that ir/o and 7% margins of error should,in themselves, give cause for concern in an estimate provided theestimate is soundly based and does not put the Department at greater risk than the firm.     Wo comment on the Ministry&apos;sprocedure for estimating overhead rates in paragraph h5.The.,, agreementx of ,,Rrices28.    The Contracts Directorate received the main reports from theMinistry&apos;s technical cost officers in April, i960, for the missilecontract and in June and August, i960, for the ground equipmentcontract.     The firm submitted a quotation to the ContractsDirectorate in April, i960, for a part of the missile contractbasing it on the estimates of costs of materials, bought-out parts and direct labour which they had agreed with the Ministry&apos;stechnical cost officers and the overhead rate of 512ft that hadbeen assessed by the Ministry&apos;s accountants.     This quotationrelated to the quantity of missile equipments - about 60% of thetotal - expected to be delivered by 30th September, i960, the date to which the overhead rate of 512% applied.     Because aboutthroe-quarters of the quantity covered by the quotation had alreadybeen delivered, or were in course of manufacture, the ContractsDirectorate sought &quot;a greater degree of forward pricing.     Thisentailed establishing an overhead rate that would apply further into the future and they asked the Ministry accountants torecommend an overhead rate that would apply to at least31st March, 1961.     This rate - 558% - was reported by theMinistry accountants in July, i960.     In the same month the firmre-quoted basing their prices, as before, on the prime costestimates agreed with the Ministry&apos;s technical cost officers butapplying 558% as the overhead rate on direct labour.     Theirrevised quotation related, to the quantity of missile equipments -about 80% of the total - expected to be delivered by 31st March,1961.     At the time of quoting nearly three-quarters of the itemscovered by the quotation had already been delivered or were in course of manufacture.9
W$,   For ground equipment the firm submitted a quotation inJune, 1960, for about 70% of the requirements basing it on theprime cost estimates agreed with the Ministry8s technical costofficers and the application of the 51 2):o overhead rate to direct labour.     In July, i960, they revised their earlier quotationupwards to allow for the application of the 558/-- overhead rate andthey also quoted for the balance of tho contract, again allowing for the 558% overhead rate.     By this time about three-quarters of the items covered by the quotation had already been delivered or were in course of manufacture.30.   The technical cost officers&apos; reports to the ContractsDirectorate indicated the estimated costs of materials, bought-outparts and direct labour for each item on the contract but they didnot explain how the estimates had been constructed:    for example,they did not indicate the nature and size of the allowances that had been added to basic labour estimates.     The accountants&apos;reports on overhead rates did not indicate the direct labour costs and overhead costs from which the rates were derived.     We comment on this in paragraph 62.     When, on 13th October, i960, the contracts Directorate staff sought information from the accountantson the method used to arrive at an overhead rate of 558%, theyobtained, for the first time, details of Ferranti Ltd.&apos;s actualdirect labour and overhead costs on guided weapon production up to31st March, i960, and an estimate of these costs for the followingtwelve months.     They recorded these details but they did notrealise that the accountants&apos; figure for direct labour costsprovided a means of checking the total value of the technical costofficers&apos; estimates of direct labour costs.     We comment on this in paragraphs 49-51.31.    The Contracts Directorate staff told us that, after making some inquiries, they saw no grounds for doubting the reliability ofthe estimates of prime cost submitted by the technical cost officers or the overhead rates recommended by the accountants.     Havingsatisfied themselves that the firm&apos;s quotations were in line withthese prime cost estimates and with the recommended overhead rate and that they provided for a 7% profit margin on costs, that beingthe profit rate agreed with the firm, they provisionally acceptedthe firm&apos;s quotations (subject to some minor exceptions) at ameeting with the firm on 27th October, i960.     These provisionalacceptances were confirmed by letters on 11th November, i960.     Ofthe total of the Mk. I Bloodhound equipments on the two maincontracts about three-quarters had been delivered and rather morehad been produced by this time.32.    In September, 1961 , the firm quoted for the remaining 20)&apos;o ofthe missile equipments on contract:    they amended this quotationslightly in October, 1961.     The firm based their prices on theprime cost estimates agreed with the Ministry&apos;s technical costofficers, subject to&quot;an upward revision of the direct labour coststo reflect a wage increase awarded subsequent to the agreement, andto the use of a 630&apos;;.- overhead rate on direct labour.     They alsoostensibly included, a 6% profit margin on costs, that being the currentprofit   agreed with the Ministry.     At this time about 90 of thetotal order had been delivered and probably 95% had been produced.In November, 1961, the Contracts Directorate accepted this quotation.Ferranti Ltd.^s knowledge of costs and profit33.    Our examination of the records of Ferranti Ltd. showed thatthe firm recorded unit costs of tho bought-out and sub-contracteditems, materials and direct labour involved in the manufacture ofbatches of Ilk. I Bloodhound components.     At fairly frequentCO^MBENTIAL
CONFEDINTIAiL intervals these component costs were aggregated with costs that hadbeen collected for assembling operations so as to produce costs of sub-assemblies and main assemblies.     In the case of the ground equipment contract aggregated costs for main assemblies had beenprepared at intervals of two or three months over the eighteen months preceding the agreement of prices.     For the missileequipments the firm went further and produced aggregated costs for complete equipments:    the dates to which these costs relatedwere April. July, September and December in 1959;    January, april and October in 1960;   February, July and August in 1 961 :    and march in 1962.     The firm&apos;s Cost Accounts Department told, us thatthe aggregation of costs for the complete missile equipments was completed within about two months of these dates.     In themselvesthese batch costs did not represent complete costs:    there are various adjustments which need to be made to reconcile them withactual costs and the extent of these adjustments can only bedetermined accurately when production has finished.     The firmtold us that they did not regard hatch costs as more accuratethan * 10%.     We found that, in the event, the batch costs forMk. I Bloodhound production required an upward adjustment ofapproximately 10^.3h-,   When the Ministry&apos;s technical cost officers reached final agreement with the firm on estimates of costs for the ground equipment contract in October, 1959, and the missile contract inJanuary, i960, the firmfs latest available batch cost information would, in our view, have revealed that the estimates being agreedprovided a considerable margin over the costs so far recorded.On the ground equipment contract we think that it should have been seen that the estimates for direct labour costs were about twicethose recorded.     On the missile contract it should have been seenthat the estimates of direct labour for the early learner stagewere about three times those recorded and that the recorded costs were, in fact, below the &apos;ideal basic&apos;  estimates.     We noted thatthe manager of the Estimating Department of Ferranti Ltd. alsocontrolled the Time Study Department which gave a time studyservice to the factory concerned with the major part of Mk. IBloodhound production.     The Estimating Department therefore hadaccess to performance times on the shop floor as s to the costs recorded by the firm&apos;s Cost Accounts Department.35.   We asked Ferranti Ltd. why they agreed estimates of direct labour costs which were so greatly in excess of their recordedcosts:    and v/hy they made a bid for even higher estimates of costs.The firm told us that emphatic instructions were given to theirestimating staff that they should be careful not to agree estimateson a basis that might lead the firm to incur a loss.     Because ofthis, and because they regarded Mk, I Bloodhound as a complexproduction task on a new type of product for which extremely high standards of manufacture were demanded and a high level of inspection was imposed, their estimators were very cautious.     the firm agreed that some apparently favourable batch cost informationv/as available during 1959 but they said that in their experiencesuch early information is not a reliable indication of costson a contract as a whole.     Therefore their estimators, working on the basis of long experience, did not regard this informationas more than a guide that their estimates were on the right side.They were unwilling to run the risk of reducing their estimatesbecause the contracts still had about two years to run.36.   We asked Ferranti Ltd. why, in July, i960, when their recordedbatch costs should have given them further confirmation that theestimates of direct labour costs which they had agreed with theMinistry&apos;s technical cost officers were much too high, they
^PDnetheless quoted what purported to he fair and reasonable prices for the ground equipment contract and for 80% of the missilecontract on the basis of those estimates.     In our view the firmthen had, on the missile contract, for example, aggregated costs for complete equipments representing about half of the quantity forwhich they were quoting.     The firm acknowledged that at that timein their Departmental accounts up to 31st March, 1960, they tookcredit for a profit of 2h% on sales (31-g&quot;% on cost).     They regardedthis profit as being d.ue to thoir having achieved an unusually high degree of technical control and effective management during thecourse of production.     They said that they were uncertain whether further work would be found for their production department whenthe Mk. I Bloodhound work was finished and if there were no further work they would be involved in considerable expense in compensatingstaff and looking after them until alternative jobs could be found for them.     They conceded that it was becoming evident in mid-1960,when the Ministry accountants investigated actual direct labour andoverhead costs in order to assess an overhead rate, that actualdirect labour costs were running at considerably lower levels than had been estimated:    they added that these figures were also available to the Ministry.37.   Finally we asked Ferranti Ltd. why, when they quoted for theremaining 20% of tho missile equipments in September, 1961,  theycontinued to base their prices on the estimates originally agreed with the Ministry&apos;s technical cost officers, subject to an upwardrevision of tho direct labour costs to reflect a subsequent wage increase.     At this time the firm had. secured its substantialprofit on the first 80% of the missile contract and on tho whole ofthe ground equipment contract for which prices had boon agreed almosta year earlier.     They had also acquired considerable experience ofthe level of actual costs of missile equipments as 90% of the order had been delivered and probably 95% had been produced.     The firmagreed with cur view that only a supernatural disaster could have produced a loss on the missile contract at this stage.     Theyjustified their quotation by saying that they had no future workpromised to them for their guided weapon department which was at theend of the road as a production unit.     We pointed out to the firmthat they had been given a contract in October, i960, enabling thornto order long dated materials for Mk. II Bloodhound equipments, andthat this contract was amended in August, 1 961  to allow manufactureof certain components to take place.     These preliminary arrange-ments were formalised, in a separate contract for tho manufacture ofMk, II Bloodhound equipments which was placed in October, 1961,prior to the acceptance in November, 1 961 , of the firm&apos;s quotationfor tho last 20% of the Mk. I Bloodhound missile equipments.     the firm replied that they did not regard the contract for themanufacture of Mk, II equipments as a reliable indication that theywould go into production:    there t^as still the possibility that theorder might be cancelled.38.    In reply to a question Ferranti Ltd. informed us that one government Department, the Admiralty, had questioned estimatesprepared by the Directorate of Technical Costs.     A representativeof tho Admiralty confirmed this.     It happened about two years ago.In the field of the equipment concerned the Admiralty has exceptionalfacilities for critically examining estimates of oost.   As a result,the Admiralty succeeded in negotiating with the firm a contractprice which was appreciably lower than tho figure that would, other-wise have obtained.
PART II - view--&amp;jad.,Gbr^cluaipK3The factors that contributed directly to the excessiye^J* Q&apos; Xk39,   We think that the following factors contributed directly to the excessive profit on the Mk, I Bloodhound productioncontracts and ve comment on the in in the paragraphs indicatedbelow:(i) the estimates of direct labour costs on which prices were based were too high (paragraphs 1+0-44) j(ii) the overhead rate of 558% was too high (paragraph 45);(iii) the decision to base prices on estimated costs at sucha lste stage in the production programme (paragraphs46-48);(iv) the ministry&apos;s failure to realise, before prices were agreed, thst it had information which indicated thatthe estimates of direct labour costs were too high(paragraphs 49-51);    and(v) the fact that the Ferranti Ltd. quotations were basedon estimates of direct labour coats that they knew tobe very high for contracts that called for fair and reasonable prices to be agreed (paragraphs 52 and 53).High estimates of direct labour40.   We are in no doubt that the profit stemmed mainly from theagreement of prices that were based on estimates of direct labour costs that were generally much too high, so that the firm&apos; profitsfrom the amount of this over-estimate -  731,861 - and also - tothe extent of o further  4,237,256 - from the application of highoverhead percentages to this over-estimate.    The Ministry&apos;stechnical cost officers have been unable to explain to us whytheir estimates were too high,41.   During the course of our examination of the records ofFerranti Ltd., we looked into several possible explanations.We made test checks on specifications, drawings and productionplanning details to see whether any changes made subsequent tothe Ministry&apos;s technical cost estimates being prepared could have had the effect of reducing labour costs,    We came to theconclusion that the overall effect of changes of this kind wasnot significant.    We examined the extent to which the firm had put out to sub-contract work which the Ministry&apos;s technical costofficers had assumed would be carried out by Ferranti Ltd.&apos;s owndirect labour.   We came to the conclusion that this amounted toabout  123,000 of sub-contracting end that, assuming, arbitrarilya sub-contractor&apos;s overhead rate to be 200%, the direct labourcontent of the work could be no more than about  40,000,   We also considered the possibility that work which the Ministry&apos;stechnical cost officers had assumed would be carried out by direct labour might, in fact, h. ve been, carried out by indirectlabour and charged to overheads.   For example, it had beensuggested to us that personnel in the firm&apos;s Test and InspectionDepartment, which is a charge to overheads, might have helpedproduction by undertaking work such as rectification which the/Ministry1 s13
Ministry&apos;s estimators would have treated as a charge to direct labour.   The firm have denied that work was improperly(charged to overheads.    We have found no evidence to the contrarybut we cannot say that it might not have occurred.   We aresatisfied, however, that if some -&apos;ork appropriate to direct labour was charged to overheads it was not done on a scale thatrnadLe a significant contribution to the difference between theestimated and actual direct labour costs.U2.    In our opinion the Ministry&apos;s technical cost estimates for direct labour were pitched too high for several reasons.    the ideal basic estimates were too high partly because excessivetimes were allowed for repetitive operations and because thesame time was allowed for an operrtion regardless of the frequency with which it was repeated.    Moreover, we doubt whether the idecl basic ostimst.es were 1 ideal&apos; in the sense that they were intended to be (see paragraph 11).   TheMinistry&apos;s estimators told us that they do not think thatthey departed from their idecl and they have assured us thatthey were not influenced by the contractor.   &quot;re think It is most likely, however, that the Ministry&apos;s estimating staff did,to some extent, make provision, albeit unconsciously, in theirideal basic estimates for the delays and difficulties expectedto be encountered in early production and emphasised by the firm.That the considerable learner allowances added to the basicestimates were proved to be too high reflects, in our view,the Ministry&apos;s lack of method in assessing these allowances.The basis of the assessment was said to be the experience ofthe officer that made It and of those of his colleagues whom he consulted;   no attempt was made to use, as a check,collateral evidence that was available in the Ministry.   Webelieve that insufficient allowance was made for the fact thata considerable number of evaluation missiles were manufactured in ad.vance of the main production contract which must have reduced appreciably the need for a high, learner allowance.U3-   We have reason to believe that estimates made by theMinistry&apos;s technical cost staff in the older established fieMsof engineering are reasonable, although this has not beenconclusively proved.    Equally we believe that in electronics, anew and rapidly advancing industry, this staff have not the requisite experience for accurate estimating.    Certainly none of the technical cost officers employed on the Mk. I Bloodhoundwork had had personal practical experience in the manufacture ofelectronic equipment although they had carried out estimating inthis field, during recent years.    The Ministry&apos;s technical costofficers are thus at a profound disadvantage in their dealings with the firm&apos;s estimators who have every opportunity both ofgaining experience and keeping up to date.Ll-h,   We were told by staff of the Contracts Directorate thatthey normally accepted the estimates which their technical costcolleagues recommended to them for use in price-fixing.    In viewof this we were disturbed to find that responsibility for agree-ing ideal basic estimates for direct labour, amounting to overS,-^ million on the two biggest Mk. I Bloodhound contracts, wasexercised by a Technical Gratde I officer.High overhead, ratej.l\3.    The second factor that contributed to the excessive profitto the extent of something over  200,000 was the over-estimatingof the overhead rate for the twelve months to 31st March, 1961,which we have mentioned in paragraph 27.   We said in that paragraph that the over-estimate need not be a. cause for concernif the estimate itself was soundly based.     .e are, however,concerned at the way in which the estimated overhead rate forthe twelve months to 31st March, 1961, was produced.    We were1J+ /told
S?old by the Ministry&apos;s accountants that they received the firm&apos;s estimates of direct labour and overhead costs for theperiod, they compared these with the actual costs for thepreceding period, they disallowed certain items and they thendiscussed trends with the&apos; firm.    As a result of this they made an assessment which took into account a declining production ofMk. I Bloodhound equipment.    They did not consult the Ministry&apos;production  branch which had set the production programme,neither did they consult the technical cost officers on theamount of direct and indirect labour effort that would berequired by the production programme for the twelve months&apos;period,   We do not think that it is within the competence ofaccountants to estimate the amount, and hence the cost, of the direct and indirect labour required for complex engineering products.    The Ministry appears to have taken the same view toa limited extent.    We v?ere told that it has for long been thepractice when overhead rates are being estimated for airframeand aero-engine contracts for the accountants to seek an opinion from the Directorate of Technical Costs on a con-tractor &apos;s estimate of direct labour costs and also, although not so regularly, for an opinion on a contractor&apos;s estimate ofhis overhead costs.    We have been told that the process has nowbeen extended, and the accountants now refer to the directorate of Technical Costs all estimates of direct labour co;.ts whichthey are proposing to use in overhead rate calculations.   Wethink that overhead, rate assessments would be further improved,if all direct labour and overhead figures were referred to the directorate of Technical Costs with supporting details of theinformation on which they are based, for critical examinationfrom a technical (as contrasted to an accounting) standpoint.lib.    In retrospect It can now be seen that the decision to price the Mk. i Bloodhound production contracts on the basisof estimated costs was also a factor which influenced the size of the profits.    The decision was taken early in the life ofthe contracts and. we do not Question that it was a correctdecision at that time.    It is open to question, however, whetherit was right to adhere to that decision in I960 when the wholeof the ground equipment contract and 80% of the missile contractwere priced, on estimates notwithstanding the fact that thegreater part of the production had been completed.    Pricing on estimates when production is as far advanced as this inevitablymeans that the contractor is in an advantageous position.    Hevail know how his costs are shaping:    if they indicate that hehas quoted too low he can withdraw his quotation and. re-submithigher prices;    if they indicate that his quotation will give him a higher profit margin than that which the Ministry&apos;s profitformula allows, he may keep silent.1&apos;7.    Those members of the Contracts Directorate staff concernedwith the Mk. I Bloodhound pricing from whom we took evidence alltold us that if they had. suggested to Perranti Ltd. in I960 thatthe basis of pricing should be changed from estimated costs toactual costs they would have expected the firm to object onprincipleo   Moreover,.they doubted whether the firm recorded itscosts on a contract basis so as to make possible the ascertain-ment of actual costs.     But they did not discuss these matters with the firm.   We were also told that there was a generalpressure within the Ministry to fix prices on the basis ofestimated costs and this would have influenced their thinking.Ferranti Ltd. informed, us that had they told the Ministry thattheir quotations were too high it would have seemed certain tothem that the Ministry would have switched the basis of pricing15 /from
pom estimated costs to actual costs.    They took the view;hat the Ministry were entitled to switch the &quot;basis ofpricing in this &quot;;ay.    Our investigation of the records ofFerranti Ltd. has confirmed the Ministry&apos;s suppositionthat the firm did not record its costs on a contract basis0,but it has also shown that the firm&apos;s costing system doesprovide for costs to be recorded in a way thet enables areasonable assessment of actual costs per contract to bemade.h8,    It is clear, with hindsight, that the large profitwhich Ferranti Ltd. made would have been avoided if thebasis of price-fixing had been changed to that of actualcosts.    It is also clear to us that the ContractsDirectorate staff did not actively pursue the possibilityof changing the basis of price-fixing.    But, bearing inmind that it was in the firm&apos;s interest - having regard totheir knowledge at the time - to have prices agreed on thebasis of estimated costs, it is doubtful whether theMinistry would have succeeded had. it sought to persuade the firm to agree prices on actual costs.Infpjrmati.pA available, to the Ministryh-9.    The fourth factor was the Ministry&apos;s failure to realise,before it agreed prices, that the Department had information which indicated that the estimates of direct labour costs were too high.    The available information was that which theMinistry&apos;s accountants had obtained of the actual costsexpended by Ferranti Ltd. on direct labour employed on guidedweapon production and. their estimates of such costs for a future period.    The first opportunity available to the ministry for comparing its technical cost estimates of direct labour withfigures provided by its accountants occurred late in 1959 whenthe accountants obtained the actual costs of direct labour upto 30th September, 1959.   Opportunity for a more extensivecomparison occurred early in i960 1 hen the accountantsestimated direct labour costs for the twelve months to 30thSeptember, i960.   And a still more extensive comparison becamepossible in the middle of i960 when the accountants obtained the actual costs of direct labour up to 31st March, I960, andassessed the estimated costs for the ensuing twelve months.   at each of these points in time the accountants kept the informa-tion to themselves.    Had they sought the views of their technicalcoot colleagues on their direct labour figures, as they are nowbeing asked to do (see paragraph us), the high level of thetechnical cost estimates would have been revealed, at that stage.But, accepting that it was not then the practice for these views to be sought outside the field of airframe and aero-enginecontracts, we have inquired why it did not occur to theaccountants that their figures might have provided a yardstickfor the technical cost estimates of direct labour.    We have been told that although the accountants realised that their figuresrelated to the whole of guided, weapon production, they were not aware of the full extent of the contracts concerned, or how farproduction had progressed in each period under inquiry.50.    It was not until 13th October,  i960 - two weeks before theprovisional agreement of prices with the contractor - that theaccountants&apos; figures of direct labour costs up to 31st March,1961, were in the hands of officials in tho Ministry,  i.e. thestaff of the Contracts Directorate, who also had. the technicalcost officers&apos; estimates.    Had they evaluated the total cost ofthe direct labour estimates for the many items involved andcompared it with the accountants&apos; figures, they would have seen/that
Jth&amp;t the estimates were about 100)1 too high.   We ashed whyfflptiis comparison had not been made.    The generally expressedview of &quot;those concerned was that they had. had no previous experience of the possibility of being able to make such a comparison.   We were told that for most firms the accountants&apos;figures for clirectlabour would normally relate to a particularfactory or unit and would reflect a firm&apos;s efforts in aparticular period on many contracts - some government, somecivil - covering, perhaps, thousands of items.    The possibilityof relating these figures to technical cost officers&apos;  estimates of direct labour costs for particular contracts was very remoteand no instructions or guidance had been given to the staff ofthe Contracts Directorate on this subject.51.    We recognise that a simple and exact comparison of thiskind has not usually been practicable and we think that it is because of this that the staff of the Contracts Directoratedeveloped a blind spot which prevented them recognising a case that is now seen to be one that was an almost ideal subject fora comparison.    Although we would not go so far as to&apos; dismiss thepossibility of a worthwhile comparison being made in many caseswhere the proportion of Government work is high, yet,  in thecircumstances, we do not think that the failure on this occasionshould be classified as negligence.    It does show, however, alack of perception, a matter that we touch on in paragraph 62.Information available,m.p..,,5&apos;erranti. Ltd..,52.    The fifth factor that led to the excessive profit was thefact that the firm quoted and agreed prices (ostensibly fair and reasonable prices), which were based, on estimates of costs whichthey knew were much too high.   As we explained in paragraphs33-37, production was far advanced and they had adequateinformation on which to base a. sound assessment of their costs.In cur view the firm knew a/hen it quoted and when it agreedprices that unless extremely grave difficulties occurred later in production those prices would yield a profit of the order ofthat eventually secured and, by its silence, it misled theMinistry into thinking that the prices contained provision for only a fair and reasonable profit (although not necessarily only7% on cost).   We think that the firm realised that they were likely to make a large profit when they agreed estimates of direct labour costs with the Ministry&apos;s technical cost officers,53.     :e were not impressed by the firm1s reasons for discountingthe information yielded by its batch costs.    Although hatch costs are not absolutely accurate the firm had a measure of the likelydegree of inaccuracy from past experience:    and they have agreedthat they would have had regard to batch cost Information if ithad indicated that costs were proving to he higher than estimated.Neither were we impressed by the firm&apos;s arguments that, at theuime that they agreed prices, a largo margin of profit was justified, because of low profits in the past or because theprospects of future work for their Guided Weapons department were uncertain.    The facts concerning the placing of the Mk. IIBloodhound production order which are reported in p: paragraph 37show that this latter argument was particularly weak in relationto the pricing of the last 20% of the missile contract.    In ouropinion the facts concerning future work or profit on other work are not relevant.    &apos;&quot;e think that the firm did not live up to thespirit of the price-fixing clause in the contracts.    They werenot, in our view, agreeing fair- and reasonable prices for thearticles supplied under the contracts if, without the agreementof the other party to the contract, they were seeking to obtainpayment through those prices for other factors:    there had been no mention of such factors when the parties agreed, a profit rate./Factors
^^pJiSTiL that might have contributed to the excessive,profit,5h0   Our inquiries have brought to light the following fivematters which might have contributed in some way to the excessive profit although they are not such obvious factors as the matters mentioned in paragraphs 39-53:(i) insufficient attention was given to the allocation of costs between direct charges and overhead charges to ensure that everything possible was treated as adirect charge (paragraphs 55-58);(ii) the Allocation Sheet did not reveal the existence ofa productivity bonus as a charge to overheads(paragraphs 59 and 60);(iii) Financial statements for Ferranti Ltd, prepared bythe Ministry&apos;s accountants showed that the firm were making large profits but they were not brought to notice in time (paragraph 61);(iv) the lack of knowledge in the Contracts Directorate ofthe bases of the technical cost estimates and the over-head rates (paragraph 62);(v) staffing difficulties (paragraphs 63 and 6I4.).Relationship between,, direct., and, over head, charges55o   Although the root cause of the profit made by Ferranti Ltd.was the difference between the estimated and actual costs of direct labour it was the fact that this difference was multipliedby the overhead rates - 558% for the ground equipment contract and 558% and 630% for the missile contract - which made the profit so large - see the figures in paragraph kO.    There is atemptation to any firm whose prices on Government contracts are fixed under Standard Condition h3 - after production has started-to obtain agreement to generous estimates of direct labour costs and then to take all possible action to keep these costs belowthe level of the estimate without exercising similar restraint on overhead costs.    In this way a higher overhead rate can be claimed which, if admitted, will allow the contractor not onlyto recover his overhead costs but to gain a bonus in the form ofthe saving on direct labour cost multiplied by the overhead rate.This is indeed a fundamental weakness in this system of allocatingoverheads to which we shall give attention in our second report.It is reasonable that if a contractor can, by a higher degree of technical control and effective management, beat the estimatedcost of direct labour, he should gain the benefit due to thedifference between estimated direct labour cost and actual cost,but not that he should recover more than his actual overheadsmerely through the operation of the formula for overhead recovery.56.   One way of mitigating the situation described in thepreceding paragraph is to make as much expenditure as possible a direct charge to the contract so as to reduce the total of the costs classified as overheads and so reduce the overhead percent-age rate,    Estimates of the direct expenditure might still workin the contractor&apos;3 favour but they will be subjected to a smaller multiplier.    In the case of the Mk. I Bloodhoundcontracts with Ferranti Ltd. we do not think that sufficient - ifany - attention ^:ras paid to this matter when the Allocation Sheetswere compiled.   Our examination of the 558% and 63O/0 overheadrates has shown that there were large sums of money charged tooverheads in respect of test and inspection.    There is non /uniform
ggiiform practice in industry regarding the treatment of testphd inspection charges as direct or indirect.    Indeed thereis no uniform practice in Perranti Ltd.;    we learnt that atleast one of their factories (not engaged on Mk:.  I Bloodhound)treat labour employed directly on teat and inspection, as adirect charge and the Ministry&apos;s technical cost officersestimate for it as such.    Had this expenditure been treatedas a direct charge on the Mk. I Bloodhound contracts a much lower overhead rate than 558% would have been appropriate;the firm have suggested that it would have been about 316%.Whether this would have given a lower ultimate profit to the firm depends on whether the Directorate of Technical Costs&apos;estimates for direct cost, including test and inspectionlabour, would have been as wide of the mark as their estimates were in this case for direct productive labour.    Butessentially we believe that anything which leads to a loweroverhead percentage rate is less likely to result in excessiveprofit or loss.57.    To apply the same rate of overhead to a vide variety of operations seems to us to be unsatisfactory.    In many, butnot in all, cases where direct labour coats form a relatively small part of the total costs of production, the risks eitherto the Ministry or to the contractor, arising from the mattersmentioned in paragraphs 55 and. 56 could probably be avoided, bythe use of different methods of recovering overhead coats, suchas the use of coat centres and machine hour rates.58.    We obtained explanations from Perranti Ltd. of the pro-gressively increasing level of their overhead, rate for guided weapons production over the production period of the Mk, IBloodhound contracts, of the high cost of test and inspectionrelative to direct labour and of the tendency for teat and inspection coats to continue to rise   hen direct labour coatswere falling.   We find it difficult,  so long after the event,to judge Whether the overhead costs were reasonable.    The timeto form this opinion is when production is taking place.    Wewould, have had greater respect for the opinions formed, by theMinistry&apos;s accountants at the time had they been based onconsultations with their technical colleagues In the technicalcost and [production branches.Productivity, bonus59.   We have mentioned in paragraph 2k that there was no indica-tion of the existence of a. productivity bonus as a charge tooverheads on the allocation Sheets that were current whentechnical cost estimates and overhead rates were being assessedfor Mk, I Bloodhound production.    It is doubtful whether the outcome of the Mk. I Bloodhound, pricing or the sise of the profit which Perranti Ltd. made was affected by the absence from the 1957 and 1959 Allocation Sheets of any Indication thata productivity bonus was paid- to direct workers and was a. charge to overheads,,    The Ministry&apos;s technical cost staff have told us that had they known that the productivity bonus was a charge tooverheads their independent empirical calculations would have produced lower average hourly earnings rates which they wouldhave sought to persuade the firm to accept.   Had they tried todo this we think it is questionable whether they would have succeeded in the face of the actual average rates (exclusive of productivity bonus) which the firm had produced for the threeweeks to lhth August, 1959, and for the week ending 8th January,I960./60.19
ijjO.    Unfortunately it haa not been possible to produce for usShe empirical independent estimates of the earnings rates madeby the Ministry&apos;s technical cost officer.    In this circumstancewe have been unable to examine the procedure critically but weare bound to be sceptical of the value of the empirical calcula-tions which produced exactly the same figure as an analysis ofactual earnings when the basis for the latter was not defined and it is subsequently established that the productivity bonus,equivalent to about 3d. an hour at that time, was taken intoaccount in the one and was excluded from the other.    however that may be, we think it is beyond doubt that the admiralty and Ministry of Aviation accountants allowed a situation todevelop which the Allocation Sheet procediire was designed toavoid - that of the Ministry&apos;s technical cost staff assuminga charge to be direct when the accountants and the firm weretreating it as a charge to overheads.Financial statements61,    As a general rule the Ministry&apos;s accountants producefinancial statements, derived primarily from Annual Accounts,indicating the financial results of major contractors in theaircraft industry and they send these statements to the contracts Directorates.    Information was available to theaccountants before the Mk. I Bloodhound prices were fixedto enable a statement of the recent financial results ofFerranti Ltd, to be prepared.    A statement based on the firm&apos;annual Accounts for the year ending 31st March, I960, was infact produced by the accountants late in October, I960:    itindicated a profit for the whole of the firm&apos;s trading in theyear to 31st March, I960, of U0% on capital employed, a percentage appreciably higher than in earlier years.    this statement was not sent to the Contracts Diroctorate because,we were told, it was not then the custom to d.o so for firmsoutside the aircraft industry:    and the Contracts Directoratedid not ask for a statement.    V7e can understand that statements of this kind might have little value in relation to firms whose work on Government contracts forms only a small part of their total output.   But for Ferranti Ltd,, whose Government work was clearly a substantial part of their output, a statement wouldhave served a useful purpose.    We have been told that it is now the practice for the Ministry&apos;s accountants to prepare statements of this kind for all firms and to sond them to the ContractsDirectorates in all cases where the Government is a substantialcustomer.Basic price-fixing information62,    We have mentioned in paragraph 9 that within the Ministryof Aviation the responsibility for agreeing contract prices rests with the staff of the Contracts Directorates.   We have also mentioned in paragraph 30 that the technical cost officers&apos;reports on the Mk, I Bloodhound production contracts did notexplain how the estimates had been constructed and. theaccountants&apos; reports on overhead rates did not indicate the direct labour costs and overhead costs from which the rates were derived.    In our opinion information of this kind shouldhave been given in the reports to the Contracts Directorate.As it was not given, wo would have expected the staff of the contracts Directorate to have sought it in order to satisfy themselves, within the limitations of laymen, that the data onwhich they were basing their assessment of fair and. reasonable prices was sound.   We found that the staff concerned had notprobed very deeply for this information.    They had obtained/details20
Retails of some of the allowances which the technical costOfficers had added- to their basic estimates and., late in theday, they had obtained, from the accountants the total direct labour costs and total of overhead costs on which the 558/brate was based.    But they did not obtain any details of the composition of these total costs so that they could becritically examined,    i:re cannot say, of course, whether the outcome of tho Mk, I Bloodhound pricing would have been anydifferent if the Contracts Directorate staff had. probed moredeeply.Staffing difficulties63,   We were told that at the time that the Mk. I Bloodhoundcontracts were priced the branch of the Contracts Directorateconcerned with guided weapon contracts was working under great pressure and was under-staffed.   A measure of the under-staffingcan be gauged from the fact that 11 additional posts, represent-ing over a 50% increase in staff, were approved in May, I960,but were not filled until October, I960, too late to have easedthe pressure by the time Mk. I Bloodhound, was priced.    We were also told that the incumbents of the three senior postsconcerned with the Mk, I Bloodhound pricing - the Director of contracts, Deputy Director and Assistant Director - had allchanged within the six months preceding the price agreement.It may be, therefore, that the depth of the ContractsDirectorate13 probing was affected by its staffing situation;certainly we were disturbed when a senior member of thatDirectorate told us that at least 80% of his time was spenton matters relating to specific contracts and that his manage-ment responsibilities could not be given adequate attentionunder conditions of heavy pressure and excess hours.6ii,    There have also been staffing problems in the Directoratesof Technical Costs and Accountancy Services but neither ofthese Directorates has represented to us that their work inconnection with the MA. I Bloodhound contracts was affectedthereby.PART III. - Observations65,    In paragraphs 39 to 6/4 we have reported our views on thefacts that we have established.   We make the following observa-tions on the conduct of the Ministry of Aviation and ofFerrahti Ltd. in the pricing of the Mk. I Bloodhound contracts.Observations on the conduct of. the. iilji io^rxj^f., Av iat ion66.    Three criticisms can be made of the Ministry.    The first isthat they placed reliance on their technical cost estimatingorganisation in an extremely advanced, and complex technicalfield without the means of checking the accuracy of their estimates by reference to actual prime costs achieved.    Thesecond is that there was no effective collaboration betweenbranches which should have been working together towards thecommon goal of fair and reasonable prices.    This collaborationexists for aircraft and aero-engine contracts, but the Ministryfailed to recognise its importance in other contracts.    The thirdcriticism is that the handling of the Mk. I Bloodhound productioncontracts revealed-, in. all the Directorates concerned, a lack of direction and a lack of drive In making the best use of theMinistry&apos;s resources,/Si.21
tjj.    In this report we have remarked, on the indifferentperformance of duties &quot;by technical cost officers (e.g.paragraphs 1+2, 56 and 60) and we feel that the higherofficers of the Directorate of Technical Costs failed torecognise the importance of selecting a. suitably qualifiedteam to handle the work involved in a. novel, complicatedelectronic mechanism.   We recognise that they may have beenhampered in this respect by staff difficulties but this doesnot completely excuse them    &apos;Ve have referred to failures onthe accountancy side (paragraphs L5, 1+9, 56, 60 and 6l)largely symptomatic of an approach that is more concerned to check the accuracy of the figures and facts put in front of them by the firm than to probe thoroughly the charges which the Ministry would be called upon to bear.    The higherthe overhead recovery rate they were putting forward the moreshould the Directorate of Accountancy Services have sought toestablish not only the accuracy of the figures but also the justification for the charges.      Both the technical coots andthe accountancy directorates lived in separate ivory toworsneither of them seeking the help of, or seeking to help, theother.68.    Paragraphs k8, 50, 51, 61 and 62 indicate the ways inwhich we consider the Contracts Directorate to have failedto measure up to the high standards reoaiired in dealing withcontracts of high value for novel and complicated equipments.Here again we detect a too easy acceptance of information furnished to them and inability to recognise that the nature and cost of the equipments required that special care beexercised.    Prices were being fixed in October, I960, on technical cost estimates framed many months before but no attempt was made to seek confirmation that the estimatesrepresented the conditions of manufacture then being experienced.    In the Contracts Directorate, staffingdifficulties (paragraph 63) undoubtedly played a part inthis situation, but though this may excuse the individualsit does not excuse the Directorate as a whole.69o    We have been told that collaboration, particularly betweenthe Directorate of Technical Costs and the Directorate ofAccountancy Services, has been strengthened since the time whenthe Mk. I Bloodhound contracts were priced.   We ,;:;ere glad to learnof the recent re-organisation within the Ministry -&quot;hich has put the Directorate of Accountancy Services within the ContractsDivision end under the same Under-Secretary as the Directoratesof Contracts and the Directorate of Technical Coots.    Thisshould, ease the task of developing more effective and more widespread collaboration.70.    Our terms of reference focusaed attention on a few contractsthat represent a very small part of the Ministry of Aviation&apos;scontract work.    In our inquiry we have gained an insight into the wider field of this work which leads us to believe that theDirectorates of Contracts, Technical Costs and AccountancyServices generally operate to higher standards than were evidentin the case of the Mk. I Bloodhound contracts.Ohservations on the conduct.-of &quot;Ferranti .Ltd.71.    Our principal criticism of Ferranti Ltd. is that theysubmitted quotations and. agreed, prices which they knew were very likely to yield profits that the Ministry would not regard asfair and reasonable, profits which can only be described as/excessive22
J^excessivc.    Their present clcim that a high profit was^necessary for reasons extraneous to the Mk. I Bloodhoundproduction contracts is not justified, the other party tothe price agreement hot being made aware of these reasonsat the time.    We think, too, that the firm must have undulystressed in their early talks with the technical cost officers the complexity and production difficulties to be expected.Acknowledgement72,    We cannot conclude this report without paying testimonyto the staff who have served, us in the Inquiry so far.   first and foremost is Mr. E.A. Drake, our Secretary who also acted as leader of the investigating team which we sent to the firm&apos;3works when they opened their books and records to our examina-tion.   His knowledge of contracts work overall, hisindefatigable energy, his quick perception and constructivethinking have been of untold value to us.73.    Fop the investigation work we established a termcomprising three technical specialists (one from the royal ordnance Factories service and two from within the Ministryof Aviation) and two accountants (one from the Royal OrdnanceFactories service and one from the Ministry of Aviation), all of them handpicked:    this team tackled their unaccustomed taskwith vigour and a determination to secure the maximum ofinformation that would help us.    From the commencement oftheir task they were working against a tight time-table which only their willingness to work long hours cheerfully enabledthem to meet.   We are grateful to them for the valuable servicethey gave to us, so fully reflected in this report.15th July, 1961;.23
