CP, (64) 141 r \COPY NO.   d ti15th July, 1964CABINETTHE SUPER VC. 10Memorandum by the Minister of AviationIWTP^ODUCTIQNIn my Directive of 1st January I asked Sir Giles Guthrie to prepare a plan for putting British Overseas Airways Corporation (BCAC) on itsfeet financially.    Sir Giles began by making a detailed study of theCorporation^ route pattern.    With two possible and marginal exceptionshe proposes to maintain the whole of the existing route pattern and mostof the frequencies.    He has concluded, however, that by higher utilisation of aircraft he can maintain BGACs services with 23 aircraft less than theCorporation^ planned strength for 1967.    He has accordingly recommended the planned strength be reduced by 23.In my Directive I asked Sir Giles Guthrie to frame his policy on acommercial basis.    He accordingly recommended that the most economicalway of reducing the planned strength would be to cancel 30 Super VC. 10sand buy 6 new American 3oeing 707s.    This recommendation was based onthe fact that the Boeing 707s have already been largely amortised and still have many years of life.    They would thus be more profitable to operatethan the new Super VC. 10s, which would have to earn their original capital cost before they could become profitable.    The running costs of a fleet of30 VC. 10s would be some  2 million more than that of an equivalentfleet of Boeing 707s.    If a decision were taken to retain the Boeing 707sand cancel the VC. 10s, it would be logical to acquire a small number ofadditional Boeing 707s to bring the planned strength of the fleet up toBOACs requirement.The cost of cancelling the VC. 10s would be  65- 70 million.    Theprospects of the aircraft would be ruined.    The industrial dislocation to be. A. G., Rolls Royce and Shorts would be very serious.    Several thousandpeople would lose their jobs.The problem was considered by a small group of Ministers under theChairmanship of the Prime Minister on 7th July.It was then agreed that Sir Giles Guthrie&apos;s proposal to cancel thewhole of the BCAC order for 30 Super VC. 10s and to buy 6 new Boeing 707swas unacceptable.    But it was also agreed that if BOAC were to be askedto take vc10s contrary to their commercial judgment, the Governmentshould put them in a position to operate VC. 10s in a commercially profit-able fashion.-1-
Taking account of the excess capital costs and running costs of operating VC. 10s instead of Boeing 707s, it appears that the cost ofcancelling all the VC. 10s is very close to the cost of enabling BOAC to operate an all-VC. 10 fleet commercially.    The cancel a small number ofVC. 10s - 10 or 15 - would, however, be cheaper.    I was accordinglyasked to consider in detail the financial and other implications of cancelling15, 10 or no VC. 10s.Meanwhile in a conversation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand myself, Guthrie has told us that he now reckons he will need not 40 but47 aircraft in 1968.    This is a new factor which we must take account ofin our calculations.    I accordingly analyse below the advantages and dis-advantages of cancelling 15, 12, 10 or no VC. 10s.    The case for cancelling12 VC. 10s has been added at Guthriers  instance since it would allow himto keep all his existing fleet of Boeing 707s.FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT COURSESCancelling        Cancelling        Cancelling Cancelling1J5 12 10 Nonetrillion)     85&apos;-9&apos;&apos;* &quot;-8S ?9-88* 10&amp;-114These figures show that cancelling no VC. 10s is - - 26 million more expensive than cancelling 10 aircraft, 29 million more expensive than cancelling 12 aircraft and 20 million more expensive than cancelling 15 aircraft.Similarly, it will be seen that cancelling 10 VC. 10s is marginally more expensive than cancelling 12.    The full analysis of the figtires given above is set out at Appendix I.PJTJT5RC ONSIDERA TIONS.The general considerations in favour and against the differentcourses are set out below:(a) Cancelling^ 15 Super VC. 10sThis is no longer the cheapest course.    It would also involve buying3 new Boeing 707s.    I have accordingly not considered it further.(b) Cancelling 12 Super VC. 10sArguments in Favour(i)   This is the cheapest course.(ii) It is the course Guthrie put to the Chancellor and myself as havingthe advantage of leaving him with his full fleet of 20 Boeing 707s.    It wouldthen strengthen his position to buy further Boeings in the near future.Arguments Against(i)  The chances of selling further VC. 10s to other customers would bevery seriously damaged.    Damage would also be done to the prospects ofthe BAG. 111.
(ii) There would be some immediate industrial consequences, since work is proceeding on 2 of the 12 VC. 10s. There would be a few redundancies atWeybridge over the next few months.(iii) Public opinion would be disturbed by so large a number ofcancellations.(c) Cancellation of 10 VClOsArguments in Favour(i)  This course would be  26 million cheaper than cancelling none.Arguments Against(i) A cancellation of this size would also have a serious adverse effecton sales prospects of the VC. 10 and some on the sale of the BAG. 111.(d) No Cancellation of VC. 10sArguments in Favour(i)  This course would be a vote of confidence in the VC. 10 and would greatly improve the propsect of further sales.(ii) It would give BOAC an all-British fleet and so make it likely thatthey v/ould buy British in the future.(iii) This would probably be the most popular course in the country andin Parliament.Arguments Against(i)  This would be the most expensive course.(ii) It will be the least attractive to BOAC.conclusions as between cancelling 12 and cancelling 10 VC. 10s, the argumentseems to be against 12.    Ten is the maximum number that could be cancelled without any early industrial consequences.    This and thepolitical considerations involved seem to me to out-weigh the financialsaving of  2- 3 million.The financial gain of cancelling 10 VC. 10s over cancelling none is substantial.    It would, however, make it very unlikely that further VC. 10swould be sold.    I believe, moreover, that by adopting this course we shouldalso make it likely that BOAC would seek to order further American aircraft in the future.    We should in effect be contracting out of the long rangesubsonic jet market.
There is a further consideration here.   Our earlier discussion ofcancelling 15 or 10 VC. 10s envisaged some sale of Boeing 707s.    Guthrieis now proposing that we should cancel 12 VC. 10s and keep all his Boeings(or if we cancelled 10 VC. 10s, all but 2 of his Boeings).    It would bedifficult for public opinion to accept this.I accordingly conclude in favour of an all VC. 10 fleet.    Such adecision is admittedly the more expensive by  26 million, but it is wholly-consistent with our decision in 1958 to refuse to allow BOAC to buy furtherBoeings and with our policy that the Corporation should fly British when-ever possible.    This would offer the best chance of selling the VC. 10overseas and of developing its considerable potentialities.J.A.Ministry of Aviation, S. W, 1.15th July, 1964
