LEGISLATION ON THE LIABILITY OF operators of NUCLEAR shipd memorandum by the Lord Chancellorlo       The Cabinet invited me on 30th January to examine inconsultation with the Ministers concerned the need to enact legislationapplying the principle of sole and absolute liability to the operators of nuclear ships (CM. (64) 8th Conclusions, Minute 8).   I examined the problem in consultation with the Lord President, the HomeSecretary, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Attorney-Generaland the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Minister of Transport could not attend, but v/as represented by a senior official.   On 24th February I reported to the Prime minister the conclusions we had reached and the dissentient views of theMinistry of Transport.   The conclusions,the majority reached after considering the Ministry!s arguments were: that preparation oflegislation applying the principle of sole and absolute liability both to merchant ships and warships should be put in hand that delaymight make our embarrassment in relation to Holy Loch worse andthat in view of the prominent part played by us in preparing the brussels Convention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Shipsit would be difficult to make any radical departure from principlesthere laid down (GEN. 841/1st Meeting).2.       On 26th February the Prime Minister minuted me that weshould prepare legislation but that no hint should be given that this/as being done.3.      I now understand that the Minister of Transport remainsstrongly opposed to any legislation, and it appears from thememorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence on Visits of nuclear Powered V/airships (C. P. (64) 106) that he is no longerprepared to accept the principle of sole and absolute liability inrespect of accidents in the course of visits by our nuclear warshipsto foreign ports,   I believe that a firm decision is now necessary on our intention to legislate and, if so, on the question whether thelegislation should establish sole and absolute liability.   these decisions may well have repercussions on the provisions on liabilitycontained in paragraph 3 of the draft Statements on the Operationof Nuclear Powered War ships in Foreign Forts in Annexes A and Bto the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum.-1-CP. (64) 107 COPY NO.    ^22nd May, 1964CABINET
4.       When the &quot;Savannah1 s&quot; arrival in July is announced,   wemay well be asked about liability should there be a nuclear incident.The agreement the Foreign Secretary is negotiating with the UnitedStates Government about this will only become really effective when we have by legislation established the principle of sole and absolute liability.   This is hardly likely to escape notice if the agreement is published, and we ought then to be in a position to say that thenecessary legislation is being drafted.5.      A Bill imposing sole and absolute liability in respect of nuclear incidents occurring on land is likely to be ready for introduction early next Session.   The Minister of Pov/er does not want to be very much behind our co-signatories to the ParisConvention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy(Cmnd. 1211) and wants to be one of the early adherents to the ViennaConvention on the same subject (Cmnd. 2333). A Bill dealing withincidents on land is likely to provoke enquiries about the positionin respect of sea incidents, and I have suggested that there wouldbe advantage in a single Bill imposing sole and absolute liabilitywhether the incident occurs at sea or on land.   I know that several of my colleagues take the view that two Bills, one dealing withincidents on land and the other with incidents on ships would be the better solution.   If so, I still feel it desirable that the two bills should be introduced at about the same time and, in view of the HolyLoch position and the situation likely to arise as the result of the visit by the &quot;Savannah&quot;, I believe that the legislation dealing withships should be prepared without delay.6.       I am accordingly asking my colleagues -(i)     to endorse the conclusion arrived at in the consultations referred to in paragraph 1,namely that there should be legislationapplying the principle of sole andabsolute liability both to nuclear merchant ships and to nuclear warships, and(ii)     to decide that the drafting of the necessaryBill should be carried forward withoutdelay.D.Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office, S.W.122nd May, 1964-Z-
