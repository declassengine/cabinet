(64) 148 COPY NO.  j J20th July. 1964CABINETTHE SUPER VC. 10Note by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I attach the text ofthe Parliamentary statement which, following Cabinst&apos;s discussion on Friday, 17th July (CM. (64) 39th Conclusions), the Ministerof Aviation proposes to make this afternoon.(Signed)  BURKE trend cabinet Office, S.W. 120th July, 1964confidential
REVISEDRAFT STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER OF AVIATIONWith permission I will make a statement about the size and composition of the B.O.A.C. fleet of aircraft.As tho House knows, B.O.A.C. have ordered 30 Super VC 10s.   these aircraft with the 12 Standard VC 10s now being delivered and the 20 Boeing 707s :now in service would make a total fleet of 62.When Sir Giles Guthrie assumed the Chairmanship of B.O.A.C. on January 1,1964? I sent him a directive which was published in Hansard on February 5*In this I askod Sir Giles to prepare a plan for putting the Corporation onits feet financially.   This plan is intended to cover all aspects of B.O.A.C.&apos;operations, and Sir Giles has not yet completed his work on it.   He has,however, already made a detaoled study of the Corporations route pattern.He does not propose to make many reductions in this and, indeed, has plans for extending it.   He has, however, concluded that by higher utilisation of aircraft he can maintain B.0.A.C.&apos;s services in 1967 with 23 less passengeraircraft than the Corporation had previously planned.   In other words hejudges that he will need a fleet of about 39 passenger aircraft in 196? insteadof 62.As the House knows, the question which now has to be decided is what isthe best solution to the problem which has arisen as a result of B.O.A.C.having ordered more aircraft than it now appears will be needed.Sir Giles and the other members of the Corporation have reached theconclusion that the right   course for B.O.A.C. to follow would be to cancel the order for 30 Super VC 10s.This would involve heavy cancellation charges.     It would reduce thefleet to 32.   To meet their requirements B.O.A.C. wish to buy 6 now Boeings707s.   The fleet would then consist of 26 Boeing 707s and 12 Standard VC 10s.The main consideration that has led B.O.A.C. to this conclusion is thefact that the 20 Boeing 707s now held by B.O.A.C. have a number of years of life before them and have already been largely amortised in the Corporation&apos;saccounts.   Tho cost of amortising new Super VC 10s would be much greater thanthe further depreciation of tho Boeings now in service.In tho opinion of B.0.A.C.?the continued use of the Boeing 707s wouldbe more profitable than their replacement by Super VC 10s, and it would be more economical to buy new Boeing 707s rather than to take Super VC 10s.Sir Giles has told us that B.O.A.C. will need about 8 further aircraftafter 1968.     If B.O.A.C. were now to buy 6 hew Boeing 707s, this furtherrequirement would almost certainly have to be met by further purchases ofBoeing 707s.
Implementation of this proposal would thus mean the cancellation of30 Super VC 10s and the purchase of 14 new Boeing 707s. The fleet wouldthen consist of 34 Boeing 707s and 12 Standard VC 10s.I wish to stress the point that the question is not simply whataircraft B.O.A.C. should now order to meet their estimated requirements, but whether they should cancel the order already given and at the same timeembark on a policy of replacing some of the cancelled Super VC 10s withBoeing 707s.While I appreciate the force of the considerations advanced bySir Giles Guthrie5 I do not think it would bo/right
right to allow B.O.A.C. to cancel the order given by them for Super VC 10swith a view to buying more Boeing 707sThe trials of the Super VC 10 show that they will be aircraft of very high performance and quality,,   Their quietness, slower landing speed and relatively short take off and landing capacity should give them greatappeal both to passengers and operators.The result of following BoOoAoG,&apos;s commercial proposals would be to inflict extensive injury on the British Aircraft Industry and those whowork in it and also serious damage to the prospects of a fine and promisingaircraft.I have had several talks with Sir Giles and in view of all these considerations, including the existence of the contracts, he has agreedthat B.0.A.Co will take 17 of the 30 Super VC 10s,   This means that hewill take 7 to meet his estimated requirements up to 19&amp;7 and subsequentlya further 10.   As the House will appreciate, this is 2 more than he nowthinks will be required after 1968 and B.O.A.C., if their present forecast of future traffic requirements does not in fact prove to be an underestimate,may decide when they get the additional 2 VC 10s to dispose of 2 of the boeing 707s.Of the balance of 13 Super VC 10s, the R.A.F. will take 3 in additionto the 11 Standard VC 10s now on order by the Air Force,   These 3 aircraft will be needed to maintain our strategic airlift capacity as existingtransport aircraft cease to be operational.Work will therefore continue as planned on 20 of the 30 Super VC 10sordered by B0O.A0C0What should be done with regard to the balance of 10?   I have foundthis a very intractable problem.   B0O.A.C. are in ray view quite rightlynot prepared at this time to say how many more or indeed what aircraftthey may need at the end of the decade in addition to the kl fox whichthey now have a requirement.
In April? 19^3? I took the precaution of asking the B.A.C, to suspendwork on 10 of the Super VO 10s ordered &quot;by B.O.A.G.   The work on these aircraft is not very far advanced and a final decision with regard to themneed not now he taken.   Work on these aircraft will remain in suspensefor the time being.B.0.A.C.&apos;s fleet as now planned wi11 consist of 17 Super VC 10s?12 Standard VG 10s - in all 29 VC 10s and 18-20 Boeing 707s-    It couldwell he that in the light of operating experience, B.O.A.C. may wish toreplace the Boeing 707s as they age with Super VC 10s.   It may be thatsome new features can with advantage he incorporated in the Super VC 10s?and it may be that B.0.A.C.&apos;s requirements after 1968 will exceed presentforecasts.It does not therefore appear to be sensible now to decide to cancel the order for these 10.   As I have said, work on them will remain in suspensefor the time being.I have assured Sir Giles Guthrie that it is the Government&apos;s intention that the Corporation should he put in a position to operate their new fleeton a fully commercial basis.    I mean by this that B.O.A.C. shall be in no worse a financial position as a result of talcing on new and unamortizedaircraft than they would have been under the proposals put forward byB.O.A.C.   The detailed implementation of this assurance will be worked out between my Department? the Treasury and the Corporation in the context of any other steps necessary to put B.O.A.C. on its feet financially.Sir Giles Guthrie on behalf of B.O.A.C. and Sir Charles Dunphieand Sir George Edwards on behalf of Vickers and the British aircraft corporation respectively have assured me of their full co-operation inthe discussions which must necessarily take place in view of the decisionsI have a announced.   I would like to express my thanks to them for their help in seeking to find the best solution of the difficulties which have arisen as a result of B0O.A.C.&apos;s ordering more aircraft than are now required.
