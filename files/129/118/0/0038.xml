INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP THE WORK OF THE UNITED nations conference ON TRADE AND development memorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional development and President of the Board of TradeIntroductoryWhen I reported to my colleagues on 18th June on the United nations conference on Trade and Development, I was invited (CM. (64) 32nd Conclusions,Minute 5 (2)) &quot; to submit in due course proposals about the policy which we should adopt as regards the arrangements to be made in relation to the new institutionwhich was to develop the work of the conference on a continuing basis &quot;.2. The conference recommended that it should be established as a permanent organisation of the United Nations General Assembly and should meet at least once in three years, beginning in 1966. The conference also recommended theestablishment within the United Nations of a Trade and Development Board,consisting of 55 members elected by the conference, to carry out the functions ofthe conference between sessions. The Board is to set up subordinate commissionsin the fields of (1) primary commodities, (2) manufactures, and (3) invisibles and finance.3. These recommendations now fall to be considered by the Economic and social Council of the United Nations and to be submitted by this council to the nineteenth Assembly of the United Nations which will be held from November1964 to February 1965.4. With a view to the effective working of the institutional arrangementsreferred to in paragraph 2 above, a special committee is to be appointed by theSecretary-General of the United Nations to prepare proposals &quot;designed toestablish a process of conciliation to take place before voting, and to provide anadequate basis for the adoption of recommendations with regard to proposals ofa specific nature for action substantially affecting the economic or financial interests of particular countries &quot;. This special committee is expected to meet on20th September and its report, if available in time, to be considered at the nineteenth Assembly.5. There are two points of difficulty on which I would like the views of mycolleagues. First, we need to decide what attitude to adopt on the question whetherthe Trade and Development Board, with its subsidiary bodies and secretariat, should meet in Geneva or New York. Secondly, we need to decide our attitude to proposalsof the United States for a system of dual voting designed to protect the minorityinterests of the developed countries from the majority vote of the developing countries.6. Location of the Trade and Development Board and the Secretariat of thenew institutions. There are likely to be informal discussions during the currentmeeting of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations on the questionwhether the Board should be in Geneva or in New York. The arguments for eachof these locations are fairly evenly balanced.7.   The arguments for Geneva can be summarised as follows:(a) If the Board, like the GATT, met in Geneva, it might compete less withthe GATT, and better relations might be established between theSecretariats of the two bodies.4587I---^-;-Printed for the Cabinet.

\b) The proximity of Geneva to London would lessen the cost and difficultyof staffing arrangements for us especially as it might be possible to somegvextent to combine representation at the Board with representation aWrthe GATT.\c) Governments might tend to be represented by trade experts rather than by officers from their mainly political delegations in New York and the atmosphere of the discussions might be more practical and less political.\d) The Board might be more likely to reach negotiated agreements on trademeasures than to adopt recommendations of a general character.8.   The arguments for New York can be summarised as follows:(a) The tendency of the Secretariat of the Board to be independent of theUnited Nations Secretariat, and hence to convert themselves into the secretariat of an International Trade Organisation, might possibly bereduced.(b) The United Nations Secretary-General and Secretariat would take a morebalanced view than the Secretariat of the Board on the scope of its activities. Budgetary control might also be more effective.9. It is believed that the Americans favour New York, and that the French,the Indians and the USSR favour Geneva. The views of the developing countries are not known in detail, but those with limited resources may favour New Yorkin order to economise on personnel. Dr. Prebisch, Secretary-General of the Tradeand Industry Conference, is said strongly to favour New York in order that the newinstitutions should not be influenced by the GATT. Presumably he believes that political pressures will be more effective in New York. At official level Departmentsconsider that the balance of advantage slightly favours New York as the seat ofthe Secretariat. They think that, given that most countries are likely to favour -New York, we should express a preference for it. Our attitude should, however,be flexible in case the expectation that others will prefer New York to Geneva iswrong. We should, however, on grounds of efficiency and economy, oppose any suggestion that the seat of the Secretariat should be in the developing countries.We would not mind the Conference itself or the Trade and Development Boardmeeting from time to time away from New York.10. I personally believe that the balance of advantage favours Geneva. Ifthe Board and Secretariat are in New York I cannot see how they can ever be other than influenced largely by political considerations. If they are situated in geneva there is at least a chance that by living and working alongside thepermanent delegation to the GATT, EFTA, etc., both the delegations and the secretariat could be brought to be more realistic about the problems of tradeand development. Moreover, if many of the developing countries have to sendofficials to Geneva especially for the meetings they will send trade officials ratherthan those from political departments such as they would use in New York. Iwould therefore prefer Geneva. Otherwise I agree with the recommendation of officials in paragraph 9 above.11. Voting procedures. The United States delegation at the TradeConference informed us that their Governments acceptance of the new institutions in the trade field would be conditional on the adoption of a system of dual voting.By dual voting we understand a procedure which would stipulate a majority ofprincipal trading countries as well as of developing countries, in addition to amajority of the whole. The object of this system would be to offset the minorityposition of the developed countries in relation to the developing. The UnitedStates delegation requested an assurance of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments support for this position, but no assurance was given. What we did do in the final criticalnegotiation against the united hostility of the developing countries was to keepthe door open for the United States delegation to put its point of view on dualvoting to the special committee in New York in the autumn.12. The delegations at Geneva of the 75 developing countries were strongly opposed to dual voting. They issued a declaration after the Conference in whichthey categorically affirmed the right of the proposed Board and conference toadopt recommendations on any point of substance by a two-thirds majority vote in the case of the conference and a simple majority in the case of the Board.&apos; they stated that they attached cardinal importance to democratic procedures whichafforded no position of privilege in the economic and financial, no less than in thepolitical, sphere.
. 13. The French delegation at Geneva made known their opposition to dualg/oting and of ;the remainder of the Western delegations few are solidly in favour.&quot;There is no clear indication of the Soviet attitude, but the Soviet Government arehardly likely to align themselves against the 75 on this matter.14. There seems small likelihood that the United States, even if supportedby other Western countries, could secure a majority in the Special Committee orin the General Assembly for any form of dual voting which could be effective in protecting minority interest. I. do not believe this would be possible even if theUnited States were disposed to exercise maximum pressure, e.g., by threateningto withhold funds.15. The background to the problem is as follows. Under existing votingprocedures in the United Nations and Specialised Agencies resolutions imposingfinancial obligations on member Governments can be adopted by majoritieswhich have little relation to the relative responsibilities or wealth of member states. We share the concern of the United States Government over the tendency to railroad resolutions irrespective of the interests of States bearing the mainresponsibility. The introduction of special voting procedures could eventually be a possible method of improving control by the principal contributing States,and in this sense it was discussed at official level with the United States in May.16. This does not apply however to the institutions proposed by the geneva conference for the following reasons. First the special procedures in the newinstitutions will not directly relate to expenditure because under therecommendations of the conference this remains with the Assembly. We mustnot confuse budgetary issues with wider questions of economic policy. Secondly,it is essential to maintain the position that the resolutions of the General assembly and subsidiary bodies (apart from budgetary questions) impose no obligations of policy on Governments which do not accept them. As the new institutionsmust operate within the United Nations Charter they cannot go beyond making recommendations to Governments. The adoption of any special voting procedure would be liable to expose member States to increased pressure to comply with recommendations adopted in accordance with such procedure, whether or not they had voted in their favour.17. There is a case for a conciliation procedure which provides for a delay indecisions by the Board or conference and gives improved opportunities for negotiation between the different groups, as is the practice in GATT; but we seedanger in formal or automatic procedures designed to bring pressure to bear onminorities or to elevate the status of resolutions adopted after such procedures.18. The considerations in paragraphs 14-17 above were put to the state department on 6th July. The additional point was made that it was difficult to threaten to withhold contributions at a time when efforts were being made to getthe Russians to pay their share of the costs of peacekeeping operations.19.   In reply the United States made the following points:(a) they had not yet considered the problem to any great extent;\b) they would certainly take the position that no recommendation, whetherarrived at by special procedures or otherwise, could compel a countryto act against its will;(c) they agreed that a recommendation arrived at by special procedures would carry greater moral weight (see paragraph 16 above). Indeed this was a consideration which had led the United States to favour specialprocedures. If the machinery were good, the conclusions would represent a consensus, have value and meaning, and set up moralpressure which would have effect on public opinion or, for example, onCongress. It was desirable that the Trade and Development Board have some meaning and not be just a debating society;(d) it might be that, in the final analysis, the United States would revert tosome kind of conciliation arrangement;(e) however, it might still be necessary, in order to make this work in practice,to provide for some kind of special voting procedure as a disincentiveto the less developed countries to force confrontations through insisting on taking a vote before there had been proper discussion of the mattersat issue;(/) tactically it would be unwise to abandon at this early stage the general position adopted by the developed countries at Geneva. (In fact the
majority of the developed countries at Geneva did not adopt this general position : a number, including ourselves, went along with the United^States in an attempt to maintain Western unity.) In other words, it woulcP^be a mistake (and the United States Mission at New York agreed very strongly with this) to adopt in relation to the Commonwealth PrimeMinisters&apos;meeting anything other than a relatively hard line.20. Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington, in reporting the above, considerthat the United States have a valid point at (c) above. In sum, whilst reserving the right to disregard any recommendations they regard as unacceptable, they still wish that the new institutions should produce recommendations which willcommand general support and should contribute to a process of mutual education.21. The above gives the impression that the United States are not irrevocablycommitted to holding out for dual voting, although their line may harden when mr. Richard Gardner, the influential official who propagated this policy at Geneva,returns to Washington. It may be that they think they can use dual voting as a bargaining counter, which they would be prepared to give away in exchange forreasonable conciliation arrangements. In my view there is no bargaining counterhere for the United States to use.22.  To sum up:id) Dual voting has no chance of being accepted, and an attempt to make ita condition of bringing the new institutions into existence would seriously embitter relations between the developed and developing countries.ib) There may be a case for taking a firm line on financial control in theUnited Nations Specialised Agencies, and this is under consideration.The Trade Conference is poor ground to start this battle as it is notbudgetary questions which are at issue.(c) The Article XIX dispute over peace-keeping finances makes this a particularly inappropriate moment to threaten withholding of funds from the United Nations.23. Conclusions. I, therefore, recommend to my colleagues (1) that, as regards the location of the Secretariat and the Trade andDevelopment Board, we should express preference for Geneva asthe headquarters for the new institutions but that we should be preparedto consider New York, if the great majority of developing countriesprefer it, and to agree to the holding of meetings of the conference orthe Trade and Development Board from time to time in places otherthan New York if that is the general wish;(2) that, as regards dual voting,(a) the paramount consideration is to maintain the position thatresolutions adopted in the new institutions will not be mandatoryand to do nothing which might alter this;(b) on the merits of the case, we see no object in supporting a lostcause. The United States immensely damaged their own position at Geneva as a result of raising this issue; some of the blameattached itself to us and other Western countries the UnitedStates gained nothing;(c) we should not now prejudice our chances of maintaining our influence over the developing countries, including those in theCommonwealth, by supporting a proposal for dual voting in anyway whatever.We should now inform the United States that this is our position.id) we should continue to review whether conciliation proceduressatisfactory to ourselves can be devised and we should try tobring the United States to accept that the best we are likelyto be able to obtain is some form of conciliation procedure.We should try to persuade them that their protracted adherence to &quot; dual voting &quot; may make the developing countries so angryas to render very difficult any eventual agreement on conciliationprocedures.E.
