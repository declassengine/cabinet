Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1964CP. (64) 143 Copy No.  8315th July, 1964CABINETTHE PROSPECTS FOR EXPENDITURE, TAXATION ANDTHE ECONOMYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the chief secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster GeneralTreasury Ministers have a duty to warn their colleagues about the implications of Government expenditure commitments from time to time and in particular toproduce regular estimates of aggregate future supply expenditure. We haveourselves issued warnings on the subject of expenditure and taxation this year in CP. (64) 3, 8 and 65. We feel that we must explain again, in the clearest possibleterms, the situation that has now been reached in the light of our collective decisions and on the latest available figures.Growth of Expenditure2. The Chief Secretary is circulating separately a paper (CP. (64) 144) onprospects for supply expenditure in 1965-66, as is normally done at this season ofthe year. These show an increase of 8-4 per cent in money terms or 6 per cent in real terms. No comment is needed in this paper on the seriousness of these estimates.We are concerned here not only with next year but with the general trend.3. The December 1963 White Paper on Public Expenditure. Cmnd. 2235.showed a 174- per cent increase of public expenditure at constant prices from1963-64 to 1967-68. As we said in CP. (64) 6&quot;5 this meant that even if we fullyachieved our 4 per cent growth target the ratio of public expenditure, excludingdebt interest, to gross national product would rise from the present 40 per cent to around 41^ per cent. In the White Paper itself, we said:&quot; This rate of growth [i.e., 4 per cent per annum] if maintained between now and 1967-68, should be enough to support public expenditure on thegeneral scale foreseen in this White Paper and implied by the governments policies. But if these policies seemed likely to make a larger claim on resourcesthan is here envisaged, or if the prospects for economic growth substantiallyworsened, it would clearly be necessary for the Government to review their policies accordingly.&quot;4. The latest figures for expenditure that we now have available fromDepartments are set out in the Report by the Public Expenditure Survey Committeecovering the period up to 1968-69 circulated by the Chief Secretary as CP. (64) 140.These figures show a grave deterioration. On this up-to-date basis the increase willnot be Yl\ per cent but 214- per cent and the annual rate of expenditure increase will rise from 4 -1 per cent to 5&quot; per cent and this is without taking into account the costof proposed policy changes such as improved national insurance benefits. We muststress the implications of this for taxation policy. If all this expenditure is to be financed without impinging on exports or investments, privately financedconsumption will have to carry the burden. On the best calculation we can makeassuming the highest reasonable level of savings, taxes will have to be increasedannually on the average by  100 million if we achieve the full 4 per cent growth ratefor our productive capacity, and nearly  200 million if the rate of growth of capacity is about 3 per cent, the rate of the last few years. There is no evidence to assume4590
that our productive capacity is in fact growing at 4 per cent and a rate of not much^^more than 3 per cent unfortunately seems at present a more prudent estimatedWithout any of the additions referred to above or any further commitmentstherefore we are clearly launched on a policy involving large and regular increases in taxation and this is a matter that we have no right to try to disguise.The Balance of Payments5. As our colleagues will be aware from the papers regularly circulated, ofwhich the latest, the Report of the Economic Forecasts Committee will be circulated in the next few days, the balance of payments situation at the presentmoment is one of considerable difficulty. We have a large outflow of long-term capital superimposed upon a current deficit. This is a situation that we have always anticipated would happen at the early stages of an expansion and we are confident that we have the resources to meet a short-term drain on our reserves.But there are, as we have always said two fundamental conditions. First, the strain should only be a temporary one and the position must be corrected after atime; second, the domestic economy must be sound. The forecasts suggest however that the period of balance of payments strain will be a long one and that there areunderlying weaknesses in our economy which are tending to produce recurringbalance of payments deficits.Summary6. The conclusion is inescapable that to maintain the health of our economyover the next few years we shall have to make substantial changes in the use ofour resources. The commitment of so much of our skilled manpower and our foreign exchange to defence purposes is only one example of a load that the economycannot indefinitely carry. We have not thought it right as a Government up to nowto make fundamental changes in defence policy to meet the financial realities,although we have recognised that this would have to be done in due course. Wemust point out to our colleagues that the time for doing this is rapidly approaching.7. We are not asking for any immediate decisions but we are seeking to pointout the consequences of existing policies and the determination with which decisions about Government expenditure must be handled from now on if we are to have any real opportunity of achieving the major policy objectives to which we have committed ourselves.R. M.J. A. B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,14th July, 1964.
