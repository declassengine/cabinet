(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CP. (64) 15928th July, 1964CABINETLAND VALUESMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and -LocalGovernment and MinisterjForri Welsh A.ff air sAt the discussion of my Memorandum (CP. (64) 145) on28th July (CM. (64) 42nd Meeting, Minute 4) I v/as invited by mycolleagues to circulate a note setting out alternative bases for astatement on Land Values.2.      I now therefore attach as an Annex the draft of such a state -ment with two alternative endings -&apos;A! and &apos;B&apos; .3,       &apos;A! has been drafted on the assumption that we would wish to announce our intention of seeking some means of securing for theExchequer some share in betterment realised on a sale of land.    &apos;B&apos;,on the other hand, is drafted with the intention of setting out our existing policy on land values in the best possible light.K. J.COPY NO.-Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S. W. 1.28th July, 1964
Annex   to CP. (6k) 1591.     Current high, land prices reflect the nation&apos;s prosperityand the shortage of land for all development, includinghousing.    The level of land prices is not holding back house-building, nor indeed other forms of development,2.     The building industry is fully employed and lower prices could not, in themselves, add a single extra house,3*     It is, indeed, the price that people are willing to pay for houses, or for other forms of development, that is pullingup the price of land.    So that even If one could, by somediktat, cheapen the price of land it might have singularlylittle effect on the price of houses.4*     Meanwhile people are not held back from buying or rentinghouses because of cost.   Local authorities, who must providehouses for people who cannot afford the full cost, are helped by the Exchequer subsidies - and these are currently underreview.5.     But this is not to deny that there exists a substantial body of public opinion which is concerned at the present levelof land prices.    Many people feel that there is somethingunfair in a sj^stem which can enable an individual to gainlarge unearned profits from the sale of land simply becausethat land has been selected, on planning grounds, as suitablefor early development.   Much of the increased value is attributable to the availability of services, such as roads and sewers which have been paid for by the community at large,or to planning restrictions which prevent development ofadjoining land.    It is widely felt that some at least of thisbetterment should return to the community which has donemuch to create it.
6,     A previous attempt by the Labour Government to obtainbetterment by a development charge failed - largely because it removed the incentive to land owners to bring land forward for development.    The charge further tended to be added tothe price of the land, thus actually increasing the cost ofdevelopment.7.     The policy of the Labour Party is to set up a land commission to acquire virtually all land to be developed, ifnecessary by the use of compulsory powers.    A huge officialmachine would be needed to buy and then dispose, by lease,of many thousand parcels of land each year.    The price thatwould be paid remains uncertain?    but the suggestion has beenmade that it would be well below market value.    If so, it is certain that compulsory powers would have to be used in almost every case.8,     If the aim is to acquire betterment for the coimnunitythen the Commission would need to dispose of the land abovethe price at which the land wa3 bought.    Otherwise therewould be no betterment.9.     And if the object is to cheapen land prices then therewould have to be a cat&apos;s cradle of controls to stop thelucky recipient of the land from the Land Commission fromrecouping the value the original owner had been prevented from realising,10.    The Land Commission proposals would thus merely frustrateand delay development and almost certainly fail in their ultimate objectives.11.    The plain fact is that you cannot cheapen land pricesexcept by a system of taking over the land, at confiscatoryprices, determining its disposal in an entirely arbitrary way,and maintaining control over any future disposals.    TheGovernment believe that such a system would be wholly2
unacceptable to the great majority of people, and that theright method of stabilising land prices is to increase thesupply of land by planned releases.    This is the policywhich underlies the various regional surveys.Alternative &apos;A&apos;12A. The Government recognise however that the presentprosperous and buoyant period of urban development and building investment has provided opportunities for people to obtain large unearned increments of value, some of whichshould, in equity, be returned to the communit.y - provided this can be done without slowing down, in any way, the presentpace of development,13A. After some preliminary examination of the undoubtedproblems which exist, it Is the Government&apos;s view that itshould be possible to collect a proportion of betterment by methods which need not introduce a vast new network of controls and which would not hold back the pace of development.They have therefore set in hand a further examination of thevarious possibilities of obtaining for the Exchequer -perhaps through some adaptation of existing taxationarrangements - a share in the profits now being made out ofland needed for development.Alternative &apos;B&apos;12B. The Government have however considered whether some of-the betterment could not be collected in some way or another,13B. It would, no doubt, be practicable to re-impose some sort of betterment levy on the lines of the development chargecreated by the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947.    TheGovernment abolished this in 1952, to the general relief,because the effect of the charge was that land was not coming forward for development and it was being added in part to theprice of such land as was sold.- 3 -
1423* The worst thing that any Government could do would beto check the flow of land for development.    The mostimportant thing to be done in this whole field, andespecially for housing, is to bring forward more land, agreat deal more.153. But, it is argued, if the charge were kept low enough -say 2Cfo or 30c% of the betterment due to permission for development - owners would not be discouraged.    But is it then worth collecting?   We hear a lot about the very high prices which some land is commanding^    but these cases arethe exceptions in all the transactions of land for developmentgoing on all the time.    A charge, if one is made, must biteon all cases where development takes place, those where theprice of the land is not especially high as v^ell as those where it is.    Assessment and collection of a charge entailsadministrative cost.    The net profit to the community on a modest charge might be remarkably small.16B. And if the purpose of a levy or charge is not primariljrto raise money for the community, but is mainly intended tosoothe the sense of outrage that stories of high land profitscause, then the purpose might not be achieved.    Critics of thepresent situation would not be greatly soothed to be told thata land ovmer had made  70,000 instead of  100,000 on aparticular transaction.17B. Some people claim that the right answer is site valuetaxation.    This will be studied in the review of the rating system now being made.    But there are real difficulties inlevying a tax on a value which the owner may be quite unableto realise because of planning restrictions,18B. In the Governments view an attempt to collect bettermentwould not be worth while. They will concentrate their efforts on promoting housing and development generally and by ensuring a plentiful supply of land, will thus stabilise land prices.- 4 -SECRET
