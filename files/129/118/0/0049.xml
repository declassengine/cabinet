Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1964CP. (64) 149 Copy No.21st July, 1964CABINETKENNEDY ROUNDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional development and President of the Board of TradeI last reported to my colleagues on this subject in April shortly before the ministerial meeting in Geneva of the GATT Trade Negotiations Committee on 4th May (CP. (64) 90). I explained that progress was bound to be slow, since theUnited States would not be ready for serious bargaining before their election andthe E.E.C. had no incentive or desire to make concessions prematurely. My aim at the Geneva meeting was to keep things moving this year without spectacularconfrontations or upsets.GATT Ministerial meeting in May2. In the event this meeting went much as expected. The Kennedy Roundwas formerly inaugurated and Ministers recorded a general intent to co-operate inthe solution of outstanding problems. The Resolution also mentioned for the first time (as the United States wished) the objective of a 50 per cent general linearreduction in tariffs but only (as the Six insisted) as a &quot; working hypothesis &quot; whoseapplication was linked with the solution of outstanding problems and, in general,with the achievement of reciprocity.3. It was agreed that countries should table on 10th September their lists ofexceptions &quot; to be necessitated only by reasons of overriding national interest &quot; from the general linear cut. The United States made a clumsy attempt to make thisdependent on progress in settling the problem of disparities and other issues; thiswas particularly ill-advised because it was already common knowledge at the time that they themselves would find the September date, so close to their Novemberelection, politically impossible. This move, therefore, was transparently designedto put the blame on the Six for a postponement likely to be required for UnitedStates domestic reasons and was obviously unacceptable to the Six. A few weeks after the meeting the United States themselves asked for the date to be amended to 16th November and this has been agreed.The current situation(a) Industrial tariffs4. The position after the May meeting on the industrial aspect of thenegotiations is by no means comfortable or easy but probably viable. The mainargument has been about &quot; tariff disparities&quot;, Le., the fact that the United Statestariff (and to a lesser extent ours) contains a good many rates much higher thanthose in the common tariff of the E.E.C. and the French view that to applyequal cuts to unequal tariffs will not give a fair result. The Six say that in thesecases a 50 per cent cut by the United States is only worth a shallower cut bythem. The prolonged attempts by the experts to work out rules to meet this problem failed. (The Annex to CP. (64) 90 explained why this was.) Basically,any rule that would avoid damage to third countries would, in the view of the six, unacceptably restrict their claims against the United States.4614
5. The Six thought they could meet the difficulty of the smaller efta countries by bilateral deals to buy them off. They were uneasily conscious thaljthis technique could not be applied to us as a key country. When M. Rey, the&quot;member of the European Economic Commission responsible for external relations,came to see me in April, he saw our difficulty and proposed, in effect, that weshould leave over for settlement in the final bargaining whatever differences laybetween us over the fair extent of the Six&apos;s disparity claims. This proposal alsoreflected the fact that the Six saw no advantage in disclosing their hand fullyon disparities until they could see how the exceptions lists looked and what additional concessions might be available in the field of non-tariff barriers. HenceM. Rey envisaged a package deal in which differences in lengths of exceptionslists, differences over disparities and non-tariff barriers could all be traded off inthe final bargaining on a basis of reciprocity.6. I certainly have no illusion that the negotiation of such a package dealwould be other than tough and lengthy: it would clearly be open to obstructivetactics if the French or others wanted to frustrate a settlement. Nevertheless itsuits us better to start the negotiation on the &quot; package &quot; basis with no rules fordisparities than to start from bad rules. I should also much prefer to see negotiationsabout tariffs started than go on for ever negotiating about rules for negotiatingabout tariffs. In any case there is no way of coercing the Six to agree to rules thatwould suit us. We have to remember in all this that the only bargaining weapon ina tariff negotiation is the attractive force of one&apos;s own concessions: no side can be forced, nor is it a GATT requirement, to offer more by way of reduced protectionthan they conceive it to be in their interests to concede in the light of what they can get for their exports.7. Thus, if industrial tariffs were all in this negotiation, 1 should expect the bargaining to be lengthy and difficult but I should also hope to get a reasonablycomprehensive multilateral deal. I very much doubt whether the Six would in theend accept a general cut in tariffs of more than, say, 30 per cent and the average level of cuts would be brought below this by their exceptions and disparity claims.Even so, much of their industrial tariff might then be around the 10 per cent leveland I should regard this as offering a fair basis for continued growth of our exports and as substantially mitigating the discrimination arising from the fullimplementation of their Customs Union. This would be a better result than previousGATT conferences have achieved. Our own tactics would be to put down anexceptions list confined to a genuine minimum of items I am putting a separatenote to the Economic Policy Committee about this and then adjust our offers inthe light of those made by others. A negotiation on these lines would lose much ofthe simple, linear approach from which we all started in the Kennedy Round butit could still succeed.(b) Agriculture8. But, of course, industrial tariffs are not all in this negotiation. The realtrouble will come over agriculture and events since May, so far from advancingmatters, have served only to sharpen the inherent conflict of interest between theUnited States and the E.E.C. on this subject.9. The United States position has always been firm on the need for the kennedy Round to include genuine negotiations on agricultural trade. The GATTMinisterial meetings both in 1963 and this year have endorsed this and the E.E.C.subscribed in May to a Resolution reaffirming that the negotiations &quot; shall providefor acceptable conditions of access to world markets for agricultural products in furtherance of a significant development and expansion of world trade in such products &quot; and calling for rules and procedures to be established for this aspect ofthe negotiations. The United States are determined not to let this go and have made it clear that they will not table their exceptions list in November &quot;unless some basis for meaningful negotiation is found. To them the &quot; package deal &quot; concept isunacceptable so long as the Six refuse to indicate even in broad terms what theagricultural content of the package might be or even whether they will accept any agricultural content at all. This is not an unreasonable position, though we think the United States go too far when they demand that the tabling of exceptions listsin November shall be accompanied by the tabling of specific agricultural offer listswhich it would not be practicable for the Six to prepare at that stage.
10. The United States have carefully refrained, for wider political reasons,from directing their pressure at the Germans to settle the common grain price inthe Community. They deny that this is essential. In relation to major commodities,like cereals, their minimum aim is to secure from the Six some assurance that theiraccess to the E.E.C. market is a proper subject for negotiation: it need notnecessarily be guaranteed in quantitative terms but at least the extent to which theapplication of the common agricultural policy damages this trade should be subject,if necessary ex post facto, to confrontation and appropriate remedy. So far as other commodities are concerned, the United States say that the offer by the Six to bindthe totality of support arrangements (montant de soutien) by which the level of community prices is maintained above that of world prices is manifestlyimpracticable and that on these items, and especially on items protected only bytariffs, the Six should make reasonable offers of concessions in the usual way.11. The E.E.C. position utterly rejects these claims. At a meeting in geneva on 9th July the Community representatives made it clear that even the vague andgeneral assurance of access which the E.E.C. had given to the United States at theend of the Dillon Round in 1961 could no longer be offered. They also took theextreme position that even bound tariffs should remain bound only in relation to existing price levels and that reductions in world prices would justify increasedprotection in the Community, i.e., that even a fixed tariff must in future be regardedas a variable levy. While it was conceded under pressure that this position on tariffs might be subject to review and exception, it was indicative of the general line.12. At a meeting between officials and French officials on 16th July the conflict was exposed even more starkly. Access, said the French, could not bethe basis of negotiation. France could not be denied the technological improvements in agriculture which other countries achieved earlier: they could well increase output at the expense of United States and other imports but this was a long-termstructural change in the pattern of production and trade, and the United Statesmust put up with it. In their view the right basis for negotiation was a comparison of the domestic support policies of the main countries and the offer to bind theCommunity&apos;s arrangements (only by reference, however, to existing price levels)was an advance. In practice this doctrine means that the Community will acceptno international commitment to reduce existing measures of support (including those still to be settled as the common agricultural policy develops) though theywill stabilise them (subject to stable world prices) and perhaps make ad hocconcessions here and there on particular items. But any idea that trade shouldflow, as in the industrial sector, from low-cost to high-cost areas is regarded asa pipe dream. This may be a realistic view.Prospect for the negotiations13. Given this deadlock on agriculture, the prospect for getting thenegotiations moving is bleak. I have no reason to think that the E.E.C. will makeany concession that will come near to satisfying the United States. Equally Ibelieve the United States are determined not to table their exceptions list inNovember unless they can see some genuine prospect of progress on agriculture.14. We have been supporting the United States in their efforts to secure ameaningful basis for negotiation. The Foreign Secretary strongly urged the needfor this at last week&apos;s meeting of W.E.U. I have considered whether there is more that we could usefully do at the Ministerial level. In the light of the officials&apos; talk with the French, I could not expect to make progress with French Ministers atthis stage. The Germans are too exposed on the cereals price to demand substantial concessions from their colleagues in the Six at present. i am considering inviting the President of the European Economic Commission, Dr. Hallstein, and M. Reyhere shortly before either the end-July or the September meeting of the Councilof Ministers, since it may be of value to impress on them the need to avoid sucha complete appearance of rigidity on the part of the E.E.C. that the United Statesmake a premature break.15. Our immediate objective must indeed be to avoid a premature publicbreakdown in the negotiations. The fact that the United States do not table theirexceptions list in November will not of itself be decisive. It may indeed shockboth the new United States Administration and the Community into a searchingexamination of how far they can modify their respective positions on agriculture,
when the alternative is seen to be no Kennedy Round at all. Some people believethat when this choice is finally clear, the United States will still wish to avoid a break and may be reluctant to lose the advantages to be gained by an industrialtariff agreement, if some minimal face-saving gesture is provided on agriculture.The chance that this is so may indeed partly explain the current uncompromisingstand of the French and the E.E.C. From our point of view it would certainly be right to await this crunch which is likely to come in the early months of 1965.16. It may be necessary to this end to restrain the United States from somedramatic move to &quot; make or break &quot;, though it would seem to make no sense forthem to do this before their election. The President of the United States special representative, Mr. Herter, is expected to visit us in September and this willprovide an opportunity to advise restraint, if necessary. I shall not hesitate,however, to get in touch with him earlier, if the position seems dangerous. TheExecutive Secretary of GATT, Mr. Wyndham White, is also inclined to talk interms of suspending the negotiations if there is no progress by September. her majesty&apos;s Ambassador to GATT and EFTA in Geneva, Sir Edgar Cohen, has beenasked to restrain him.17. It may, of course, be that the positions will still be irreconcilable early next year, assuming that we can avoid a break before then, and that the kennedy round is doomed. We shall have to consider in good time what we should do inthat event. I suggest that officials should prepare a full review of the courses opento us with a view to bringing this issue to Ministers again after the election.E. H.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,20th July, 1964.
