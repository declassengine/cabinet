(i) COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS^kwM                        i.  The British Government suggest  the initiation  of  a  scheme of ^kwM^LXwM                  &quot; Commonwealth Development Projects&quot;, under which Commonwealth countries ^LWM^LXwM                  would provide technical assistance to one another in the exploitation of their ^LWM^-mjm                  resources. While the developed countries would have to provide the bulk of this ^LXjMassistance, some developing countries might in certain cases be able to help others. ^LWM^LWM                       2.  The projects would be chosen jointly by the contributors and recipients. wMMWAThe emphasis would be placed on technical aid in training, education and research,though in certain cases capital aid would be provided for the necessary buildingsand equipment. The contributing country or countries would also assist in the ^LWM^LXjM preparatory study of the project and would give such advice and help in ^LWWmanagement as was needed during the early stages. It should not be difficult to H ^H\jmselect suitable projects in agriculture and in the exploitation of other naturalresources; and projects in other fields, including industry, could also be undertaken. ^LWM3. Such projects might include for example: ^LWM(a) technical assistance in agriculture, forestry and the veterinary services with ^LWM^LXjM                                special emphasis on training and research into improved methods; or ^L*M(b) the supply of professors and equipment for an engineering college or ^L*M^LXjM                                post-graduate medical school. ^k-M4. It is suggested that each contributing country might undertake to provide^LXjM                  money and staff for certain projects. Contributing countries might sometimes ^L*Moperate a project jointly in a certain region on an agreed basis, with one of themacting as co-ordinator.^L^JM                        5.  If this scheme finds general favour among developed and developing ^L^m^L%jm                  countries, the British Government would be prepared to play a substantial part in ^L*M^m\ji                  suitable projects of this kind. The procedure for selecting and initiating projects ^LWM^L%jm                  would need to be further examined. ^k-W(ii) A COMMONWEALTH FOUNDATIONWMMMM                          (To promote non-governmental contacts within the Commonwealth) ^kwMThere is already considerable collaboration between a number of professional ^L^mbodies in Commonwealth countries, including among others those representingeducation, the law, medicine, architecture, engineering and accountancy. Thecontacts between these and similar organisations and the conferences they hold play ^-\m\wMMMM                  a most important part in strengthening the links between the peoples of the ^LXjMCommonwealth. However, the extent of their activities is inevitably restricted by ^L^M^kmm lack of finance.2. It is, therefore, suggested that consideration should be given to the ^L^jM^k-9m                  establishment of a scheme to help such bodies in Commonwealth countries to ^LXjMincrease the number of visits exchanged by their members and other contacts ^LXjMwMMMM                  between them, and to encourage the formation of additional Commonwealth ^LXjMorganisations in professional and other fields where these do not already exist. ^H\jm3. The scheme would be administered by an independent board. While it    I ^L^jM^k-WM                  would seek support from all quarters, the bulk of the resources required would ^LWMhave to be provided by Commonwealth Governments. In order to make an WMMMMappreciable impact, an income of at least  250,000 a year would be needed initially. ^LmWwMMMM                  Of this the British Government would be prepared to contribute half. ^mjM4. If this proposal should be adopted, decisions would be needed regarding ^L^jMthe terms of reference of the administering body, its title, the composition of its ^LXjM^LXwM                  board and its location, as well as the amounts to be contributed by each ^LXjMGovernment. ^LWMSECRET ^LW
SECRETI (iii) CAPITAL AID FOR HIGHER EDUCATION^gM All  Commonwealth  countries  including  Britain  are  engaged  on the^gM development of their higher education systems. Such development is vital if each^gM country&apos;s need for more people with administrative, professional and higher^gM technical qualifications is to be met. The need of developing Commonwealth^gM countries in these respects is particularly urgent. In recognition of this Britain has^gM given capital aid to such countries for building and equipping their universities,^gM technical and teacher training colleges.^gM 2.  Much of this help was given before independence. Some of it, promisedmUM before independence, has been made available in the years immediately following^gM its attainment and twice post-independence grants have been made by Britain for^gM development of higher education-in Nigeria (1962) and in East Africa (1963). But^gM the demands for facilities for higher education do not end with independence. This^gM means that developing Commonwealth countries continue to need outside help^gM over capital costs. Without an assurance that they can continue to look for a^gM measure of help such countries may not feel able to plan confidently for the future.^gAM 3.  With this situation in mind, the British Government is prepared to take^gM the necessary steps to increase, to an average of  5 million a year over the next^gM five years starting in 1965-66, the sums already being provided for higher education^gM in developing Commonwealth countries, both independent and dependent. This^gM would provide for further capital help for universities, higher technical education^gM and teacher training institutions in developing Commonwealth countries. This^gM provision could be called a Commonwealth Higher Education Programme. The^gM aid would be provided mainly, although not exclusively, for local cost expenditures^gM and to meet the needs of those Commonwealth countries which have in the past^gAM looked to Britain for help in developing their systems of higher education.^gAM 4.  The British Government hope that other Commonwealth countries,^gM besides continuing with their own present arrangements for grants of capital aid,^g-M may feel able to make contributions to the new programme, in addition to Britain&apos;s^g-M contribution of  5 million. They hope that other Commonwealth Governments willWggM welcome this proposal. If so, it would be their aim to go forward with it as speedily^gM as possible.^gM (iv) HIGH-LEVEL TRAINING AND RESEARCH IN PUBLIC ^gMADMINISTRATION fummmgm mggm^gM The British Government are convinced that the techniques of administration^gAM and of development planning, particularly in developing countries, need continuing^gM study and research. They think that this is a fruitful field for Commonwealth^gAM co-operation. For their part they would be ready to devote funds to the^g-M encouragement of further specialised training and research in these problems.^gM 2.  In consultation with universities and professional bodies in Britain they^gAM have already given considerable thought to the means through which such training^gAM could best be promoted. Many countries both Commonwealth and foreign already^gM have colleges or institutions catering for trainees or administrators at varying^gM levels. But there seems to be room for a single institute providing teaching and^g-M research facilities on behalf of senior administrators with particular reference to ^^^jadministrative and development problems affecting the needs of new countries.^gM 3.  The British Government feel that this gap might perhaps be filled by the^gAM creation of a new Institution for Training in Public Administration. If other ^^^h^gAM Commonwealth Governments welcomed the idea they would be ready to discuss^gAM with representatives of universities in Britain the practicability of associating such^gM an institution wth one of the new universities here. They envisage that the^gAM institution, though adequately endowed from Government funds, should be freefrom Government control. Its governing body might include distinguished personsdrawn from other Commonwealth countries. While it would not cater exclusivelySECRET ^-W
^L-M SECRETfor Commonwealth personnel, the basic aim would be to attract to its courses- ^LWM^LWM whether short or long term-senior officials, university teachers and researchers ^LMMWXw\M                   engaged in administration and development planning. I^^H4.  Although the majority of those attending the institution&apos;s courses would ^LWM^LwM                   be from the developing (or newer) Commonwealth countries, the British ^LwMMw^mU                   Government would also wish to make use of it and it would of course be open to ^LMM^LWM                   other developed Commonwealth countries as well. The staff of the institution could ^LMM^LWM                   well include some drawn from other Commonwealth countries. WXWM(v) REGIONAL ORGANISATIONS FOR TECHNICAL ADVICEThe British Government suggests, as part of a policy of Commonwealth ^LWM^LwM                   co-operation for development, the establishment of regional organisations for ^LwMtechnical advice. Such organisations might, it is suggested, consist of a technical ^LMM%W^mu                    team made up of a number of professional advisers of high level, working under an m^mWAdministrative Director with the function of providing professional and technical ^LMMhelp to the countries of the region in question. ^LMM2. The advantages of an organisation of this kind based in a region are: ^LMM^LWM                         (a) The team gains a background of intimate knowledge of the problems of ^LMMthe region. It can establish close and helpful personal relations with ^LMMofficials of the local governments. ^LMM^LWM                         (b) Through the corporate knowledge it acquires it can provide coherent advice ^Lwmmore broadly related to the general economic and social requirements mWlmof the countries served than could experts operating solely as ^LMMindividuals. ^LMM(c) The existence of an organisation makes for continuity and the accumulation ^Lwmof knowledge even though individual team members may change from^LMM                                   time to time. ^LMM(d) Such an organisation can provide valuable support to specialist technical ^Lwmadvisers from elsewhere. ? W^mt3. For the sake of efficiency organisations of this kind should normally be WmwM^LMM administered by one country though the team might include experts from several ^LMM^LMM                    Commonwealth countries.  Subject  to the views  of other Commonwealth ^LMMGovernments, Britain would be ready to consider sponsoring one or more ^LMM^LMM                    organisations of this kind in other areas. ^LMM4. Commonwealth Governments will be aware that the Governments of ^LMM^LMM Tanganyika, Uganda and Kenya have sought the help of other Commonwealth ^LMMwkwM Governments in establishing a regional organisation of this kind on a ^LwMmWAm                    Commonwealth basis in East Africa. mWxm^LWM 5.  The British Government have had experience.of an organisation of this   I ^Lwm^LMM                    nature in the Middle East. This has proved the practical value of approaching these ^LMMproblems on a regional basis. ^LMM? SECRET
SECRETP.M.M. (64) 4 Copy No. 272MEETING OF COMMONWEALTH PRIME MINISTERSCOMMONWEALTH MEDICAL CONFERENCENote by the Secretary of the MeetingAttached is a copy of the British Prime Minister&apos;s message, containing aproposal for a Commonwealth Medical Conference, which was sent to other^L-U Commonwealth Heads of Government before the Meeting.(Signed)     BURKE TREND^L-W London, S.W. 1, ^L\\\AJuly,I should like, during our meetings next week, to propose that there should^LWM be held in the autumn of 1965 a Commonwealth Medical Conference. It would^LWm be at Ministerial level and its purpose would be to consider the possibility offurther co-operation between countries of the Commonwealth in the field of^LWm health, with the object of seeing that we are making the best use of all the^LWm resources available. The type of Conference I have in mind would run on broadlysimilar lines to the very successful Commonwealth Education Conferences. Theagenda would, of course, have to be worked out in detail; but I should envisagethat the main subjects of discussion would include the provision of medicaleducation; co-operation between Commonwealth countries, especially by way^L-M of secondments of teaching staff; the creation of &quot;links&quot; between teaching^L-U institutions and the provision of ancillary staff; the development and planning^L-W of health services and the supply of medical equipment and medical research.^L-W I believe that such a Conference could play a valuable part in bringing to^L-W the fore the main needs and in stimulating a more effective deployment of potential^LWW resources in this field, although I should not, in view of the pressures on the^L-M medical profession throughout the Commonwealth, expect that such a Conference^L-M could lead to an immediate and substantial increase in the supply of doctors forservice in the developing countries.^L-W If the proposal were acceptable to my colleagues I should propose that a^L-M detailed Agenda and a distribution of business over specialist Committees shouldbe worked out as soon as possible after the conclusion of our meetings.SECRETI 4569 ?
