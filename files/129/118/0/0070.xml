AnnexGENERAL ELECTION: REPLIES TO ENQUIRIESIt is desirable that all Departments should, so far as possible, follow a commonprocedure in dealing with enquiries or requests for information, particularly by parliamentary candidates, during the Election campaign.2. Departments should provide any Parliamentary candidate with factual information which is readily available and is not confidential. Such information should not, however, be provided if its extraction would require a substantial useof official time; a useful criterion is whether information would be extracted forthe purpose of a reply to a Parliamentary Question. Local and regional officesshould deal on this basis with any enquiries addressed to them; but they should refer doubtful cases to the headquarters of their Department for decision.3. For information not of a factual nature, or for guidance on policy,Conservative candidates and their agents are expected to look to the ConservativeResearch Department. In order to prevent much separate and unco-ordinatedcorrespondence between the Research Department and individual GovernmentDepartments, the Election Business Committee of the Cabinet has been appointedto supervise the work of advising Government candidates about the replies whichthey should return to questionnaires and other enquiries put to them during the campaign. The Conservative Research Department will accordingly collatequestionnaires or particular questions which they receive, and normally willprepare first drafts of replies. All drafts will be forwarded to the Secretary of theElection Business Committee in the Cabinet Office, who will in appropriate casesobtain the comments of the Ministers concerned upon them in order to check the information and arguments originally supplied by the Conservative research department. The Secretary of the Committee will, where this seems necessary inthe light of a Ministers comments or the comments of the Conservative research department, submit final drafts of replies for the Committee&apos;s approval. the research Department will thereafter be responsible for passing on the necessaryguidance to candidates.4. Requests for information not of a factual nature or policy enquiries fromConservative candidates which are addressed to Departments should normally bereferred, through Ministers&apos; Private Offices, to Mr. James L. Douglas at theConservative Research Department, 24 Old Queen Street, S.W.1 (Whitehall 1471),accompanied, in appropriate cases, by advice from the Ministers on how suchenquiries should be answered, and on the question whether they are of such a natureas to require consideration by the Election Business Committee. A copy of any such communication should be sent to the Secretary of the Election Business committee at the Cabinet Office.5. Requests for information not of a factual nature, or policy enquiries whichare addressed to Departments by individual members of the public, are usuallyanswered by or on behalf of the responsible Ministers. During the election campaign this procedure is still correct, but Ministers should arrange for copiesof the correspondence to be sent to both the Conservative Research department and the Secretary of the Election Business Committee.6. Enquiries addressed to Departments from any quarter may call for animportant statement of policy to be made by the Minister concerned. In that eventa Minister may decide himself to seek the guidance of the Election business committee; and in any case it would be advisable to inform the Secretary of theCommittee of the enquiry and of the terms of the reply.7. The function of initiating guidance to Conservative candidates in caseswhere no issue of policy is concerned normally belongs to the Conservative PartyQuestions of Policy Committee. Exceptionally, Ministers may wish to suggesttopics on which guidance should be given. In these instances, suggestions shouldbe sent to the Conservative Research Department who will prepare first draftsand forward them to the Secretary of the Election Business Committee.
