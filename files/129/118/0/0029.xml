LAMP STANDARDS IN THE WESTMINISTER area memorandum by the Minister of Public Building and works at the Cabinet meeting on 25th June (CM. (64) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 4)I was asked to give further consideration to the possibility of improving the lightingin the streets in the neighbourhood of St. James&apos;s Park without the introduction of modern lamp standards in place of the existing old type standards.2. All the lamp standards in King Charles Street and Downing Street, apartfrom the one outside No. 10 and the four on Clive Steps, are the responsibility ofthe Westminster City Council and have only recently been changed. The oneoutside No. 10 and those on Clive Steps are my responsibility. The lamp outsideNo. 10 has already been electrified and I have given instructions for those onClive Steps to be converted from gas to electricity, while retaining the existinglamp standards.3. There have been frequent complaints about the poor standard ofillumination in Birdcage Walk, the Approach Road to the Horse Guards and inConstitution Hill. The Ministry of Transport and the Westminster City council have pressed strongly for the illumination of these roads to be brought up toGroup A2 standard (the normal standard for a main road) and in 1962 myParliamentary Secretary announced in the House of Commons that steps werebeing taken to improve the lighting of these roads.4. To convert the existing gas lamp standards to electricity would still leavethe illumination of the roads a long way short of the requisite standard for thefollowing reasons:(a) there is a limit to the size of electric bulb that can be mounted on thesestandards, both because of the size of the lantern which would house the bulb, and the danger from glare;(b) the old standards are only 14 ft. high whereas the new ones are 25 ft. high.5. The erection of the new lamp standards in Birdcage Walk is at present inprogress and 27 of the 32 new standards have already been put up. To stop worknow would cost about  8,000, and it would be obvious that there had been a loss to public funds on a change of policy.6. Although work on the Approach Road has not yet started, the contracthas been let and to cancel it would probably cost about  1,000.7. The contract for Constitution Hill has not yet been placed and in this case no loss would be involved if it were decided not to go ahead with the work.8.  The questions to be decided are whether:(a) work on the erection of the new lamp standards in Birdcage Walk shouldcontinue;(b) work on the lighting in the Approach Road, for which the contract hasbeen let, should be started;(c) the contract for new lighting in Constitution Hill should be let.9. My view is that, in the interests of public safety, this scheme, which isalready well advanced, should be carried through to completion.G.
