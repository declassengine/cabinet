NUCLEAR PROPULSION FOR MERCHANT shipd memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate this memorandum as Chairman of the Economic Policy Committee.Our present position in nuclear propulsion for merchant ships2. Discussion in the European Nuclear Energy Agency (within theOrganisation for European Co-operation and Development) on the possibility ofa European joint project for a nuclear ship led the United Kingdom Atomic energy authority to consider collaborating with Belgonucleaire (supported by the BelgianGovernment) on a joint research programme to investigate a reactor system knownas the Vulcain. An agreement with Belgonucleaire was signed in 1962 and theVulcain was included in our research programme. A review in the same year of thevarious systems being considered led to the conclusion that we should concentrateresearch on the Vulcain and an Integral Boiling Reactor; both were designs inwhich all the major parts were inside the reactor pressure vessel, as completepackaged units. In 1963 a further review, based on technical advice from theAuthority, showed that both these systems offered a prospect of being developed as economically promising commercial propositions.3. We announced in February, 1963, that we would talk with the shipping and shipbuilding industries to see whether mutually satisfactory financial andother arrangements could be agreed for the ownership, construction and operationof a prototype nuclear merchant ship in the event of a decision to build one. we made it clear that we had not yet taken any decision, and that when we did thenature of it would depend partly on progress with the research and partly on theattitude of the shipping and shipbuilding industries; and on their side these industries reserved their position until certain technical and economic points wereclarified.The possible future courses4. A thorough review of all the rival systems and their economic prospectswas then made by the working group under Sir Thomas Padmore ofrepresentatives of Departments, the Authority, and outside interests (the british ship Research Association, Lloyd&apos;s, the Chamber of Shipping and ProfessorDiamond of Manchester University). They concluded that the choice laybetween-(A) constructing and testing a reactor now or very soon either in an experimental ship or as a land-based prototype;(B) deferring construction of a reactor until a design with more obviouseconomic potentialities seemed a reasonable possibility, in themeantime continuing with a research programme at more or less thepresent level;(C) reducing the research effort to what is needed to finish present commitments under the Vulcain programme (which runs to 1967) andtidying up other current research this year, so as to get the most outof past research; and keeping in touch with nuclear marine reactordevelopments elsewhere so that we could resume research anddevelopment if promising ideas emerged.4584DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

5. The group dismissed (B) because &quot;in the present state of marine reactca^technology we cannot add greatly to our knowledge of techniques and costsj?without actually designing and building a reactor &quot;.6. As regards (A), group concluded that the balance of advantage lay withtesting a reactor in a ship and recommended that the reactor should be of theVulcain type. In their view the Vulcain type offered the best hope of leading to acommercially saleable reactor for marine propulsion in due course. On this basis,the cost of (A) over the next five years is estimated as follows:  millionReactor and fuel charge............Hull and machinery      ............Shore facilities     ...............Research and DevelopmentAnglo-Belgian contract for VulcainShip application team       .........Research and Development in support ofprototype        ............Research and Development for improvedsecond core2\1-1-31-85-155-203-50(say)9-7 (say 10) 15-17 million for the following five years a further  5-7 million would probably need to be spenton research and development and about. ^ million for operating costs.7. If (C) were adopted  9-10 million of the  15-17 million under (A) for thefirst five years should be saved.Our rivals&apos; position8. Overseas, the United States have built the Savannah. They have noproposals at present to spend much more on nuclear propulsion for merchant ships.Russia has the icebreaker Lenin. Germany is committed to build a nuclear ship of conservative design by 1967, but the German Ministry of Science seems to have lost enthusiasm for this line of activity. Norway and Sweden have a joint programme on a boiling water reactor; and Italy and Holland have joint research in handwithin Euratom on another kind of reactor. Japan has decided to build a smallnuclear ship for oceanographic surveys, financed three-quarters by their government and one-quarter by industry.The Minister of Transports proposal9. The Minister of Transport has asked us to decide now, and to annouce our decision, to build a Vulcain-type reactor and to test it in a ship built for thepurpose. This is course (A). He also advises that (i) if experience with the ship fails to offer a real chance of success, the project should be dropped;(ii) if it succeeds, the shipowners should be brought in, sharing the cost;(iii) if we reject (A), we should drop the whole project and see how far theinformation which we have acquired from the Vulcain and other researchcan be passed to a private consortium.The views of the Economic Policy Committee10. Some Ministers favour the proposal by the Minister of Transport, mainly for the following reasons:(a) There is national prestige in building a nuclear merchant ship.(b) Our shipbuilding industry, which  is  losing  ground  to  its  foreign competitors, needs something to enhance Britain&apos;s prestige in their line of business.
(c) Although the best estimates that can be made show that there is no hopethat the prototype ship will be economic, it might turn out that thereis not so far to go beyond the prototype for an economic design tobe found; we shall not know how far there is to go until we have trieda prototype at sea; and because it would be important if we could scorea success, we should take the risk of building the ship.(d) It is thought unlikely that the economic performance of conventionalpropulsion machinery, such as the heavy diesel, can be drasticallyimproved, whereas the Vulcain design may be capable of very greatdevelopment.11.   Other Ministers are more impressed by the contrary arguments:(i) Our first need is economic efficiency; it is dangerous to keep subordinatingcommercial considerations to those of prestige, as we have done, forinstance, with the Concord.(ii) Neither our shipbuilders nor our shipowners are prepared to put any money into building a nuclear merchant ship at this stage.(iii) Government expenditure has been rising so fast that whereas we forecastlast year in our White Paper on future public expenditure a rise of4-1 per cent per year to 1967-68, the rate has already risen to 4-7 percent per year over that period; and this will entail successive increases in taxation rates. This is without taking any account of the recentincreases in the cost of the Concord, the cost of dealing with the problemof the VC-10, or the cost of the major developments in national insurance which we have been considering. Against this background,it is not enough that a project should be desirable. The case for it mustbe very strong indeed, whereas the case for the nuclear merchant ship is no more than problematical.(iv) On the most optimistic assumptions it is not expected that the additional capital cost of using a Vulcain reactor, from series production, insteadof conventional propulsion in a ship would be less than  \ million. Tocounterbalance this additional capital cost in operation, fuel costs wouldhave to be brought down at least to 0- 15d. per shaft horse-power hour;and it is not at present possible to foresee means of reducing it below0-20d. or 0-25d.(v) Nuclear power has its best opportunity of being competitive with otherfuels in large units which permit a different technology and economies of scale and when it is used intensively for long periods; for instance,in power stations. But a marine reactor has to be small, and only incertain classes of ship is it likely to get the full advantage of intensiveoperation.(vi) The Minister of State for Education and Science has advised us that from both the economic and technical points of view development of marinenuclear propulsion should not be regarded as having an equal claim on the resources which we devote to nuclear research and developmentwith the existing programme on reactors for power generation or witha project for a fast reactor prototype to which he would attach a high priority.(vii) Development of a merchant marine reactor would not obviate separatedevelopment of a naval reactor for surface ships, if we were to decide on the latter; it is not expected that work on either of them would beof much value to the other.12.  I invite my colleagues to decide between (a) the proposal to build the ship; or(b) the proposal that our effort should be confined to continued participation in the Vulcain programme.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,13th July, 1964.
