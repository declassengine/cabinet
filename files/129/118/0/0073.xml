THE THIRD COMMONWEALTH EDUCATION conference memorandum by the Minister of State for Education and science the Third Commonwealth Education Conference was held at Ottawafrom 21st August-4th September. It was attended by all the independent countries of the Commonwealth (except Cyprus). Representatives from 14 dependent territories formed part of the delegation from Britain. The observer from WesternSamoa accepted, in the course of the conference, an invitation to be a fullparticipant. The United Kingdom delegation was led by the Secretary for technical Co-operation for the first week of the conference. I took over the leadership for the remaining 10 days. Our delegation comprised official and non-official elements (e.g., representatives of universities, from the schools andlocal education authorities). Both Scotland and Northern Ireland were separatelyrepresented.2. The first in the series of Commonwealth Education Conferences tookplace at Oxford in 1959, and the second at Delhi in 1962. The main single objective of the Oxford Conference was to launch the Commonwealth Scholarship andFellowship Plan, under which university students in Commonwealth countries canpursue their studies, mainly at postgraduate level, elsewhere in the Commonwealth.This Plan is now well established, and attention at Delhi, and even more soat Ottawa, was focused on the means whereby the developed countries ofthe Commonwealth can best help the developing countries at all stages inthe educational process, e.g., by making school or university staff available, byassisting in the training of teachers and by advice in such matters as curriculumdevelopment and textbook production. Actual aid programmes are arranged ona bilateral basis between the countries giving and those receiving help. The generaldiscussions at the conferences are valuable in suggesting the major lines of further advance.3. Throughout the Ottawa Conference much stress was laid on theimportance of giving help in such a way that the developing countries would,as soon as possible, be able to look after themselves, in particular by generatingthe necessary increase in their output of trained teachers in support of theirvigorously expanding educational programmes. The offers of increased help from britain which I was able to make during the conference were almost all directed towards this objective and were very well received. A brief list of the main offersis as follow:(a) an increase from 450 a year to 550 a year, as soon as possible during thenext five-year period, of the places offered in British institutes ofeducation and training colleges to serving teachers in theCommonwealth who come here for specially arranged courses offurther training. This scheme, known as the Commonwealth BursariesScheme, has been a success and the decision to expand it waswelcomed. I said that the increased facilities were particularlyintended for technical teachers, science and mathematics teachers andteacher trainers;(b) a doubling of the Aid for Commonwealth English Scheme, under which britain will make available a further 30 experts for English in teachingcentres over the next five years, in addition to the 30 who have alreadybeen provided;(c) the provision of finance for increasing numbers of graduates from Britishinstitutions to do a year&apos;s postgraduate study, after which they wouldguarantee to undertake at least a year&apos;s service in many cases thiswill be teaching service in the area. I said that we hoped to build4930Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1964CP. (64) 173 Copy No.   [j g13 th October, 1964CABINET
up the numbers of these graduates to 1,000 over the next five years^gg^.This offer, which had the appeal of novelty although it is in facSP&apos;based  on  experience in East  Africa, was  particularly warmly welcomed;id) the provision of  5 million a year for capital assistance towards theestablishment of institutions of higher education, including teacher training institutions, in the Commonwealth. In this case I was merelyrepeating the offer which we had made at the Prime Ministers&apos;Conference, but the announcement of the decision in the specificcontext of educational co-operation had a considerable impact;(e) willingness to consider, in consultation with interested commonwealth countries and institutions, how finance can be provided on a moresystematic basis than at present to enable the expatriate teachers whoare still required in large numbers in Commonwealth universities(particularly in Africa) to remain in post;(/) readiness to collaborate with developing countries in one or more pilotprojects designed to prepare the way for a more massive attack on theproblem of adult illiteracy;ig) readiness to increase general assistance in order to meet needs as they arise. The organisation of vacation courses for in-service training of teachers is likely to be important in this context. We also offered to study the possibility of giving help towards the development of localcurricula and the production of local textbooks by the provision of advice on a team basis.4. One reason why this &quot; package &quot; was so well received was that althoughthe other developed countries were obviously willing to continue with existingforms of co-operation and even to add a few frills like links between schools, onlyBritain had any substantial offer of increased aid to put forward.5. Like its two predecessors, the conference showed that the educationallinks are among the strongest in the Commonwealth, based as they are on acommon background in language and tradition. There was an excellent spirit ofco-operation among all member countries and few discordant notes. One of thesethreatened to be the rivalry between Ghana and Nigeria for the role of host to thenext conference in 1967-68, but this ended in a gracious withdrawal of theGhanaian claim. Another threat was that the role of Southern Rhodesia to be present as an &quot; independent&quot; country at the conference would be challenged, butthis did not materialise.6. The main threat to educational progress in the developing countries of theCommonwealth lies, of course, in the &quot; population explosions&quot; taking place inmany of these countries. Realisation of this threat underlay much of the discussion on the training and supply of teachers, but it is fair to say that the realisation wasnot complete and was seldom explicit. So far as speeches at the plenary sessionswere concerned, only the Minister of Education of Mauritius, in a speech on thefinal day, made a clear reference to the problems that arise in his country on this score. It may be expected that this very real problem may loom larger by the dateof the next conference.7. One interesting feature of the conference was that the less developed countries led by India favoured more institutionalisation of schemes of co-operation and a larger and more active Commonwealth Education Liaison Unit, while the developed countries insisted on the fundamental importance of bilateralarrangements and tended to resist any aggrandisement of the Unit.8. I do not think anyone who attended this conference could be in any doubt about the vitality of the Commonwealth as an association of free and independentnations. Mr. Chagla, the Indian Education Minister, gave an impressive address onthe Commonwealth at a meeting arranged during the conference in Ottawa by thelocal branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society. He stressed particularly id) thecommon language the fact that we needed no interpreters at the conference,(b) the great value of Prime Ministers&apos; Meetings and (c) the departure of SouthAfrica, which in his view had given the Commonwealth a new sense of purpose.Finally, and by no means least, I was very conscious of the exceptionally highpersonal regard in which the Prime Minister is held in all parts of theCommonwealth, old and new.E.
