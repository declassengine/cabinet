Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1964CP. (64) 114 Copy No.     554th June, 1964CABINETREBUILDING THE FOREIGN OFFICE BLOCK AND CONSEQUENTIALACCOMMODATION CHANGESMemorandum by the Minister of Public Building and WorksOn 31st October, 1963, I was invited by the Cabinet (CM. (63) 3rdConclusion 5 (5)), to circulate in due course a memorandum on the timing of thevarious measures contemplated for the rehousing of the Departments in the presentForeign Office building and the implications of these measures for the accommodation likely to be required by the Service Departments as a result ofthe changes in the central organisation for Defence.2. The following Departments occupy space in the present Foreign office building :Foreign Office.........      about 125,000 sq. ft. netCommonwealth Relations Office(including    India    OfficeLibrary).........      about   75,000 sq. ft. netHome Office    .........      about   65,000 sq. ft. net3. The Home Office staff (along with other Home Office staff who need tobe in the area) are to be rehoused in new offices on the other side of Whitehall.It now seems out of the question that we should be ready to start building this new Home Office accommodation before the middle of 1967. This means thatthe new Home Office will not be ready until 1969 at the earliest. I propose,therefore, to plan on the basis that they are rehoused by the end of 1970.4. I would hope to have the Foreign Office fully planned and ready to start by the time the new Home Office building was occupied. This means thatI will have to rehouse the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations office staff from the present Foreign Office building by the end of 1970 also. I proposethat they should be temporarily housed in the Admiralty building while theForeign Office site is being redeveloped.5. The question where the Ministry of Defence staff at present in theAdmiralty building should go can best be settled after the recently agreed study of the scope for dispersing staff of the Ministries of Defence and Aviation from central London has been completed.conclusion. I accordingly s,eek the agreement of the Cabinet to the proposal thatthe Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office staff should be housedtemporarily in the Admiralty building while the Foreign Office site is beingredeveloped.G. R.Ministry of Public Building and Works, S.E. 1,3rd June, 1964.4433
