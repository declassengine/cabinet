REPORT BY THE WORKING- PARTY ON THE LIABILITY OFOPERATORS OF NUCLEAR ships the Secretary of State for Education and Science was invited by the Cabinet on 4th June to arrange for further considerationto be given, as a matter of urgency, to the possible implications of legislation establishing the principle of solo and absolute liability of the operator of nuclear powered ships, particularly with regard to considerations raised by the Minister of transport in his paper submitted to the Cabinet on 2nd Juno (CP(64)111).2.    The Secretary of State for Education and Science accordinglygave instructions for this examination to be made by the working party under the Chairmanship of the Department of Education and science which has studied these problems for some years.     TheWorking Party has held five meetings, attended by representativesof the Foreign Office, ELM. Treasury, the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office,Treasury Solicitor&apos;s Department, Ministry of Transport, Ministryof Defence, Ministry of Power and the Atomic Energy Authority.General Considerations3.    To some extent the Working Party&apos;s task was a repetition ofan exercise they carried out a year ago for the Lord Chancellorwhen he was invited by Ministers to consider, in the context of a proposed visit of the U.S. nuclear ship Savannah, the subject oflegislation to cover all aspects of the liability of operators of nuclear ships.     On that occasion the Working Party concluded thatBritish interests would be better safeguarded if legislation were introduced and that with this in view the sooner the legislation could be passed the better.     The basis of such legislation was available in the International Convention on the Liability ofOperators of Nuclear Ships, which was adopted by the DiplomaticConference on Maritime Law in Brussels in May 1962.     (A summaryof the provisions of this Convention as given in the report of the1
Working Party a year ago is attached at Annex A).     The Ministryof Transport while subscribing to this as an ideal, expressed doubts whether early legislation was justified.4.    The main arguments for U.K. legislation on the lines of the brussels Convention can be enumerated as follows;(a) It is an important interest of the U.K. to provide protection for conventional shipping against the specialhazards which are introduced through nuclear-powered ships,and in particular to ensure that in any collision between aconventional ship and a nuclear ship, sole and absolute liability for any nuclear damage caused (including damage to third parties) should rest with the operator of the nuclear ship, whoever is at fault.     For this reason, theU.K. took an active part in the discussions leading up tothe Convention.     We were successful in maintaining all our major points of principle, and these are embodied in theConvention.(b) We knew before we went to the Brussels Conference that theU.S.A. and U.S.S.R. were unlikely to agree to the inclusion of warships or (at any rate for some time) to accept aConvention which included them.     Nevertheless, theinstructions to our delegation were to press for theinclusion of warships, since the U.K. felt that the effective-ness of the Convention depended very largely on this.     Therewere at that time something like 50 nuclear warships and only two other nuclear ships.     There are more nuclearwarships now5   and when those now under constructions are completed there will be over 100 nuclear warships altogether,in the service of the U.S., U.S.S.R. and U.K.     The only other nuclear ships are the U.S. Savannah and the U.S.S.R.icebreaker, Lenin.2
We are in a key position as regards bringing the 1962Convention into operation, since the ratification of one&quot;Licensing State&quot; and one other State is required to do this.Since we have a nuclear warship in commission we could be the&quot;Licensing State&quot;, and in view of the present attitude ofthe U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. we are effectively the only Statelikely to bring the Convention into operation in the nextyear or two.There is virtually world-wide acceptance of the principle that individual victims of nuclear damage, vtfiether caused by ships or land-based installations, need the protection provided bysole and absolute liability.     The U.K. has taken certainactions, on the assumption that this principle will becomeuniversal.     Thus, (as was stated in the Report last July)until there is legislation the Royal Navy intend to accept,ex gratia, absolute liability for nuclear damage in the TJ.K.arising from U.K. nuclear submarines, although no public announcement to this effect his been made.     Moreover,reference is made in the Holy Loch memorandum to the factthat &quot;the two Governments recognise that, at international conferences where this subject has been discussed, provisions for sole, absolute and limited liability channelledexclusively to the operator of a nuclear reactor have been generally supported by a groat majority of delegations,including those of the United Kingdom and United States&quot;.Legislation would give the Navy Parliamentary cover for the liabilities they intend to accept for their nuclearsubmarines, would apply the principles of Brussels to somecases (sec para.6) in the NATO Status of Forces agreement and would strengthen our hand in any negotiations for anextension of that agreement to other cases.3
(e)   U.S. legislation makes funds available to cover the publicliability of the Savannah, but this liability is determinedby the &quot;local&quot; law.     It was because of the inadequacy of u.K. law that we had to accept an agreement for the recent visit of the Savannah which failed to ensure that U.S. funds would meet all nuclear damage that might have been caused.The Savannah may come again, but even if she does not we arevulnerable for having neither covered our position by legislation nor expressed our intention of putting matterson a proper footing in the foreseeable future.Warships5.   The situation as regards nuclear warships, particularly inrelation to visiting U.S. warships, needs to be explained further.If United Kingdom legislation applied the principles of sole andabsolute liability generally, i.e. to the nuclear ships of allcountries and to warships as well as merchant ships, then such legislation would be applicable to United States nuclear warships.However, the United States Government could then plead sovereignimmunity in our courts in respect of its warships, so that such legislation could not be enforced against&apos; the United StatesGovernment by legal proceedings (unless the proceedings could bebrought against a member of a U.S. Visiting Force, in which casethe NATO Status of Forces Agreement provides that immunity fromjurisdiction shall not be claimed).6.    At present, under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, theUnited Kingdom Government can recover from the United StatesGovernment up to 75$ of amounts paid in respect of claims arisingout of the operation of nuclear warships on the basis of the lawapplicable to our own nuclear warships.     These arrangementsapply to death or personal injury claims (not to property claims)where both the incident and the damage occur in United Kingdomterritory or territorial waters.4
O7.    Claims not covered by the NATO Status of Forces agreement would, as at present, be pursued through diplomatic channels.In order to meet such claims the U.S. Administration might have to seek an appropriation from Congress.     Without suitable U.K.legislation, and with the Brussels Convention not in force,  theAdministration could only argue the case for accepting sole andabsolute liability in terms of political expediency.     On theother hand, if we had legislated and the Brussels Convention werein force, although the Americans might plead sovereign immunity from action in the courts, they would find it very difficultpolitically to evade the consequences of our own and internationallaw in practice.8.   legally, the Administrations hand would also be strengthened by U.K. legislation.     At present Congress would be within their rights in disputing the legal validity of any U.K. claim madeexclusively on the basis of sole and absolute liability.     this applies equally to those cases which fall within the terms of the nato Status of Forces Agreement and those which do not.9.   Thus, the intended effect of such legislation on United Statesnuclear war ships would be;(i)    if the United States Government operating nuclear warships in United Kingdom territory incurred sole and absolute liability in accordance with the legislation, suchliability could not be enforced by legal proceedings,unless the limited waiver of immunity in the Status of forces Agreement were to apply5(ii)    as regards death or personal injury claims, suchliability would be the basis on which claims torreimbursement would be made by Her Majesty&apos;s government under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement 5(iii)    the prospects of the U.S. meeting all claims would be improved (but see para.17 for Ministry of Transport views)5
9(cont.).    It must, however, be recognised that the terms ofthe Brussels Convention do not readily fit in with the specificobligations assumed under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement 5it may prove difficult to formulate our legislation in sucha way that it will impose liability under the Agreement, andif this could not be done the effect on our present arrangements on Holy Loch and other U.S. visiting nuclear warships couldbe harmful.5A
10.    Our arrangements with the United States on visiting nuclearwarships, (in effect this means warships other than the Holy Lochsubmarines), are expressly left open to alteration in the eventof the U.E. enacting nuclear ship legislation.     In discussingany proposed alteration, we should be able to rely not only on thefact (mentioned in the Holy Loch, memorandum) that the U.S.Government at international conferences has consistently supported the application of sole, absolute and limited liability to theoperation of nuclear reactors, but also on the facts -(i)    that such liability applied under our law to U.K.warships %(ii)    that in principle it also applied under our law to U.S.warships, and(iii)    that the U.K. law on this subject accorded with an inter-national Convention which was likely to be widely accepted.11.    A further advantage of U.K. legislation would be that it would remove the possibility of a U.S. nuclear warship which had been in collision with a U.K. conventional ship suing the conventional ship in the U.E. for nuclear damage on the grounds of negligence.    the conventional ship would also bo protected against suits by other parties, e.g. a third ship which suffered radiation damage.Conflict with other International Conventions12.    In CP(64)111  the Minister of Transport made the point thatthe proposed legislation would be in direct conflict with inter-national conventions to which amongst others, we and the americans are parties.     The Working Party has examined this contention.13.    There are four maritime conventions to which the UnitedKingdom is a party and which appear to be in conflict with the nuclear Ships Convention. (See Annex B).     The Nuclear ShipsConvention itself provides that these conventions are superseded,to the extent that they are in conflict, so far as contracting par tie6
to the Nuclear Ships Convention are concerned.     That Conventioncannot of course regulate the position of non-contracting states.Of the four conventions,the United States is a party to only one -the Bills of Lading Convention of 1924 which would apply to theN.S. Savannah.    (It is not certain, however, that there is anyconflict because the Bills of Lading Convention concerns thecontractual terms of carriage of goods and there is someimplication that liability under the 1962 Convention can be excluded by contract.)     The U.S.S.E.  is a party to the CollisionsConvention of 1910, but this Convention does not apply to warshipsor Government ships on public service.     Accordingly, there is verylittle practical danger at present, of a conflict with existingconventions.14.    So far as the future is concerned, it is clear that thenumber of states operating nuclear ships will increase.     Of thestates which may do so, Germany and Japan are party to the Bills ofLading Convention and the Collisions Convention and Prance is a party to all four conventions.     These countries have taken an active part in work on the Nuclear Ships Convention and there isno reason to believe that they would not ratify it in due course.If they did so, no problem would arise.15.    Although the practical danger of conflicts is very slight,the theoretical possibility clearly exists.     If we v/ished toremove even this theoretical possibility, this could be done by seeking to amend the conventions so as to exclude nuclear damage caused by nuclear ships expressly from their application.     Thiswould require the agreement of all the parties to the existingConventions and is a process which might take a matter of years.Another possibility which would avoid delay is to make use of thefact that none of the Conventions can have been concluded in contemplation of the special problems of nuclear damage.     On this7
m .&quot;basis, it could bo said that the conventions did not apply tonuclear damage so that we would not be in breach of them if weapplied different rules to such cases.     If H.M.G. took this view,they could communicate it to the other parties to the conventions and it could be expected that the other parties would acquiesce in such a statement.     Such acquiescence would make the UnitedKingdom1 s legal position secure.Reciprocity16.    If the U.K. ratified the Brussels Convention, liability of u.K. operators under the Convention would not extend to non-Convention states.     The U.K. legislation could, however, providefor assuming liability tov^ards non-Convention states only on a basisof reciprocity.    (This could apply to U.S. nuclear ships).Views of the Ministry of Transport17.    The Ministry of Transport1s views are as follows s-(a) The crux of the matter is whether by passing domesticlegislation applying the principles of the BrusselsConvention H.M.G. could substantially improve the presentsituation about American nuclear warships?(b) It is agreed that legislation could not be enforced againstthe Americans except perhaps in the limited sphere referredto in para.9(i).    The question is whether, after legislation,our negotiating position would be improved 5(c) If legislation wore introduced, the Minister introducing theBill would need to explain its effect on American warships.The explanation would need to be discussed with the U.S.Government beforehand.      If the U.S. Government wereprepared to agree that, after legislation had been passed,they would act as if their nuclear warships were absolutelyliable for nuclear damage incurred by U.K.. nationals in U.K.or other territorial waters or on the high seas - this damage8
being damage to property as well as persons - then, in theopinion of the Ministryof Transport, there would be advantage in passing domestic legislation;If, on the otherhand, the U.S. Government consented only toa statement similar in substance to the present relevantpart of the Holy loch memorandum, then tho Britishnegotiating position would not bo improved.     It might indeed be weakened if, through the matter being ventilated in public, the U.S. administration were forced to define their position more closely than at present and perhaps even toemphasise publicly the reasons (sovereign immunity, theirnot having adopted the Brussels Convention, tho limitations of the Status of Forces Agreement, etc.) why they would notact as if they were liable;There would bo additional disadvantages, in those circumstances,in that it would be made clear to Parliament that -(i)    the Holy Loch situation had not been in the past, andwould not bo in the future, covered by a watertightagreement5(ii)   H.M.G. was imposing on its own nuclear warshipsobligations which the Americans were not accepting fortheirs.In addition, H.M.G, would lose some freedom of action infuture negotiations with countries other than U.S.A.     Itwould be much better to wait and see what policy would suitthe U.K. best on the liability of nuclear merchant ships -a matter which, is likely to become in time of great economic importance.     If there Is legislation, Ministry of transport would not advise H.M.G. to ratify the Convention;     theyconsider that this would tie our hands not only on the questionof liability itself but on other important unsettled
CONF5DSNT5AL280questions, such as the proposed international tribunal to handle actions for compensation?   moreover, they see no advantage in early ratification of a Convention which is not going to hind the only other operators of nuclear ships.Ministry of Defence view18.    The Ministry of Defence think that it is essential that good relations with the america should he maintained.     They considerthat while legislation is in principle desirable, we should (onthe warships side) carry the Americans with us and should not attempt finally to decide on the treatment of foreign warships inthe Bill until there has been consultation with the United States.If there were any doubt whether the liability created by theproposed legislation foil within the Status of Forces Agreement,it would also be necessary to find out whether the americans would continue to accept the application of the NATO claimsprocedure.Conclusions19.    The Working Party agrees -(a) legislation would not hind the Americans as regards nuclearincidents arising out of the operation of U.S. nuclearwarships, save to a limited extent (for 75?  of the amount of death or personal injury - not property - claims inside U.K.territorial waters) through the operation of S.O.P.A. (paras.5 and 6).(b) Conflict with existing conventions is not a very seriouspractical issue at present.     In the long run, we should&apos;seek to secure amendment of the earlier conventions, whichwere never intended to apply to nuclear damage.     If problemsarise before this has been achieved, ad hoe arrangements will still be open to us (para.15).10
20,    The Working Party is unable to reach agreement on whetherthe balance of advantage lies in early legislation.     most members consider that -(a) there are a number of arguments in favour of early legislation on the linos of the 1962 Brussels Convention(paras. 4 and 11);(b) legislation would improve the chances of obtaining fromthe U.S.A. full satisfaction of claims in respect of nuclear incidents involving U.S. nuclear warships (paras,9 and 10).The Ministry of Defence consider that there could be no certainty of this without prior consultation with the U.S.Government.     The Ministry of Transport do not believe, in theabsence of consultations with the U.S.A., that domesticlegislation would in fact further the objective (whichall agree desirable) of giving greater protection toBritish interests if there is a nuclear incident arisingfrom a U.S. warship   (para.17).Department of Education and Science,4, Richmond Terrace,Whitehall, S.W.1.17th July, 1964.
confidentialSUMMARY OF TH)i PROVISIONS OF THE BRUSSELS CONVENTION,  1962(a) The operator of a nuclear ship (including a nuclear warship) shall be solely and absolutely liable for nucleardamage arising anywhere in the world out of the operations of the ship.     He may, however, be relieved wholly orpartially of his liability towards an individual whose owndeliberate act or omission causes or contributes towardsnuclear damage.(b) The operator&apos;o liability is limited to $100m. and it is envisaged that the State which authorises the operation ofthe nuclear ship (the Licensing State) will provide fundsbeyond the point where insurance cover ceases to beavailable, in practice, say, $15m.(c) Actions for compensation for nuclear damage have to bebrought within 10 years from the date of the nuclearincident although the Licensing State may in certaincircumstances prescribe a longer period.(d) Jurisdiction lies at the option of the claimant citherwith the courts of the Licensing State or with the courts ofthe State or States in which nuclear damage is suffered,but proceedings against a warship may be brought only inthe State to which it belongs.(e) Judgments shall be enforceable in the courts of States otherthan where jurisdiction lies and there are provisions forapportionment of the liability fund in the event of damageexceeding $100m.(f) The Convention will come into force when ratified by oneLicensing State and one other State.
CONFLICT WITH EXISTING CONVENTIONSTho existing maritime conventions containing provisions whichmight conflict with those of the Nuclear Ships Convention, and thepossible areas of conflict, are :,-(i)    The Collisions Convention of 1910.    This provides(a) for blame to be apportioned between ships in collision whereas under the Nuclear Ships convention the liability is solely- with the nuclear ship,(b) a time limit of two years within which proceedingsmust bo brought, as against ten years under the NuclearShips Convention.(ii)    Tho Bills of Lading Convention of 1924.    This relievesa ship owner from liability for loss of or damage tocargo in many circumstances.     Under the NuclearShips Convention his liability for nuclear damage to be cargo would be absolute.(iii)   The Convention concerning Jurisdiction in Mattersof Collisions, 1952.     This provides for a numberof courts to have jurisdiction in collision cases.The Nuclear Ships Convention offers a limited range.(iv)    The Limitation of Liability Convention,  1957Under this Convention a ship owner may limit hisliability to 3?1O0 gold francs ( 74) per ton of hisship&apos;s tonnage.     Liability assessed on this basis would be only a small fraction of $100,000,000.
