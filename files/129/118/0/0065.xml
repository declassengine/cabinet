this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1964CP. (64) 165 Copy No..&apos;$93rd September, 1964CABINETCOMMONWEALTH IMMIGRATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department in the 12 months ended 31st June, 1964, net immigration from theCommonwealth totalled 83,000, of whom 68,000 were coloured.2. In my view the country cannot continue to absorb coloured immigrantsat anything like this rate. But if we are substantially to reduce the rate it will benecessary (a) to free ourselves from some of the pledges given during the passageof the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill about the issue of employment vouchersand (b) to legislate to take more effective powers against evasion of the control.Careful interdepartmental study has been made of the possible steps that couldbe taken.3.  I should be against checking in any way the inflow of genuine visitors:genuine students: and wives and young children accompanying immigrants orcoming to join them.4. The Ministerial Committee on Commonwealth Immigrants determinesthe rate at which employment vouchers are issued. We started with a rate of40,000 a year (vouchers lapse after six months, and by no means all are in factused). We reduced it progressively to 21,000 a year. I think we should aim to cutit down to some 13,000 a year.5. This will involve confining the issue of vouchers to those who (a) possesssome special skill of which we are for the time being in particular need, or (b) arerequired in some undermanned services particularly in the public sector suchas transport and have a job to go to.6. Evasion should be reduced by instructing Immigration Officers to imposeconditions on the length of stay of those claiming to be visitors or students aboutwhose bona fides they have doubt. To impose conditions is already lawful, butit is seldom done, because they are difficult to enforce. We cannot deport thosewho disregard them unless a court makes a recommendation; and this courts arereluctant to do. The law needs to be amended, in my view, so as to give the HomeSecretary the same power to deport those who disregard their landing conditionsas he already has in respect of aliens, whom it is common to deport in such circumstances.7. I do not think that we can impose vexatious requirements (such as beingphotographed and finger-printed) on those admitted subject to conditions, althoughthe police doubt whether enforcement can be effective without them. I hope that departments such as the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Pensions and national Insurance will give the police all the assistance they can in tracing thosewho have out-stayed their permitted time. We must, however, accept the fact thatenforcement of landing conditions will never be 100 per cent effective.8. All that is necessary at the present stage is for the Cabinet to approve astatement of policy which can be made in a speech or otherwise before theElection: and I suggest that this statement should be in the broadest terms, soas to give us a wide discretion in the next Parliament. I attach a draft.H. B.Home Office, S.W.1,2nd September, 1964.4756
DRAFT STATEMENTReluctant as we all were to impose any restrictions on immigration from theCommonwealth, the Government decided three years ago that Britain could nolonger continue to absorb immigrants at the high rate at which they were arriving.Attempts to have the numbers kept down by voluntary action on the part ofother Commonwealth countries having failed to stem the flow, the government took the only step open to it and introduced legislation to make it possible tocontrol the rate of immigration. This was bitterly opposed by both the Labourand Liberal Parties in Parliament. How right the Government was is shown bythe fact that there are now over 300,000 more immigrants who, to judge fromthe waiting list for entry vouchers, would have come here by now. accompaniedin many cases by their wives and children, if the control had not been imposed.One does not care to contemplate the social and housing problems that wouldhave been created by these vast numbers.The Government has always maintained [and will continue to maintain] freeadmission of Commonwealth citizens who genuinely come as visitors or students,and also of the wives and young children who accompany immigrants or cometo join those who have already settled here.But the legislation must be tightened up, to strengthen the safeguards againstevasion; and the conditions and rate of issue of work vouchers must be furtherreviewed. We welcome those whose work and skills, when they arrive here, willenable them to meet a real need. But this is a small and already densely populatedcountry, and social tensions will heighten if immigrants are allowed to come infaster than they can be absorbed into our life and our cities.
