(64) 162 Copy No.    6 420th August, 1964CABINETBRITAIN&apos;S FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE european economic community memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs for some time now officials have been studying the problem of Britain&apos;future relations with the European Economic Community (E.E.C.).2. I attach as an annex despatch No. 6 from Sir C. 0&apos;Neill, which is designed as a contribution to this work from the special viewpoint of the delegation to the Communities in Brussels. The Prime Minister has read thedespatch, and suggested that it should be circulated to the Cabinet.3. The despatch, though long, is worth reading in full. I would only drawmy colleagues&apos; attention to the chief conclusions which Sir C. 0&apos;Neill has reachedafter 18 months&apos; work in Brussels. He believes that the European Communitiesare here to stay. It is implicit in his despatch that he believes also that they will grow in political as well as economic power and importance. He foresees that without a satisfactory link between this country and the European Communities,within an Atlantic framework, we will suffer a relative, perhaps rather rapid,decline towards isolation and reduced influence. The alternative would be a chance of greater power and influence for the Continent as a whole through unity.In the search for a satisfactory relationship, Sir C. 0&apos;Neill believes that theconclusion reached in 1961 was correct, and that nothing short of full membership would be satisfactory or attainable. Finally, in paragraphs 23 to the end,Sir C. 0&apos;Neill sketches out some ideas on policy for the period following theElections, both of which are designed to keep the door open to eventualmembership should the opportunity arise.4. It will be noticed that in paragraphs 26 to 28, Sir C. 0&apos;Neill examinesthe question of United Kingdom participation in the talks on European PoliticalUnion and refers to the possibility of our renouncing publicly our wish to take part in these discussions. I have some reservations on the line which herecommends, since it could well be misinterpreted and reduce our influence onthe course of events in Europe.5. I am not, however, at this point, asking my colleagues to approve aline of policy on this or any other of the matters dealt with in the despatch, sincethe study of these questions is still in train.R.

BRITAIN&apos;S FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.E.C.Sir C. 0&apos;Neill to Mr. R. A. Butler.   (Received July 25)SUMMARYI. This despatch contributes simplified and subjective views to the assessment of the European problem now being made in whitehall with a view to helping the next Government to determineits policy. (Paragraph 1.)2. Conclusions are difficult partly because so many viewscan be taken as to the nature of the European Community.(Paragraphs 2-3.)3. Three background factors. First, the &quot;Europeans&quot; have always been interested in power as well as in prosperity. Second,current United. States attitudes to the Community may change.Third, the Member States of the Community are much less interestedin our problem than we are. (Paragraphs 4-9.)4. We must assume the Community will continue to exist andto develop successfully. (Paragraph 10.)5. Paradoxically, whether one likes the Community or dislikesit, the conclusion for policy is the same. (Paragraphs 11-12.)6. The alternatives. Political factors are crucial. It is hard to seean effective future role for Britain without a satisfactory relationship to the Community. The Commonwealth offers no real alternative.Failing a solution, we may be headed for isolation and even neutrality.(Paragraphs 13-16.)7. Till 1961 we sought a solution falling short of membership.This is neither satisfactory nor available to-day. Membership is stillthe right policy, but it is not available either because of French policy.We must assume there will be no further chance for us to enter the Community for the next three or four years. (Paragraphs 17-19.)8. This corresponds with a stage in the Community&apos;sdevelopment. It might be easier to enter it nearer the end of itstransitional period. In three years much will have happened whichmay give us a clearer view of possibilities. (Paragraphs 20-22.)9. What the next Government says will be even more important than what it does. Present policy is the best; but if this cannot bemaintained there may be an alternative which would preserve most ofits advantages while falling short of commitment. A possible coursedescribed. (Paragraphs 23-25.)10. We may in any case have to change our line on PoliticalUnion. Subject to one important proviso, this might not matter too much. (Paragraphs 26-28.)II. A reference to the Multilateral Force. (Paragraphs 29-30.)M 1083/19KForeign Office and Whitehall DistributionECONOMIC AFFAIRS (GENERAL)July 25, 1964Section 119948-322   309-15
history gone to war. For those who tak^this view, the Community has almd^succeeded, by stealth, in achieving whatNapoleon and Hitler failed to achieve by force: a Europe united without Britain,and therefore against her. Napoleon&apos;sContinental System, Hitler&apos;s New EuropeanOrder-both had, or might had they lastedhave had, some of the characteristics which,at the worst, the Europe of the Six may yetdevelop. Yet even those who take thisextreme view might conclude that our best way of averting such dangers is to get onboard if we can and try to change thevessels course. The great difficulty of reaching and holding firm opinions residespartly, I think, in the fact that there is sometruth in both these extreme views and in allpossible views in between.4. At the risk of appearing an extremistmyself I must record a couple of views Ihave come to hold. The first concerns amatter, more or less, of fact; the second isspeculative.5. First, I feel that we in Britain still, ingeneral, underestimate the extent to whichthe European Communities are and always have been concerned with politics and power. Their economic titles and functionsstill blind us to a fact the &quot; Europeans &quot;themselves have never sought to conceal:that they aim, through union, to revive theinfluence and power, not merely the prosperity, of their countries and peoples.This is stated clearly enough, for instance(though I admit the word &quot; power &quot; is not used, only &quot; influence and prestige &quot;), in the preamble to the Messina Resolution ofJune 1955, which began the process which led to the establishment of the common market; and I have no doubt the conceptcould easily be traced back earlier thanthat. Mao Tse-tung declared that powergrows out of the barrel of a gun.Professor Hallstein operates in a moresophisticated environment; but he hasalways declared he is in politics notbusiness, and he may well believe that power grows out of regulations on the reference price of Tilsit cheese or the priceof the grain a hen needs to lay one egg.I think it does.6. If so how strange (in parenthesis) thatwe should have grown as &quot; European &quot;aswe have, and how far from strange that the&quot; Europeans &quot; should be sceptical of our having done so. Almost all our troubles inthe last 300 years (except for the last 20)UKDEL to theEuropean Communities,(No. 6.   Confidential)      Brussels,Sir, July 23, 1964.Departments in Whitehall are now engaged, I understand, on a fundamentalreview and reappraisal of the innumerablefactors affecting two large, complex and tosome extent separate questions: whatrelationship the United Kingdom might wish, and might be able, to establish infuture with the European economic community. The purpose of this work is to assemble and assess the facts and arguments which Her Majesty&apos;s next administration will need in order to help it to determineits policy. I feel it is my duty, from thispost, to try to contribute to this enterprise.Perhaps the best way in which I can do sois by setting down some simplified andsubjective views, based on my experienceof, by now, more than a year as ambassador to the European Communities.2. I do not find it easy to arrive at conclusions. I envy those who are able toform and stick to clear and decisive views,one way or the other, about this intenselycomplicated issue. A year here has left me,if anything, less certain than when I arrivedas to what we either should or can do. this may be partly because better acquaintancewith the Common Market its fundamentalpurposes, its inner compulsions, its methods,its limitations, some of its leadingpersonalities, its probable course of develop-ment has lessened such enchantment asignorance and distance gave it, in my eyes,before I came here. I must begin byadmitting this bias.3. There are many ways, for outsiders,of looking at the European Community.At one extreme it can be regarded as themost hopeful experiment in international relations embarked on for generations,dedicated with growing success toreconciliation, peace, prosperity and welfarenot only for the peoples within it but forall the world. For those who see it so it isan enterprise we should be proud to join ifwe can both for ideal and interested reasons,paying almost any price entry might involve.At the other extreme it can be regarded this view is one which presents itself moreperhaps to the British than others as constituting potentially, and already tosome extent in fact, the kind of Europeanstructure to prevent the establishment ofwhich we have repeatedly throughout our
IJIIve come from France and Germany.what could have suited our aims, consciousor subconscious, better than the situation of 1945 when both were powerless, and anew, strong, friendly, English-speakingPower, on whom we were prepared to relyand with whom we had and believedwe could maintain a specially intimaterelationship, was ready to assume their protection and ours? No wonder the&quot; Europeans &quot;, who for it is not only theGaullists refuse to rely on the UnitedStates for protection but are determined tocreate power of their own, find it hard tobelieve that, in our heart of hearts, we arewith them.7. My second, more speculative, viewconcerns relations between the european community and the United States. I think there is a fairly serious risk (Lord Harlechdrew attention to it in a despatch from washington last autumn) that at all eventsif European unity proceeds on the basis ofthe Six only the European community and the United States of America may fallout with each other. The present doctrine of the Atlantic Partnership, in which I suppose most &quot; Europeans &quot; and Americanssincerely believe, is that a strengthened andunified Europe will collaborate with theUnited States in promoting all good causes.If the Soviet Union and China were unitedto scare them both, this might be so. If not,I doubt it. International groups or units ofgreat and roughly equal power tend on thewhole, lacking common enemies to unitethem, to generate in their relationshiptension rather than harmony. In the tarifffield where the Community already operatesas a unit, the process can already be observed.8. When I was in China, eight or nine years ago, it was fairly obvious that Indiaand China were in for trouble. CertainlyI reported this view frequently enough.But it was impossible at that time to find an indian in Peking who would listen to a wordagainst the Chinese Government. the indians now, I believe, refer to this periodof honeymoon and illusion as the &quot; Hindi-Chini Bhai-Bhai &quot; period, after a sloganwhich characterised it and meant &quot; Indiansand Chinese are Brothers&quot;. The&quot; Americani-europe Bhai-Bhai&quot; period will last some time yet; but it too mightend.9. Whether or not others have illusions,we must have none ourselves. For us, the309-15question of our relationship with theEuropean Community is and will probablyremain a critical one. For the &quot; Europeans &quot;on the whole it is not. The tide ofexpectation and even emotion that built upto its climax in January 1963, and the tideof indignation that flowed strongly for afew months thereafter, have ebbed awayalmost out of sight. Save by the Dutch andsome Germans, our problem is on the wholeforgotten, or if revived from time to timethen more to belabour a partner than toadvantage us. I exaggerate somewhat; andno doubt this dwindling of concern with ourproblem is largely due to the fact that itis so clear that no solution of it is in sight.Were there a prospect of a solution, interestcould quickly revive. Even though ourelections can by themselves bring no suchprospect, it will revive strongly when theyare over. There will be intense concern inmany quarters about our new Government^attitude. And there will be intense relief insome quarters (not only in France) if our attitude allows the Community to forget usagain. Nowhere is the feeling &quot; we mustget on with the job as we are &quot; stronger than in the Commission. Their task isintensely difficult; our presence wouldcomplicate it enormously. The commission is deeply sexocentric: &quot; Life&apos;s just bearablewith the Six. Don&apos;t let a Seventh ruin it.&quot;10. At this stage I must try to answer a preliminary question. Has the european community come to stay? Is it already&quot;irreversible&quot;? Or might it one day solveour problem by vanishing? There are fourpossibilities which might cripple or evenconceivably dissolve it. First, really serious economic difficulties much graver than any now in prospect in one or more ofthe major Member States. Second, a profound change of political course in oneof the major Member States for instancea popular front government in Italy orFrance. Third, a grave dispute with theUnited States in which the Member states are themselves disunited. Fourth, anirreconcilable dispute between the member states arising from some other cause thanthe first three possibilities. Neither of thefirst two seems at all probable in the nextfew years; the other two are perhaps a little less unlikely. I do moreover feel there is some possibility that, as over the next fewyears the Community comes to tackle theharder problems of economic union, theremay be some tendency for its progress to slow down; though this would of course in
13. So much for background. I must ngfeattempt to analyse the alternatives openwus. I make no attempt to estimate theeconomic advantages or disadvantages ofour joining it, while inclining to believe thaton balance v/e should gain. I am convinced the crucial factors are political; and the negative political factors the disadvantages of our staying out, rather than theadvantages of our going in seem to me themore important.14. I find it hard to see an effectivefuture role for the United Kingdom unless we can establish a satisfactory relationship with the European Community, at all eventsso long as the Community continues todevelop and to maintain even reasonablerelations with the United States. We cannotsafely make any assumption other thanthat these two conditions will be fulfilled.I cannot believe that the Commonwealthoffers us a real alternative. Whatever wecan derive from the Commonwealth interms of trade, influence, power, prestige oropportunities to contribute to sounderrelationships in a wider world will be almost as much available to us whether weare linked to the Community or not. In anycase, whatever advantage we can draw fromthe rest of the Commonwealth, or the restof the Commonwealth from us, will surelyvary directly with our own political strengthand economic success, which in turn in my view depend so largely on establishing asatisfactory link with the Community. If weare not so linked our decline towardsisolation and comparative insignificance,which it seems to me has already begun, islikely to continue, and cannot be arrestedmerely by our Commonwealth associations.Leaving China aside, it appears that therewill for the rest of the century be three maincentres of effective power: the Soviet Union,the United States and Western Europe. all states outside them will become increasinglyperipheral and irrelevant.15. Perhaps we should accept this.Nations have no right to eternal influence;and indeed we were pretty peripheral in european or world affairs in all but the last250 years. We can decline again to whatwas for so long our proper place; but ifwe choose this course I feel we must beprepared for the decline to be rather rapid.In particular, I fear that unless we succeed in creating a satisfactory relationship with europe we may have declined in a relatively short time into neutrality. It will no way hinder its development as a customs union, to which development so manypowerful private interests within it, as wellas the Six Governments, are by now sodeeply committed. All in all, I consider weshould be most unwise to base our policy on any assumption other than that, overthe next five or ten years, the Communitywill remain in existence, will more likelythan not develop successfully, and willcontinue to act as a powerful magnet on many countries outside it, both in europe and beyond.11. I have painted a rather unattractivepicture of the Community; it should infairness be remembered that it looks very different from the inside. And we are confronted with a paradox. For, whetherone likes the Community or dislikes it, theconsequences to be drawn in respect of ourown action may be very much the same.Uncritical admirers naturally wish to be in.And those who like the Community less,and fear that it may develop in waysincreasingly uncomfortable for outsiders,must wish to change it. Yet, as our experience over the last six years has shown,it cannot be changed from the outside.Probably the only way by which we couldeffectively change the character of theCommunity in order to convert it intosomething less dangerous to our interestsis by getting inside it. A large, if unavowable,part of our objective in negotiating for membership from 1961-63 was preciselythat of changing the character of theCommunity. Our entry would have changedit. That is why we were kept out.12. We should also bear in mind thatthere are other European States which wish,or may come to wish, to establish close relations with the Community or to enterit. Austria has already embarked on thiscourse. Spain would like to. Denmark mayin the future feel forced to. Of existing members of the Community it is France,for reasons directly hostile to us, which inall these three cases would most like to seeprogress made. The Austrian case will now proceed to a settlement one way or theother. But we can ourselves best contribute,in the other two cases, to preventingdevelopments contrary to our interests by maintaining a positive attitude towardsEuropean integration, and by continuing to proclaim our desire to solve as soon aspossible the problem of our own relationship with the Community.
Pt indefinitely seem sensible to the Britishople to remain committed to the defenceof a continent in whose real concerns and decisions we have no part. I imagine it wasto some such possibility as this thatMr. Macmillan frequently referred when heunderlined the dangers of the economicdivision of Europe, and said that the split,if it could not be healed, would be &quot; a cankergnawing at the very heart of the Alliance &quot;.16. It has for long been commonplaceto envisage the role of a &quot; greater Sweden &quot;as one of the alternatives before us. I feel it is in fact, in the long run, the only optionopen to us unless we can establish asatisfactory relationship with the european community. There is something to be said for such a role, though to play it well wouldinvolve, in our case, practical as well aspsychological difficulties. All I can say isthat I would not choose it myself, but would prefer a course that offered us a chance of greater influence and participa-tion. The &quot; Europeans&quot; consciously anddeliberately chose to subordinate theprospect of limited power and influencefor their independent nations to the chanceof greater power and influence for theirContinent through unity. If we want to goon playing a major part however different from the part we have played till now wemust make the same choice.17. I have written of &quot;creating asatisfactory relationship with Europe.&quot;What relationship would be satisfactory?For a number of years we sought a relation-ship which fell short of full commitment,and concentrated on the trading ratherthan the political aspects of unity. our experience from 1956-61 led us to theconclusion that nothing short of full membership of the European community would be satisfactory or indeed attainable.I think that conclusion was and remainscorrect. &quot; Association&quot; might give useconomic benefits but not political ones;and above all it is no more likely to beattainable in the future than it was in thepast.18.1 consider therefore that full member-ship of the European Community should remain our objective. But what is desirableis not necessarily attainable; immediatepolicy must be governed by immediaterealities. And the immediate reality is that,because of French policy and until itchanges, we have absolutely no prospectwhatever of becoming a member of theEuropean Community.519. It may well be that we shall never have another opportunity to enter theEuropean Community. We certainly shallnot unless things change; and the changesneeded are not in our power to bring about.History will have to be on our side overthe next few years, since time by itself isnot. The mere departure of General de gaulle from the scene might not bringchange enough; for a successor Governmentin France might have in this respect thesame policy, though perhaps hardly thesame effectiveness in maintaining ourexclusion if we and others were determined to end it. It is at the moment impossible to foresee in what precise circumstances afurther opportunity to enter the Communitymight arise; but that should not yet lead usto conclude that the chance will nevercome. The only safe prediction about theEuropean situation five years hence is thatit will not be the same as it is to-day; thereare, as always, elements of change beneaththe rather rigid surface. But it seems to mewise to assume, as a basis for policy, thatthere will be no further chance for us toenter the Community for the next three orfour years.20. This political barrier happens, interms of time, to correspond not too badlywith a practical barrier which the present stage of development within the Communitymay v/ell impose. The transitional period isdue to end, and the Common Market to beachieved, at the beginning of 1970. It mighthave been less difficult for the community to admit new members at the very outset of its development; in this respect our lastapplication was maybe a year or two too late. It may not again prove relatively easy if it ever does till the Common Marketapproaches its theoretical completion.21. Thus, even if we want to begin again the process of joining the Community, wemay have to wait at least three years before we can even attempt to do so. There are possible advantages in this, since during thenext three years a number of elements inthe situation may have become clearer thanthey are to-day. Thus:(i) The system of majority votingshould be inaugurated at thebeginning of 1966. We shall know in three years if it was, and if so howit works;(ii) The Kennedy Round will have beencompleted, for better or worse, well before three years from now, and if
reinterpret their interests and desire otifcaccession. If there is a will there will wa way, and practical obstacles can becircumvented.-23. What then should Her Majesty&apos;snext Administration do? And still moreimportant, since in fact there will be littleit can do to change the existing situation,what should it say? I hope that, when thiscrucial decision comes to be taken, thefollowing factor may be borne in mind. a positive attitude., towards Europe would bring no early results, but equally needinvolve no inescapable commitment orstand in the way of other action. It would leave the situation much as it is to-day, sothat if opportunities for change arise theycan be taken or tested. A negative attitudetowards Europe would change the presentsituation profoundly. It would be the signalfor which our enemies in Europe they arefairly numerous, and not only in France-are waiting. It would close doors, cancelcommitments, relieve consciences, comfortenemies, bitterly discourage friends. Itwould amount to taking off the brake,which our attitude since January 1963 hasto some extent imposed, on the Com-munity&apos;s development away from us; itwould cut the cables which have kept us,to some extent, in touch and alongside. Tosay &quot; Yes &quot;, or even &quot; Yes, but&quot;, would keep open future options, while notinhibiting other action. To say &quot; No &quot;, orto issue a declaration of indifference, wouldbe a decisive step, and perhaps irreversible.24. It will be clear by now, to those whohave read so far, that I hope that, after theGeneral Election, British policy towardsEurope will remain much what it is to-day.I am convinced that such influence, even ifit be only of a restraining character, as wecan still exercise on the development of theEuropean Community to-day derives only from our application and sincere attempt tojoin it, and from our present position ofstill wishing to do if the door should open.If our present positive attitude towardsEuropean integration, and our implicitcommitment to seek again, if opportunityarises, to join the Community, were to be cancelled or reversed we should suffer graveloss. But if for any reason Her Majesty&apos;snext Administration feels unable to main-tain so positive an attitude, then I thinksome of the factors I have described inparagraphs 19 to 22 above may perhapspermit an alternative course which would preserve most of the advantages I see in ourit fails we shall know what theconsequences of failure are;(iii) Internal tariffs will reach zero, bothin the Community and in EFT A, atthe beginning of 1967, and in threeyears&apos; time we should be able to judge the effect of this decisive step;(iv) In three years&apos; time the common agricultural Policy should have advanced to a point where one can judge better than now whether it willwork, and what its consequences are both for prospective members andfor third parties;(v) In three years&apos; time the ChannelTunnel may be beginning to takeshape, and we shall be better able to judge whether that fact affects thesituation materially or psycho-logically;(vi) In three years&apos; time some membersof the Commonwealth may havesolved some of the problems withwhich the existence of the Com-munity and the possibility of our membership of it confronted them;(vii) In three years&apos; time the threeEuropean Communities, as well as their Executives, should have beenfused, and we shall know whetherthey have changed significantly, ornot, in the process;(viii) In three years&apos; time the relationship of Austria to the Community shouldhave been settled one way or theother and the position in respect of denmark and Spain should beclearer;(ix) In three years&apos; time General de gaulle may be dead or gone; and(x) In three years the attitude of theUnited States towards the Com-munity may have crystallised moredefinitely, one way or the other.22. And in three years&apos; time, opponents of this delaying thesis might well argue, theCommunity will have settled in its ownfashion a score of policies, each one ofwhich will represent a new and majorobstacle to the accession of a new member.This is true. But it is not so decisive an argument as it seems. For if a furtherchance of our joining the Community everrecurs, it can only do so if there has beena profound enough change in the will andattitude of the Member States principallybut not exclusively of France for them to
absent situation while falling short of any^polute or unconditional commitment. this alternative would amount perhaps rather to a holding operation than a policy, andmight offer the tactical advantage of deferring real decisions till nearer the timewhen they might be made effective, withoutforgoing all the advantages of our present attitude.25. If therefore some change of policy is unavoidable, it is my earnest hope thatHer Majesty&apos;s next Administration, in thiscritical European question, may feel ableafter due deliberation to declare an attitude which is positive rather than negative, andwhich does not bolt from our side the doorwhich de Gaulle closed. Something on thefollowing lines is what I have in mind:&quot; We are deeply convinced of the need toarrive at a satisfactory relationship betweenthe European Community and the UnitedKingdom. We believe that in the end thebest solution will be membership for theUnited Kingdom of the Community. Butthere is no reason whatever to suppose thatsuch a solution is attainable to-day. On thecontrary, there can be no doubt that therehas been no change in the circumstances which led to our exclusion in January 1963.We therefore do not expect that, in the nextyear or two, circumstances will arise whichwill require us to decide whether or not to renew the United Kingdom&apos;s applicationfor membership. Should our expectation be wrong, and should there meanwhile be a real and decisive change in the attitudeswhich still prevent any advance, we shallbe haopy to explore the new situationimmediately in a most positive spirit. but until there is such a change we shall continue to concentrate on developing ourrelationships in EFTA and elsewhere, whiledoing all we can to keep in close touch withthe European Community and to ensure,especially through quarterly Ministerialmeetings in Western European Union, thatwe remain aware of each other&apos;s policies and objectives and harmonise them so faras possible.&quot;26. In one respect at least, I think, adeclaration on these lines would not suffice to deter the &quot; Europeans &quot; from trying to advance without us: I refer to their project for Political Union. So far, in my viewrather luckily, our frequently repeateddesire to participate in any discussions theymay hold on Political Union has contri-buted to the deferring, probably at leasttill our General Election is over, of any discussions between the Member States ofthe Community on this subject. I havepersonally always felt that our case is rather a weak one. I do not see how, not being a member of the Economic Community, wecan really claim to join a political one. Nor,if the &quot; Europeans &quot;, as seems quite likely,decide to attempt to make progress ratherby developing the political aspects of thepresent Community than by establishing anew and separate Political Union, shall wehave any legitimate claim to stand in their way. I doubt whether, if after our GeneralElection the &quot; Europeans &quot; really desire togo ahead in this field, we (or our friends in Holland) will be able to stop them.Perhaps we ought in any case to considerafter the General Election whether (pro-vided the Dutch have no objection) weshould not publicly renounce our wish totake part in political discussions if the&quot; Europeans&quot; prefer to go ahead withoutus, while naturally maintaining our desireto be kept in the closest touch with theirdeliberations.27. For, subject to one crucially impor-tant proviso, I am not certain we reallyhave much to fear if the &quot; Europeans &quot; doattempt to go ahead in the political fieldwithout us. First of all, they may well fail to produce any result at all. Second, if theydo succeed in constructing something, it is hardly likely in present circumstances to bevery supra-national in character, or thus tobe too much of an obstacle to our lateradhesion if things should change. Third,they might well find, even if an institutionis created, that it permits only very limitedprogress and leads to disputes rather thanagreements, thus exacerbating rather thansmoothing relations. It may well be that theodium we are now incurring by attempting probably in the long run in vain to hold the Six back from political advance is agreater disadvantage to us than any we might incur if they tried to go ahead.28. But the proviso is important. Wemust try to ensure that, if the Six do go ahead in the political field without us, they accept only minimal engagements pre-ferably none at all in the field of defence.The French will of course seek to engagethem in defence as far as they can; we mustencourage the others to hold back. Inter-national relations, when you reduce themto their essentials, are concerned with littlemore than economics and defence. Moreand more, by choice and by institutional
creation of an independent Europeannuclear force.30. The establishment of the multilateral force can do these things even if we stayoutside it. But if we do, then we shall begin to become excentric to Western Europe in defence as we are already becoming in theeconomic sphere. In that event our isolationand peripheral character might rapidlyincrease, and it would be harder to reverse the trend. If we do not join with thoseWestern European countries which co-operate in this defence effort we shall find it very much harder to join them in theeconomic sphere. Thus in the two majorspheres of international action divergencecould became complete. It seems to meworthwhile, if it would avoid such a development, for us to put up with even avery great deal of the strategic imperfectionand the additional expense in which the multilateral Force might involve us.31. I am sending copies of this despatch to Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Paris,Bonn, The Hague, Brussels, Rome,Luxembourg and Washington; and to the heads of the United Kingdom delegations to NATO, O.E.C.D. and EFTA (Geneva).I have, &amp;c.C. 0&apos;NEILL.growth, the international economic rela-tions of the Six are becoming confinedwithin the objectives, the limits, themachinery of the Community. If theirinternational defence relations were to begin to be similarly confined, they wouldbe on the way to becoming a Communityindeed, independent, self-reliant, powerful,exclusive and unpredictable.29. For this reason I make no apologyfor concluding this despatch with a reference to the Multilateral Nuclear Force.Discussion of this project does not fall within my sphere of responsibility, and i know little about its technical details or thetechnical objections to it. But I do know that it is a project which is potentiallyabsolutely cardinal to the future of theEuropean Community and of our relation-ship with it. Seen from here, there is oneargument in favour of. the multilateral force which transcends all others. its establishment could guarantee, for anumber of years, that the main defence interests, links and responsibilities ofGermany (and of some other member states of the Community) continue to runacross the Atlantic, and not to any nearerterminus. And its establishment shouldremove from Germany the terrible tempta-tion of joining with the French in the
