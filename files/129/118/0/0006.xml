69CP. (64) 106COPY NO.CABINETVISITS B Y NUCLBAR-PO^REr^AJ^HIPSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for DefenceBjick^roundSome two years ago the then Prime Minister and my predecessoxinstructed officials to examine the issues involved in visits by UnitedKingdom and United States nuclear-powered warships to each other&apos;sports.   The main object was to agree with the Americans formulaewhich would fully safeguard the United Kingdom, in particular underthe heads of nuclear safety and indemnity, when visited by UnitedStates nuclear warships,,   To this end an Aide Memoire was handed tothe State Department in October, 1962.2.      Action was held up until the Holy Loch negotiations were almost complete, and no formal reply to the Aide Memoire was receiveduntil January of this year.   United States nucleai&apos; war ships have paid a number ox visits during the past few years to United Kingdom portsother than the Holy Loch, both at home and overseas.   In the absenceof a formal understanding, we have taken all such visits on trust andhave assumed that the Americans would accept the application of the holy foch  arrangements if anything went wrong.   DREADNOUGHThas not yet visited an American port, but the Americans have beenasked to accept her at Norfolk, Virginia, at the end of June.3,       The United States reply to our Aide Memoire took the form of a&quot;Statement by the United States Government on the operation ofUnited States nuclear-powered warships in foreign ports&quot; (Annex A),which they told us had also been sent to other Governments likely tobe concerned.   An accompanying paper expressed the hope that her majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to issue a similar Statementso that mutual visits could be arranged on the basis of the assurancescontained in the statements,4.       The wording of this United States Government Statement issimilar to that eventually agreed upon for the Holy Loch, but thereare some differences.to safety, including the provisions for notification of visits.   Thesereservations have now been satisfactorily met in further discussions between the Chief Scientific Adviser and Admiral Rickover.   TheSafety5DWe had reservations about that part of the Statement relating
ECRET52results are embodied in the revised Statement at Annex Bj  and the safety and procedural aspects of the problem need not, therefore, beconsidered further.Indemnity6.       There is still, however, the question of indemnity in the eventof an accident.   We had proposed that the terms of the Holy LochMemorandum should apply to operational visits world-wide.   This wouldhave entailed an introductory proviso to the United States indemnityclause (Annex A, paragraph 3) reading:   &quot;Except in cases covered bythe NATO Status of Forces Agreement&quot;, and a reference at the endof that clause to the principle of the sole and absolute liability of theoperator of a nuclear reactor.7.       The United States Government opposed these additions, arguing that the Statement would be used in negotiations with any country whichmight be visited by nuclear warships and that the NATO Status of forces Agreement has no application to many of these countries.   Asregards the principle of sole and absolute liability, we ourselveshave always recognised that the reference to it in the Holy LochMemorandum has no legally binding effect,8.      As a result of the further discussions between the ChiefScientific Adviser and Admiral Rickover, it is understood that, ifwe can reach agreement with the United States Government on the indemnity clause, they are prepared to withdraw their originalStatement world-wide and to replace it with their counterpart, inexactly comparable terms, of the United Kingdom Statement at Annex B.9.       The arguments in favour of this revised Statement are:-(a) It leaves the Holy Loch Memorandum entirelyunaffected,(b) It provides all that we require as regards safety and the notification of visits by United States warships to our ports.(c) I submit that the NATO Status of Forces Agreement mustin any case apply between the two countries, even ifit is not expressly mentioned.(d) I hope that my colleagues will agree that the claimsclause (Annex B, paragraph 3) covers us adequatelyand that we should not in any event want to go further in relation to visits by our nuclear warships to foreignports.-2-SECii.;i.!Y
10.     Clearance for the DREADNOUGHT visit will be given assoon as we can tell the United States Government that we agree tothe revised form of statement at Annex B.   It is important that weshould be able to do this by the beginning of next week.Re commendation11.      I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; agreement that the UnitedStates Government should now be told that we accept the revisedStatement as set out in Annex B on the understanding that the UnitedStates will also do so, mutatis mutandis, vis -a-vi3 not onlyourselves but also all other countries which may be concerned, in replacement of their original Statement at Annex A.P.
