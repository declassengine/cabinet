(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S government. P. (64; 137,13th July, 1964CABINETLANDLORD and TENANT.SECURITy&quot;15f&quot;tenur!&apos;5 AND rSnt CONTROLMf^^^Jt4^^-3YJ^A-M^n^1:le,r of Hpusjnjg, and LocalGovejameat and Minister for Weloh^AffairsAnnexed is a memorandum by me, (H. a. (64) 107) about our future policy on security of tenure and rent control, with particular reference to the position of tenants in London, which was consideredby the Home Affairs Committee on 10th July (H.A.(64) 23rd Masting,Minute ?.).2.       In that memorandum I suggested that we ought to legislate, inthe next Parliament, to give to all tenants the right to an extendedminimum period of -notice (at present only 4 weeks);  to provide thatthere should be no eviction without a Court order;  and to give to tenants in London (on some of whom the housing shortage is pressingvery hardly) full security of tenure coupled with rent control.     Theposition of tenants in London is at present being examined by acommittee under the chairmanship of Sir Milner Holland, Q. C. andtheir report is not expected till the end of the year;  but in my view we already know enough of the difficulties of tenants in London to know thatwhen the report is published we shall be bound   somehow to give themsome real security.3.       I further suggested that if this was agreed there would be advantage in our saying so before the Election.    There is tobe a debate on London housing on 16th July, and that would provide anopportunity for me to indicate our intentions.4.       The Home Affairs Committee however felt that we should not go further at thin stage than saying that we would provide for noeviction to take place except on a Court order.     That, they thought, i could say in the debate if I wished.5.       I think that it would be better to say nothing than to say that.Eviction otherwise than on a Court order is the exception now;   and itwould be no comfort to the hard pressed tenants to be told that anorder would always be required.     It might well be taken that that v/asall that we intended;  and that would greatly iipcet our supporters amongthe London Members.COPY NO. ^6
6.       I believe myself that it would be very helpful - and wouldcertainly hearten our London Members - if I could say that weshall give extended security of tenure to all tenants, and shall provide for no eviction without Court order;  and that if theMilner Holland report shows that the situation in London requiresmore than that we shall be prepared to provide a still greater measure of security, along with some form of control over rents,for tenants in London while the acute pressure on housing continuethere.7,       If I cannot say this much I think I can only repeat what Ihave already said?  that we shall not hesitate to take whatevermeasures the report shows to be necessary.     But the LondonMembers have already given me warning that they do not think this is good enough.8.       If we were to cay that rents might need to be controlled inLondon we should consider taking the chance to balance this by saying that we would - as we have anyway intended - review thelevel of rents currently controlled.     These should be broughtnearer to current rateable values.    It is only fair to the largenumber of small owners of rented houses that this should be done.9.       -But the big question is whether we should not now indicatethat we recognise that some greater measure of security would be right for ail tenants and that in London we shall be willing to go further still - including a measure of rent control - if the reportshows that to be justified.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, 3. 77. 1.13th July, 1964
30th JUNE,  1964 COPY NO.cabinet home AFFAIRS COMMITTEESECURITY OF TENURE AND BENT CONTROL; FUTURE policy the POSITION &quot;OF TENANTS IN london memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand Minister for Welsh AffairsThe pressure on housing in london.     Since the Bent Act was passed in 1957 the pressure on housing, notably in London, has increased beyond what could then have been foreseen.   Growth of population, increase of separate households - due to younger marriage and longer living -immigration, rising prosperity have all contributed to this.2,     In consequence the rents of flats and^houses which have come out of control following the Bent Act&quot; have, in manycases, risen sharply; and some rents, in London particularly,are painfully high.    Further, as the pressure intensifies rentsare constantly being re-adjusted upwards, and many tenants withshort (often only weekly) tenancies have a great sense ofinsecurity.3.     In addition, the pressure on housing has resulted in thecrowding of houses by multi-family occupation, the exploitation of people (especially of coloured immigrants) seeking a corneranywhere, a steady stream of homeless families, intimidationof tenants to get them out, some appalling conditions.    Thesephenomena are the consequences of the pressures on housing - not,as the Labour Party allege, of the Rent Act.   They are to befound in all the prosperous big cities to which employment ispulling people; but have been worst in London.4.     In February,  1963? I presented a White Paper on London -Employments Housing: Land (Cmnd.1952).    In this I said that,despite all the new house-building, there v/as still in Londonan excess of 150,000 households over houses; and that over thenext 10 years half a million new houses would be wanted forLondoners, to overtake the shortage, to provide for natural growth, and to replace slums and houses demolished in thecourse of re-developmente5About 2-g- million houses have come out of control in Englandand Wales, between 800,000 and 900,000 in Greater London.Some were sold; we do not know how many.   About 1-g- millionremain in control, about   million in Greater London.
5.     But I had to recognise in the White Paper that progressin getting these houses would be slow, the great difficultybeing the shortage of land.    Since then we have published theSouth East Study containing a long term plan for meetinghousing neods over the whole of South East England, and it isclear that to solve the problems of housing in London willtake time.The Milner Holland committee.     I acknowledged in the White Paper that meanwhile therewas a serious problem in the pressure on tenants in London,the extent of which was not known.    Nor did we know whetherthe fullest use in the interests of those most in need wasbeing made of the just oy.er half a million houses owned byLondon local authorities&quot;.    I therefore announced that theGovernment would appoint a committee to carry out a survey of housing in London &quot;with particular reference to the use,maintenance and management of rented accommodation, whetherprivately or publicly owned, and to the relations betweenthe occupiers of rented accommodation and private landlords&quot;.7.     There was some delay while I sought a chairman of theright calibre for the committee; but in July 1963 I announcedthat Sir Milner Holland, Q.C., had agreed to serve, and thecommittee started work the next month.8.     Their report is expected at the end of this year.   Wedo not know what overall picture they will show; but it isalready clear that they will show that some - perhaps many -tenants live in the greatest anxiety owing to insecurity and rising rents; that some are unmercifully exploited; and thatsome landlords mis-manage or neglect their property shamefully;On the other side are some - perhaps many - landlords whohave behaved with great responsibility, despite the temptation offered by scarcity and the lifting of control.There are in Greater London about       million houses andflats in total; just over 1 million are owner-occupied, about900,000 privately rented,  just over -j- million owned by localauthorities.2 -SB)1! v\
The two main problems arising from shortage9.     Mu11 i-o c cup at ion.    The most extreme form of exploitation of shortage has been the sweating of multi-occupied property.      In theHousing Act 1961 we gave local authorities new powers to deal withthese abuses.      In introducing this measure,  the present HomeSecretax^y promised to review the working of the new provisions after an interval.      The Act has enabled some of the more vigorousauthorities to start a systematic attack on multi-occupied squalor.Last summer the Rachman scandal broke and I accelerated the promised review.      This showed that the powers needed strengtheningin several ways.      The current Housing Bill gives to the localauthorities the further powers they need, enabling them to takecontrol of any multi-occupied house wherever that is warranted toprotect the safety, welfare or health of the persons living in it.in short, we have already initiated drastic action to check theabuses of multi-occupation,  although we still have to see that local authorities use the powers adequately.      It was not to adviseus on these troubles that the Milner Holland committee was set up,though no doubt the report will contain a good deal about them.10.    Insecurity and high rents.    The other problems arising fromthe general pressures on London tenants are high and sometimesextortionate rents, and a widespread feeling of insecurity.      Localauthorities were told by the present Home Secretary in 1960 that where there was evidence of extortionate rents, and tenants were in danger of being made homeless in consequence,  they could propose to buy the house compulsorily;    and although relatively few houses havebeen bought, the threat undoubtedly did a good deal to checkunscrupulous landlords.     But compulsory purchase is not in the longterm a satisfactory way of regulating landlord and tenant matters,and this problem of security and rents will be the major issue withwhich we shall have to deal when the Milner Holland Committee have reported.The problem of security and rents;Old control11.    Following discussion in Cabinet on 17th March (C.M.(6U) 19thMeeting, Item 6) I announced that we would not,  if returned to power,propose during the next parliament any further measure of blockdecontrol,  and that we would not interfere with the process ofcreeping&quot; decontrol.      The Cabinet discussion also referred to theneed to allow controlled rents to rise, but no decision was reachedthen.      I am sure we shall have to make it clear that we intend to let the rents of existing controlled properties rise generally,  infairness to landlords.      This will be welcomed by many small land-lords throughout the country.      We shall have to relate the rents tothe new gross values for rating, but I cannot yet say exactly what we should propose nor what increases it would mean.      If,occasionally, it resulted in sharp increases,  these could be spreadover a suitable period.New contro112a    When announcing that there would be no more block decontrol, i made it clear that when the Milner Holland report is available, wewould act at once to deal with whatever excessive burdens on tenants
it reveals.    It seems &quot;very probable that the report will showa need for action to provide security for tenants in Londonand to pull down excessively high rents.    The question is whether we should say now that we shall do this; or should merely rest on the general promise to do what is shown to be necessary .    The London Conservative M.Ps are anxious that weshould say that we shall,  somehow, provide some protection.13-    Right to longer notice for all tenants.    Tenants have atpresent a right to a minimum period of h weeks&apos; notice &quot;before they can he evicted.    I think it would be right to extend this period for tenants everywhere, and to provide substantialperiods for those who have been a long time in occupation,subject to the right of the landlord to go to the Courts for early eviction of an unsatisfactory tenant.    I have in mindperiods ranging from, say, a minimum of 3 months for alltenants rising to 12 months for those who have been inoccupation for many years.    I would provide too that therecan be no eviction except on a Court order.    Something like this would, I am sure, he generally welcomed - and would heright.1L[..    Security for tenants where pressure is acute.    This,however, would do very little to help tenants in London whoseproblem is that if they are evicted, or asked for rentsbeyond their ability to pay, they have very little hopeindeed of finding other accommodation within their means.For those who are tied to London the only remedy is thesame measure of security of tenure as is enjoyed bycontrolled tenants now, with control over the rentsthat can be charged; the one is useless without the other.15-    It may well be that we shall want to provide this;hut it means reversion to rent control within whatever areaswe decide that it must apply.    And it means control of allhouses and flats (below the luxury level).    We could allowrealistic rents - one of the worst mischiefs of the oldcontrol system was that rents were absurdly low; we could also provide that the permitted maximum could he increased as earnings and costs increase.    We might perhaps be ableto exempt tenancies providing a reasonable length of tenancyand within the maximum permitted rent.    But we should haveto relate the permitted rents to the current gross values for rating; and there would be great difficulty in deciding whatlevels to allow in view of the wide variations of rent nowprevailing.    We should have to provide a tribunal system forarbitrating disputed rents within the permitted levels, andthat would he extremely difficult.    Still, somehow it could he done - though it would he highly arbitrary, and might involve a most cumbersome tribunal system which it would hevery difficult either to man or&quot;to instruct.    Once you getaway from the determination of rents &quot;by the market it isimpossible to say how a &quot;fair rent&quot; is to he fixed.    MyDepartment is now collecting further information about the relationship between existing rents and gross values to see what might he possible.    The Milner Holland report will alsocontain information on this.16.    We have said, and said repeatedly, that the Rent Actwas right; and we have repeatedly refused to stop theprocess of creeping de-control.    The Rent Act did achieve a great deal.    Over the greater part of the country theeffect has been wholly beneficial.    It enabled landlordsto put their houses in proper repair - and many did.    It- k -mmm
kept houses available for letting, even though at high - orvery high - rents; whereas previously they were sold as soonas the landlord got possession.   It gave families trying tofind a rented house a chance.    By injecting some realisminto rents, it has contributed to the buoyancy of house-building - though very little has been built to rent.17.    To revert to rent control must mean revert in,;/ to someof the ills which the Eent Act cured.    Existing tenantswill be protected, so rented accommodation will dry up.When a landlord gets possession he will usually want tosell.    Further, we shall get all the dodges: premiums,sale of furniture and fittings, money under the counter.While the pressure keeps up people will get in somehow -though it is fair to add that rent control in London might do something to discourage people from coming to London,18.    We have a choices to protect the sitting tenants at theexpense of a difficult administrative device and of thepeople who want to get tenancies even at high rents; or to let the sitting tenants (other than those still in controlledtenancies) sweat it out while we struggle to solve thehousing problem.    I suspect myself that the plight of somesitting tenants is so bad that we ought to protect them;though I cannot know the real position until we have thereport.   We must decide where the balance of disadvantagelies,   Eent control adds not a single extra house.    But,provided the rent level is high enough and is reviewedregularly enough to avoid ossification, it may be betterthan leaving tenants to their misery - a misery which thereport may well show to be widespread.19.    If it is agreed that we will have to face some measureof protection,  do we say now that we will do it?   It wouldbe represented of course as the death bed repentance toovershadow all others.   But I think we could fac^ that;as I jftave shown we started on this course 18 months ago.What is more difficult is that we cannot say until we have seen the report precisely what scheme we would go for; theright course, administratively, is undoubtedly to wait for it,20,    But this is a very sensitive political issue; and manyof our supporters would be thankful if we would say that weshall provide both a reasonable period of notice for alltenants (as in para. 13 above); and in London real securityof tenure coupled, with rent control.21.      Our last problem is whether we could confine this toLondon..   The position is undoubtedly worse in London thananywhere else in England and Wales.    But I think we shouldhave to say that we would be prepared to extend this toother cities if and as we were satisfied that It v/as necessary,To sum up22.    My own view, on balance, is that it would be right to announce before the Ele^ion that we shall:(1)    Give all tenants the right to an extended minimum period of notice before they can be evicted, ranging probably
from 3 to 12 months according to the length of time they have beenin occupation, subject to the right of a landlord to go to theCourts for immediate eviction of an unsatisfactory tenant.    Weshall provide that there will be no eviction without a Court order.(2)   Provide (as already announced) no further blockde-control of houses and flats still in control, but allow the rents to rise to a new maximum, bearing in mind the increasein earnings and in costs since the Rent Act;    the increasesbeing spread over a period where necessary.(3)   Provide security of tenure, generally equivalent tothat now enjoyed by controlled tenants, for the majority ofprivate tenants in Greater London, coupled with a rent control which would allow realistic rents while preventingextortionate ones - the detailed scheme to be worked outwhen we have the Milner Holland report;    and take power toapply this to any other city as and when we are satisfiedthat the pressure on tenants, owing to shortage, warrants it.23.    I seek the views of the Committee.K. J.Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment,Whitehall,S.W.1 .- 6 -SECRET
