Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1964CP. (64) 110 Copy No.   6 729th May, 1964CABINETIMPORT ARRANGEMENTS FOR APPLES AND PEARSMemorandum ey the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee has discussed proposals for alterations inour present arrangements for restricting access to the United Kingdom marketof imports of apples and pears (E.P. (64) 21st Meeting). The Committee were unable to reach agreed conclusions and I undertook to put the issues involvedbefore the Cabinet.Present Arrangements2. Little protection is given to home growers of apples and pears by thetariff, which is bound at the following rates:Apples 16th August-15th April.........      ...      Nil16th April-15th August     ............      4s. 6d. acwt.Pears   1st August-31st January    ............      3s.acwt.1st February-31st July............      4s.6d.acwt.The prices of imported apples and pears on offer in United Kingdom wholesalemarkets vary widely according to the time of year and the source of supply. Theextremes in 1963 were, for apples, 56s. and 168s. a cwt., and for pears, 92s. and134s. a cwt. The main element of protection is provided by import quotas. Thesequota restrictions were originally introduced for balance of payments reasons andcontrol total imports from the Dollar Area and most other countries outside the sterling Area. There are separate restrictions on the Communist bloc. Australia,New Zealand and South Africa are the principal exporting countries which are free of restrictions. The quotas are as follows:Apples (Two six-monthly periods) ...      July-December    ...      15,200 tonsJanuary-June      ...     68,750 tonsPears (Annual quota)       ......      July-June   ......     28,000 tonsThe Case for Altering the Present Arrangements3. The immediate pressure to change the existing arrangements stems from a request by the Italian Government, first made in July last year and repeated at twosubsequent meetings of the Anglo-Italian Economic Committee, that our quotasshould be increased. The Italians have been told that we are reviewing our long-term arrangements for access to the United Kingdom market and that weshall discuss with them as soon as we can the outcome of this review on the basisof a statement of our intentions which we expected to make by the end of May.The Foreign Office have pointed out the advantage of going as far as we can tomeet the Italian request, both in the interests of expanding our trade with Italyand in the wider context of strengthening our links with individual members ofthe European Economic Community (E.E.C.) as a counter to inward lookingFrench pressures. We have also been under pressure from other suppliers, inparticular Canada and the Lebanon, for an increase in the quotas or for some measure of liberalisation.4411a
4. Moreover, our quota restrictions are no longer justified on balance ofpayments grounds, and are contrary to our obligations under the General,Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. We have undertaken to remove them as soonas possible. But most Western European countries also maintain quota restrictions(except Italy and except the E.E.C. among themselves): some of them, though notFrance or Italy, go further by imposing a complete ban on imports during their home season, and their tariffs throughout the year are generally higher than ours.5. As regards the consumers interests, our aim should be to give consumersin this country as much good quality fruit as they want at a price consistent withour assurances to our own producers. Despite the increase in net income per headand in population in the United Kingdom, there is no clear evidence thatconsumption per head of fresh apples and pears is rising. This suggests that prices are too high they have increased by half as much again as the increase in retail prices in the period 1953 to 1963 and that, in the interests of the consumer, we ought to aim for a significant increase in imports. On the other hand, it can be pointed out that consumption per head is static or falling in other countries with ahigh standard of living and plenty of fruit (notably the United States); and that,compared with 1953, total supplies of apples in the United Kingdom in 1963 wereup by over two-thirds and pears by over one-third.Long-term Arrangements6. There is no dispute that arrangements for access to United Kingdommarkets in the long run must be discussed in an international forum as part ofthe consideration of the problems of potential surpluses caused by the post-warincrease in world production. The opportunity for such discussions may arise underthe Kennedy Round, and there are several possible forms of international agreement which might be considered. On present showing, however, it would be unrealistic to count on any international agreement on apples and pears emerging from the kennedy Round negotiations in the near future.Interim proposals. Meanwhile, in view of the pressures from overseas suppliers and in theinterests of the consumer and of the balance of payments, the Economic PolicyCommittee have considered two alternative sets of proposals put forward by theMinister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Industry, respectively, for interim adjustments in our quota arrangements. The Minister of Agriculture hastaken some soundings of the National Farmers&apos; Unions and believes that themaximum concessions which he could offer to our quota suppliers without runninginto active opposition from the home industry would be as set out below; the changes would not take effect until 1st January, 1965:ApplesIn place of the two present six-monthly quotas there should be substitutedthree periods as follows:(a) 1st January-31st March with a quota of 55,000 tons (which would represent a 6 per cent increase over the average level of imports duringthis period in 1958-63).(b) 1st April-31st July complete liberalisation.(c) 1st August-31st December with a quota of the same size (15,200 tons)as that now applicable to the six months 1st July-31st December.(The quota for 1st July-31st December, 1964, to remain at 15,200 tons.)PearsIn place of the present annual quota period there should be substituted twoperiods as follows:(a) 1st March-31st July-complete liberalisation.(b) 1st August-last day of February with a quota of the same size (28,000tons) as that now applicable to the whole year.(The quota for 1st July, 1964-28th February, 1965, to be 28,000 tons.)
8. The proposals of the Secretary of State for Industry, which are supportedby the Foreign Office and the Treasury, would carry relaxation a little further.They would increase the quota for the period August-December from 15,200 tons to 16,000 tons, and would begin the period of liberalisation on 16th March, insteadof on 1st April (with a quota for the first two-and-a-half months of the year of50,000 tons instead of 55,000 for the full three months). For pears, they would introduce complete liberalisation for six months (1st February-31st July) insteadof for five. The changes for both apples and pears would be introduced on 1st July,1964, the beginning of the new quota year.9.   The main considerations advanced by the Minister of Agriculture are:(a) Apples and pears are sensitive horticultural items. One of the assuranceswe gave to the horticultural industry when we introduced our new policy for horticulture was that the tariff on sensitive items wouldnot be regarded as negotiable within the next four years. While itis true that no mention was made of quotas, the importance whichthe growers attach to a fair measure of protection from increased imports is so great that we shall find any relaxation in quotas hard to negotiate. Any too drastic relaxation would not only be activelyresisted but would be regarded as casting doubt on the value of the assurances we gave when we introduced our new policy.(b) It must be recognised that the Minister^ proposals will adversely affect our growers, both at the beginning of the home season (July) and at its end (April). Our producers would regard extension of the period of complete liberalisation into the second half of March as seriouslydamaging to their interests.(c) The industry is likely to oppose any change in the present arrangements which is introduced during the main home season from July toDecember. It would be particularly unfortunate to begin new arrangements with a month of complete liberalisation in July. Theleast unfavourable time to introduce changes would be the beginningof 1965, when the enlarged quota for the first three months of theyear would take effect.(d) Retail prices for apples in the last five years have shown no clear upward trend, though there has been some increase for pears. The average price of apples in 1963, as estimated for the National Food Survey,was practically the same as in 1958 (about Is. l^d. per pound). In the intervening period prices were in two years rather lower and in twoyears rather higher than this, the latter being due to the relatively short season in 1961-62. The Survey figures also show that usuallyretail prices have been lowest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year and highest in the second quarter (when full liberalisation isnow proposed).(e) The Italians would surely welcome liberalisation of apples in the period april to July since their export trade reaches a peak in the spring andis capable of expansion. In the past two years it has averaged some60,000 tons in April, 70,000 tons in May and 30,000 tons in June.The new season&apos;s crop begins in July when the corresponding figure is some 12,000 tons. The main export season for Italian pears is july to November but exports continue until June.10. The main considerations advanced by the Secretary of State for industry are:(a) The production of dessert apples in the United Kingdom averaged about156,000 tons in the three crop years 1950-53 compared with an averageof 245,000 tons in 1960-63, an increase of 57 per cent over a decade.Similarly, during the same period, imports from all sources have risen by about the same proportion. But, though there have been changes inthe form of the quotas (from value to quantity) and in coverage (bythe inclusion of the dollar area, Yugoslavia and Japan in the globalquotas), there has been no significant increase in the quota levels duringthe last 10 years.4411
(b) The period July-December is of most interest to suppliers in the NorthernHemisphere, and a quota which remained at 15,200 tons, even for aftperiod of five months instead of six, would give these suppliers virtually^no improvement in their position.(c) A quota of 50,000 tons for a period of two-and-a-half months ending15th March would be equal to an increase of approximately 10 per cent above the average level of imports during January-March in 1958-63,compared with an increase of only 6 per cent under the proposals of theMinister of Agriculture.id) The horticultural &quot; package deal&quot; announced last autumn involved anumber of substantial measures of Exchequer assistance on theGovernment side in return for freedom to reduce tariffs on horticulturalimports, although tariffs on sensitive items were to be bound for fouryears. There was no limitation on the reduction of quotas, as opposedto tariffs, on sensitive horticultural items. This apples and pears issue isthe first practical test of the new horticultural policy in terms of exercising the freedom of action which the Government bought with itsassistance measures. To make an unsatisfactory degree of change nowin this case (or to promise the growers that after this no further changes would be made for some years) because of union pressure would setup an undesirable precedent for the future, when we come to seekreductions in horticultural tariffs. The Government^ new horticulturalpolicy would be frustrated and the &quot; package deal&quot; would become an expensive one-way bounty.(e) Our concern over the possible reactions of the farmers should not obscureour obligations to the consumer. No increase in United kingdom production of dessert apples and pears is expected over the next fewyears; if consumption is to increase in step with the increase in net income, and the present rise in average prices is to be arrested andreversed, a significant relaxation of the quota restrictions is necessary.(/) On timing, we have told Canada, who stands to gain, and warned Australiaand New Zealand, who stand to lose, that some relaxation of the quotasis likely after June this year, and we have also led the Italians to expect that some relaxation will be forthcoming. None of these Governmentshas been informed of the proposals described in this paper. We cannot reasonably postpone any changes until after the end of the year; Julyis in any case the beginning of the new quota year.Commonwealth Interests11. Australia and New Zealand send us substantial quantities of apples andpears and Canada of apples.12. Canada. We could not easily defend any change which benefited Italybut not Canada. The Canadian interest is in the period 1st October-31st March.Any enlargement of the quotas, or liberalisation, should therefore apply to thewhole or part of that period. The Canadian Government should be consulted about whatever changes we favour. They are trying to improve their trade relationswith us, and will be disappointed if no change at all is made in their favour.13. Australia and New Zealand are protected by the contractual preferencesdescribed in paragraph 2. The quota arrangements give them an uncovenantedbenefit, and they have no right to expect it to continue indefinitely. The australian government have reacted to the communication in paragraph 10 (/) with an expression of concern lest there should be any sudden large-scale easing of the quota restrictions, though they accept the prospect of some change. The NewZealand Government have not commented.Consultation14. We have an unpublished obligation, linked to the 1957 Trade Agreement,to consult the Australian Government about any significant change in our import licensing arrangements affecting goods in which Australia has a substantial trade
interest. This covers both apples and pears. The published Trade Agreements with australia and New Zealand oblige us to consult both Governments about our food import policy.Canned and Bottled Apples15. My colleagues in the Economic Policy Committee think that the annualquota restriction of  800,000 for canned and bottled apples should be removedentirely; and this should be welcomed in Canada. The greater part of the applecanning industry in the United Kingdom is in Northern Ireland, and removal ofthe quota is likely to evoke some criticism from the Ulster Farmers&apos; Union andfrom Northern Ireland manufacturers; but protection of the canning industry doesnot justify the maintenance of quota restrictions.Conclusion16. I invite my colleagues to decide, subject to the proposed further consultations with Canada, Australia and New Zealand:(i) whether we should relax our quota restrictions, on the lines set out inparagraph 7, or on those set out in paragraph 8, or by some combination of the two;(ii) the timing of any relaxation and of the announcement of this.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,28th May, 1964.
