Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1964CP. (64) 147 Copy No. 5 820th July, 1964CABINETDEVELOPMENT OF A SMALL SATELLITE LAUNCHERMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster GeneralThe Minister of Aviation&apos;s proposal (CP. (64) 146), to develop a small satellitelauncher based on Black Knight is not in my view yet ripe for decision.2. It is important that we should distinguish between the various threads ofour space policies, and that decisions in each field should be taken in the light of a proper assessment of the cost involved in particular courses of action and the benefits to be derived from them.3. We have a programme of scientific space research, including our contribution to E.S.R.O., the research satellite UK. Ill, the Skylark studies andother activities. Expenditure on this will be building up to a total of  6 million ayear. The Minister^ present proposal does not fall within this programme. then there is the potential Defence interest. I must emphasise the word &quot; potential&quot;,because the extent of our military requirement for activities in space (e.g., satellite communications) has not yet, I think, been settled, nor do we know whether we shallbe able to afford military space activities from within a tolerable Defence Budget.In any case, I understand that the Secretary of State for Defence would not wishto pay for the development of this small satellite launcher from the Defence Budget.4. For the rest, our space policies are, I am sure, in need of review. We are committed to the initial E.L.D.O. programme, our share of the cost of which will amount to at least  30 million. It is very possible that this expenditure will prove tohave bought us little except an opportunity to spend more money. Certainly,as the Minister of Aviation says, the E.L.D.O. launcher which would emerge at theend of the initial programme would not be able to put communications satellitesinto orbit. The E.L.D.O. Secretariat have some very ambitious and expensive-sounding plans for further programmes, including the addition of an apogee motorto the initial E.L.D.O. launcher, the development of high energy second and thirdstages to go on to the Blue Streak first stage, the development of a completely newrocket with a new first stage, work on guidance systems, the construction of a newlaunching site and so forth. No proper estimate of the cost of all this will beavailable before the autumn. When we have such an estimate, it will be necessaryto consider the pros and cons of going ahead with further E.L.D.O. programmes.5. Closely linked with the problems about the future of E.L.D.O. is thequestion whether we should participate with other European countries in a programme of work on communications satellites, leading to the development ofsatellites which might be put up by some future E.L.D.O. launcher. We have agreedto defer decisions on this until we are in a position to take them in conjunction withdecisions about the future of E.L.D.O.6. The Minister of Aviation is now suggesting, however, that notwithstanding that we are not yet in a position to take decisions about the future E.L.D.O.programmes and the proposed work on communications satellites, we should develop a launcher of our own. This proposal to build our own private launcher to test satellites and components seems to me inconsistent with the Minister^ own view (which I share) that if we are to go into the business of buildingcommunications satellites, we should only do so in collaboration with Europe. In
any case, however, I do not think it would be sensible to consider embarking upon!the development proposed by the Minister until we have considered carefully asit will be necessary to do later this year whether and to what extent we should go ahead with further space activities of the E.L.D.O./communications satellitetype. The extent to which we go ahead with these activities will be the biggest factor in determining whether or not we need a small satellite launcher.7. When we come to consider this important question, we shall need to payparticularly close attention to the extent to which we can hope to get an economicreturn from further investment in space. I am inclined to suspect that in economicterms space is likely to be an even less attractive proposal than the Concord. TheMinister suggests that we must be in a position to bid for contracts in this field. Itis more than possible that these contracts would not be worth having at the pricewe should have to pay for them in terms of Government expenditure. But wecannot form a proper view about this until further studies, which I have asked myofficials to arrange for and about which they are in touch, with the Ministry of aviation, have been completed. These studies would of course have to deal notonly with the direct economic benefits of space activities, but also the difficult question of &quot; technological fall-out &quot;.8. On public expenditure generally, my colleagues will have in mind the paperswhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have circulated (CP. (64) 140, 143and 144). In the light of these any proposal for increased expenditure of at least 8 million, which has not so far been taken into account in forecast estimates,cannot but be looked at critically.conclusion. I invite my colleagues to agree that at this time no decision should betaken on the proposal to develop a small satellite launcher based on Black Knight,and that we should consider this proposal again in conjunction with proposalswhich will be coming forward later this year in regard to the future of E.L.D.O.and the development of communications satellites.J.
