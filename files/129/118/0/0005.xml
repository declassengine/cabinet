C. F. (64) 105 COPY NO,22nd May, 1964CABINETSTATIONING COSTS IN germany memorandum by the Chief Secretary tothe Treasury and Faymaster-GeneiralI visited Bonn on 20th-21st May to continue the negotiationsfor a new agreement with Br, Dahlgruen, the German Minister ofFinance, on the lines set out in my paper C. P. (64) 92, of 5th May,and agreed by the Cabinet on 7th May (CM.(64) 26th Conclusions,Minute 4).2.       It is clear that the German Government on general political grounds would like to reach an agreement with us, although UnitedKingdom policy on credits for Prussia, however unfairly, affects theattitude of some German Ministers and officials.3.       In the course of discussion it appeared that there were three possible courses of action.   One was an agreement on the lines ofthat with the Americans whereby the Germans recognised the continu-ing burden on our balance of payments caused by our militaryexpenditures in Germany, and undertook in general terms to do their best to offset these expenditures.   We were negotiating in the back-ground of the reaffirmation on 11th May after Mr. McNamara&apos;s visit to Bonn of &quot;the special importance of arrangements between the twoGovernments whereby dollar receipts of benefit to the federal republic&apos;s balance of payments resulting from United States forces&apos;expenditures in Germany are balanced by German defence procurementin the United States&quot;, and the statement that the two defence ministers had directed that specific procurement planning should proceed in 1965 and 1966 on this basis,4.       Dr. Dahlgruen emphasised that the German Government hadnot entered into an unqualified commitment to the United States.Theii&quot; defence procurement there was subject to supjjlies of the rightkind of equipment being available, and to the exigencies of the Germandefence budget.5,       The second possible course was an agreement like the AgreedMinute of 6th June, 1962, with an obligation to relieve our balanceof payments of a specific amount representing part of our costs.Dr. Dahlgruen however gave no indication of any readiness to accept any higher commitments than those included in the German WorkingPaper described in paragraph 6 of C. P, (64) 92, i. e. a two-year-1-
ngnroci-nent up to 31st March, 1966, on the basis of DM.500 million inall (DM.250 million a year) for defence contracts and a &quot;best endeavours&quot; assurance on civil and offshore purchases.   He argued that in realistic terms the Germans could not undertake to spend morethan this on defence contracts, though he stressed that they would do their best to spend more in the defence field and to maximise their civil and offshore purchases,   I am quite sure that it would beimpossible to defend an agreement containing figures only of this order.6,       The third possible course would be for the two countries togive up the attempt to reach a new agreement.   It was clear, as Ihave said, that Dr. Dahlgruen was genuinely anxious to reach anagreement, and that the German Government would much dislike thepolitical implications of a breakdown in the negotiations.7.      In view of the German refusal to raise the figure for an agree-ment on the old lines above DM. 250 million a year the only possibilityof an agreement is one on the American model.   The formula on which such an agreement could be based is set out in the draft annexed tothis paper.   Dr. Dahlgruen and I agreed to submit it to our colleagues foconsideration,8,      I am inclined to think that an agreement on the lines of theattached draft is likely to be no less effective in real terms than anagreement with specific minimum obligations at these relatively lowlevels.9.      Moreover, it has advantages from the point of view of presentation.   It avoids the inclusion of figures whose lowness would invite criticism and reduces the force of the argument that we arebeing less well treated than the Americans.   Moreover, the germans would be recognising in principle, just as with the Americans, the justification for our claim for the greatest possible offset.   In practice,of course, the scale of German procurement in the United States hasup to now provided a practically complete offset.   In our case we haveto recognise that it is unlikely that German military and civil purchaseswill amount to anything like our total costs.10,     The issue for consideration is whether the absence of specifictargets would weaken the pressure on the German authorities to makethose genuinely additional purchases which give us balance of paymentsrelief.   Under an agreement of this type the Germans have an incentive to make as good showing as possible.   The machinery whichhas been developed, particularly in the latter stages of the previousAgreement, would be continued both on the military and civil side,and we discussed the strengthening of the latter,11. I hope, therefore, that in the event of the German Governmentindicating willingness to come to an agreement for two years on theselines, my colleagues will authorise me to conclude such an agreement,-2-
For tactical reasons I would not propose to give the Germans anyindics.tion of our attitude unless and until they have indicated a willingness to enter into such an agreement.IE.     I would again emphasise that, however we proceed, themaintenance of forces in Germany on anything like the present scaleis going to bear heavily on our balance of payments.J. A. B. -C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 122nd May, 1964-3-
DRAFT. OUT LINE, OF THE agreement the maintence of British forces in the territory of the federal republic results in foreign exchange expenditure in the federal republic which imposes a continuing balance of payments burden uponthe Government of the United Kingdom.

This will be done:-(1) by payments to the United Kingdom on account ofexisting and new orders for research, development,testing, procurement or services in the militaryfield;(2) by additional civil procurement in the United Kingdomand other projects in accordance with the arrangementset out below,3.
