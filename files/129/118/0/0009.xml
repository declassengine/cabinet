CABINET&apos;ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF EARNINGSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor. At the invitation of the Home Affairs Committee (H.P. (64) 16th meeting,minute 8), I bring before my colleagues a difficult question on which there is avery considerable division of view among Ministers, which it has not proved possible to resolve.2. The matter is now of some urgency for the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.)raised it with me a considerable time ago and I am now being pressed for an answer.3. The problem is with regard to the calculation of loss of earnings in claims for damages before the courts. The long established common law principle waswell stated by Lord Denning in a recent case (Browning v. The War Office [1963]2 W.L.R. 57) as follows:&quot; The general principle is that the Plaintiff should be compensated sofar as money can do it for the pecuniary loss or loss of earnings (or of earning capacity, I care not how it is put) which he has suffered or will suffer by reasonof the injury.&quot;It was in accordance with this principle that it was held in the House of Lords inBritish Transport Commission v. Gourley [1956] A.C. 185 that in assessing thePlaintiffs loss of earnings account should have been taken of the tax liability hewould have incurred if he had been able to go on earning his salary. In that casethe damages awarded were on this account reduced from  37,720 to  6,695, theresult being that the Plaintiff recovered from the Defendants the net amount hewould have received if he had been able to go on earning.4. This decision has been followed in two recent cases. In Cooper v. Firth Brown[1963] 2 A.E.R. 31 it was held that in assessing damages for loss of earnings theNational Insurance contributions the Plaintiff would have had to pay had he beenable to remain at work should be deducted and in Parsons v. B.N.M. LaboratoriesLtd. [1963] 2 A.E.R. 658 it was held that unemployment benefit received by thePlaintiff should also be deducted.5. The T.U.C. have always maintained that it is wrong in principle to deductfrom damages the full amount to which the insured person himself in partcontributed and have asked for my observations on the two decisions referred toabove.6. The common law principle referred to in paragraph 3 has been to aconsiderable extent eroded by statute. The question to what extent injury orsickness benefits should be taken into account in assessing damages in actions for personal injuries was considered by the Monckton Committee on AlternativeRemedies in 1946 (Cmd. 6880). The majority thought that in calculating the lossof earnings, the full amount of insurance benefits should be deducted. The minority,the T.U.C. representatives, recommended that they should be wholly disregarded.4401Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1964CP. (64) 109 Copy No. 6?28th May, 1964
7. Following upon this report, the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act, 1948,was enacted. This provided that half of the value of any rights which had accrued(ior would accrue to the injured person in respect of industrial injury benefit, 1disablement benefit or sickness benefit within a period of five years from the timewhen the right of action arose should be deducted. The T.U.C. in their letter tome do not criticise this Act and I think they might be satisfied if unemploymentbenefit was treated similarly to the other benefits, namely 50 per cent, deducted.8. In claims under the Fatal Accidents Acts one is concerned with the losssuffered by the dependants as a result of the death. In assessing the loss, insurancemonies payable in respect of the death, all benefits under the National insurance acts, payments by a friendly society or trade union for the relief or maintenanceof a member&apos;s dependants and pensions or gratuities payable as a result of the death are wholly disregarded.9. Since the decision in Bradburn v. G.W.R. in 1874, sums payable to aPlaintiff under insurance policies voluntarily entered into have always beendisregarded in assessing damages. In that case in an action for personal injuriesthe sum received by the Plaintiff under an accident policy was disregarded.It can be argued that it is illogical and wrong that the question whether sumsreceived in consequence of insurance should be deducted or disregarded in assessingdamages should depend on whether the insurance was voluntary or compulsory.10.  The present position in England and Wales can be summarised asfollows:(a) in claims under the Fatal Accidents Acts, all insurance monies, all national insurance Benefits, payments by a friendly society or trades union,pensions and gratuities are disregarded;(b) in claims for personal injuries half the value of any industrial injurybenefits, disablement benefits, and sickness benefits accruing withinthe period of five years are deducted; but(c) in such claims and also in claims for wrongful dismissals, the contributions under the National Insurance Acts which the Plaintiff would have hadto pay are deducted, and where the Plaintiff received or would receiveunemployment benefit, the amount of that benefit is to be deductedin proceedings before the Courts in England and Wales (I understandthat Courts in Scotland would not necessarily deduct all unemploymentbenefit; and(d) the amounts received in national assistance and under insurance policiesvoluntarily entered into are disregarded by the Courts in England andWales and I understand that in Scotland insurance contributions arenot deducted.11. The decision in the Gourley case referred to in paragraph 3 wasconsidered by the Law Reform Committee who were divided in their opinion.While I share the view of those who think that it is right that a Plaintiff shouldnot receive under the head of loss of earnings more than he would actually havebeen able to put in his pocket if he had been able to go on earning, I agree withthose who think that it is wrong that the Defendants should benefit at the expenseof the Revenue as they do now in consequence of that decision. It would, I think,be better if the Defendants were required to pay what would have been paid forearnings and that the sums so paid to the dependant should be liable to tax. Butthis is a question for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I only mention this now asit is related to the questions raised by the T.U.C.12. My view is that it is right that contributions which a Plaintiff would haveto pay in respect of national insurance should continue to be deducted. This is inaccordance with the common law principle to which I have referred.I think that we should treat unemployment benefit in the same way as industrial injury benefit and the other benefits and deduct half of it. The law reform (Personal Injuries) Act, 1948, has not, so far as I am aware, been criticised. To seek to repeal that Act and now to deduct all benefits would I thinkbe politically impossible. On the other hand to disregard all benefits would resultin over-compensation. Disregarding half the benefit may be said to be rough justice and a rough assessment of the benefit paid for by the Plaintiffs contributions. It is,
I feel, difficult to disregard all insurance monies paid under voluntary insurancefand not to disregard that part to which a Plaintiff has contributed under a compulsory insurance scheme.13. I think an answer to the T.U.C. that contributions should continue tobe deducted but that we are in favour of securing that only half the unemploymentbenefit should be deducted and would introduce legislation to that end at a convenient moment would satisfy the T.U.C.14. I regret that my colleagues, the Minister of Pensions and national insurance, the Minister of Labour and the Lord Advocate, while disagreeingbetween themselves as to the right solution, unite in disagreeing with my proposal.In Scotland, apparently it is not the practice to seek to deduct such benefitsor contributions, but I have asked the Lord Advocate for his views as to the likelydecision should an attempt be made in the courts to do so.The Minister of Pensions takes the view that the present discussions and possible developments in the field of severance pay and earnings-related national insurance benefits, as well as the proposals already made in the White Paper on compensation for Victims of Crimes of Violence, make this an inopportune timefor the Government to enter into a commitment which would restrict freedomof manoeuvre in determining the future relationship between employers&apos; payments and national insurance benefits. He thinks that the T.U.C., who are very muchinvolved in these developments, should be told that the wider implications of thequestion are being examined. If legislation were introduced to deal with the deduction of unemployment benefit, he doubts whether on further examinationit would be found possible to exclude from that legislation provision for the deduction of contributions.The Minister of Labour on the other hand would accept my proposal to deductonly half the unemployment benefit but considers that contributions should be wholly disregarded.15. I see no advantage in referring this difficult problem to the Law ReformCommittee for it is a question of policy that has to be decided.16. I should be grateful for my colleagues&apos; views on the line to take in replying to the T.U.C. I must confess that a considerable time has passed since they first wrote to me and, in view of possible political repercussions, it is important that I should send an answer soon.D.Lord Chancellors Office,House of Lords, S.W.1,27th May, 1964.
