CABINETLIABILITY OF OPERATORS OF NUCLEAR shipd memorandum by the Minister of transport as the Lord Chancellor says in CP. (64) 107, the Prime Minister agreed on26th February that legislation should be prepared applying the principle of soleand absolute liability for nuclear-fuelled ships, but that no hint should be given that this was being done. Work has proceeded accordingly, and there is no reason why a Bill should not be ready for introduction at the beginning of next Session,if it then seems desirable. (It is not suggested that such a Bill should be introduced in the current Session.)2. I suggest that, in these circumstances, and seeing that it does not affectthe proposals of the Secretary of State for Defence or the reception of theSavannah next month, the Cabinet need not decide here and now whether legislation should be introduced next Session. There are some difficult issues ofinternational tactics involved. For example, the only other countries with nuclear-fuelled ships the United States and Russia are not prepared to sign theconvention that was drafted in Brussels in 1962. We ought to be sure that ifwe introduce domestic legislation as proposed we shall not be weakening ourposition. I am advised that it is not at all clear that by passing domesticlegislation we can bind the Americans in law. For example, the legislationproposed would be in direct conflict with international conventions to which we and the Americans are parties. I suggest that these complicated issues should befurther examined by officials and then discussed by Minsiters, after an exchangeof papers between them.3. It has been suggested that, primarily to save Parliamentary time, a Billon liability of operators of nuclear ships should be combined with a Bill thatthe Minister of Power wishes to see introduced next Session about nuclearinstallations on land. I do not wish to exclude this if it proves that we wish to seelegislation introduced on both subjects at about the same time, but that can besettled nearer the time.E.
