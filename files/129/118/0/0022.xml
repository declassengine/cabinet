CABINETPARTY POLITICAL BROADCASTING AT THE GENERAL ELECTIONMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal the broadcasting authorities allot time for a series of post-dissolutionbroadcasts by the three main parties. In addition the B.B.C. provide facilities fora national broadcast for each of the minor parties with a certain minimum numberof candidates after nomination day. In 1945 the qualifying figure was 20; since then the figure has been 50. Formal responsibility for deciding this figure rests with theB.B.C. but they have been willing to take account of representations from the mainparties. At previous elections it has been the practice for the B.B.C. to announce the qualifying figure at dissolution so as to discourage frivolous nominations forthe purpose of securing broadcasting time. But this time the qualifying figure hasalready been announced. This has led to protests from the Welsh Nationalists Plaid Cymru and the Communist Party.2. Plaid Cymru&apos;s complaint is that there are only 36 constituencies in wales and that they are therefore automatically precluded from qualifying.3. The Communist Party claim that the arbitrary figure of 50 is unfair andthat there should be fixed an equally arbitrary figure of 20, coupled with a minimum of 10 minutes broadcasting time for any party which cannot claim more. On thepresent allocation the Communists, who have announced that they will have35 candidates, would qualify for about 4 minutes. 10 minutes therefore represents2\ times their entitlement as judged by that of the main parties, and there can beno real justification for this.4. It is possible, however, that it might be desirable to make a gesture andpersuade the B.B.C. to reduce the qualification to, say, 30 candidates, even though this would mean finding more time for political broadcasting in the pre-electionperiod. Any change of policy on these lines might be justified by relating it toPlaid Cymru, and probably that would be well received in Wales. Presentationallyit could be linked also with the Scottish Nationalists although they would be unlikely to benefit because they are not expected to have more than 16 candidates.Nor would Northern Ireland, where there are only 12 constituencies, expect totake part.5. The disadvantage of a change is that the qualification of 50 has alreadybeen announced to the Press. To that extent we would seem to be &quot; giving way &quot;,and it is for my colleagues to decide where the balance of advantage lies.S.
