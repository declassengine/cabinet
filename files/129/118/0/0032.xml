July, 1964CABINETUNITED ST ATES SHIPPING legislation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Indus try, TradefiQSL?:g i.ggaj- Deyelopmont and President of tho Board of Tradeand Minister of transport at their meeting on 2nd July (C.M.(64) 34th Conclusions, Minute 6.)the Cabinet agreed that legislation to secure Her Majesty&apos;s jurisdictionagainst encroachment by the requirements of foreign governments inrespect of the carriage of goods or passengers by sea should be enactedbefore the Parliamentary Recess.    They considered, however, that clause 1 of the draft Bill which was then before them was unduly wide andthat the powers it conferred should be more precisely defined and be related to a better definition  of the national interest.    The Secretary ofState for Industry was invited; therefore, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Minister of Transport and the Attorney-General, to give further consideration in the light of their discussion to the form of this legislation.The Bill has been considered by Ministers at two meetings and hasbeen amended to take account of the views expressed on 2nd July.    Aredraft of the Bill will be available for consideration by the Cabinet attheir meeting on 7th July.Clause 1 of the amended version of the Bill has been substantiallychanged.    As it stood previously it conferred upon the Minister ofTransport powers to issue to any person carrying on business comprising the carriage of goods or passengers by sea such directions with respect tothe contracts made by them for the purposes of their business as appear tothe Minister to be necessary for preserving Her Majesty&apos;s territorial orother juris diction, and contravention of these directions was made aciminal offence punishable on conviction on indictment by a fine.Under clause 1 as redrafted the Minister of Transport will nothave any power to issue directions until he has made an order under sub-section (1) directing that clause 1 is to apply to such measures taken bythe government or legislature of or any authority of a foreign country for regulating or controlling the terms or conditions of contracts for the carriage of goods or passengers by sea as may be specified in the order.Moreover, subsection (I) has been drawn so as to bring cut more clearly that it must appear to the Minister that the measures so specified, in sofar as they purport to apply to things done outside the territorialjursidiction of the country from which the measures emanate, aremeasures relating to matters which fall properly within the territorialjurisdiction of the United Kingdom.-1-
Clause 1 now also provides that where the Minister has made an order under subsection (1) two consequences follow -(1)    it will become the duty of persons carrying on business in the United Kingdom who are affected by those measuresto report to the Minister any attempt by the foreign countryto secure compliance with the measures specified in theMinister&apos;s order, and(2)    the Minister will have power to direct such persons notto comply with any prohibitions or requirements imposed by or under the measures specified in the order.An order under subsection (1) must be laid before Parliament and willbe subject to the negative resolution procedure.These changes in clause 1 seem to us,, and to the other ministers with whom we have considered this legislation -(a) to bring out more clearly that the powers to be conferredwill be exercised only when measures taken outside thiscountry are interfering with matters which properly fall within our own jurisdiction;  and(b) to px-provide a better ba^is for making persons carrying on business in the United Kingdom liable to criminal proceedings for failing to comply with the duties imposed in the Bill.Clause 2 confers power on the Ministers of the Crownspecified in subsection (2) to give directions with respect to documents and written information required to be produced or furnished to anycourt, tribunal or other authority of a foreign country.    It has been amended to ensure that it covers companies registered in this country who carry on business only outside the United Kingdom and alsowritten information relating to a business of any description whichhas to be compiled from documents outside the country from which therequest for the furnishing of the information comes.Clause 3 has been amended to take account of the changes incl2.use 1.We ask the Cabinet to approve the immediate introduction ofthis Bill.S.H,E.M.Board of Trade, S. W. 1.6th July, 1964-2-
