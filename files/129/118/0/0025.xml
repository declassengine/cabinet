Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1964CP. (64) 125 Copy No.     6 029th June, 1964CABINETLAND VALUESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at our meeting on 30th April I was invited by the Cabinet to give furtherconsideration, in consultation with other Ministers concerned, to the government&apos;s policy on land values in relation to urban development (CM. (64) 25th Conclusions,Item 2). The purpose of this memorandum is to report to our colleagues the views which I and the other interested Ministers have reached on this matter.2. On the evidence available to us we have felt bound to conclude that thereis no action open to the Government which will have the effect of reducing theprice of land in the short term. Following the South-East Study, steps are beingtaken to allocate enough building land for the next 20 years; the necessary consultations with the local authorities have begun already. In any event the presentposition is that the building industry is constructing houses at maximum capacity and despite high prices houses are being bought as fast as they can be built. Ifthe price of land comes down the immediate effect may be no more than to increasethe builder&apos;s profit.3. In these circumstances our minds have turned to the case for securing forthe Exchequer some share in increasing land values in order to meet the public criticism which is directed not only at high land prices but also at the large profitsrealised by some owners and developers when land is zoned for development. Wehave considered three possible ways of doing this:(i) An Extension of the Short-term Gains Tax4. Any gains realised from land acquired on or after 10th April, 1962, anddisposed of within three years, are already liable to Income Tax and, where appropriate, to Surtax or Profits Tax. It is arguable that having regard to the timescale against which land developments take place, this three-year time limit is tooshort and should be extended, perhaps to six years.5. An extension of this kind would present no administrative complicationsand it would presumably result in more of the profits from land transactionsbecoming subject to tax. It would, however, be open to a number of objections.First, it might reduce the supply of land coming on to the market, at least for aperiod, for it is reasonable to assume that some owners of land would refrain fromselling until their gains could be realised tax-free. Second, to the extent that the effectiveness of the tax was increased, it might tend to put up the price of land.Third, the longer the period within which gains were taxable, the stronger wouldbe the pressure for a rate of tax less than the full rate, or for some other alleviationto take account of the fact that the gains being taxed had accrued over a numberof years: this would be administratively complicated.(ii) A Long-term Gains Tax6. A second alternative would be to make realised gains from land sales liableto tax whatever the period between acquisition and disposal; in other words tointroduce a full-scale capital gains tax for land transactions. A new tax of thiskind would presumably tend to put up the price of land. It might do thiseither directly, by being passed on to the purchaser, or indirectly, by restricting4521
the supply of land to the market, for although a long-term gains tax, unlika^a short-term tax, could not be avoided by holding on to land until the tirfiplimit whether three years or six had expired, there would still be a temptationfor landowners to refrain from selling until such time as the extra price they received by reason of continually rising land prices offset, at least in some measure,the new tax they had to pay. The tax would, moreover, be open to the objectionmentioned in the foregoing paragraph, namely that it would clearly require aspecial rate of tax. More important, we should find it difficult to justify a full-scalecapital gains tax in this limited field while opposing its extension to long-termgains from transactions in other kinds of property. This difficulty would be particularly acute if land went up in value without any expectation of change of use, for it would be said that in such cases, e.g., for land continuing in agriculturaluse, there was no more reason for a tax than for one on share transactions whichhad proved profitable. The argument that land is different from other assets becauseof its limited supply and because much of any increase in value is attributable to expenditure by the rest of the community, might not command general acceptance.(ill) A Levy on Development Values7. In dealing with gains from land transactions, it is a weakness of anycapital gains tax that it applies, and as a practical matter can apply only to gainswhich are realised. Thus a developer who buys a piece of land at existing use value,obtains permission to develop it, carries through the development and thereafterlets the building which has been erected, would never be liable to capital gainstax on the increase in capital value which accrued to him through exercising his right to develop the land. It is arguable that in this kind of case also the Exchequerought to secure a share in the increase in value which results from decisions by public authorities and from public expenditure. It has also to be remembered thata great deal of land is being zoned for development. Once the likely areas can reasonably be forecast a rise in land values begins to take place and continuesas the land becomes increasingly ripe for development. Moreover, particular parcelsof land may change hands many times as values rise and the increase in value which takes place while the land is in the hands of the developer may be quitesmall.8. As a means of dealing with this situation we have considered thepossibility of a tax on all sales of land and on all development. In the case of salesthe tax would be charged on the vendor and would be based on the differencebetween:(i) sale price; and(ii) existing use value or purchase price, whichever was the greater.Where development took place without a sale of land, the tax would be charged on the developer and based on the difference between:(i) market value with planning permission; and(ii) existing use value or purchase price whichever was the greater.9. Thus, to take a simple series of transactions, the original owner of theland would be taxed on the difference between sale price and existing use value,each subsequent vendor on the difference between sale price and purchase price and the developer on the difference between market value before developmentbut with planning permission and the purchase price he paid. Disposal other thanby sales, e.g., by leases, would have to be covered; in cases of re-developmentsevere problems would arise in allowing for improvements, making apportionmentsand estimating use values. These problems should not be minimised, but solutionscould no doubt be found. As is indicated above, the tax would apply to all sales of land, but it would not in fact bite on sales where the consideration did not include an element in respect of development value; in these cases the existing use value and the sale price would be the same.10. A tax on these lines might best be administered by the Inland Revenue;but the staffing problems involved would need further study. There would be a heavy burden on the Department^ Valuation staff, particularly if there were to berights of appeal against the notional valuations involved: there would be strong pressure for this, but in present conditions the prospects of obtaining additionalexperienced and qualified valuers are remote.
k 11. A tax of this kind, although we think it the best of the three alternatives^outlined above, would, of course, have its disadvantages, of which two deserveparticular mention. First, in present conditions of demand for land it seems inevitable that it would cause some increase in land prices, for vendors would seek to pass on at least some of the tax to purchasers and in many areas the marketis still sufficiently buoyant to enable them to do so. In this case the fact that our action had increased the price of land, even if only slightly, would attract public criticism and the critics would not be mollified by the fact that part of the profithad accrued to the Exchequer. Second, it is essential that any action we takeshould not slow down development or re-development, especially in relation tore-development in the towns to meet the urgent needs of traffic and urban renewal.It seems likely, however, that a tax of the kind described above would have someinhibiting effect, even if it was imposed at a rate well below that of the old 100 percent development charge.Conclusion12. In the light of these considerations my colleagues and I are agreed thatthere are two alternative courses open to the Government. First, we could decide to study further a tax on profits arising from the sale or development of landfor which, despite its disadvantages, there are good arguments of equity. We couldnot, of course, introduce the tax before the next session of Parliament, but it wouldbe possible to make a statement of our intentions before then. Second, in view ofthe complications, the disadvantages and the criticism to which an additionaltax on profits from transactions in land would give rise, we could decide that itwould be inopportune to take the matter any further at the present stage. I should add that arguments in favour of such a tax would lose some of their force if itcould be shown that profits from land transactions are already effectively caughtby the general tax on trading profits: I have carefully reconsidered this aspect of the matter but have concluded that profits from land are not so caught, nor could they be, unless we were prepared to extend the concept of trading profitsto include profits from all land sales, including those which were genuinely the realisation of a single capital asset, and to do this would amount to a generalcapital gains tax on land alone (see paragraph 6 above) and for that reason would,I am sure, be generally unacceptable.13. The Cabinet will wish to consider the two alternative courses outlinedimmediately above.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,26th June, 1964.
