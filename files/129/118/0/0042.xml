THE VC 10 AND boac&apos;s SOUTH AMERICAN services memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Chairman of the British Overseas Airways Corporation(BOAC) reported to the Minister of Aviation earlier this year that inreviewing boac&apos;s routes he had come to the conclusion that the presentroutes down the East and West coasts of South America would not pay their way in the foreseeable future.    BOAC calculated that the cost of continuing the East coast route would be  1.3 million a year and thatof continuing a modified version of the West coast route   0. 3 million a year.    The Minister of Aviation in a minute dated 22nd June askedwhether I thought that BOAC should be subsidised to enable them tocontinue these services on grounds of national interest.2,      Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the capitals affected have allopposed the abolition of the services.    The main argument which theyadvance is that a withdrawal of these services would be interpreted by public opinion in South America as indicating a lack of interest in SouthAmerica, or a lack of confidence in its future as a market for UnitedKingdom goods.    I think these arguments are well-founded.    other major European airlines are maintaining or expanding their south american services.    None, so far as we know, proposes to withdraw.3.       boac&apos;s services to South America, having been abolished in1951 (West coast) and 1953 (East coast), were restarted, at consider-able expense, in 1961 and I960 respectively;  if they were droppedagain now, it would be very difficult to restart them again a few yearslater if we then wanted to.    A decision to cut the services now would therefore probably be final.    I consider that such a decision would be short-sighted, since the importance and prosperity of South Americaare likely to increase.    Furthermore, an announcement of a cut inthese services, unless it could be balanced by some simultaneousdramatic expression of United Kingdom interest in South America,would come rather awkwardly so shortly before General de Gaulle&apos;sautumn tour of the sub-continent.4.      If BOAC is directed to acquire a fleet of VC. 10s and can put them in service on both the South American routes, we should notneglect the effect on our export prospects and general standing inSouth America.CP. (64) 142 COPY NO.14th July, 1964CABINET
5.      I hope therefore that my colleagues will agree that the sumsrequired - up to  1.6 million per annum - should if necessary befound to maintain these South American services for a trial period offive years.    I have however one important reservation.    It seemsto me wrong in principle that the Foreign Office vote should be usedto pay a subsidy to a United Kingdom nationalised airline if Ministersdecide that it is in the national interest to maintain the routes inquestion.6.      I invite my colleagues to agree that BOAC should be directed to continue to serve Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago andLima (by whatever routeing they consider most attractive) for atrial period of five years, and that any subsidy payable should be part of the overall financial settlement with BOAC.T?
