RETAIL PRICES-RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach for consideration by the Cabinet a note by the Treasury on recent developments in retail prices and the likely movement of retail prices over the nextfew months.Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1964CP. (64) 11715 th June, 1964CABINETR. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,15th June, 1964.4474
RETAIL PRICES-RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTSNote by the TreasuryRecent developments the retail price index stayed fairly constant for most of last year. The foodcomponent of the index, a third of the total, fell from the high level reached in theearly months of the year (when the severe weather disrupted some supplies) and thismasked the upward trend in other prices.2. The index turned up in the fourth quarter and has risen continuouslysince then. The mid-May index is estimated (the calculations are not yet quitecomplete) to be 106-9 on the base January 1962=100, a little over 3 per cent morethan in October and also some 3 per cent more than in May 1963. An element of theincrease since November is seasonal: seasonal food prices normally reach theirpeak in June with the end of the old potato crop. More importantly, the rise includes the annual April increase in rates payable in England and Wales and the effect ofthe Budget increases in drink and tobacco taxes. The Budget effect alone amountsto nearly one point on the index. But in addition there has been a continuingunderlying upward movement in prices of goods and services and some signsrecently of a slight acceleration in the rise in prices of manufactured goodsgenerally.The Prospect3. The prospect up to October is of a fall in the food component of the indexfor seasonal reasons and a rise in the rest of it. The index that will become available during October will relate to September. In the past eight years the indexhas fallen between June (the seasonal peak for food prices) and September, except on two occasions one of which (1961) was because of the imposition of theregulator.4. Any attempt to forecast seasonal changes in food prices is bound to behazardous. The seasonal rise this year has not been large. The probability seemstherefore to be that the fall may not be large. The food component of the indexcould fall about two points between May/June and September/October,equivalent to a fall of about two-thirds of a point in the all-items index.5. As the April rise in local authority rates has already been reflected in theindex, the housing component of it should rise only quite moderately over the nextfew months. London fares are expected to go up &quot; substantially &quot; quite soon, asa consequence of the proposals of the Phelps-Brown report and some increases,partly seasonal, in solid fuel prices have been announced for August. Apart fromthese, few price changes by the nationalised industries are expected.6. Changes in other prices can best be assessed in the light of changes inthe cost of labour and materials. The trend of labour costs remains upward. Therehas been added pressure over the last year or more from rising prices for imported materials. In the first quarter of this year the price index for basic materials and fuel used in non-food manufacturing industry was about A\ per cent more than ayear earlier, though there are signs that the increase has been levelling off again in the last three or four months. Some part at least of the increase up to thefirst quarter has already been reflected in retail prices. It is too soon to say, however,whether the recent faster rise in prices of manufactured goods in the shops hasspent itself yet. It might continue for a time.7. It is impossible to say with any assurance whether the non-food part ofthe index will rise by more than the food part may fall. The index will probablyrise a little more between May and June, say from just under 107 to just over 107.From then on it might remain close to 107 till September/October. It could fallfractionally. It seems very unlikely, from present indications, that any rise wouldbe as much as a percentage point.Her Ma)esty&apos;s Treasury,12th June, 1964.
