0PUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1968-69IntroductionThis is the fourth annual report on public expenditure. It sets out what public expenditure is likely to be in 1968-69 on the basis of present policies and programmes, so that the aggregate of expenditure can be seen in relation toprospective resources. It deals with public expenditure in its widest sense, includingthe current and capital expenditure of central and local government, the investment expenditure of nationalised industries and the outgoings of the National insurance funds, but excluding debt interest.2. The report is agreed by the Public Expenditure Survey Committee as giving a realistic costing of what Departments regard as their present policies and programmes. In particular, allowance has been made for investment in theDevelopment Districts in accordance with the Governments commitments. It is accepted, however, that the inclusion in this report of forecast expenditure figuresdoes not of itself commit either the Treasury or Departments to those figures.3. In some fields (e.g., education, health, roads, defence) Departments havebeen able to make projections of expenditure on the basis of specified policies and programmes. Although programmes are not necessarily firmly agreed within theGovernment there is no reason to suppose that the figures as a whole contain anymargin which would allow them to be painlessly reduced later; indeed experience is the opposite and new demands not allowed for are bound to arise in a five-year period.4. There are other items of expenditure where projections of this kind are notpossible. Here predictions have been made on the basis of past trends or by such other means as seemed most appropriate.5. Purchases of goods and services are expressed in terms of constant prices.Figures for current expenditure are on the same basis as the 1964-65 budget estimates: wherever possible, figures for investment expenditure are at March 1964prices. In some cases, however (e.g., roads and universities), it has not been possibleaccurately to assess prices for March 1964; it has therefore been necessary to use the price basis currently in use for planning purposes. The aim has been to showfor each heading the change in real terms on a constant price basis. The figures forbenefits allow for rates of benefit increasing in line with a rate of growth of real earnings per head of 3 per cent per annum.* Such payments as grants and loans to industry, subsidies and overseas aid are money figures, but generally related to current levels of prices rather than to anticipated future prices. These bases of thefigures are referred to as &quot; Survey 1964 Prices &quot;.Public Expenditure 1968-696. The results of the costing are set out in considerable detail in the appendix to this report; and at the beginning of that Appendix there is a table summarising the figures, heading by heading, and showing for purpose of comparison the 1963Survey forecasts for 1963-64 and 1967-68 converted to a &quot; Survey 1964 &quot; pricebasis. From this it will be seen that the total for 1968-69 is  13,840 million, including 400 million for contingencies (see paragraph 57 of Appendix). This is an increaseof  2,170 million over the 1964-65 total implying an average annual rise of 4-4 percent over the period. This percentage should, however, be viewed with somereserve. The costings show that expenditure forecast for 1968-69, the year furthestahead and therefore the most likely, on balance, to be under-estimated, is only put at 3-4 per cent above that for 1967-68, which suggests that the 1968-69 figure iscertainly not unrealistically high. It should also be borne in mind that the 4 - 4 percent cannot validly be compared with the 4-1 per cent in Cmnd. 2235, because the periods which they cover have no common base. For a valid comparison see paragraphs 8-9 below.7. The following summary lists the more important blocks of expenditure and shows the totals by comparison with the figures used in the 1963 White Paper,&quot; Public Expenditure in 1963-64 and 1967-68 &quot; (Cmnd. 2235).* This differs from the growth rate assumed in the 1963 White Paper (3-2 per cent) which in turndiffers from that used in the 1963 Survey (2-9 per cent).SECRET4562 a 2

As to benefits and assistance, see also footnote to paragraph 5.Comparison with 1963 White Paper8. The White Paper put total expenditure in 1967-68 (converted to 1964prices) at  13,225 million. This year&apos;s Survey shows it at  13,380 million, an increaseof  155 million.

The figures in the White Paper showed that expenditure between 1963-64and 1967-68 was expected to rise annually on average by 4-1 per cent. However,expenditure in 1963-64, on the figures of estimated out-turn so far available, lookslike being over  250 million lower than the White Paper had assumed. When thisis coupled with the rise of  155 million in 1967-68 expenditure now foreseen, theaverage annual rise in expenditure between the two years is 5 per cent. If the comparison is extended to 1968-69, the average annual rise is 4-7 per cent.Expenditure in 1964-65 is now put at  675 million, or 6 -1 per cent higher than theestimated out-turn for 1963-64.Conclusion10. The costing suggests that public expenditure at Survey 1964 prices (as defined in paragraph 5 above) will grow from 1963-64 to 1968-69 at 4-7 per cent
r annum. Within the total current expenditure on goods and services is expected increase at 4 T per cent per annum and gross fixed capital formation at 6 - 2 percent per annum.11. On the assumption that the Gross National Product would grow by 4 percent per annum in real terms, the White Paper concluded that by 1967-68 public expenditure (as here defined) would represent about 41^ per cent of the total (asagainst some 40 per cent in 1963-64). On the same assumption * it is now expectedthat by 1968-69 public expenditure will represent 42-3 per cent of the gross national Product. If the Gross National Product grows by only 3 per cent perannum, public expenditure in 1968-69 v/ill represent 43-2 per cent of the total.Treasury Chambers,Great George Street,London, S.W. I,3rd July, 1964.* For technical reasons, the assumption is not quite identical: it is that G.N.P. will grow at 4 percent a year once the loss of output due to under-utilisation of resources in 1963 had been made up,which is equivalent to an average rate of growth of G.N.P. of just under 4-1 per cent a year from1963-64. A similar qualification applies to the 3 per cent case in the following sentence.

Aid Programme*3. The largest item is aid to developing countries. Out-turn in 1963-64 wasbelow the level expected; but expenditure may rise in 1964-65, and in accordancewith the settled policy that there should be a continuing restrained increase in aidexpenditure in the years ahead, it was announced in the Queen&apos;s Speech on12th November, 1963, that the Government would be providing an expandingprogramme of financial and technical assistance. The scale of the increase will depend on such factors as the state of our economy and the external situation. Forthe purpose of this survey expenditure has been forecast at  230 million in 1968-69.Other Overseas Expenditure*^ 4. Expenditure on overseas information is currently about  29 million a year.There has been a fairly steady increase in recent years; and although the projectionfor 1968-69 has been made at about the existing level, it is in practice likely that afurther increase will have to be contemplated. The remaining items of overseas representation, payments to international organisations and miscellaneous are estimated to rise from about  60 million in 1964-65 to about  75 million in 1968-69,reflecting the acceptance of the recommendations of the Plowden Committee t andthe fact that the payments to the international organisations are an expansive sector,and to some extent not within our control.* See Table 2.f Report of the Committee on Representational Services Overseas, 1962-63 (Cmnd. 2276).SUPPORT OF EXTERNAL POLICY $!Defence Bndget*2. The Defence programme costed in the 1964 Forward Look is based on thesame strategy as that costed in 1963. It takes account of later decisions, for example the purchase of Phantom aircraft and the construction of a fifth Polaris submarine.The Defence Departments&apos; costings envisage a total expenditure of  2,219 million an increase of  220 million over the 1964-65 Budget estimates and of  381 million over 1963-64 Budget estimates. There is, however, a great deal of uncertainty aboutlong-term forecasts in the defence field and some account has been taken of this in arriving at the contingency allowance for public expenditure as a whole shown inTable 2.

Forecasts of investment expenditure on new construction and major improvements on major roads from 1964-65 onwards are based on proposals still under consideration. The allocations agreed last year have been revised to take account of the following:(a) A further adjustment of 5 per cent for motorways and trunk roads in respectof price increases during the period 1960-62 in addition to the 25 per cent which was provisionally agreed last year. Price movements since 1962will be the subject of later review in the light of further investigation into trends over a longer period.(b) The figures for England and Wales also allow for a re-phasing of theprogramme to reduce payments in 1965-66 by  6 million in accordancewith Ministerial decisions.6. The figures for non-grant-aided road works, road lighting and car parksshow an increase of the order of  8-3 million between 1964-65 and 1968-69. 2 - 2 million of the increase is for unclassified roads and  6 -1 million for car parks.The increase for car parks reflects, in part, the increasing importance of thisprovision in coping with the growth of traffic in towns.Maintenance and Minor Improvements7. Forecasts for maintenance and minor improvements on major roads inEngland and Wales are in accordance with the agreed 10-year programmes forSECRET4562 BoadsECONOMIC services table public Expenditure on Roads
trunk and classified roads approved by Ministers in 1963, plus an allowance gL5 per cent for price increases since 1962. The classified road allocation for 1964-111has been kept to 5 per cent below the agreed figure because of the general economicsituation. It has been assumed that there will be a compensating increase of 5 percent in 1966-67 to offset the reduction in 1964-65. These adjustments to the agreed programme have still to be considered. There are no agreed programmes forScotland and the present proposals are also subject to discussion.British Railways and Waterways Subsidies*8. Improvement in the financial position of the Railways Board depends verylargely on the implementation of the Beeching proposals for the reshaping of therailway system. The Beeching Report forecast that, if the whole plan is implementedwith vigour, much (though not necessarily all) of the deficit should be eliminatedby 1970. During 1963-64 the Board made striking improvements in theirperformance, the deficit grant estimate of  144 million being underspent by some 18 million; the Vote provision for 1964-65 is  115 million.9. A deficit grant requirement of  64 million is forecast for 1968-69, a sumequivalent to the interest burden forecast for that year. On this basis, which is subjectto the extension of legislative cover for the payment of grant, the working deficit iseliminated by 1968, i.e., two years earlier than forecast in last year&apos;s P.E.S.C. Report.In making these forecasts, the Board have assumed that the Beeching closureprogramme will be fully effective by mid-1967, and that the other proposals in theBeeching Report will be implemented by the end of 1968. Various other assumptionshave been made, e.g., about trends in passenger and freight traffic, but the wholebasis of the improved financial position is that the Beeching policy will be followed.Other Assistance to Industry (including Employment Services)Table public Expenditure on Other Assistance to Industry  million at Survey 1964 Prices	1963-64		1964-65	1967-68		1968-69	1963	Provisional	1964	1963	1964	1964	Survey	Out-turn	Survey	Survey	Survey	SurveyPorts      ...............		10-9	18-2		20-3	20-other transport (excluding roads and						railways)        ...      .........		31-5	37-8		40-2	40-4Employment services    .........		29-1	32-4		48-9	55-5Assistance to industry promotion of						local employment (B.O.T.)......		17-5	30-8		15-4	14-9Shipbuilding      ............	 	 	28-7	 	17-6	 Other     ...............		31-2	40-7		48-0	46-1Total   ............	144-0	120-2	188-6	166-0	190-4	177-110. Expenditure on assistance to specific industries, on the promotion of local employment, and on employment and other services to industry, transport and trade has been allowed for at  177-1 million in 1968-69. The figures for 1963-64 and1964-65 include the  8 million loan towards the Fort William Pulp and Paper Mill;only  2 million remains to be advanced in later years. Expenditure under the shipbuilding loan scheme is expected to continue at a high level until 1967-68, whenthe final payments to the Q4 are expected to complete the advances on offersmade under the scheme. On the promotion of local employment, it is assumed that assistance will continue on the present lines, but that repayment of past loanswill significantly reduce the net expenditure.
11. These savings may be largely offset by increased expenditure on assistance the new Industrial Training Boards, loans to Port and Harbour Authorities, andthe Concord; and experience suggests that further schemes may well be foundnecessary and that it is unlikely that expenditure in the later years will be lower than in 1964-65. This has therefore been allowed for in the contingency allowance(see paragraph 57).Industrial Research, etc.*12. 1963-64 was the last year of an agreed five-year plan for the Departmentof Scientific and Industrial Research. While the Report of the Trend Committeeis under consideration long-term planning can only be speculative. The presentforecast includes increases resulting from the Robbins Report and the coming intoforce of the European Space Research Organisation Convention. Apart from these,the only &quot; space&quot; projects allowed for are those, such as the E.L.D.O. initialprogramme, already approved. Aeronautical research will continue at roughly itspresent level. The Atomic Energy Authority&apos;s forecast assumes the continuance ofits civil research and development programme at about the same level. It includes provision for the National Institute for Research in Nuclear Science and for theUnited Kingdom&apos;s contribution to the international reactor project DRAGON.The forecast of expenditure by the Medical Research Council includes provision forthe Clinical Research Centre.Agricultural Support*13. The cost of agricultural support in future years is affected by changes inthe level of supplies and in market prices and cannot be forecast.14. Neither is it possible to forecast the nature or effect of adaptations ormodifications in the agricultural support system which may be made at futureannual reviews.15. The only practical course in these circumstances is to assume for 1968-69a figure for agricultural support of approximately the same order as that for 1964-65,adjusted to take account of the conclusions of the 1964 annual review.4562

ousing England and Wales16. Present policy on public investment in housing in England and wales is to build up to a level of 125,000 approvals in 1965: no decisions have yet beentaken for any later period. Figures of investment in subsequent years reflect a steady level of 118,000 approvals for local authorities. New town starts on theother hand are shown as rising steadily to a total of 13,600 in 1968-69 as a resultof the designation of further new towns and decisions to expand existing towns. Itshould be noted that no allowance is made in Table 5 for building by cost-renthousing associations which is included in &quot; Advances &quot; in Table 6.17. A higher level of public sector building was implicit in paragraph 17 ofthe White Paper on &quot; Public Expenditure in 1963-64 and 1967-68 &quot;; the figure of 460 million stated there assumed that roughly 139,000 dwellings would be started and completed by local authorities and new towns in 1967-68. But privateenterprise now seems likely to produce substantially more houses than was thought likely last year: 230,000 starts are expected in Great Britain in 1964. If this level is sustained the public authority programme set out above will be sufficient to achieve that part of the Governmenfs target of 400,000 dwellings a year in thelate 1960s which relates to England and Wales (360,000).18. The average cost of a local authority dwelling in England and Wales hasbeen taken as  2,902, compared with  2,525 last year. The total allowance for land has been increased from  20 million to  24 million. Not all of the increase in unitcost is due to price increases; roughly one-third is due to the 1963 estimate havingproved too low as the result of the proportion of more expensive types of dwelling,such as multi-storey flats, being higher than expected. Some (small) part of theincrease is also due to rising standards. New town houses have been assumed to cost  3,000 (land excluded) compared with  2,700 last year.Housing -Scotland19. The present forecast of housing in Scotland assumes a policy ofmaintaining the programme of development and growth in the Central Belt, andachieving by about 1967 the building of 40,000 houses a year (public and private)over the whole of Scotland. It is also assumed that control will be exercised overthe number of houses to be built by the new towns and the Scottish Special housing association (S.S.H.A.), but that although this is not agreed by the Treasury no direct action will be required with local authorities other than to ensure that theybuild for approved needs only. The number of houses expected to be started by public authorities in 1964-65 is 33,100, about 8,300 more than expected a yearago. Thereafter it is expected to vary between 31,000 and 32,000 a year. From1965-66 the new towns and the S.S.H.A. should increase their share of the housing programme in accordance with the Governmenfs policy. It is not expected that inthe period under review the number of houses built by the private sector willsubstantially increase. The average cost used in the forecasts is  3,000 a house,based on March 1964 tender prices, compared with  2,700 in last year&apos;s review.This includes the cost of land, site preparation and fees, and takes account of the increasing number of multi-storey flats.Water20. A constantly increasing demand for water, particularly for industrial and agricultural purposes, has been reflected in recent years in increasing investment expenditure in water supplies. The forecasts assume a continuance of present trendsand are much the same as those made a year ago.Sewerage21. The forecasts of sewerage investment in England and Wales assume a continued increase in new work in rural areas, accompanied by rising expenditureon the modernisation of outworn systems and on extensions to cater for new developments in urban areas. The increase forecast for Scotland is mainlyattributable to the developments envisaged in the White Paper on Central Scotland(Cmnd. 2188).Local Government, General22. This head covers a miscellaneous group of services of local authorities;it includes the provision of facilities for sport. Expenditure on these services tends
to rise steadily and there is a backlog of desirable, though not essential, work whichilocal authorities have been prevented from carrying out because of earlierrestrictions on investment.Town and Country Planning23. The bulk of the item is for land and property acquisition for town centreredevelopments, town expansions and factory building by local authorities. the forecasts are based on the latest estimates of local authorities for purposes ofgeneral grant and on estimates of redevelopment work where there is mountingpressure for greater expenditure.New Towns24. Investment, other than housing and sewerage, in new towns consistslargely of industrial building and commercial development; the remainder is mainly for road construction and the acquisition of land for buildings. The increaseforecast in England and Wales, from  11 million in 1964-65 to  17 million in1968-69, is mainly the result of the designation of further new towns, for which no provision was made in the forecasts last year. The present forecasts do not, however,include any allowance for a new town for Manchester or for new town proposalswhich may emerge from the South-East Study.Table other Public Expenditure on Housing and Environmental Services  million at Survey 1964 Prices	1963-64		1964-65	1967-68		1968-69	1963	Provisional	1964	1963	1964	1964	Survey	Out-turn	Survey	Survey	Survey	SurveyHousing						Subsidies:						England and Wales......	97-0	88-1	93-6	106-0	1060	110-scotland        .........	40-8	37-0	43-0	55-5	57-9	62-8Total   ............	137-8	125-1	136-6	161-5	163-9	172-8Improvement grants       ......		f   17-3	17-3	&quot;l    r	25-1	25-1Loans (less repayments) for house	64-0	\		r31,0i		purchase............

The increase in the number of houses to be built under the investment programme is reflected in the rise in the total housing subsidy bill from  136-million in 1964-65 to  172-8 million in 1968-69. The forecasts also provide for a steady increase in the level of improvement grants. On loans for house purchase,the figures assume a constant rate of lending of just over  125 million a year,offset by a rising level of repayments. Advances to the Housing Corporation underthe Housing Bill now before Parliament are estimated to rise to about  20 millionbut these also are offset in the figures shown, especially for the earlier years, byrepayments of past advances to building societies.
26. Current expenditure on environmental services is estimated to rise from 294-5 million in 1964-65 to  339-4 million in 1968-69-a rate of increase of 3-per cent per annum. While this forecast is based mainly on past trends, some special allowance has also been made for the expansion of services in central scotland.Libraries, Museums and Arts27. An increase in expenditure is forecast on the basis of present trends.The largest part of expenditure is by local authorities on local libraries andmuseums (about  38 million in 1968-69); the estimate of central government expenditure assumes an increase in manpower for national libraries and museums,higher purchase grants for the quinquennium ending 1968-69 and a regularincrease (on the basis of previous years) in the grant of the Arts Council.Police and PrisonsTable 7Public Expenditure on Police and Prisons  million at Survey 1964 Prices	1963-64		1964-65	1967-68		1968-69	1963 Survey	Provisional Out-turn	1964 Survey	1963 Survey	1964 Survey	1964 SurveyInvestment England and Wales        ......

Expenditure, of which 50 per cent is paid by the Home Departments,is expected to rise by about 11-5 per cent in the period. About 85 per cent ofthis expenditure is on pay, etc. (mostly for police, but also for civilian staffs).Strengths and rates of pay are, therefore, the determining factors. The estimates are based on the likely rate of recruitment at current rates of pay and it is thoughtthat by 1968-69 the total strength of the police in England and Wales might, onthis basis, increase by about 8,000 to 89,000 and in Scotland by 600 to 10,900.29. These estimates of strength are higher than the total establishments atpresent authorised but it has been assumed that existing establishments will be substantially increased.Prisons30. The estimates for England and Wales provide for an increase in current expenditure of about 18-7 per cent over the period. This increase is occasioned
by the need for additional staff for new establishments and to implement a shorter working week for prison officers. It also provides for increased workshop activityby prisoners.31. Over the past 12 months the total prison population has fluctuated andthere is no established trend, though the number of crimes known to the policecontinues to increase. Provision has therefore been made, as in the 1964-65Estimates, for a total prison population of 31,500, somewhat above the currenttotal.32. The estimates for Scotland allow for an increase in staff and in thenumber of prison, etc., establishments to contend with the rising prison population and to alleviate overcrowding. A number of building schemes will be completed in the next four years.Fire 8erviees*33. An increase in operation strengths in England and Wales of 800 menper annum has been assumed in the light of current recruitment trends.Parliament, Law Courts, etc.*34. This heading includes the cost of legal aid and advice. Expenditure onthis will continue to rise, partly because of the introduction of legal aid in criminal cases in Scotland but mainly due to the increasing number of applications.Provision has been made for the new scheme, which will begin this year,&apos; forex gratia payment of compensation to victims of crimes of violence, and forincreased expenditure on Magistrates&apos; Courts to meet the expected increase ofwork.SOCIAL SERVICESEducationTable 8Public Expenditure on Education  million at Survey 1964 Prices	1963-64		1964-65	1967-68		1968-69	1963 Survey	Provisional Out-turn	1964 Survey	1963 Survey	1964 Survey	1964 SurveyInvestment^) England and Wales        ......

^Primary and Secondary Schools35. In England and Wales the number of pupils is expected to rise by 8 percent between 1964-65 and 1968-69 and the teacher force by 13 per cent. the comparable figures for Scotland are 5 per cent and 8 per cent. Non-teachingcosts in schools are shown as rising by 24 per cent in England and Wales and22 per cent in Scotland.Teacher Training36. Students are expected to increase in number by about 30 per cent inGreat Britain in accordance with announced expansion programmes, which are inthis period roughly commensurate with the expansion envisaged by the RobbinsReport.Further Education37. The increase in the number of students doing full-time and sandwichcourses at advanced level corresponds with the Robbins targets for years from1966-67. This involves a rise in the number of these students of about 30 per centin Great Britain. Part-time work is estimated to develop in about the sameproportions. The expansion of lower level work will continue on the basis of the policies laid down in the White Papers of 1956 and 1961 and will in addition beaffected by the Industrial Training Act, 1964. Increases of about 40 per cent inteaching costs and 50 per cent in non-teaching costs have been assumed.Universities and Colleges of Advanced Technology38. For the years up to 1966-67 the figures for universities are based onthe approved quinquennial settlement and additions set out in Appendix I ofthe 1964-65 Estimates (Class VII, 1). The figures for 1967-68 and 1968-69 are consistent with the total student numbers in higher education recommended asplanning figures by the Robbins Committee. The estimates include provision forthe expansion of post-graduate work and research. The figures for Colleges of advanced Technology and the two Scottish Central Institutions are based on plans for expansion in the light of the Robbins Report. The price basis adopted for this review means that the figures make no allowance for the increased academicsalaries recently recommended by the National Incomes Commission. Thisaddition would add about  7 million in the current year, rising to  84 million atthe end of the period.Capital Expenditure39. The expansion of the education service in all sectors requires continuedprogrammes of capital investment at a high level, which imply rising expenditurethroughout the period under review. The building programmes assumed for schoolstake account of increases in the school population, new housing, the need for improvement in the most unsatisfactory schools and, in the later years of theperiod, the first steps towards providing for the raising of the school-leaving again 1970-71. The building programmes for universities, further education and thetraining of teachers reflect existing plans for expansion in the light of the RobbinsReport together with the increasing demand for further education at lower levels,including the preliminary estimate of the work required following the industrial training Act, 1964.4562c

The Health Departments&apos; estimates up to 1965-66 for current expenditure are consistent with the policy of development in the National Health Service as awhole at the rate of 2\ per cent a year which was agreed in 1961 for the next fouryears. This policy has for some time imposed a special limitation on development in the hospital services and for the purpose of the present Survey (as for the last)rather faster rates of growth have been assumed in those services after 1965-66.There are considerable divergences between the rates of development for individual services other than hospitals owing to different assumptions about the probablepattern of growth. Despite these differences, however, the overall rates of growthfor the Health and Welfare services in England and Wales and in Scotland are broadly similar.41. The figures for current expenditure on hospitals in England and Walesallow for a 2 per cent rate of increase from  543 million in 1964-65 to  550 million in 1965-66 and then a 2\ per cent per annum rate to  592 million in 1968-69. InScotland the corresponding rates of increase are 2\ per cent and 3% per cent respectively from  70 million in 1964-65 to  79 million in 1968-69.42. Expenditure on the Executive Council services of the N.H.S. is expectedto rise from  229 million in 1964-65 to  252 million in 1968-69 in England andWales and from  26 million in 1964-65 to  28 million in 1968-69 in Scotland.Health and WelfareTable 9Public Expenditure on Health and Welfare
^Jhis is a rate of increase of nearly 2\ per cent a year in England and Wales and^Fxearly 2 per cent in Scotland. These forecasts are based on projections made of thenumbers of doctors and dentists, the number and cost of prescriptions and thevolume of dental and ophthalmic treatment.43. A high rate of growth is forecast in current expenditure in England andWales on local authority health and welfare services. Expenditure on local health services is estimated to rise from  96 million in 1964-65 to  115 million in 1968-69,an increase of 5 per cent a year, and on local welfare services from  33 million to  44 million, about 1\ per cent a year. The comparable figures for Scotland are 8 million and  8-9 million for local health services (just under 3 per cent) and 2 - 6 million and  3 - 3 million for local welfare services (6 per cent a year).44. The proposals for capital investment in the hospital service are in line with the 10-year plans, as revised this year; in all, expenditure rises from  60-9million in 1964-65 to  85-4 million in 1968-69 in England and Wales and from 8-9 million to  11 million in Scotland. Local authority capital expenditure on health and welfare services is expected to increase substantially in England andWales over the same period.Children&apos;s services table 10Public Expenditure on Children&apos;s Services  million at Survey 1964 Prices							1963-64		1964-65	1967-68		1968-69	1963 Survey	Provisional Out-turn	1964 Survey	1963 Survey	1964 Survey	1964 SurveyInvestment School meals and milk   ......

The increase in expenditure is related to the expected rise in the birthrate.School Meals and Milk46. The increase in current expenditure largely reflects the expected rise inthe number of children in school and the proportion using these services. Theincrease in capital expenditure reflects the increase in school building programmes.Family AllowancesAl. The increase in the number of children will give rise to an increase in expenditure on family allowances from  147-4 million in 1964-65 to  161-2 million in 1968-69.Child Care48. The forecasts reflect the established trend in the number of childrencommitted to the care of local authorities or sent to Approved Schools and RemandHomes.SECRET4562 c 2

The Governments pledge in the 1959 Election Manifesto, which hasbeen repeated from time to time, was &quot; to ensure that pensioners continue to share in the good things which a steadily expanding economy will bring &quot;. To implementthis pledge, the Governments policy has been that rates of benefit should risebroadly in line with earnings, although in recent years the increase in rates has gone a good deal further than was needed to keep pace with the rise in real earnings.50. Even if there were to be no further change in rates of benefit, totalexpenditure (including administration costs) on National Insurance benefits,National Assistance and War Pensions would continue to rise mainly because ofthe increasing number of retirement pensions, and by 1968-69 it would be  128million higher than in 1963-64.51. However, to allow for implementation of the Governments declared policy, a further increase of  316 million has been assumed. This figure has been calculated as described in the next paragraph.52. There is no wholly satisfactory way of adjusting cash payments of thiskind to a new price basis. In order to ensure that they are reasonably comparablethe figures have been calculated as follows:&apos;(i) 1963-64 (1963 Survey); it has been assumed that the rates of benefit inforce at 31st March, 1964, were in force for the whole of the year(whereas in fact they operated mainly only from May 1963).(ii) 1963-64 (Provisional Out-turn)-as (i).(hi) 1964-65 (1964 Survey)-these are 1964 Budget Estimates.(iv) 1967-68 (1963 Survey): the 1963 Survey assumed that benefits would increase in line with what was then the assumed growth of real earnings,viz. 2-9 per cent per year. To the figure thus produced, a further2 per cent has been added for price rises which have since occurred.(v) 1967-68 and 1968-69 (1964 Survey): here, two assumptions have beenmade; the first is to treat benefit rates as having been increased on1st April, 1964, by 5 per cent to take account of increases in prices and in real earnings since May 1963; the second is to treat rates ofbenefit as increasing each year from 1965-66 to 1968-69 by 3 per centin line with an increase of 3 per cent per annum in real earnings per head. The second assumption is adopted to agree with a 3 per cent perannum growth of the G.N.P. For a 4 per cent growth of G.N.P., theBenefits and AssistanceTable 11Public Expenditure on Benefits and Assistance
comparable assumption would be an increase of 4 per cent in real earnings per head and in rates of benefit. On this basis, the 1968-69estimated figures become  2,308 million, an increase of  519 million in the five years from 1963-64, or including administration,  2,390million and  520 million respectively.ADMINISTRATIVE AND MISCELLANEOUS services table 12Public Expenditure on Administrative and Miscellaneous Services  million at Survey 1964 Prices	1963-64		1964-65	1967-68		1968-69	1963 Survey	Provisional Out-turn	1964 Survey	1963 Survey	1964 Survey	1964 SurveyExpenditure other than investment Tax collection      .........		98-6	98-1		100-6	101-other financial administration   ...		18-7	18-7		19-9	19-9Common services......		91-9	99-3		101-9	105-8Miscellaneous services     ......		41-8	27-3		24-4	20-8Total   ............		251-0	243-4		246-8	248-2Investment						Government buildings     ......		18-2	21-0		28-6	28-other        ............		11-8	12-4		14-5	13-7Total   ............	281-0	281-0	276-8		289-9	290-353. In this year&apos;s Survey, a large number of significant items (e.g., Research,Fire Services, Parliament and Law Courts) which were last year shown under this heading, have been included elsewhere. Civil Defence is included with other defence expenditure, and the cost of administration of major services has been shown in the table appropriate to the individual services.54. Expenditure on the remaining items is not expected to increase considerably over the period. Tax collection and other financial administrative costs (excluding those for benefits and assistance) are forecast at nearly the same level for 1968-69. Similarly only a small increase is expected on the group services for Civil Departments. The Miscellaneous Services are a wide range of small items(e.g., Central Office of Information, B.B.C., Civil Service Commission) on which expenditure at a fairly constant level is expected. However, the trading profit of the atomic Energy Authority is included here: this results in a net decline ofexpenditure to 1968-69.Investment by Nationalised Industries and Public Corporations55. Expenditure under this heading covers the investment of nationalised industries and public corporations (excluding the Atomic Energy Authority whoseexpenditure has been included amongst that of Government Departments). In spiteof substantial changes, compared with the 1963 Survey, in individual programmes,the total shows a similar pattern of investment, rising very sharply in 1965-66(10 per cent higher than in 1964-65) flattening out in 1966-67, and falling thereafter.This is due to the concentration in the investment programmes of many of the nationalised industries and public corporations in this and the next two years ofadditional investment to make good deficiencies already known, and to provide forincreased demand, including the effects of adopting a national objective of 4 per
cent annual growth in the economy. There may still be some under-estimation dLexpenditure at the end of the period, because of the difficulty of predictiriUp:investment requirements so far ahead.56. The figures for individual programmes are of course under consideration in the current investment review, and some figures are subject to further adjustmentby the industries concerned. These uncertainties may alter individual figures in either direction.CONTINGENCY ALLOWANCE57. The total of expenditure so far estimated is not a reliable forecast of whattotal public expenditure will be in 1968-69 even on the basis of present policies.Experience shows that such forecasts of expenditure tend to under-estimate the eventual cost of present policies and so there must be an addition for contingencies.As last year, we make an arbitrary addition for contingencies; for the presentSurvey this has been put at  400 million, which is  150 million more than last year.This larger allowance is necessary to cover some major uncertainties for instance,the likelihood of expenditure at a higher level than has been forecast on defence,and on industrial research and space projects (for which there are several other proposals now under consideration), and also any expenditure on the ChannelTunnel.58. There are other influences making for greater public expenditure, someof which cannot yet be foreseen, while others (including some in the field of benefits and assistance) are at present under discussion. The figure of  400 million is not intended to allow for additional expenditure arising from such changes of policy,whether foreseeable or not.ADJUSTMENTS59. Finally, to arrive at a total of public expenditure for the United Kingdomconsistent with statistics of national income and expenditure, it is necessary to addNorthern Ireland expenditure and make certain statistical adjustments.annex public INVESTMENT60. As our previous reports have emphasised, there is a close link betweencapital and current expenditure. Accordingly, the major public service investment programmes have been considered with the associated current expenditure in theAppendix, while the investment of the nationalised industries were therefore dealtwith under a separate heading. This Annex brings together details of investment programmes both for Departments and nationalised industries both individually and also, for the first time, on the same classification of expenditure as that usedin the Appendix.Public Service Investment61. Departments&apos; estimates of investment expenditure are summarised inTable 13 below, and show that public service investment is expanding very rapidly.Departments&apos; proposals for 1968-69 show an increase of 5-3 per cent per annumcompared with the forecast out-turn for 1964-65. Between 1964-65 and 1965-66the forecasts show an increase of 5 -1 per cent. The figures suggest some reductionin the rate of increase in the later years of the period, but this flattening out is unlikely to materialise as the full implications of current policies are worked out.Nor do the figures make any allowance for additional expenditure following from new policies. Thus, no account is taken, for example, of the consequences for housing and other investment of the South-East Study or of the Channel Tunnel.Investment by Nationalised Industries and Public Corporations62. This has been discussed in paragraphs 55 and 56 of the Appendix;Table 13 sets out the investment programmes at present proposed.
Sptal Civil Public Investment&quot; 63. The total of public investment is thus shown as rising by  431 million atSurvey 1964 prices or 3-8 per cent per annum in real terms over the four years1964-65 to 1968-69. The rate of increase falls off in the later years and the forecast for 1968-69 is only 1 - 7 per cent larger than that for 1967-68. In practice it is unlikelythat this trend will be borne out by events since there will be a steady pressure to add to investment expenditure.64. A functional breakdown of civil public investment is shown in Table 14covering 1964-65, 1967-68 and 1968-69.Load on the Construction Industries65. Civil public investment makes particularly heavy demands on theconstruction industries. For a complete picture of the demands made by public expenditure in this field, however, it is necessary to take into account constructionexpenditure in the defence field also. Table 15 shows estimated expenditure onconstruction in public investment and defence in 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66.(These figures are based on those originally supplied by Departments and do not take account, for example, of the reductions made in the 1965-66 public service investment programme.)
