HOUSING PROGRAMME, scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland the Chief Secretary in his paper C. P. (64) 96 proposes that the1965-66  investment allocation for housing in the public sector in scotland should be fixed at  78 million, as against the figure of  96 million whichit is now estimated that present policy v/ill involve.    This is a muchheavier proportionate reduction even than is proposed for England andWales, in spite of the fact that the private sector contributes three-fifths of total housing output there as against only one-fifth in Scotland.2.       As the Chief Secretary acknowledges, his proposal for scotland would mean reducing by 6,000 the number of houses currently expectedto begin building in 1964-65, with a similar reduction in 1965-66.    Thiswould require immediate overt action, including the institution of an allocation system to control the numbers of houses started by localauthorities, which is something we have not done in Scotland sinceshortly after we took office in 1951.3.        Having regard to the vital part that housing has to play in our plans for the development of Central Scotland, to the declared policy ofthe Government that we should work quickly towards a total housingoutput in Scotland of 40,000 houses a year by all agencies, to the verysmall part that private enterprise is as yet able to play in the housingfield in Scotland, and to the traditionally bad state of housing in Scotlandwith its heavy concentration of slums in Glasgow and elsewhere, I trust the Cabinet will agree that the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal is impracticable.&apos;    I do not believe that we would be justified on merits intaking action to cut back housing activity in Scotland at the present time,or that politically we can afford to do so.M.
