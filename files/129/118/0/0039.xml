SECSI1TOCUMSNT IS THE PRCFERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;.&quot;3 GOVERNMENTfCP. (64) 13914th July, 1964CABINFQSTMWJN!S pay memorandum by the Postgn^sterGengralFor the second time within a few days I met the Union ofPest Office &quot;Workers (U. P. W.) on Friday last.   I reiterated our offerthat they should accept 4 per cent back-dated to 1st January this year,plus whatever might flow from a quick Pay Research Review, alsoback-dated to lat January.   This they refused to accept.2.       I then asked them to say what was their bid.   They made it very clear that nothing less than 10% per cent plus a back-dated pay research would be acceptable.   I said the difference was so wide thatit seemed unlikely to be resolved by negotiation, and that in such circumstances the Union ought to go to arbitration.   Despite their previous agreement to do so in case of disagreement, they indicated that they were no longer prepared to go to arbitration.   I pressedthem either to accept our proposal for Pay Research or to go to arbitration, but to no avail,3.      As my colleagues know, the Union propose to call a one-daystrike next Thursday coupled with a ban on all overtime.   Meanwhilethere has already been unofficial strike action in London and elsewhere.At the end of last week something like 20 per cent of postmen were involved.   Most of these returned on Monday but inevitably there weremail delays.   On Sunday we announced the suspension of the parcelservice in and out of London;  and as from midnight on Monday (in anticipation of the one-day strike on Thursday) we have had to suspend the parcel service altogether, and also the printed paper service.4,       Whatever may be the merits or otherwise of the U. P. 77,claim I am cure we have no choice but to stick to our guns,   I hope theaction we have already taken will enable us to maintain a reasonableservice for fully-paid letters.   I do not see any way at present of breaking the impasse, but when the Union have had a week or so ofindustrial action they may be in a more conciliatory mood.   At that stage it might be that arbitration would not be so repugnant to them.It might even be reasonable for us to offer a small increase on 4 percent.   But I do not think that any marginal improvement would standa chance of acceptance at present.t   p   &quot;rGeneral Font Office, E. C. 113th July, 1964
