IkTRADE UITIONS AND THE LAWMemorandum. by theMjnistey of labour on 11th June I saw a deputation from the Trades Union Congress(T. U. C. ) at their request, about the implications of the judgment ofthe liouse of Lords in the case of Rookes v. Barnard.2.      I attach as Annex I a copy of the Supplementary Report by theOfficial Committee on Trade Unions and the Law, who had been aske to  consider the implications of that judgment;  the Law Officers&apos;Opinion is appended to the Report.   Paragraph 4 o  the Opinionsummarises the substantial effect of the judgment.   It is clear fromthis that the protection given by the Trades Disputes Act, 1906, tothose who threaten to strike (or actually strike) in breach of contractis less extensive than had hitherto been assumed.   Since then theCourt of Appeal has decided, by a majority, in the case of Stratford v.Liindley that trade union officials threatening to call a strike in breach of contract were not liable for damages; but this is going on appeal tothe House of Lords, who in the Rookes v. Barnard case had foundthat a trade union official acting on concert with workers threateningto strike in breach of contract was himself also liable.   Until the Houseof Lords have decided this further case, the extent of the liability oftrade union officials remains in some doubt.3.      My colleagues will remember that on 19th March I announcedour intention to undertake an enquiry into the law relating to trade unions and employers&apos; associations early in the lifetime of the next Parliament(Annex 2).4.       The T. U. C. deputation told me that they had come to theconclusion that the effect of the judgment in the case of -Rookes v Barnardwould be disastrous to industrial relations.   T ey asked for immediate legislation to restore the position to what it had generally been believed to be.   They contended that:(a) trade union officials would be inhibited from taking part in meetings of their members at which threats of strike action were to be discussed and fromconveying the decisions of such meetings to employers.In this way their authority would be undermined andthe restraining influence which they could exercisewould be absent;(b) unofficial leaders would consequently find their handsstrengthened and unofficial strike action (notpreceded by threats) would take place more often;-1-CONFIDENTIAL(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CP.

(c) trade unions and their officials would be lesswilling to continue existing general &apos;no-strike&apos;agreements or enter into new ones;(d) the risk of all this was more than hypothetical.They said there were a number of actual cases in which employers were using or threateningto use the Rookes v* Barnard decision toinhibit trade union officials from using strike action as a weapon.5.       I said in reply that I accepted that the present state of thelaw was not satisfactory but that I was not as clear as the T. U. C.were about the extent of the change needed or its urgency.   I madethe following points:(i)    The Governments decision, taken on their own initiative, nearly three months ago, to institute a post-election enquiry, had been largelymotivated by recent Court decisions, includingRookes v. Barnard, the consequences of whichwould naturally fall to be considered in thecourse of that enquiry.(ii)    The T. U. C. had not previously suggested -either before or after the announcement ofthat enquiry - that the matter was acutelyurgent.(iii)    It was unrealistic in any case to assume that wecould legislate on this point in the short remain-ing lifetime of the present Parliament or inadvance of clarification of the extent of theliability of trade union officials by the House ofLords in the case of Stratford v. Lindley.(iv)   The Government had deliberately proposed thatthe enquiry into trade union law generally shouldnot be held until after the election in order thatit should be able to start in an atmosphere free from controversy.   If, however, the T. U. G.felt this particular point was a matter of suchurgency that it ought not to wait till then, I wouldbe willing to consider with my colleagues whetherthe inquiry could be launched now, with a remitto study and report first on this point.6.       The T.U. C. representatives suggested that this was alegalistic approach;  that they were ready, if necessary, to talk tomy legal advisers about the legal difficulties of the situation; andthat this matter ought to be dea.lt with at once and separately fromthe proposed enquiry.   I said that I could hold out no prospect of immediate legislation but promised to give their views further thought with my colleagues and communicate with them again.   Iinvited them to send me details of the particular cases of difficultythey had mentioned (paragraph 4(d) above), but did not gather thatthey were likely to do so.-2-
CONFIDENTIALB57.       That the present state of the law is unsatisfactory is, I think,undeniable.     But to contemplate legislation this session is out ofthe question.   The amendment of -the law the T. U. C. want would be un-acceptable to our own backbenchers and would give members  heopportunity for proposing other difficult and controversial changes inthe law.   We could in any case hardly propose, v/ith propriety, achange in a law, one aspect of which is currently awaiting a new Houseof Lords interpretation.   The Official Committee itself also concluded(Annex 1, paragraph 33) that the Rookes v. Barnard decision did not make legislation urgently necessary.8.       If my colleagues agree, therefore, I propose to write and tell the T, U. C. that we have carefully considered their representations;that we accept the law as it stands on this point needs to be reviewed;but that, as I had explained to them, we are satisfied that that canbe done most effectively in the context of the proposed enquiry wehave already announced;  and that if in the circumstances the T. U. C.feel that the enquiry should be started now (instead of after theelection), with a remit to give prior consideration sympathetically tothis particular point, we should be very willing to discuss forth with the scope and form of the enquiry both with them and the BritishEmployers1 Confederation.   I would also propose to repeat rnyinvitation to them to let me have any detailed instances of practicaldifficulties currently arising.J.G.Ministry of Labour, S.W.116th June, 1964

CABINET.  OFFICIAL COMMITTEE ON TRADE UNIONS AND THE LAWSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF THE COMMITTEEIntroduction1. The Committee has been asked to consider in the light of the House ofLords&apos; decision in the case of Rookes v. Barnard whether it wishes to add to or to qualify the report it has already submitted.2. The Law Officers have given an opinion on the decision, and a copy isattached as an Appendix. The relevant conclusions which arise from the decisionare listed in paragraph 3 of the Appendix.3. The case of Rookes v. Barnard has clearly established that the tort ofintimidation does exist, that it extends to threats to commit a breach of contract and that the protection afforded by the Trade Disputes Act 1906 (as respects actsdone in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute) does not extend to threatsby employees to strike in breach of their contracts of employment. As one of thethree defendants in that case (Silverthorne) against whom damages were awardedwas not an employee but a full-time trade union official it might appear that threatsto induce a breach of contract were also unprotected by section 3 of the 1906 Act.More recently, however, in the case of Stratford v. Lindley the Court of Appeal(Lord Denning, M.R., and Salmon L.J.: Pearson L.J. dissenting) has held that section 3 of the 1906 Act protected the General Secretary and the President ofthe Watermen, Lightermen, Tugmen and Bargemen&apos;s Union who, in furtherance of a trade dispute, had threatened to induce members of the Union to break their contracts of employment. The case of Stratford v. Lindley is now to be heard on appeal by the House of Lords and until it is decided the Committee does not thinkit can usefully express a view on the implications of the Rookes v. Barnard judgmentso far as concerns people, such as full-time trade union officials, who threatened to induce others to break their contracts of employment.Strikes in Breach of Contract4. This report is therefore confined to the implications of the Rookes v.Barnard decision for employees who threaten to strike in breach of contract. It maybe presumed, however, that the effect of the decision will also extend to actualstrikes in breach of contract, so long as there is present an express or implied threat,e.g., to continue to strike. Moreover it seems likely that in fact there nearly alwayswill be present such a threat, since the point of the strike will be that it is done (to quote the definition in Shedule I to the Contracts of Employment Act, 1963, whichis believed to be the only one on the Statute Book), &quot; as a means of compelling [the]employer ... to accept or not to accept terms or conditions of or affectingemployment&quot;. This view is also borne out by the following passage in Lord Devlin&apos;judgment:&quot; So if in the present case A.E.S.D. went on strike without threatening,they would not achieve their object unless they made it plain why they were doing so. If they did that and B.O.A.C. then got rid of the Appellant, his causeof action would be just the same as if B.O.A.C. had been threatened first,because the cause of the injury to the Appellant would have been A.E.S.D.&apos;sthreat, express or implied, to continue on strike until the Appellant was gotrid of.&quot; [at I on page 399 of the judgment in [19641 1 All E.R.L5. In the light of the decision great weight now rests on whether a strike,actual or threatened, is in breach of contract or not. Weight has also been put onthis distinction by the Contracts of Employment Act, 1963, because in reckoningcontinuous employment for the purpose of qualifying for rights to minimum noticeunder the Act a strike in breach of contract is to be regarded as breaking continuitywhereas a strike which is not in breach of contract is not. (See paragraph 7 (2) of schedule I to the Act.)4368b*
6. A strike is in practice always in breach of contract if less notice has beengiven than is necessary for termination of employment. (Theoretically, a contract&apos;could permit an employee to go on strike with less notice than is necessary to terminate the contract, but in practice this never happens.)7. A strike is in breach of contract, whatever prior notice has been given,if it is a term of the employees&apos; contracts that they will not strike, it being agreedthat all disputes will be referred to arbitration; or if it is a term of the employees&apos;contracts that they will not strike until an agreed procedure for the settlement of disputes has been used, and that procedure has not in fact been used.8. In many industries there is an agreed procedure for the settlement of disputes, but it is far from clear to what extent observance of the procedure isincorporated in individual contracts. It is understood for example that employers in the civil engineering industry believe that observance of the agreed disputesprocedure in that industry is incorporated in the contracts of individual employees and that employers in the building industry believe that this probably applies intheir industry also. On the other hand in coalmining observance of the procedure is squarely laid on the union&apos;s shoulders, since the undertaking is that the union will try to prevent anyone from striking whilst the conciliation procedure is being followed and will refrain from supporting anyone who does go on strike in thesecircumstances: and it may well be therefore that the relevant terms of the collective agreement are not included in the terms of individual contracts.9. A strike is not in breach of contract if before striking, and in the absenceof a binding agreement not to strike in the circumstances in question, all the employees concerned, either individually or collectively through their union, giveproper notice to terminate their employment before withdrawing their labour. Infact the employees concerned &quot; ask for their cards&quot;, in the words of paragraph of the Appendix.10. There remains the case where a strike occurs after a union has givenstrike notice on behalf of its members (being a notice other than that required to terminate the employment), and there is no binding agreement not to strike in thecircumstances in question. In these cases it appears that the strike is in breach of contract. This is because the strikers, so far from wishing to terminate their contracts, wish to keep them in being with the intention that they shall be improved in some respects. In the words of paragraph 6 of the Appendix, in giving strikenotice the strikers (or their leaders on their behalf) are not &quot; asking for theircards &quot; but merely giving notice of their intention to &quot; cease work &quot;. In fact thenotice is merely a warning that they intend to break their contracts.11. Thus in such a case would-be strikers who intend only to strike after giving notice of their intention may now find themselves in something of a dilemma.Either they can &quot; ask for their cards&quot;, in which case they will avoid any riskof an action for unlawful intimidation and will preserve continuity of employmentunder the Contracts of Employment Act, but run the risk of losing rights acquiredunder the contracts they are terminating, e.g., superannuation and pension rights.Or they can give strike notice and &quot; cease work&quot;, in which case theirsuperannuation, etc., rights may be preserved but they lay themselves open tothe risk of actions for unlawful intimidation and lose their records of continuousemployment under the Contracts of Employment Act.Effect of the Rookes v. Barnard Decision in Practice12. It is clear that a very high proportion of strikes, threatened or actual,official or unofficial, would be or are in breach of contract.13. Nevertheless the decision will probably have relatively little practical effect where unofficial strikes are concerned, and will certainly leave the main problems untouched. This is because the great majority of unofficial strikes areaimed at the employer himself, and as paragraph 7 of the Appendix points outthe effect of the Rookes v. Barnard decision is unlikely to provide employers withany additional legal weapons against their employees. (For the position of third parties incidentally affected by a strike directed against an employer, see paragraph15 below.)
j&apos;      14.   It does not seem therefore that the decision has any effects which wouldTead the Committee to reach different conclusions about the problem of unofficial strikes with which it dealt in Part I of its report.15. On the other hand the decision does have practical consequences inrelation to strikes or threats to strike where the object is to damage a third party or where, if the object is attained, it will have the natural consequence of damaginga third party. There are two principal classes of dispute of this kind:(i) strikes to enforce the closed shop; and(ii) strikes whose object is to affect an employees relations with other traders.The Rookes v. Barnard decision has established that if such a strike or threatenedstrike is successful the third party can recover damages resulting from action whichthe person intimidated has taken to comply with the intimidation. (The decisiondoes not bear on incidental damage caused by a strike to third parties, e.g.,consumers or other employees laid off in consequence, and such damage may notnecessarily be recovered from the strikers by third parties.)16. The Committee did not give particular consideration to the kind of dispute mentioned at (ii) in the last paragraph (and no special comment seemscalled for here), but Part II of the Committee&apos;s report dealt among other thingswith the problem of the closed shop. Undoubtedly the Rookes v. Barnard decision will do something to discourage the enforcement of the closed shop by means ofunlawful intimidation, and so far as it goes this is a gain.17. The House of Lords held in the Rookes v. Barnard case that it wouldnot be proper to award the plaintiff exemplary damages, i.e., damages greaterthan the amount of loss actually suffered by the plaintiff. The Committee discussed the basis on which damages awarded for a breach of a collective agreement mightbe fixed supposing collective agreements were made legally enforceable (seeparagraph 52 of the report itself and paragraph 2 of Appendix II of the report),and concluded that damages should probably be based only on loss but be made subject to prescribed maxima. This decision by the House of Lords does not therefore affect what was said in the Committee&apos;s report about damages.Difficulties arising out of the Legal Situation now Established18. The law now puts great weight on the distinction between threats wherea breach of contract is involved and threats where no breach of contract is involved.But the legal dividing line between a strike in breach of contract and one not in breach of contract does not coincide with the dividing line established by the accepted code of industrial behaviour. Under the widely accepted code of industrialbehaviour workers (or unions on their behalf) are breaking no rules if, in the absenceof an undertaking not to strike in the circumstances in question, they give strikenotice (i.e., notice to &quot; cease work &quot; at least equivalent in length to the noticerequired for termination of employment and go on strike when this has expired.In other words it is not accepted that would-be strikers should have to face the dilemma described in paragraph 11 above. This divergence between the law andindustrial practice is likely to make it difficult for many people to accept the effects of the decision as reasonable.19. An action for damages could result in very heavy damages being awardedagainst a handful of individuals, e.g., if an employer were coerced into ceasing todeal with another firm, which suffered severe financial loss as a result. While thefacts of the particular case would be important in determining this, it is not clearthat public opinion would accept such a situation as fair.20. It would certainly throw into sharp relief the very far-reachingimmunities conferred on the unions by section 4 of the 1906 Act. These have beenin no way affected by the Rookes v. Barnard decision. Hence official union action may involve members who carry out union decisions in actions for tort (as in facthappened in the case of Rookes v. Barnard) but union funds are not legally at risk in any way. This gives a new twist to the problem of the protection of individuals in relation to the powers enjoyed by the unions.21. So far as the closed shop is concerned, the decision is far from providing a complete answer to the problems. It will do nothing to prevent the closed shopSECRET4368 b* 2
being enforced, with whatever hardship or injustice to the individual, by meansof lawful threats, e.g., by employees threatening to terminate their employment inaccordance with their contracts.22. Finally, the concept of &quot; unlawful intimidation &quot; and its application to industrial disputes raises complex and bewildering issues of law. It is doubtfulwhether the passage of time and further judicial decisions will clarify the lawsufficiently for it to be generally understood or accepted as fair. This is illustrated by the uncertainties which have arisen out of the Court of Appeal&apos;s decision inthe case of Stratford v. Lindley (see paragraph 3 above) and by the fact that thethree members of the court in that case took differing views about what the Houseof Lords decided in Rookes v. Barnard. It can be argued that the mere need tomake the law clear constitutes a powerful argument for legislation.Implications for the Committee&apos;s Report23. The decision in Rookes v. Barnard does not appear to have implicationswhich would make it desirable for the Committee to modify the conclusionsrecorded in its report. It has, however, brought to light the new problems discussed in paragraphs 18-22. The following paragraphs contain possible alternative courses of action in relation to these problems.What should be done?24. The T.U.C. and the unions are still studying the effect of the judgment.Until they have clarified their ideas, it is difficult to know what practical effect the judgment is likely to have on industrial relations, since so much depends onunion attitudes and feelings. Nor is it clear to what extent employ ere and otherswill be encouraged to resort to litigation. However, it is a fair assumption that theT.U.C. would be happy to see the effect of the Rookes v. Barnard decision reversedby statute, i.e., for it to be laid down that a threat of a strike in breach of contract(or a strike in breach of contract for the purpose of threatening) is not to be held to constitute unlawful intimidation.25. It is possible that one effect of the judgment might be to discourageunions from entering into procedure agreements under which no strikes are totake place until a procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes has been used.It might be also that the unions would want to revise their attitudes to existing agreements. There can be no certainty at present about the scale on which this islikely to happen or the extent to which it would give rise to real difficulties. Onecourse open to the unions is to seek agreements similar to that in coalmining,where obligations fall on the union but may not become part of the individualcontracts of employment, or to seek in other ways to prevent the relevant terms of collective agreements from being incorporated in individual contracts.26.  Broadly, four courses seem possible:(i) to leave the law as it is;(ii) to amend the law so as to reverse the effect of the decision;(iii) to amend the law as it relates to strikes in breach of contract;(iv) to amend the law so as to reverse the effect of the decision but at the sametime to impose different restraints on indiscriminate strike action.27. In the long run it is doubtful whether the first course would be satisfactory or perhaps even practicable in the light of the various difficultiesdescribed in paragraphs 18-22 above.28. The second course (simply to reverse the effect of the decision) does not seem justified. Whatever the difficulties to which it gives rise, the decision has given a jolt to those who thought that all strikes however irresponsible were beyond thereach of the law. This has been salutary, and it would be a pity to sacrifice thebenefits without a corresponding gain in some other way.29. The purpose of the third course would be to alter existing law in relationto strikes so as to bring it into line with industrial practice. This would deal withthe difficulty described in paragraph 18 above. (In theory this might be done bythe voluntary adjustment of contracts, but the process would take a very longtime, leave many gaps and never succeed in simplifying the position in the way
that legislation could do.) A strike without notice or in breach of a bindingfundertaking not to strike would still be in breach of contract. On the other hand it would be established that, in the absence of an undertaking not to strike, a strikewhich takes place after strike notice not shorter in duration than the noticerequired for termination of employment is to be regarded as putting the contractinto suspense, but not as breaking it. At the same time during a period whencontracts were in suspense the employer would have the right to terminate them without notice, and there would therefore be preserved the employer^ right not tore-engage strikers.30. It would be a disadvantage of this course that it would not come to gripswith other problems described in paragraphs 19-22. In particular it would do nothing to lessen the sharp contrast between the amount of protection afforded bythe law to unions as such and that afforded to individuals even if carrying outunion decisions.31. The fourth course would be more far-reaching, and its object would beto deal more comprehensively with the difficulties described in paragraphs 18-22(not, however, including the closed shop). This would be:(i) to reverse the effect of the Rookes v. Barnard decision, so that a threat to strike in breach of contract would not lay those concerned in the threatopen to an action for unlawful intimidation;(ii) to put a modified degree of responsibility on trade unions and trade union members for the observance of collective agreements (the possibilitydiscussed in paragraphs 43-57 of the Committee&apos;s report); and(hi) to modify the law relating to strikes in the way suggested in paragraph 29above. This would still be desirable even if the effect of the Rookes v.Barnard decision is reversed in order to clarify the law and in particularbecause of the Contracts of Employment Act&apos;s provisions in relationto strikes in breach of contract (see paragraph 5 above).32. Whatever course is adopted, another factor to be borne in mind is theeffect that legislation on unjustifiable dismissal (which the Committee recommended for consideration see paragraphs 60-67 of the report) could have on the closed shop. Such legislation might allow the dismissal of an employee who does notbelong to a union if it is a term of his contract that he is to belong to it, but this might be subject to safeguards for those who are expelled unreasonably or wholeave or fail to join the union for reasons held to be justifiable by the labour court.Strikes with the object of upsetting a decision of this or any other kind by thelabour court might be put outside the protection of the 1906 Act.Conclusion33. The Government have now announced that they intend to appoint an inquiry into the law relating to trade unions and employers&apos; associations. TheRookes v. Barnard decision does not appear to make legislation urgently necessary before the inquiry is completed. No doubt in the course of the inquiry the fourpossible courses listed in paragraph 26 above will be given consideration.Ministry of Labour,8 St. James&apos;s Square,London, S.W. 1.
AppendixIN THE MATTER OF THE DECISION OF THE HOUSE OF lords in THE CASE OF ROOKES v. BARNARDOPINIONOF THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN FOR ENGLANDAND scotland. The case of Rookes v. Barnard was an action brought by a draughtsman,Rookes, whose employment had been terminated by B.O.A.C., after the Associationof Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen (A.E.S.D.) had threatened to strikeunless Rookes was dismissed. The defendants to the action were three trade union officials of whom two were employees of B.O.A.C.2. There was in existence an agreement between B.O.A.C. and A.E.S.D. thatno lock-out or strike should take place and any disputes should be referred to arbitration; the provisions of this agreement were part of the contracts ofemployment of the members of A.E.S.D. It was common ground that if theA.E.S.D. had carried out their threat to strike this would have been a breach ofthat agreement. It was also common ground that the acts complained of were &quot; in furtherance of a trade dispute &quot;.3. The following are the relevant conclusions which, in our opinion, arise from the decision:(1) There exists as part of the common law of England the tort of intimidation.This tort consists of a threat to do an unlawful act with the intentionof compelling a person to act or refrain from acting in a manner whichis intended or must have the natural consequence of being a detriment to that person or to a third person, whereby damage is caused to either.(2) An action at law may be brought by any person whom it was intended to damage by intimidation and who as a result suffers damage.(3) A threat to commit a breach of contract, as well as a threat to commit acrime or a tort, constitutes a threat to do an unlawful act for thepurposes of the tort of intimidation.(4) The tort of intimidation so defined is of general application and is not confined to trade disputes or to questions arising between employer and employee.(5) On the facts of Rookes v. Barnard a strike by members of the A.E.S.D.would have been in breach of their contracts of service and in particular of the express agreement that no lock-out or strike should take place.Therefore the threat by the defendants constituted a threat to do anunlawful act with the intention of compelling B.O.A.C. to dismiss theplaintiff. B.O.A.C. thereupon did with proper notice dismiss Mr. Rookeswho thereby suffered the damage intended by the three defendants.(6) Section 1 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, afforded no defence to the defendants in these circumstances, because the tort of intimidation isactionable against any individual even if done without any agreementor combination.(7) Section 3 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, likewise afforded no defencebecause the act complained of was not actionable on the ground only that it induced B.O.A.C. to break its contract with the plaintiffMr. Rookes (which B.O.A.C. did not in fact break), or on the groundonly that it was an interference with the business of B.O.A.C. or theemployment of Mr. Rookes. It was separately actionable as the tort ofintimidation.
(8) The Trade Disputes Act, 1906, has never licensed the commission of a tortprovided it was done in combination and in furtherance of a trade dispute. It has served to exculpate acts which are lawful when done byan individual but unlawful when done in combination provided the combination was in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.This position has not been altered in any way by the decision inRookes v. Barnard.4. The substantial effect of the decision may therefore be stated as aproposition that a threat by A to break his contract with B, with the intention ofinjuring B or C, gives B or C, if he is thereby injured, a right of action against A.Thus, employees who threaten to strike in breach of contract in order to enforce a closed shop or over a demarcation dispute or to affect their employees relationswith other traders will be liable for damages at the suit of the non-unionists orother unionists or other traders who are injured in consequence of the threat.5. This doctrine or rule will only apply to threats to strike in breach of contract. Thus employees who are serving under a contract of employment which requires a stated number of days notice of termination (or alternatively where theterms of the Contracts of Employment Act, 1963, apply) and who wish to bring pressure on their employer by the threat of strike action can still do so by a threat to withdraw labour after due notice to terminate engagements has been given. Theywould not then be liable at the suit of anyone for the tort of intimidation.If, however, employees wish to bring pressure to bear by the threat of a strikewithout proper notice they will be threatening to act in breach of contract. This will amount to acting unlawfully for the purposes of the tort, and they will be liable for damage intentionally caused. The distinction between a threat lawfully to terminatea contract of employment and a threat to act in breach of contract now becomes the decisive distinction.6. The decision will have practical consequences. Unions who wish to affectthe position of non-unionists, or the relations of their employers with other traders,now may well feel inhibited by the possible legal consequences of a threat to strikewithout notice, and will be reluctant to make an agreement with the employers to exclude strikes and lock-outs. Moreover, many trade disputes are preceded bydiscussions in the course of which Union leaders ought and would wish to makethe intentions of their members clear. There is a substantial difference betweenceasing work and &quot; asking for your cards &quot;. If Union leaders announce that their members will cease work, they may be at risk of suit by third parties forintimidation; if they &quot; ask for their cards&quot;, different consequences will flowcompared to the results of present strikes. For instance, if in future strikes normallytake place after notice, continuity of employment will be broken for purposes otherthan the Contracts of Employment Act, 1963. How far the effects on superannuation,private pension schemes and similar matters are of significance we are unable to judge, but they amount to consequences which must not be ignored.7. The effect of the decision is however unlikely to provide employers withany additional legal weapons against their employees. If, for example, the employersurrenders to a threat to strike without notice unless wages are increased, he wouldnot bring an action against those very employees with whom he has come to terms and indeed they could easily make it a term of the settlement that he should not do so. If he resists the threat, and the employees strike, his right of action inintimidation is of no greater value to him than his existing right to sue for breach of contract. Indeed it would be easier for the employer to sue for the breach of contract than for damages for intimidation.8. The House of Lords rejected the defences under Section 1 and Section 3of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, advanced in answer to this claim only in thecircumstances and for the reasons outlined above. Section 1 will continue to affordprotection against an act which might otherwise be actionable on the grounds ofconspiracy to injure. Section 3 will continue to afford protection for those acting in furtherance of a trade dispute against a claim based on an act which might otherwise be actionable on the ground of inducing someone other than the plaintiffto break a contract of employment or on the ground that there has been aninterference with the trade, business or employment of some other person. In ouropinion the effect of the 1906 Act in this respect is not defeated or diminished bythe House of Lords decision.
193(8) The Trade Disputes Act, 1906, has never licensed the commission of a tortI provided it was done in combination and in furtherance of a trade dispute. It has served to exculpate acts which are lawful when done byan individual but unlawful when done in combination provided the combination was in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.This position has not been altered in any way by the decision inRookes v.

Moreover, many trade disputes are preceded bydiscussions in the course of which Union leaders ought and would wish to makethe intentions of their members clear. There is a substantial difference betweenceasing work and &quot; asking for your cards&quot;. If Union leaders announce that their members will cease work, they may be at risk of suit by third parties forintimidation; if they &quot;ask for their cards&quot;, different consequences will flowcompared to the results of present strikes. For instance, if in future strikes normallytake place after notice, continuity of employment will be broken for purposes otherthan the Contracts of Employment Act, 1963. How far the effects on superannuation,private pension schemes and similar matters are of significance we are unable to judge, but they amount to consequences which must not be ignored.7. The effect of the decision is however unlikely to provide employers withany additional legal weapons against their employees. If, for example, the employersurrenders to a threat to strike without notice unless wages are increased, he wouldnot bring an action against those very employees with whom he has come to terms and indeed they could easily make it a term of the settlement that he should not do so. If he resists the threat, and the employees strike, his right of action inintimidation is of no greater value to him than his existing right to sue for breach of contract. Indeed it would be easier for the employer to sue for the breach of contract than for damages for intimidation.8. The House of Lords rejected the defences under Section 1 and Section 3of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, advanced in answer to this claim only in thecircumstances and for the reasons outlined above. Section 1 will continue to affordprotection against an act which might otherwise be actionable on the grounds ofconspiracy to injure. Section 3 will continue to afford protection for those acting in furtherance of a trade dispute against a claim based on an act which might otherwise be actionable on the ground of inducing someone other than the plaintiffto break a contract of employment or on the ground that there has been aninterference with the trade, business or employment of some other person. In ouropinion the effect of the 1906 Act in this respect is not defeated or diminished bythe House of Lords decision.
9.   To sum up, the doctrines enshrined in this decision will apply only wherca^there is a threat to strike in breach of contract. If there is no threat or if the threat^is only to cease work after lawfully terminating contracts (even though, in the event,contracts are in fact broken but without any prior threat to act unlawfully), then there can be no action for intimidation, and the rights, liabilities and remedies atlaw of the parties will remain as hitherto.JOHN HOBSON.IAN H.

IN THE MATTER OF THE DECISIONOF THE HOUSE OF lords in THE CASE OF ROOKES v.BARNARDOPINIONofTHE   LAW   OFFICERSOF THE CROWN for england ANDSCOTLANDThe Solicitor,Ministry of Labour, S.W. 1.Ref. No. l/S.D.113/1962
CONFIDENTIAL166ANNEX 2Statement by the Minister of Labour in the House ofCommons on Thux-sday, 19th March,.,1964Recent decisions in the Courts have focused attention on thepresent state of the lav/ affecting trade unions and employers associations,  which was last reviewed nearly sixty years ago.The Government are of the opinion that the law should again be reviewed.   Such a review will be most effective if undertaken withthe willing co-operation of both employers&apos; associations and tradeunions and free from the atmosphere of political controversy,   Iunderstand that the Trades Union Congress are themselves givingconsideration to the effect of the recent judgments and they will beletting me have their views.The Government think that an enquiry such as they envisageshould be undertaken early in the life of the ne;ct Parliament.   Theywill seek the co-operation of the Trades Union Congress and theBritish Smployex*sT Confederation and will at the appropriate timediscuss with them the form and scope of the enquiry.
