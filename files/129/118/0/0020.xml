CABINETTELEVISED BROADCASTING OF THE STATE OPENING OFPARLIAMENTMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal the State Opening of Parliament was televised in 1958 and filmed in colour in1960. In 1961 the Cabinet decided (C.C. (61) 27th Conclusions, Minute 8) that noOpenings of the present Parliament should be televised, on the ground that the controversy likely to be generated by the publication of the Pilkington Report wouldmake it inappropriate to televise the occasion in 1962 and that the Opening shouldbe televised, if at all, at the beginning rather than the end of a Parliament.2. The British Broadcasting Corporation have raised the question whetherthe Opening of the first Session of the new Parliament should be televised.3. It has in the past been thought that the Opening should be televised onlyinfrequently and that there would be advantage in selecting the Opening of the first session of a Parliament for the purpose. I share these views and I suggest that,subject to The Queen&apos;s consent and the formal approval of the Lord GreatChamberlain, we should tell the B.B.C. that we agree to the Opening beingtelevised this autumn. We should no doubt secure, as on the last occasion, thatthey made their picture available to Independent Television, who have not sofar applied on this occasion for facilities on their own account.4. In 1958 the Opposition were consulted before an announcement was made and welcomed the proposal. We ought I suggest to consult them again both as acourtesy and because The Queen as well as the B.B.C. may wish to know that anyprovisional arrangements made now are likely to stand irrespective of the result ofthe Election.S.
