Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1964CP. (64) 11615th June, 1964Copy No.81CABINETBURMA WAR DAMAGE CLAIMSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at a meeting on 3rd June, 1964 (E.P. (64) 24th Meeting, Minute 1), the economic policy Committee agreed that it would be desirable to introduce legislation as early as possible in the next Session to protect the Crown against certain types ofcompensation claims. Such legislation would need to be retrospective in order tocover outstanding war damage claims arising in Burma, and it would deliberatelyoverride a recent judgment of the House of Lords. Legislation of this kind could hardly hope to escape criticism, and I was therefore asked to report the economic policy Committee&apos;s views for further consideration in Cabinet.The Burma Claims2. The claims actually lodged against the Crown, which gave rise to theimmediate problem, all stem from actions in Burma during the Japanese advanceof 1942 and relate to properties and installations destroyed by our own authoritiesin order to deny them to the Japanese. Actions against the Crown have been commenced by 12 companies, 8 of them being at present stayed, whilst 4, brought by subsidiaries of the Burmah Oil Company, have reached the House of Lords andbeen judged on a preliminary point of law affecting the admissibility of claims in common law (this procedure arises from the fact that the actions were brought inScotland and are therefore governed by Scottish Law). The effect of the House ofLords judgment is that the claims are admissible in law and it follows that, if theycan prove the facts on which the claims are based, the claimants will have anentitlement to damages.3. The 12 actions together involve claims which, with interest, would amountto over  100 million. The Burmah Oil Company actions alone involve some 31 million plus interest. There must also be many other unsatisfied claims arisingout of damage sustained in comparable circumstances in Burma but, as the eventstook place more than 22 years ago, any further proceedings would now appear tobe time-barred under both English and Scottish law.4. In lengthy test cases in Burma up to 1960, claimants failed to obtainjudgments in their favour for damage of this kind. The Burmese Government, whichhad not introduced any war damage compensation schemes at all, had in any casemade it clear from the outset that they would under no circumstances be willing tomeet claims, whatever the judgments of the Courts.5. Meanwhile, certain of the claimants had sought payments from her majesty&apos;s Government. In 1948, after discussions between the Burma Chamber ofCommerce and the then Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, it wasagreed that the claimants had a case in equity for some measure of help, althoughany sum offered would be for rehabilitation rather than compensation, and wouldbe a final figure. The offer finally made was  10 million and this ex gratia payment was distributed among the claimants involved in the present actions and otherclaimants in respect of losses in Burma during the war. Further approaches have4473
been made on two occasions, since then for additional payments by Her Majesty&apos;s^Government,&apos;in 1952 and 1956. On both occasions Her Majesty&apos;s-Government^refused to accept any remaining obligation, whatever success or failure the claimantsmight ultimately face in their actions in Burmese courts.6. In 1961, after the final failure of their claims in Burmese courts, certainCompanies brought the present actions against Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theScottish Courts. In advance of the first hearing, Cabinet considered the position.The previous view that Her Majesty&apos;s Government could accept no furtherobligation to make payments was sustained, and consideration turned on what action, if any, should be taken to dissuade the claimants from pressing their actions.It was finally agreed C.C. (62) 39th Conclusions, Minute 4 that a formal warning should be conveyed to all the claimants immediately or prospectively concerned.This was sent in a letter which incorporated the following sentences:&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government are moreover satisfied that the claim madeis not in any event one which ought to be met by the British taxpayer. her majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly decided that, in the unlikely event ofyour Company succeeding, legislation would be introduced to indemnify theCrown and its officers, servants or agents against your Company&apos;s claim.&quot;7. Despite this clear warning, which caused some adverse criticism in theScottish Press and Courts at the time, the four Burmah Oil Company subsidiariespursued their actions on an important preliminary point of law affecting theadmissibility of claims in common law. On this point the Companies were successfulat first hearing, the Crown was successful by a unanimous judgment on appeal, andthe Companies have now won in the interlocutory judgment of the House of Lordsby the majority of 3 against 2. The way is now therefore open for the companies to pursue their claims on evidence.Wider Implications8. Although the case was brought in the Scottish Courts and the decision ofthe House of Lords is strictly limited to Scottish law, nevertheless there may be far reaching implications in English law, since the House of Lords said (obiter)that English law was the same. It has always been thought that acts done by or onthe authority of the Crown in the defence of the realm fall within one of three categories: those which are lawful at common law and give no right of action to anyone affected by them; those unlawful at common law which give a right ofaction for damages to anyone affected; and those unlawful at common law butauthorised by statute, the aggrieved persons&apos; right to damages being replaced bythe statutory right to compensation in accordance with a specified procedure.9. It now appears that some of the acts lawful at common law may give to persons affected a right to &quot; compensation &quot; which is in principle indistinguishablefrom the right to damages in respect of unlawful acts. This concept is wholly novelin the law of England. There would not appear to be in principle any justification for it; and its ambit has been left vague by the recent decision, which draws no clear line of distinction between those lawful acts which do, and those which donot, give to persons affected by them a right to compensation.Proposed Legislation10. After considering the situation created by this judgment, the economic policy Committee concluded that legislation should be introduced to deal both with the Burma claims and with the possible wider implications in respect of actions for compensation against the Crown. It was agreed that with regard tothe Burma claims, there would be no justification at this stage in time, over20 years after the events in question, and after repeated warnings that the claimantscould expect no further payment beyond their share of the  10 million awardedin 1948, for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to make further payments at the expenseof the taxpayer. Indeed, in view of the clear statements already made on behalf ofthe Government, and the very large amounts involved, the Government mightwell be criticised if they changed their minds and decided to pay the compensation claims. Nevertheless, the giving of retrospective effect to legislation of this kind would be open to the general objections against the principle of legislatingretrospectively.
11. With regard to the wider implications of the recent House of Lordsjudgment, we cannot foresee what claims against the Crown might arise inconsequence. It would certainly seem to be desirable, however, to clarify theposition, and prudent to enact general legislation how, rather than await the courseof events and perhaps face the need for retrospective legislation on some futureoccasion to avoid an intolerable claim.12. Until legislation is introduced, litigation may be expected to proceed without interruption. The full process will be lengthy, certainly occupying12 to 18 months, but the early stages might well involve a great deal of work and expense, both for the claimants in preparing their case, and for the treasury solicitor and others in preparing the defence. It is clearly desirable to avoid this,and if legislation is to be introduced, then it should be introduced as soon aspossible.Conclusion13. The final judgment so far has gone against the Crown by a fine margin,and some legal opinion in England is likely to see greater merit in the minorityjudgment. There must, however, be criticism of legislation which is at onceretrospective in effect and deliberately over-riding a judgment of the courts.14. At the same time, the considerations in favour of legislation, outlined above, are powerful and such as must be appreciated by potential critics. TheEconomic Policy Committee concluded that these considerations require and justifylegislation in spite of likely criticism, and I invite my colleagues to endorse this conclusion.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,15th June, 1964.
