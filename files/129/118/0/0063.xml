Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1964.CP. (64) 163 Copy No.   Pj *]1st September, 1964CABINETCOMMERCIAL POLICY: JUTEPROPOSED CHANGES IN PROTECTD7E ARRANGEMENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional development and President of the Board of TradeI have to-day announced certain changes in the arrangements for importedjute goods. The purpose of this memorandum is to give my colleagues the background to the announcement and an outline of the purpose and scope of the changes.background. The jute industry is protected against Asian Commonwealth imports inthe interest of employment in Dundee and district, and there are consequentialcontrols on imports from other countries. This is done by State trading, as a wayof enhancing the prices of Indian and Pakistani jute goods by the addition ofmark-ups in effect disguised tariffs of varying levels. There was a discussion in cabinet on 1st August last year (C.C. (63) 51st Conclusions, Item 9) about my predecessor^ plan for unfreezing the very rigid and complicated arrangements which then existed. He was authorised to implement some of the proposalsforthwith, but it was decided to defer for a year the proposal to replace sellingcertain jute goods at Dundee price levels by a fixed, reducing mark-up (startingat 50 per cent). During that time an inquiry was to be held at the request of theindustry to consider alternatives which, it claimed, might meet the Governmentsaims more scientifically, while leaving the industry with more confidence in its future. If the inquiry did not produce a useful result, the Board of Trade were authorised to go ahead with the proposal for a fixed mark-up at 45 per cent, thepoint it would have reached if there had been no postponement.3. A Working Group under Board of Trade chairmanship and composedof representatives of both sides of industry, of merchants, of the Board of Tradeand the Scottish Development Department was appointed to conduct this inquiry and it has now reported. Members worked well together and I am glad to say thebasis of a sensible alternative emerged.Government proposals in 19634. Under the Governments proposals of last summer, competing imports would have fallen into two main categories goods of particular importance toIndia and Pakistan, which were to have a mark-up of 10 per cent, and other goods,which were to have the reducing fixed mark-up starting at 50 per cent.The industry&apos;s alternative proposal5. The alternative proposed by the industry split imports into three categoriesin place of the proposed twoO; enabling:(a) the range of cloths marked up by 10 per cent since last year (a restrictedrange of standard bag-making cloths) to be widened and the mark-upeliminated; in consequence, the goods would be returned to private trade;0) With consequential revised arrangements for bags; the current arrangements for yarn would remain unchanged.4749
(b) cloth close to this restricted range in weight and width to have protectionon a reducing level something like that proposed last year;(c) other cloths to have a fixed mark-up at a level something like that proposedlast year. British production of similar cloths accounts for well over half of Dundee&apos;s production.6. With reference to paragraph 5 (b) above, the industry argued that the mark-up should consist of a fixed element of 35 per cent plus a 10 per cent&quot; variable &quot;, the variable element representing the &quot; gap &quot; between the prices ofraw jute and of imported jute goods at a selected base date. The reason why theindustry sought a variable is that raw jute and jute goods prices can move indifferent directions or, if in the same direction, at different rates; the adjustment to the basic 10 per cent to take account of these movements would be madeaccording to a complicated formula.Changes now introduced7. Officials have made it clear in the Working Group that such variableelements are very unattractive to the Government (for reasons both of policy and administration). I have already refused to entertain a somewhat similar proposal from the cotton industry; and I should have preferred to have insisted on theprinciple of a fixed mark-up. However, the market has, after a long period of stability, become very unsettled just at this moment of time. Serious floods in pakistan have produced a rise in raw jute prices and widened the gap on whichthe industry&apos;s claim for a variable mark-up is based. In these circumstances,outright rejection of the industry&apos;s &quot; variable &quot; idea could have created serious difficulties for us. Therefore while I thought it important to make it clear both to the industry and to the Asian Commonwealth countries that we do not acceptthe principle of a variable mark-up as an enduring policy, I have accepted theindustry&apos;s starting point of 35 per cent &quot;fixed&quot; and 10 per cent &quot;variable&quot; forthe category of goods at present sold at Dundee price levels but I intend to reducethe variable element (rather than, as the industry suggested, the fixed element)by one-quarter each year and to review the situation in 1967; this will be presented as a way of easing the transition to a fixed mark-up from the present system ofequating the selling price to current Dundee prices and not as an acceptance ofthe principle of a variable element. For the category (c) goods where the industrysuggested &quot; permanent &quot; protection I am giving protection by a fixed mark-upof 45 per cent and will leave it undisturbed pending the review in 1967.8. The categorisation the industry have proposed was worth accepting. Sofar as India and Pakistan are concerned, it widens the range of goods of mostinterest to them, removes all protection on such goods and returns them to private trade (something to which India attaches great importance); and makes a startin reducing the level of protection on the goods of next most importance to them.As regards Dundee, the retention of the highest protection in category (c) helpsthe jute industry precisely where it considers it is likely to be most viable and competitive in the long term.Conditions favour change9. My colleagues will wish to be assured that the commercial, local and international conditions were still conducive to change. This was so:(i) There is reason to believe that many in the industry will secretly welcome an end to the uncertainties which have now lasted so long;(ii) Business in the jute industry is healthy;(hi) The jute industry is having difficulty in getting all the labour it requires;(iv) There are a substantial number of jobs in the pipeline for other industries;unemployment in Dundee is the lowest for months. (The July figure is rather higher than the June one, because school leavers wereregistering, but otherwise unemployment is at its lowest since March1956).(v) The general economic climate is good; Scotland has not been left out;(vi) Despite its comparative health, Dundee remains on the list of development districts;
(vii) Dundee is to have an advance factory;(viii) The easing of restrictions on imports of jute goods from India and pakistan, particularly the widening of the range receiving the lowestprotection and the elimination of protection, is presentationallyimportant, vis-a-vis United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment where Britain has played a leading role;(ix) As regards third countries it would free some goods at present on quotafrom Europe (including European Free Trade Association where thereare distant rumblings about our position);(x) It would ease our position at the first meeting of a Food and agriculture organisation Study Group on Jute in mid-September.Timing&apos; Immediate10. I discussed the outcome of the Working Group, and my proposal to implement the alternative rather than the Governments proposals of last year,with the Secretary of State for Scotland and he was in general agreement with methat the Working Group had tried fairly to balance the need both to take accountof our international obligations and at the same time to have regard to the interestof employment in Dundee and district. He considered, as I did, that changes shouldbe made without delay.E. H.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,1st September, 1964.
