DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1964CP. (64) 161 Copy No.    6 110th August, 1964CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1964-65Note by the Prime minister when the Cabinet considered on 23rd July (CM. (64) 41st Conclusions,Minute 7) the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament, ministers responsible for preparing legislation for the new Session were invited to arrangeas a matter of urgency that work on draft Bills proceeded as rapidly as possible.I know that the large amount of legislation which we have passed in the present session has involved Departments and the Parliamentary Counsel in a considerableeffort and has to some extent delayed the initiation of work on next Session&apos;s Bills.It is the more important to ensure, therefore, that there is no loss of impetus duringthe next two months and that we can rely on the Bills which we shall need tointroduce in the early weeks of the new Parliament being available in time.I shall be grateful, therefore, if Ministers responsible for the Bills which we intend to introduce next Session will satisfy themselves that high priority is givento the work of preparing them.A. D.-H.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,7th August, 1964.CONFIDENTIAL
