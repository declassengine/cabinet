THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1964CP. (64) 164 Copy No.    622nd September, 1964CABINETAN ANGLO-AMERICAN BALANCE SHEETMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues may be interested to see the paper attached &quot; An Anglo-American Balance Sheet &quot; which was prepared in the Foreign Office to assess theextent to which each of the two countries needed the help and support of the other and thereby to correct any misapprehensions which might exist about the real extentof our influence and openings for leverage on the United States.2. The paper has been written on the assumption that President Johnson willbe returned at the forthcoming election. A Gold water victory could haveconsequences that would require us to examine the Anglo-American relationshipab initio. They are not therefore covered here.3. The paper takes the view that any systematic attempt to spend suchbargaining counters as we hold, or, like the French, to pursue independent policies for their own sake, would undermine the basis of the relationship and do greatdamage to the national interest.4. The various items on the balance sheet are of course essentially ephemeralbut they give an impression of the main factors in our relationship with the UnitedStates which may be of value to those whose Departments directly deal with them.R. A. B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,1st September, 1964.4752A
AN ANGLO-AMERICAN BALANCE SHEETOur alliance with the United States is the most important single factor inour foreign policy. The long association between the two countries and theirshared or complementary interests in all parts of the world have meant that,other things being equal, each has come to accept the support of the other in its international dealings. The degree of support thus given is based more on ageneral assesment of the benefits each derives from co-operation than oncalculations of precise national advantage in each case.2. It is sometimes suggested that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would get more out of the Anglo-American relationship if they behaved from time to timelike General de Gaulle. Apart from the fact that General de Gaulle has so farobtained little if anything from the Americans as a result of his attitude towards them, the position of France in the world is fundamentally different from ourown. Unlike us the French have few remaining world-wide commitments and responsibilities, and they are not in the last resort dependent on their overseastrade. For good or ill they have therefore greater freedom of manoeuvre. Thestock-taking that follows shows clearly enough that any attempt on our part toemulate them would do us far more harm than good.3. The disparities of power and wealth between the United States and Britain rule out any exact balance sheet of national advantage: each wantsdifferent things of the other. In general the Americans want our support for the policies which they as leaders of the Western world judge right for the West asa whole. We provide a useful European check on their own policies and fromtime to time act as a vehicle for them. In some circumstances we are able forhistorical reasons to play a part which they cannot. Moreover, they look to us as their major partner and as a Power with world-wide interests for practicalco-operation in a wide variety of fields, from the development of joint defence facilities to the conduct of economic policy. They particularly value theirintelligence relationship with us, and ability freely to exchange views on all worldproblems. We may not always agree with their judgments of what is in theWestern interest and may see the hand of domestic political pressures and interests. We may also think that, as has so often happened in the past, theirtiming is sometimes wrong. Rightly or wrongly the Americans tend to convincethemselves that their policies have a moral validity of their own and thus deserveour support: this limits their sense of gratitude when such support is given.4. We on the other hand largely seek American support in dealing with our colonial or post-colonial problems or in protecting certain of our overseas assets,such as oil. Here the Americans tend to see imperial policies in a new guise.When these demonstrably serve a Western interest they will usually support them.But when they appear to cut across American (or what the Americans regard asWestern) policies in the developing world, they are reluctant to help us. indeed they may only be brought to do so if they need our support elsewhere or as aresult of diplomatic pressure, as for example in Malaysia or South Arabia. SomeAmericans may think we too give a moral quality to our policies; but we are more often accused of being unreasonable than self-righteous.5. We also need American support for our policies in and towards western europe, NATO, O.E.C.D., GATT and so on. The United States commitment tothe defence of Europe and to liberal trading policies within the free world economic system are national interests which are no less vital to us because theyare shared by our other allies. In these fields, although there are differences of approach, particularly in the military field and that of East-West trade, the objectives of the two countries are closely matched.6. The following is a fist of the main circumstances in which we needAmerican help and the Americans need ours. It points up the fundamentaldisparity of power between the two countries. It is not intended to be exhaustiveand covers only those subjects with a high political content. It does not includethe numerous occasions on which both countries need the help of the other inapproximately equal measure. In so far as it refers to the future, it is composedon the assumption that President Johnson will be returned at the forthcomingelection.
Where we need American support7. (a) MalaysiaWe seek greater American support to help persuade PresidentSukarno to cali off confrontation. The Americans are reluctant to give this for fear of pushing Sukarno (or his successor if Sukarno isoverthrown) into one or other of the Communist orbits, and arebasically more interested in the future of Indonesia (with 100 millioninhabitants) than of Malaysia (with 10 million). Although, therefore,they will work hard to preserve the peace, and in the last resortwould become militarily involved under the ANZUS Treaty, they willcontinue to be reluctant to bring as much pressure as we should likeon the Indonesians in favour of a settlement.(b) Indian OceanWe would like the Americans to play a greater part inunderpinning the defence of the Indian sub-continent, the middle east and East Africa. We also hope that by associating them with our proposed new alternative line of communication across the indian ocean we shall be better able to establish and defend it ourselves.The Americans have an interest of their own in this: while they recognise and to some extent depend on our influence in the Indiansub-continent and East Africa, they probably believe that we areno longer able, even if we so wished, to discharge our traditional role in the area. To this extent the interest is mutual.(c) Middle East and oil from time to time we need to remind the Americans that our military presence in the Middle East and special links with the persian gulf States serve Western as well as purely British interests. Tosubstantiate this we point to the need to maintain the stability in the. area, and the increasing dependence of Western Europe on middle east oil supplies. The Americans have some sympathy with the stabilityargument and guardedly support our retention of the Aden base. Butthey are sceptical both about our present methods of securing our oil supplies on satisfactory terms to us and the argument that what we are doing is the best way of safeguarding the Western interest. In the event ofany breakdown of Middle East oil supplies, we should of course bevery dependent on the Americans for alternative sources of supply.(d) South Arabia and the UARWe should like the Americans to bring greater pressure to bear upon President Nasser to moderate his campaign against our positionin the Middle East and in particular to curb Yemeni subversion inSouth Arabia. Though the Americans are far from happy aboutPresident Nasser&apos;s policy towards the West at large, they think thatsome of our troubles are of our own making and that we shall soonhave to come to terms with Nasser and the Republican regime in the yemen. They are not prepared to be too closely associated with ouractivities in the area and in particular our connexion with reactionaryArab regimes.(e) South Africa and apartheidWe need continued American support for our opposition tosanctions against South Africa. The Americans do not like sanctionsany more than we do but believe that political pressures world-widerequire them to take a fairly strong line against South Africa.(/) Southern Rhodesia and other colonial problemsOur principal remaining colonial embarrassment is SouthernRhodesia. We need American support in the United Nations to help us withstand anti-colonialist attacks which make more difficult asettlement of this and other remaining colonial problems. For the sake of their general position with the Afro-Asian majority, the americans will be reluctant to stick their necks out very far in our support.SECRET4752 a 2
(g) CyprusWe share with the Americans an interest in any Cyprus settlementthat will meet the views of Cypriots, Greeks and Turks. They agreewith us in regarding this as a matter of vital concern to NATO&apos;seastern frontier particularly in view of the possibility of Sovietinvolvement. But they may not always be as conscious as we are of theimportance of the sovereign base areas, though they recognise their value to the Western position in general. We for our part shall badlyneed American support both on the spot and in the United Nationsif we are to retain the sovereign base areas against pressure.(h) MaltaWe want the Americans to accept our views of the desirability of keeping the NATO headquarters in Malta after independence.(/) EuropeWe need continued American support for our policy towardsWestern Europe, and in particular the European Economic Community.So long as we maintain our policy of trying to &quot; get into Europe &quot;American support (assuming the return of President Johnson) is likelyto continue. If we changed our policy towards Europe or stayed outof the Multilateral Force we should have great difficulties with the americans at a time when we particularly needed their help.(/&apos;) Nuclear weaponsFor the future of our independent nuclear deterrent, we are dependent on the Americans to provide the Polaris weapons systempromised under the Nassau Agreement. We likewise need the special arrangements for the supply of nuclear information and fissile material to continue. Although the present Administration have not sought to change their nuclear relationship with Britain, there are many opponentsin America of our independent deterrent and we cannot rely on thisrelationship continuing indefinitely. In particular, a British decision not to join the Multilateral Force would be bound to jeopardise it. Atall events, we are beholden to the Americans for its continuance.(k) Interdependence in arms productionWe wish the Americans to play a genuine and practical part ininterdependence of arms production within the Western Alliance andin bilateral collaboration with us. The failure of our efforts so far hascost us dear, and, unless some European consortium proves possible,may cost us dearer in the future. The Americans pay lip service to theidea of interdependence but have done and are likely to do verylittle about it. So long as this continues individual European countries are likely to be subjected to increasing pressure to buy Americanweapons and equipment on terms with which we cannot compete.We are of course pretty dependent on the Americans ourselves both for know-how and for equipment of all kinds.Where the Americans need our support8-(a) East I West relations the main responsibility on the Western side for the conduct of east /West relations on such issues as European security and the futureof Germany lies with the Americans. In general we concur with their policies, and so long as these continue, the Americans need our support,in the first instance in the Ambassadorial Group and in the second withthe Russians, more than we need theirs.(b) DisarmamentThe same is broadly true with disarmament and nuclear testing.Although we do occasionally take initiatives of our own and like toparticipate in any decisions that may be taken, real progress is in thelast resort dependent on the Russians and the Americans. Our supportis, however, of great value to the Americans at all stages of negotiations.
(c) Multilateral force the Americans want us to join the Multilateral Force and have over the past 18 months applied a great deal of pressure to make us doso. We agree with the objectives of American policy but are still doubtful if the present plan for a Multilateral Force represents the best way of achieving them. We are not however in a very strong position and itcould be argued that we need American help as much as they need ours.Now that they seem to have taken the decision to proceed with the Forceif necessary without us, we are in particular trying to persuade them notto go ahead too fast and to take account of the various modificationsand suggestions for widening the scope of the Force which we have putforward. If eventually we decide not to join, and the Force neverthelesscomes into being, our influence with the Americans will certainly decline.(d) East! West tradeIn accordance with their general philosophy on East/West trade,the Americans would like us to give political considerations greaterweight in trade with the Communist Powers. They object in particular to the grant of long-term credits which might contribute to Communisteconomic strength. We on the contrary believe that trade (with credits to support it) is in general good for all who participate in it and helpsin the long run to break down barriers between East and West. This isa political issue in both countries and neither has much room for manoeuvre.(e) CubaThe Americans particularly object to our trade with Cuba whichthey believe helps to fortify the Castro regime, and counters their own policy of isolating Cuba and deterring other Latin American countries from following her example. The subject is emotionally charged.Although we have gone some way to meet the Americans, we do not agree with their assessment and decline to place Cuba in a different category from the other Communist countries for the purpose of trade.(/) china the Americans feel similarly about our trade with China which they believe increases Chinese power for harm. Otherwise they find ourrepresentation in Peking of use to them. Through it they get an ideaof developments in China and have a line to the Chinese Government.They were for example grateful to us for helping by these means to getAmerican pilots released by North Korea.(g) South-East AsiaThe Americans need our support for their policies in South-east asia, and in particular towards South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.Although our own national interest in the area is small, we recognise its importance both to the United States and to the West as a whole.Moreover, as has been seen above, we need their support for Malaysia.In these circumstances, whatever our doubts about some aspects of american policy we have closely co-ordinated our own policy withtheirs and generally support them. This has led to some decline in ourreputation for impartiality and thus of our general influence in the area,not least on the Americans themselves.(h) SEATOThe Americans are anxious not to appear as the only Western power in the area (apart from Australia and New Zealand) and thusparticularly value our support for SEATO. For this and other reasonsthey support our determination to stay in Singapore. Mr. McNamaraonce said that a thousand British troops east of Suez were of more value than in Europe.(/) Latin america the Americans need more European and thus British help in latin america. In this way some of the old links between Europe and Latin
America could be restored and &quot; anti-Yankee &quot; feeling mitigated.Although their preference would be for European participation in the alliance for Progress, they profess to welcome virtually any sign of increased European interest in the area. We think that a co-ordinatedEuropean approach is desirable but this has so far been frustrated bythe French. Meanwhile we are making a modest increase in our effort.(/) British GuianaThe Americans wish us to ensure that British Guiana does not become another Cuba on the mainland of America and to delayindependence so long as a Cuba-type regime remains a seriouspossibility. We have no wish to stay in British Guiana any longer than isnecessary and regard it as a drain on our military and financial resources.(k) Defence facilities the Americans need our help in providing facilities in Britain andBritish colonial territories for defence establishments in various partsof the world. In Britain, Holy Loch, the USAAF bases and the NavalCommunications station at Londonderry are examples. Overseasexamples are Wideawake airfield and other establishments on ascension island and numerous facilities in the West Indies. Our control over realestate of this kind throughout the world has been and still is ofundoubted advantage to the Americans.9. The foregoing list, incomplete as it is, is enough to show that, although there are circumstances and cases where the Americans are glad to have our support,there are more where we positively need theirs. The fact of this disparity in ourmutual requirements does not of course mean that we are automatically precluded from exercising any sort of leverage on them. But we are not particularly good atdiplomatic arm-twisting, which, although it may bring short-term advantage, tends to do more harm than good to the interests of a country as dependent on international goodwill as our own. Thus if we did try to exert leverage on the americans, we should be ill-advised to do anything which might suggest that wewere after a series of bargains with them, in which like and unlike were weighed against each other. In such a deal we could not fail to be the losers. Moreover, theGovernments responsibility to Parliament and public opinion and our traditionaldislike of devious diplomacy would make it difficult for us to pretend to, or worsepursue, policies in which we did not believe for the sake of exerting pressure on our allies. Our reputation with the Americans and the general influence we exert on american policy as a whole springs not only from similar or complementary interestsbut from their belief in our relative objectivity in international affairs and our readiness to judge problems on their own merits.10. Subject to these very powerful limitations which arise from the essentialcharacter of our relationship with the United States, it is worth assessing to what extent some sort of leverage can be exerted. There are two main sets of circumstances in which this might be done:(a) Where we can take a slightly more independent line without damage to our own interests, as possibly in our policy in Indo-China or in thefield of disarmament. This does not mean that we should gratuitouslyadopt a different policy from the Americans or make unnecessarydifficulties for them: but rather that we should do what we think right for us both in particular circumstances with less regard for theAmerican point of view if this strikes us as misconceived (as for exampleat theUNCTAD);(b) Where we can take a more accommodating line. This could in due course follow the adoption of the harder line referred to above, orinvolve some sacrifice of national interest for the greater good of anglo-American relations. We could, for example, make some minorconcessions over trade with Cuba or China, without in fact damagingour general position on East-West trade.11. We could also discuss frankly with the Americans a better co-ordinationof our policies world-wide and take in some of each other&apos;s dirty washing. assuming the return of President Johnson, the more we put into the Anglo-American Alliance,
the more we shall get out of it. If, for example, we undertook to give more aid andtechnical assistance to Latin America, the Americans might be persuaded to do more in other parts of the world, such as Africa south of the Sahara, where we stillcarry the major responsibility and get little credit for it. We might likewise make a renewed attempt to work out with them a joint policy on overseas bases and where appropriate establish joint defence facilities. There are also perhaps one or twocircumstances in which straight bargains would not be inappropriate.Conclusion12. But in sum the conclusion of this paper can only be that bargaining is notthe way to operate the Anglo-American relationship. As much the weaker partner,dependent on overseas trade and with world-wide responsibilities, we find american support for our overseas policies virtually indispensable, while they find our support for theirs useful and sometimes valuable. Thus any systematic attempt to exploitsuch bargaining counters as we hold or, like the French to pursue independentpolicies for their own sake, would undermine the basis of the relationship and dogreat damage to the national interest.Foreign Office, S.W.
