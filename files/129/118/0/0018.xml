CABINETEARNINGS-RELATED SHORT-TERM benefits memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Pensions and National Insurance Committee discussed on 11th June(I.N.P. (64) 6th Meeting, Minute 2) whether we should extend the principle ofrelating benefit to earnings to the short-term benefits of the national insurancescheme and, if so, whether we should publish the proposals in a White Paper (adraft of which as circulated to the Committee is attached). The majority of theCommittee are in favour of doing both these things and I am, as Chairman,circulating this paper setting out the arguments. A minority of the Committee,consisting of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and myself, take a different view and we shall be circulating a separate paper.2. We should bear in mind the background to our considerations. N.E.D.C.in their report&quot; Conditions Favourable to Faster Growth &quot; nearly eighteen months ago referred to the advantages of earnings-related unemployment benefit and suggested that there was much to be said for a comprehensive earnings-relatedscheme. The question of financial provision for redundancy was considered last summer by the Minister of Labour&apos;s National Joint Advisory Council. Both theBritish Employers&apos; Confederation (B.E.C.) and the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.)came out in favour of earnings-related unemployment benefit. In subsequentdiscussion both bodies have reiterated their support for this development. TheT.U.C. has said that earnings-relation should be extended to sickness benefit. Therehas been a series of detailed discussions at official level which have shown that ascheme is workable. There have been reports and discussions in the Press whichhave built up an expectation of Government action. We cannot defer making some statement of our views for much longer and it will not be easy in the present climateof opinion to say that we have decided to do nothing.3. There is a growing feeling that the Beveridge concept of flat-rate minimumbenefits for all is out-moded. The rapid growth of earnings in recent years make sit possible for the ordinary worker to pay more for better financial protection.Although proportionately the rise in benefits has more than kept pace with the risein earnings, the absolute difference between standard benefits and average earningshas been widening considerably, so that the drop in income for the worker who loseshis job or falls sick is serious. Prosperity has encouraged people to take on continuingcommitments of various kinds. The onset of unemployment or sickness and the sudden drop from average earnings of  16 a week or so to  3 7s. 6d. a week for asingle person and  5 9s. for a married man can cause real difficulties which we oughtto mitigate. People no longer consider hardship in absolute terms; they assess itrelatively to earnings and commitments, and argue that provision against the cessation of earnings should be related to those earnings. We took a first step in thisdirection with the introduction of the graduated pensions scheme in 1961. that scheme is now well-established and it would seem a wholly natural and sensibledevelopment, in tune with modern thinking, that we should take the next step and extend earnings-relation to the short-term benefits. Many overseas countries havealready adopted it.4475Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1964CP. (64) 118 Copy No. 8 416th June, 1964
4. There are powerful special reasons why unemployment benefit should be related to earnings. They are:(1) We cannot have modernisation and faster economic growth without anincrease in movement of workers not only within industries but fromone industry to another. Earnings-related unemployment benefit is a necessary reinforcement of our other measures to deal with growth and its consequences, such as our training and re-training programme and regional development policies.(2) Unless the worker can have reasonable protection against a sharp fall in income in these circumstances, he will resist strongly and will opposeevery change that threatens jobs. Restrictive practices will continueto flourish.(3) Equally, employers will be less reluctant to discharge redundant employeesif better financial provision is made for them through the national insurance scheme. Overmanning is serious and may be widespread,and anything that will assist employers to eliminate it is of crucial importance.(4) It will improve the atmosphere of industrial relations. This again will help to secure workers&apos; co-operation in raising productivity.(5) High unemployment benefit will act automatically as an anti-cyclicalmeasure, helping to sustain purchasing power in those areas, and atthose times, where this is desirable to encourage employment.5. These economic arguments do not apply to sickness benefit, but thefinancial needs of many sick people are no less than those of the unemployed.The case on both economic and social grounds for introducing earnings-related short-term benefits and providing more adequate protection against a sudden fallin income in unemployment and sickness seems to be a compelling one.6. If we improve the provision for the early months of unemployment and sickness, we should similarly improve the provision for the early months ofwidowhood. Improvements in parallel on all three fronts would mean a sensibleand attractive advance in our social provision.Publication of a White Paper7. If the Cabinet decide, as the majority of the Committee recommend,in favour of this extension of earnings-related benefits, we must also decide whether we should publish our proposals in a White Paper. The majority view in theCommittee is that we should. The Ministers who take this view argue as follows.There has been considerable interest in, and publicity for, our consultations withthe B.E.C. and T.U.C. These have been going on in one form or another for thebest part of a year and we should be subject to criticism if we could not showthat we had carefully worked out the essentials of our proposals. A White paper would be the natural way to do this, and can be expected to be widely welcomed.Pressure for too early legislation would have to be resisted, but this could be doneon the grounds that there were still important details to be worked out and discussed with interested parties. Early publication might involve some embarrasment with the B.E.C. and the T.U.C., since our consultations withthem are still continuing. But this is not thought to be serious. Thus, if the cabinet decide in favour of the scheme recommended by the majority of the Committee,it would also be the strongly-held view of the majority that the scheme should bepublished in a White Paper before the Recess.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.L15th June, 1964.
appendix draft     WHITE     PAPERFurther development of the National Insurance SchemeShort-term &quot;benefits related to earningsIntroduction1 o     &quot;Provision for Old Age - the Future Development of the National InsuranceScheme&quot; (Cmnd. 538) was*issued in October 1958-   It contained the Government&apos;views on the future development of national insurance retirement pensionprovisions.   The Government then decided that the existing flat-rate system should he preserved as the basic provision for old age hut that its limitationsin meeting the developing needs of the community in an expanding economy pointed to the need for a supplementary system of graduated contributions and retirement pensions rexa ted to earnings.    The Government therefore put forward proposals tothis effect and these were later embodied in the National Insurance Act   1959-2.     This was a major new development for national insurance in this country.The national insurance scheme had hitherto been based on the principle of universal compulsory insurance giving flat-rate benefits at standard rates forall the contingencies covered in return for flat-rate contributions. The graduated pensions scheme introduced a new principle by relating contributions and benefits to individual earnings.   New methods of assessing,, calculating and recordingcontributions had to be devised.3-     The inauguration of the new scheme posed many problems for employers and theGovernment Departments concerned.    It was nevertheless launched successfully inApril 1961 and has run smoothly since then.   With this important new development in national insurance now firmly established in the pensions field, theGovernment has been considering whether an element of earnings-relation should beintroduced into the present provisions for unemployment and sickness and, if so,how this might best Tse done.   Such a development would be natural, but the patternset for pensions would need considerable modifications before it could be appliedto the quite different contingencies of unemployment and sickness. Recentdiscussion of these problems has been given an impetus by the search for better provision for transitional unemployment in conditions of rapid technologicalchange.   The Government welcomes the interest shown in this topic. In order tohelp further discussion, it has decided to set out its views on the main considerations involved (Part I) and its proposals for a system of graduatedsupplements to unemployment benefit, sickness benefit and widows allowance(Part II).PART   IThe considerations involved in extending graduation to unemployment and sickness benefits the present provisionsThe national scheme.     9he national insurance scheme provides a uniform, flat-rate benefit to1.
2.compensate for loss of earnings during unemployment or sickness., The value ofthis benefit has been substantially increased in real terms since it was introduced.   The rate of &quot;benefit is now  3 7s- 6d. a week for a single man and 5 9s- a week for a married couple.   To this are added payments for children.One of the features of the present arrangements is the substantial weight givento family responsibilities.   A married couple with two children thus receive 7 Is. a week5 excluding family allowances5 with four children  8 5s* a week,excluding family allowances.    Unemployment and sickness benefits are not subjectto income tax and those receiving them are not liable for national insurance contributions.   For men with families and with wages below averagethe present benefits already amount to a substantial proportion of their take-home pay.    But people with high earnings and with no or few dependants can suffera substantial drop in income if they lose their jobs or fall sick.Employers&apos; schemes5&quot;     National insurance benefits are often supplemented by payments underemployers&apos; schemes.   Payments to employees who have become redundant are usuallylump sums related to length of service; their main purpose is to give recognitionfor long service and some compensation for the disturbance and uncertainty whichthe loss of employment entails.    It is estimated that about 4^ million workers(including If- million in the nationalised industries) are covered by schemes which include severance payments.   Many other employers make severance paymentseven though they do not have a formal scheme.    Except for the nationalised industries, however, employers&apos; arrangements rarely include provision for continued weekly payments while the worker is unemployed.    It is here that national insurance must play a predominant part.6.     Employers&apos; sick pay schemes, on the other hand, cover a large proportion ofthe employed population, particularly during the early weeks of sickness. an enquiry into the incidence of incapacity for work has provided detailed information about the extent and nature of such schemes.    In view of its importance this information [has been published] [will shortly be published]as a separate report.    It shows that in 1961 56.6 per cent of male employees and 59&quot;5 per cent of female employees insured for sickness benefit were coveredby employers&quot; sick pay arrangements.   There are wide variations in the extent ofcover in different occupations and industries.   The nature of the cover providedalso varies considerably.   The amounts range from full pay (or full pay lessnational insurance benefit) down to quite small sums; and the duration of payment may be long or short.   The Government attaches great importanceto the part that employers&apos; sick pay schemes can play, and a Committeeof the Minister of Labour&apos;s National Joint Advisory Council was appointed
last autumn to study information about employers&apos; sick pay arrangements and to consider the expansion and improvement of these arrangements by^voluntary means.   This Committee&apos;s report will shortly he considered bythe National Joint Advisory Council.Private insurance7&quot;   The Government recognises the valuable part heing played by individualvoluntary insurance against sickness, either through the friendly societymovement or through private insurance companies, and believes there will always be a place for supplementary provision of this sort.The need for graduated benefits80   The principle embodied in the graduated pension scheme is that retirement pensions should be more closely related to individual earnings and so help to reflect the standard of living the worker has attained in his working life.By the same token it may be argued that the worker on higher wages who can afford to pay higher contributions than are practicable under the flat-ratescheme   should be able to receive a rate of benefit more in keeping withhis normal standard of living when his earnings are temporarily interrupted by sickness or unemployment..   Workers today generally enjoy higher wages than ever before.   Many are buying their homes and have taken on other continuingcommitments.   A sudden illness Or loss of a job frequently causes a substantiadrop in income which makes things difficult for the worker until such time ashe can get hack to work.   The Government considers that, with increasingprosperity, the principle of relating national insurance benefits to earningsshould be extended to short-term benefits.Unemployment benefit9*     Although unemployment benefit and sickness benefit exist to serve thesame social purpose and are closely linked at present7 interest has been concentrated recently on the extension of earnings-relation to unemploymentbenefit.   If we are to sustain a high rate of economic expansion and to achieve a modernised and competitive economy, we must be ready to redeployresources to meet technological change and changes in demand for ourproducts.    We must expect greater movement of workpeople not only withinindustries but from one industry to another.    But the interests of workersmust be safeguarded.   Unless this is done, resistance to change and tomobility may act as a brake on the whole process.   The Government is meetingthe situation in a number of ways - by encouraging and helping industryto plan its manpower requirements ahead so that unnecessary redundanciescan he avoided and to make plans in advance to deal with possibleredundancies in consultation with representatives of the workers who may beaffected? by greatly expanding the facilities for re-training redundantworkers5 and by legislation which has prescribed minimum rights to noticebefore employment is terminated.    But it is also important to make reasonablefinancial provision for those who lose their jobs.3.
10.     Provision for redundancy has been considered by the National joint advisory Council of the Minister of Labour.   A special sub-committee agreedthat there were two main problems - the alleviation of hardship if redundancyis followed by unemployment and compensation to a redundant worker for theloss of a job after long service.   In the Government&apos;s view, earnings-related unemployment benefit would relieve the financial hardship for those who cannotfind a new job immediately and would thereby help to romove the fear of redundancy.In recent years there has been a considerable extension of arrangements for compensating redundant workers through severance payments by employers.   TheGovernment has encouraged this and attaches great importance to the further development of such arrangements.Sickness benefit11.     These special arguments in favour of earnings-related unemployment bene-fit have no relevance to sickness benefit, but the financial needs of manysick people are no less than those of the unemployed.   A substantial proportionof them are not covered by any employer&apos;s sick pay scheme 5 some of those whoare covered can only benefit after a period of qualifying service,and otherscan expect only small amounts for short periods.   In some occupations, illnesslasting for more than a short time may mean the loss of a job.   Workers inthese occupations and those who fall sick after losing their jobs suffer the double misfortune of being out of a job as well as sick.12.     The Government has therefore decided that the strong social reasons for extending graduation to sickness benefit as well as to unemployment benefit should be recognised and that there should be graduated supplements to bothbenefits, payable for a limited period, related to the claimant&apos;s previousearnings.   In this way the worker who loses his job or is ill can be givenadditional protection against too severe a drop in income.   The same need doesnot however arise with short spells off work and it is not therefore proposedto pay graduated supplements to workers on short time or during the early stages of a spell of unemployment or sickness.   There are compelling reasons,explained later in paragraph 22,why the initial period for which no supplementwould be paid with sickness benefit must be longer than with unemploymentbenefit.Widow&apos;s allowance13-     A similar need for additional protection against a sudden drop in incomearises during the early months of widowhood.   This is the purpose of thepresent widow&apos;s allowance, which is paid to widows for the first thirteen ?;eeksafter their husbanddeath   at a level higher than the standard rate of otherflat-rate benefits.   The Government&apos;s policy has always been to give preferen-tial treatment to widows, and it has therefore decided that graduated supple-ments related to the husband&apos;s previous earnings should also be paid withwidow&apos;s allowance. .
The self-employed CONFIDENTIAL &apos; 8814*     When the graduated pensions scheme was introduced, it was decided thatit should not apply to the self-employed.   People who are self-employed do notd^ave the advantage of an employer&apos;s contribution to supplement their own andthere would be great practical difficulties in assessing and collectinggraduated contributions from them.   The self-employed are in any case noteligible for unemployment benefit.   For these reasons they are not included inthe Government&apos;s proposals for extending graduated contributions and benefits.Scope of the Government&apos;s proposals15.     The Government&apos;s proposals which follow in Part II deal with the essential features of a system of earnings-related short-term benefits.   A great deal of detailed work remains to be done before these proposals can be put into effect and the consequences for other benefits? notably the benefits payable under theIndustrial Injuries scheme for people injured at work, need further study.PART   IIThe Government&apos;s proposals16.     The Government proposes that graduated supplements, related to previousearnings, should be paid with flat-rate unemployment and sickness benefits,and with widow&apos;s allowance, in order to provide additional protection during the difficult period of adjustment that follows a severe and unexpected drop in income.   The following paragraphs show what the earnings - related benefits would be, on the basis of the present rates of flat-rate benefit.The amount of the graduated supplements17&quot;     The extra graduated contributions required to finance the supplementswould be collected on the same band of earnings as for graduated pensions (atpresent  9 to  18 a week).   The supplements would be related to earnings in thatband.   It would be wrong for the second  9 of earnings to attract more benefitthan the first  9.   Therefore, on present figures, the supplement for thoseearning  18 a week or more should not be more than  3 7s- 6d.   .0n this basis the maximum rate of benefit for a single man would be twiae as much as thepresent flat-rate benefit.   For those earning between  9 and  18 the supplementwould be three-eighths of their earnings over  9*   This is the proportion whichthe maximum supplement bears to  9*   People earning  9 a week or less do not pay graduated contributions and would not be eligible for&quot;any supplement.   Buta single man with earnings bet\?een  9 and  18 would not receive a higher pro-portion of his gross earnings than the man on  9 a week.   For those earning morethan  18 a week the proportion of gross earnings would be smaller.18.     The following tables illustrate the benefits which would be payable at different levels of earnings and for different families under the Government&apos;sproposals for graduated supplements amounting to three-eighths of gross earnings between  9 and  18 a week./Table 15.

19.   These tables show that a single man with earnings up to  18 a week^vould receive benefit amounting to almost half his take-hone pay.   For the married man the proportion would be well over half; for a nan with a familyit would be two-thirds or more according to the number of children.20.   The purpose of the supplement will be to cushion the impact ofunemployment, sickness and widowhood by providing higher benefits during theperiod following a sudden drop in income.   The present widow&apos;s allowance, whichhas always existed for this purpose, lasts for three nonths.   For the unemployedthe period should be long enough to tide them over the initial difficultiesof what may be a major upheaval in their lives but not so long as to dis-courage mobility.   It can be argued that three months is a suitable period for these purposes.   The Government considers that there is merit in adopting the same period for all three contingencies but that a rather longer period than three months is needed.   It has concluded that the graduated supplement to all three benefits should be paid for six months.    This means that the flat-rate widow&apos;s allowance will also run for six months.21,   The question of when payment of graduated benefit supplements should begininvolves different considerations for different benefits.   Account must betaken of the amount of work required to determine the rate of supplementpayable, and the number of claims involved.   In all cases, enquiries about aclaimant&apos;s previous earnings would be necessary.   These enquiries would inevitably take time and it would be difficult to avoid some delay in putting the supplements into payment.   For unemployment and sickness benefits, thesheer weight of numbers would make it impracticable to pay graduatedsupplements for short periods; to try to do so would place an impossibleburden on employers and the local offices   of the departments concerned.   TheGovernment therefore proposes that graduated unemployment benefit supplementsshould not be paid to workers on short time or for the first week of a spellof unemployment.22.    In the case of sickness benefit, the payment of graduated supplementswould present an even greater administrative problem.   Each year there are over nine million new claims to sickness benefit, oonpared with about threemillion unemployment benefit claims.   The bulk of sickness benefit claims are for relatively short periods.    One-quarter are for spells of a week or less,over half two weeks or less, and over three-quarters four weeks or less.Dealing with all these claims is not easy, particularly during the winter months when the influx of new claims is at its highest and the staff to dealwith them is itself often depleted by sickness.   At such times it is difficultenough to maintain flat-rate benefit payments; it would be out of the question to expect large numbers of graduated supplements to be paid as well.   Neitherlocal offices nor employers, who would have to assist in establishing detailsof previous earnings, would be able to cope with the extra work.   another important consideration distinguishing sickness benefit from unemploymentbenefit is that while an unemployed person is available in person to provide
details of his previous employment, a sick person is not.   He is usuallyconfined to bed, or at least to his hone, and in his case all enquiries about his earnings would have to be conducted by post.   This would inevitably makethe process more protracted.   In view of all these factors, and the extra coveralready provided in many cases by employers&apos; sick pay schemes during the earlyweeks of sickness, the Government proposes that graduated sickness benefitsupplements should not be paid for spells which last for four weeks or less,nor for the first four weeks of longer spells.   Only in this way would the task of paying graduated supplements to sickness benefit become manageable.23.   There is no need for a waiting period for the graduated supplements towidow&apos;s allowance.    These supplements would be paid as quickly as possible ivitheffect from the date of the husband&apos;s death and they would go on for the periodof six months now proposed for this allowance.The earnings to which graduated supplements would be related24.   The supplement would be related, as nearly as possible, to the earningswhich were reasonably representative of what was normal or average for theclaimant (or, in the case of the widow&apos;s allowance, the claimant&apos;s husband).It would therefore be necessary to average earnings over a period.   TheGovernment considers that this period must be the same for everyone, long enoughto even out fluctuations, seasonal or otherwise, in earnings, and one for whichdetails of earnings could be readily and reliably ascertained,25.   Studies made so far suggest that the period which would most nearly satisfyall these requirements would be the last tax year.   The Government thereforeproposes that graduated supplements should be calculated by reference to gross earnings (or the graduated contributions paid on such earnings) for P.A.Y.E.purposes in the last tax year before the date of claim.   The precise method of doing this needs further study.   One of the problems to be considered would bethe treatment of absences during the year due to unemployment or sickness.Cost and contributions26.   The Government proposes to finance the new short-term benefits, whichwould cost about  50 million a year, by adding -5- per cent to the graduated contributions (now 1^ per cent) which employers and employees are alreadypaying on earnings between  9 and  18 a week.   For those earning  18 a week ormore this would represent lid.a week each from employee and employer; andcorrespondingly less for those with lower earnings.27.   Employees who are contracted out of the part of the scheme providinggraduated retirement pensions do not at present pay graduated contributions.The Government believes it would be wrong to withhold the new benefits fromcontracted-out employees.   A way must therefore be found to collect theappropriate graduated contributions from them and their employers.    It is not practicable to collect two separate rates of graduated contributions, one fromordinary contributors, counting both for retirement pension and. short-term benefits; and the other from contracted-out contributors, counting for short-tem benefits only.   Among other difficulties, there would be no means ofCONFIDENTIAL8.
CONFIDENTIALensuring that the two kinds of contributions were kept absolutely distinct at^1 stages.   Any failure to distinguish between then would inevitably lead toerrors in the payment of pensions and other graduated, benefits.28.   This means that the contracted-out would have to pay the sane graduated contributions as other contributors.   Some rearrangement of the provision for contracting-out would be necessary, but the studies that have already beenmade have convinced the Government that the changes necessary for thispurpose could be introduced without departing from the essential principlethat the employer undertakes to provide certain benefits through a recognisedoccupational pension scheme in place of part of the national insurance retire-ment pension.   No change would be necessary in the amount of occupational pension which enployers must provide in order to contract out, and existingcertificates of non-participation would remain valid without enployers having to modify their occupational pension schemes.   The Government proposes to dis-cuss the detailed application of these revised arrangements for contracting-outwith representatives of employers, employees and others concerned withoccupational pensions.9,
