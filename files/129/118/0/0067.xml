CABINETDOCKS WAGES CLAIMMemorandum by the Minister of LabourLast week, a delegate conference of dockers rejected a pay offer which theemployers say is their final offer. I think my colleagues will wish to know the background to this dispute and my assessment of the likely course of events in theimmediate future.2. History. The unions, of which the Transport and General Workers&apos; is themost important, put in a claim for a substantial increase in time rates of pay and adjustment of piece rates in March. The claim was made earlier than expected.When agreement was reached in October 1963 for the introduction of the 40-hour week in July of this year, it was thought that a pay claim would probably not besubmitted until the middle of this year.3. Negotiations started at a meeting of the National Joint Council for thePort Transport Industry on 8th July. The unions opened by asking for an increaseof 10s. a day on the time rate (about 25 per cent) and 5 per cent on the piece rates,but came down to 5s. a day and 5 per cent. The employers offered 2s. a day ontime rates and 2\ per cent on piece rates. They also offered to review the minimumweekly time rate of  9 9s. Od. in the autumn, so that the very small percentage ofdockers who earn no more than this, could be given a further increase.4. The offer was rejected by a delegate conference of the unions on 17th July,and there was a further meeting of the Joint Council on 21st July at which the unionsformally notified their rejection of the wage claim and the employers undertook to consider the matter. At a meeting on 11th August the employers made an improved offer of 2s. 2d. (instead of 2s.) per day for time workers and 3 per cent(instead of 2\ per cent) for piece workers. This improved offer was rejected by asecond delegate conference on 14th August at which the negotiators were instructedto seek authority for a strike from the executives of the unions concerned if asettlement was not reached at a further meeting.5. At a meeting of the National Joint Council on 29th August, the employersimproved their offer again. They offered an increase of 2s. 6d. per day for timeworkers and 3-1 per cent for piece workers, and an increase in the present fall-backrate (the minimum weekly guaranteed wage) from  7 16s. 9d. to  9. They repeated that they were prepared to do something later in the year to improve the positionof the small percentage of dockers on the lowest earnings, as part of a general reviewof the wages structure. They said this was their final offer and that, if it was not accepted, they would want the matter referred to arbitration or some other form of independent decision.6. The improved offer was rejected at a delegate conference on 3rd September.My information is that the majority of the delegates thought the offers to increasethe piece rates and the fall-back rate were satisfactory, but that, when the offer was put as a whole, including the proposed increase on the time rate, it was defeated bya heavy majority. The union officials were criticised for summoning another delegate conference before going to their union executives for power to call a strike, ifnecessary, and it was agreed that they would now go to their executives.4787Printed for the Cabinet.

7. Future Developments. The trade unions are likely to ask for anothermeeting of the National Joint Council in the week beginning 14th September. The(executive of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union is meeting to considerthe situation on 21st September. The timing of these moves is significant. Underthe constitution of the National Joint Council the unions must give four weeks&apos;notice to terminate the agreement and the parties must meet forthwith to discussthe position. Failing agreement during these four weeks the unions must givetwo weeks&apos; notice to strike. It seems likely that the timing on the union&apos;s side isaimed at postponing the final crisis in the negotiations until after the Election.They have to take account, however, of the feeling in the docks. The claim for anincrease of 5s. per day for time workers has been given a lot of publicity and the dockers have been stirred up in recent months by unofficial leaders and by theNational Amalgamated Stevedores and Dockers (the rival union to the transport and General Workers&apos;), which is particularly active in the northern ports. Thereis a danger of unofficial trouble if the Transport and General Workers&apos; and other unions move too slowly.8. Incomes Policy. The proposed increases for time workers and pieceworkers, together with the increases in pay resulting from the introduction of the40-hour week in July, amount to 3-9 per cent per annum since August 1962, thedate of the last pay increase. The proposed increase in the fall-back rate will costpractically nothing at present nor so long as the level of activity in the docks is reasonably high.9. Conclusions. I do not propose to intervene in the dispute at this stage.I think the right course is to allow the constitutional procedure of notice to terminate the agreement and the joint meeting to discuss the position to operatebefore I make any move. I shall, however, reconsider the position following themeeting of the National Joint Council next week and, of course, if there is seriousunofficial trouble meanwhile.J. G.Ministry of Labour, S.W.1,8th September, 1964.
