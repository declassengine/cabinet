SECRETp THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June .1964CP. (64) 115 Copy No.    4 59 th June, 1964OFFER OF AN ART COLLECTIONMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster general there is a real possibility of an offer to this country of a very importantcollection of modern art, on condition that we provide a site and building to houseit in London, and undertake to meet the running cost of it. The modern sculptureincluded in the collection is representative of the whole period from Rodin tothe present day and includes many examples of our own Epstein and Henry Moore.It is, I am advised, the most important collection of modern sculpture in privatehands in the world. There are also a great many modern paintings, mainly by american artists. The value of the whole collection is put at at least  6 million,and competent authorities in the art world are unequivocal in their view that itwould represent an addition of the first order to our cultural possessions.2. Mr. Hirshhorn, the owner, is an American citizen and his collection is atpresent mainly at his home in Greenwich, Connecticut. If he decides to make hisoffer to bring his collection to London a firm one, it would be on the understandingthat the United Kingdom Government would provide a suitable site and building,including provision for outdoor display of many major pieces of sculpture, andwould meet the running costs of the museum. The site, which he wishes to be in central London, would probably be found in Regents Park, and although exactdetails of the size and scope of the building would have to be worked out, it wouldbe likely to cost perhaps  1 million- l million at present prices. Running costs mightbe of the order of  150,000 a year. Mr. Hirshhorn would be ready to finance apurchase fund, of about  f million, for further acquisitions. He would want his present curator to remain in charge and would also want a major say in the nomination of the governing body and in the policy of the museum.3. At a meeting I had with Mr. Hirshhorn on 8th June, he indicated thathe would like to have a statement of what Her Majesty&apos;s Government would beprepared to undertake to do if he decided to bring his collection to London. I said that I would consult my colleagues and let him have a reply by the end ofthe week, when he leaves.4. To accept such an offer, if after full consideration Mr. Hirshhorn decidesto make it, would call for considerable Government expenditure. It would,however, give London an outstanding new public collection of modern sculpture,which we could not hope to accumulate without such a gift and which wouldbe unique of its kind. The opportunity seems to be one which we ought not to miss.In the circumstances, I seek the agreement of my colleagues to tell Mr. Hirshhornthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to provide a building on a central London site and to meet running costs, on the kind of scale indicated above if he vested his collection in a suitable body of trustees, constituted inagreement with the Government, and transferred it permanently to London for public exhibition. The precise details of the constitution and management of thenew institution would need to be worked out, as would many other matters.J. A. B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,9th June, 1964.4457
