CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC{8)) 20COPY NOCABINET0-11 May 1981PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1981: GUIDELINESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. This paper makes proposals concerning certain guidelines for the1981 public expenditure survey which require Mlnisterial agreement,including provisional inflation assumptions necessary for planning in ( ,.sh,which we discussed in general terms in February (CC(8l) 8th Conclusions,Minute 6).     The object at this stage; is to enable officials to work rp thematerial we shall need when we come to substantive discussions in the .&apos;11101110TIMETABLE2. I hope to avoid putting proposals to colleagues too early, with therisk that they have to be reopened later, as happened Lail year.    This maymean concentrating discussion of specific proposals for programmes in theautumn (but in time for the Rate Support Grant negotiations).     Wo shall,however, probablv wish to take stock in July and consider giving somepreliminary advice to the local authorities beyond that already i&quot; the WhitePaper, in order to influence their planning for 1982-83, even if, ai laslyear, this advice has to be subject to later reconsideration.OPTIONS3. It is customary and useful in preparing survey material to includecosted options for reductions in expenditure,  showing the political, social,economic and other implications.    We shall need later to consider togetherwhether and what scale of further reductions in our spending plans should heattempted.    I do not want to advance proposals at this stage.   But againitthe background of the very much increased tax burdens we have had to imposeso far, I think it must be right to ask officials to prepare options for expendi-ture reductions on a scale which will give us a aubstantinl range of choices,in total and priorities.4. We must also bear in mind that many of our decisions will not besettled until the autumn, by which time the scope for action affecting thecoming financial year is beginning to be limited.     I propose that official a beasked to set out what would be involved for o\ery programme, in two L&lt; Vtliof reductions, by 3 per cent and 5 per cent in 1982-83 and by 5 per cent and7j per cent in the later years including 1984-85, the percentages beingrelated to the cash figures for each programme calculated as proposed below.For social security, where the reduction may in large part need to begin1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfrom the November 1982 uprating date, I suggest we ask for options of5 per cent and l\ per ceat in a full year.    The basic options should alsoapply to the territorial programmes (Scotland, Wale?, Northerr Ireland),without prejudice to a later decision whether to adopt this approach or thenormal &quot;formula&quot; approach by reference to comparable English programmes.5. Where a Department finds it necessary to make a bid for additionalexpenditure for whatever reason, including argument that the standardprovision for ccst increases will be inadequate for a particular programme,it should also make proposals for offsetting reductions.5. So that we can consider the balance, officials should distinguishbetween capital and current expenditure in the survey report, includingadditional bids and options for reductions; they should also distinguishexpenditure on construction.1984-8 57. For the new final year 1984-85, which was not covered in the lastsurvey and White Paper, I propose that officials be asked to put forwardfigures that reflect the continuation of present policies, specifying in eachcase the nature of the policies and related commitments.    Proposals whichwould increase the level of commitment should be t&apos;eated as additional bids.INFLATION ASSUMPTION8. In order to work from the start in terms of cash, at, I believe weshould, decisions are needed now about provisional inflation assumptions.The assumptions must be provisional, and be open to revision in the autumn.9. I recognise reasons for reluctance to decide assumptions between1981-82 and 1982-83 at this stage.    But if we do not do this, we shall have tocontinue the volume system through much of the survey process, and incurthe disadvantages of a full revaluation in the autumn, rather than merelyadjusting the factors, if necessary, in October.    We would have to change inthe middle of our discussions the language in which we have been conductingthem.    To get the full benefit of the switch to casn planning, we ought to usecash from the start.10. A further advantage of taking a provisional view on inflationassumptions now is that they can then be given to the local authority expendi-ture groups, for use in their discussions in the next few months.    They canalso bp used for the preliminary decisions in July on the nationalisedindustries&apos; Investment and Financing Review.FACTORS FOR 1982-8311. Inflation forecasts are notoriously subject to error, even on a shorttime-horizon.    One year ago our forecast for the Retail Price Index (RPI)from November 1979 to November 1980 was 16| per cent;  as late as Julymany feared that the out-turn would be 1 or 2 percentage points higher; in2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe event it w  g a percentage point or so lower. Any forecast made nowfor 1982-83 can only bw a reasonable working assumption; which we mustreview in the autumn before cash limits ami  &gt; (.  ma?  h an- liinl&apos;y fixed.12. In relation to 1982-83,  tho only inflation I&apos;orcr.iHt which we h iv&lt;published is that tho RPI wiL bo 8 nor cent higher in tho hocoikI quarter ol1982 (ic the first quartor of 1982-8 \ ) than a year oa rlior.     to - th.  p ro .jentpurpose we need to consider tho average increase of prices between thefinancial years, rot the Q2 on QZ figures.     Our unpublished kim forecastfor the financial year is around 7^ pur cent.     The kim does ik.i nocomiarilyreflect the basket of goods and scrvicos bought by Gnvornnnni, Sat there isno reason at present to tnink it will bo uncharacteristic as a rise for in xiyear in costs other than pay.    (This is not to say that I be re may not be son oprogrammes where prices increase faster than the average.    Their casefor additional cash provision will be for coi. side r a t.lon along with othoradditional bids. )13. On public services pay, even at this preliminary and provisionalstage one would liko to set a realistic assumption, consistent with lowersettlements generally in the next pay round, but not. so low is t&lt;. un&lt;!&lt; riolmthe validity of our planning.    However, in the special circumstances ihfayear, with the Civil Sorvice dispute still unrepolved, I am impressed by theawkwardness of putting into widespread use in Whitehall Just now anassumption, however provisional, specifically for pay incroanos next year.It would become widely known and could be represented as the Governmenthaving already determined a pay factor for next year.14. On tho basis of our present calculations, it is reasonable to thiol&apos; interms of an average increase in costs generally next year on aCCOUbl 0 Iinflation of the order of 7 per cent, perhaps a b-t more for prices Other thanpay, and we hope rather less for pay.    While I should have preferred tosuggest appropriate separate lactors for pay and non-pay, I propose tintinstead for the time being we adopt as a temporary and provisional workingassumption this general figure of 7 per cent, to bo regarded as I&apos;i expectedaverage increase in costs generally, including pay.15. This avoids any specific assumption about pay, and it will be plainthat the general assumption is provisional.    We shall need to consider moredetailed expectations later in the year, but the present a ssumption will giveus, both for the total of expenditure as a whole .and for nearly all tho majorindividual expenditure programme s, figures which will be a prett accuratereflection of present expectations as to the course of inflation,  and en 1.1? I  us to vork from the start with figures not far from those which may emergefrom more refined calculations later.THE LATER YEARS16. In our earlier Cabinet discussion wo left aside the question oftreatment  f future years.     On further consideration,  I believe there will boadvantage in adopting cash values for later years also - although they mustinevitably be even more provisional than those for tho Immediately comingyear,3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL17. The alternative of using &quot;estimated 1982-83 prices&quot; would avoid theneed to assume inflation factors for later years now.    But it would leavehyb .-id series of figures, partly in cash, partly in constant prices, whichwould have a very odd appearance on eventual publication,    A cash seriesavoids this problem and, although future revisions are bound to be necessary,we should find it a good deal les3 troublesome to make adjustments to figure3which already incorporate some allowance for increases in costs, than toface at the beginning of each survey the same kind of problem we are facingin this first transitional year.18. I propose, as simple working assumptions, single inflation factorsof 6 per cent for the change from 1982-83 to 198^-84 and 5 per C3nt from1983-84 to 1984-8 5, broadly reflecting Government strategy and objectivesover the period.CONCLUSION19. I seek colleagues&apos; agreement that:-i0 the survey report by officials should show altcrnativa costedpolicy options for reductions of 3 per cent and 5 per cent for 1982-83and 5 per cent and l\ per cent for each later year, as suggosted andsubject to the qualification in paragraph 4;    and offsetting savingsfor additional bids (paragraph 5);ii. the figures for 1984-85 should be derived initially on thebasis of existing policies (paragraph 7);iii. work on the survey should now proceed in cash for 1992-83,U3ing the provisional working assumption for inflation between1981-82 and 1982-83 that all costs rise by 7 per cent (paragraph 14);iv. this provisional working acsumption should be given to localauthority expenditure groups and be available for discussion withthe nationalised industries of th^ir expenditure plans;v. cash should be used for the later years also, with provisionalworking assumptions of 6 per cent for the change between 1982-83and 1983-84, and 5 per cent for the following year.GHTreasury Chambers1 May 19814CONFIDENTIAL
