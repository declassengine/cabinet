CONFIDENTIALHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81)251 June 1981DISQUALIFICATION OF PRISONERS FROMELECTION TO PARLIAMENTMemorandum by the Secretary o.f State for the Home Department1. At its meeting on 30 April, Home and Social Affairs Committee (H)agreed that, to prevent a repeat of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election, a Bill should be introduced as a matter of urgency to disqualifyfrom election to the House of Commons convicted persons serving a prisonsentence of more than twelve months;  that the disqualification should includethose released from prison but subject to recall (eg those on parole or lifesentence prisoners released on licence);  and that, subject to the views ofthe Lord Privy Seal as to its effect on Anglo-Irish relations, these newgrounds of disqualification should apply to prisoners serving their sentencein either the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland.    Finally, it wasdecided that arrangements should be introduced to permit acting returningofficers (AROs), either on their own initiative or on the basis of objectionsreceived from the public, to invalidate the nominations of those disqualifiedon these grounds so as to deny them the privileges of candidacy.2. To take effect before the next by-election in Fermanagh and SouthTyrone, this Bill must receive Royal Assent before the Summer Recess.Work on the Bill, however, has shown that it is not possible to meet all theseobjectives in a measure sufficiently short, simple and uncontroversial tocomplete all its stages in both Houses within the next two months. Itherefore propose that we limit the scope of this Bill to -i. extending the ground of disqualification to convicted personsdetained in prison in the United Kingdom pursuant to a sentence ofmore than twelve months; andii. introducing arrangements for invalidating the nomination ofsuch persons.3. There is no residential qualification for membership of theWestminster Parliament.    Any British subject or citizen of the Republic ofIreland resident anywhere in the world (and not otherwise disqualified) maybe elected to the House of Commons.    H Committee felt that presentcircumstances required that the Bill should be extended to persons servingsentences in the Republic of Ireland.    (The further, logically defensible,extension to persons serving sentences in the rest of the world was1COPY NO    g |CABINETCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrecognised to be impracticable. )    I io not, however, believe that the costof extending the Bill beyond the United Kingdom would justify the possiblegaintj.    It would add considerably to the length and complexity of the Bill(eg by requiring the provision of machinery to take account frcrn time totime of any changes which might subsequently take place in the relevant penalarrangements in the Republic).    It would disqualify only a very small numberof IRA sympathisers and leave many more free to stand for, and be electedto, Parliament.4. The easiest and most effective method of eliminating such personsfrom election would be to introduce a residential qualification for member-ship of the House of Commons (the practice adopted by most otherdemocracies).    But it would not be appropriate to introduce a major changein our electoral arrangements of this kind in the Bill.    My review ofelectoral law and procedures has disclosed a number of desirable changes inour electoral arrangements which I intend to announce for consultation in theautumn and I should much prefer to include this proposal in that package.PRISONERS ON RELEASE5. Before the Criminal Law Act 19&amp;7 abolished the distinction betweenFelonies and misdemeanours, the Forfeiture Act 1870 (as amended) dis-qualified from election any person &quot;convicted of , . . felony /and/ sentencedto death, preventive detention or corrective training or any term ofimprisonment exceeding twelve months&quot;, while in prison under that sentence.Many more prisoners are now released early on parole or licence.H Committee decided that these prisoners, while subject to recall, shouldalso be disqualified.    It is, however, now clear that disqualifying suchpersons would complicate the Bill.    Moreover, this step raises importantissues of principle.    Such persons enjoy all other civic privileges, includingthe right to vote.    On penological grounds, disqualifying them from the rightto gtaud or be elected would introduce a new element of controversy. Theremight also be difficulty in distinguishing between the prisoner released onparole and the prisoner released under the ordinary rules relating toremission.    I recommend that we limit the grounds for disqualification to asnearly as possible the pre-1967 position;  ie convicted persons detained inprison for a period of more than twelve months.DISQUALIFICATION FROM NOMINATION6. The proposal that the Bill should enable AROs to invalidate thenomination of those disqualified on these new grounds would require theelection timetable to be extended by two days and would add to the controversy,length and complexity of the Bill.    But I believe, subject to the views  f theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland, that such considerations areoutweighed by the advantages, particularly in the Northern Ireland context,of preventing disqualified persons from enjoying the publicity attendant oncandidacy.    I, therefore, propose that the Bill should include such aprovision.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSION7. I accordingly invite my colleagues to agre ? that, to facilitatelegislation disqualifying prisoners from election to the House of Commonspassing by the Summer Recess, the Bill introduced for this purpose shouldbe as short and as simple as possible.    In particular, I propose that itshould be limited to:-i.        disqualifying convicted persons detained in prison inthe United Kingdom for more than twelve months; andii.       introducing arrangements for invalidating the nominationof such persons.W WHome Office1 June 19&amp;I3CONFIDENTIAL
