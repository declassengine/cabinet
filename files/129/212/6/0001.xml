The Cabinet first considered these matters on Thursday 9 April 1981(CC(81) 15th Conclusions, Minute 5), on the basis of a memorandum by t!..- I ,&lt; idPresident of the Council and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster andPaymaster General (C(81) 13) which set out five options for dealing with the payof Members of Parliament (MPs) and Ministers.     No decisions were reachedat that meeting, but in the discussion the choice was narrowed down toOptions B and D in C(81) 13, and the Cabinet agreed the proposals in thatmemorandum for dealing with the remuneration of junior Ministers in theHouse of Lords2. The Cabinet reverted to the subject last week (CC(8l) 17th Conclusions,Minute 5), and agreed to decide at its meeting on 7 May whether the pay ofMPs and Ministers should be increased in accordance with Option D, asproposed by the Lord President of the Council and the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster, and whether this decision should be announced at the l&amp;fflfl tim&lt;as those on the three Review Body reports.3.

I attach a copy  .f an extract from the draft of an announcement oy tinPrime Minister on the Review Body reports, as an indication of what might besaid if the Cabinet decided to proceed on the baa&apos;s of Option D and to announithat decision and the decisions on remuneration of junior Ministers in theHouse of Lords together with the decisions on the other Review Body reports.Signed    ROBERT ARMSTRONGCabinet Office5 May 1981SECRET
SECRETMinisters and Members of ParliamentMinisters and Members of Parliament are unique in thatthey still have to receive the third stage of the increasesrecommended for them by the Top Salaries Review Body beforethis Government came to office.    Last year the Governmentfelt compelled to propose, and the House approved,  second stageincreases which fell short of those recommended by the ReviewBody;     the House also approved revised rates to come into effectin June 1981, which were also less than the rates recommendedby the Review Body for that date.    These were embodied in aResolution of this House and an Order in Council approved by theHouse.    But my right hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford,then the Leader of the House, undertook that the Review Bodywould be asked to review the third stage increase due in 1981,and he said that the Government would implement the results ofthe third stage review unless there were clear and compellingreasons not to do so.In the event the Preview Body has taken the same coursewith the pay of Ministers and Members of Parliament as with theother groups which come within their remit:  it has notrecommended new rates for this year, but has urged the imple-mentation in full and as soon as possible of their recommendationsfor the third stage. It has, however, advised on the increaseof the various Parliamentary allowances which is  within itsremit.The Government proposes to the House that the salaryrates approved last year to come into effect on 13 June 1981should be increased by 6 per cent.     This would bring theParliamentary salary up to  13, 950 with effect from 13 June next.This compares with the figure of  13, 750, which the Review. Bodyrecommended last year to come into effect in June 1981. TheoroDosed new rates of Ministerial salaries are set out in aschedule which is being circulated in the Official Report.The Government proposes that new rates of Parliamentaryallowances should be implemented as proposed by the Review Body,SECRET
SECRETJunior Ministers in the House of LordsWhen I announced last year&apos;s increases in Ministerialsalaries, I drew attention to the special problem which arisesfor Ministers of State and for Parliamentary Secretaries in theHouse of Lords from the fact that they do not receive any salaryspecifically in respect of their Parliamentary duties.    I told theHouse that the Government proposed to consider how the arrange-ments for their remuneration should be revised to take account ofthis problem.The Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 gives mediscretion to fix the salaries of Ministers of State within a rangewhich, at present extends from  16,250 to  19, 300.    Under theproposals that I have just described, from 13 June 1981, thisrange will extend from  19, 775 to  23, 275.    Ministers of Statein the House of Commons, who also draw a Parliamentary salary,will continue to be paid at the bottom of this range.    I proposeto exercise my discretion to secure that Ministers of State inthe House of Lords are paid at the top of it.    This will give thema Ministerial salary  3, 500 higher than that of their counterpartsin the House of Commons, who will of course be drawing aParliamentary salary of  8, 130 which Ministers in the House ofLords do not get.So far as Parliamentary Secretaries are concerned, the1975 Act prescribes a single salary (at pre sent  12,500), butSection 4(2) of the Act provides that the salaries specified by theAct are maxima, and that lower salaries may be paid.Accordingly the Government is proposing that the maximumsalary prescribed for Parliamentary Secretaries should beincreased to  18, 600.     That will be the rate paid to Parliamentary.Secretaries in the House of Lords;  but the Government intendsthat Parliamentary Secretaries in the House of Commons shouldreceived, in addition to their Parliamentary salary, a Ministerialsalary of  15, 100, which represents an increase of 6 per cent ir.the rate approved last year to come into effect in June 1981.SECRET
SECRETThe Government also proposes that the salaries of LawOfficers, other office holders and Whips in the House of Lordsshould be set  3, 500 above the third stage levels as approvedlast year and increased by 6 per cent.     The proposed rates areset out in the schedule to be circulated in the Official Report.ImplementationThe House will be invited to approve a Resolution and anOrder in Council implementing the increases proposed in theremuneration of Members of Parliament and of Ministers witheffect from 13 June 1981.SECRET
