CONFIDENTIAL5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 17 COPY NO 3528 April 1981CABINETTOP SALARIES REVIEW BODY (TSRB) REPORT NO 16Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council1. Report No lb covers the pay of senior civil aervants, senior officersof the armed forces and the higher judiciary.    A summary of the report isat Annex A.    It makes no new salary recommendations for 1981 but urgesthe Government to implement in full, and as soon as possible, the ratesrecommended last year in TSRB 14.    This would Involve BJi average increasethis year of 12 p^r cent (with increases ranging from 8.1 per cent co 15. 4 percent).2. We have told the Review Body that the Government is consideringits recommendations and have asked them tc advise Oxi how a 7 per centincrease in the salary bill might best be distributed.    I hope this advicewill be available before we meet.THE OPTIONS3. We have to decide what increases to accept from 1 April.    As thefollowing paragraphs show, we have three main options:-a. To implement fully TSRB 14, as recommended by theReview Body.b. To allow a 7 per cent increase in the current salary bill.c. To allow a 6 per cent increase in the cuirent salary bill.A.   Implementing TSRB 144. A strong case can be made in logic for implementing the TSRB 14rates now.    These rates were what the Review Body thought right forApril 1980 since when there has been further inflation. Implementationin full would still leave the TSRB groups behind *he outside world.Moreover, the Review Body are conducting a fundamental review ofsalary levels as the basis for their recommendations for 1982.    Given thegeneral level of pay increases since April 1980, an increase of only 6 percent or 7 per cent now will mean that next year&apos;s recommendations areCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlikely to be even more err barrassing for us.    The Review Body wouldprobably not be prepared to continue if we rejected what they recommendnext year.    Implementation of TSRB 14 now would also ease differentialswhich were compressed last year.    There is also the problem ofrecruitment to the judiciary because of the high earnings of barristers.5. On the other hand it would be difficult to say the least to justify12 per cent tor the TSRB groups when many groups in the public sector aresettling at around 6 per cent to 7 per cent, when the rest of the Civil Serviceis being limited to 7 per cent and when nationalised industries&apos; chairmenhave been told that the Government cannot guarantee rises for boardmembers (now removed from the Review Body&apos;s remit) up to TSRB 14 levelswithin the near future.    It would also mean giving the TSRB groupssubstantially better treatment this year than the doctors and dentists (eventhough the latter had their full increase last year).    Finally, although fullimplementation cou)d generally be accommodated within cash limits, thismay not be so for the cash limit covering judicial salaries not borne on theConsolidated Fund.B. 7 Per Cent6. If we decide not to implement TSRE 14 rates now, the argumentsfor 7 per cent are:-a. There would be no cash limit problems.    It would be broadlyconsistent with many of the settlements already reached in thepublic sectrr, eg local authority manuals and teachers. Inparticular, it would be the same as the offer for the non-industrialCivil Service.b. There would be a slightly less acute catching-up problemnext year with 7 per cent than wi*h 6 per cent.c. It would do a little more to alleviate differentials problemsthan a lower figure although the precise effect would depend on thedistribution recommended by the Review Body.d. Last year the recommendations of the other two ReviewBodies were implemented in full, averaging 16 per cent for thearmed forces and 19 per cent for the do-torn and dentists. TheTSRB recommendations were cut by half, to 12j per cent. Evenif it is accepted that the armed forces are a special case, recenthit;toi.y wouiu tiiercfore justify rather batter treatment  ox theTSRB groups than for the doctors and dentists this year.C. 6 Per Cent7. The arguments for 6 per cent are:-a. It would underline our tough attitude on public servicepay generally.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. It would be in line with the ir.creaser, available within cashlimits for the National Health Service groups, including the doctorsand dentists.OTHER POINTS8. Two further points to rote:-a. None of the above options would cause insuperable problemsof differentials if the Armed Forces Pay Review Bodyrecommendations are fully implemented.b. It still remains for us to decide in due course what to dcthis year on the salaries of Members of Parliament and .Ministers.Our decisions on TSRB will be relevant.CONCLUSION9. I cannot recommend implementation of TSRB 14 rates now thoughwe must be conscious of the problems we shall be building up for next year.A 12 per cent increase for these groups would be too damaging to our generalstance on pay.    However I think there are sound reasons for 7 per centrather than 6 per cent.    I therefore propose that there should be a 7 percent increase  on the salary bill for the TSRB groups to be distributed inthe light of the TSRB&apos;s views on this.SCivil Service Department28 April 19813CONFIDENTIAL
F KKPORT NO 16nhe Review Body says that the comprehensive review of salaries whi ehthey are undertaking is not yet complete, and that consequent!yTSRB 16 should be regarded as an interim report.    Because of thisthey do not think it appropriate to recommend salary levels for thethree groups within their remit beyond those which they consideredright for 1 April  1980,  and which s l.ill  remain to lie implemented.Instead they strongly urge the Government to implement therecommendations of TSRB 14 in full, and as soon as possible. Thiswould entail an increase of about overall  in current, salarycosts (with increases ranging from 7.5$ to 15-4#) The Review Body nevertheless emphasise that they interpret theirtask as being to keep salary levels under review and that, infulfilment of this remit, they are continuing with a fundamentalreview of the present structure.    The review has addressed thedifferent problems of the three groups:-i. the judiciary:    the key question is the relationshipbetween salaries for judicial posts and earnings at thebar.   A survey of earnings at the bar has been undertakenby OME and a sub-committee appointed to consider itsfindings.    Its report is annexed to TSRB 16;ii. Civil Service and Armed Forces:    the Review Body hascommissioned management consultants to conduct an in-depthcomparison between civil service and armed forces salariesand those in the private sector.    A survey by OME ofremuneration in the private sector is attached to the report.The initial evidence has suggested that differentials atthe top may not be adequate, and has pointed to the needfor a review of the existing liiiks between civil serviceand armed forces salaries.These questions and others will be dealt with in a comprehensivereport in April 1982,  the object of which will be to recommenda coherent salary structure.    This structure will take accountof the Government&apos;s decisions on the Scott Inquiry into the&quot;value of pensions.
