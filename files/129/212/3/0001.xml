CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT35C(81) 18 COPY NO28 April 1981CABINETDOCTORS&apos; AND DENTISTS&apos; REVIEW BODY REPORTMemorandum by the Secretary of Stale for Social Services1. The Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body (DDRB) Report recommendsincreases close to 9 per cent across the board, with small variation ! etweenthe various groups.     The overall increase in the pay bill for the twoprofessions in 1981-82 would be rather less -8.3 per cent - as the Report alaorecommends recouping an overpayment of practice expanses to dentistd inprevious years - see paragraph 8 below.2. Accepting the Report would exceed the provision in the National He.i&apos;thService (NHS) cash limits by  26 million.    In addition, the increase in actremuneration for general medical and dental practitioners - part of the non-cash limited family practitioner services - would cost . 19 million more thanthat for a 6 per ceni settlement.     Even more important, it is clear lliat thenurses will not settle for less than the doctors this year, and that tin awardmade to the professions will probably set the floo; tor settlements by virtuallyall groups of NHS staff.     The consequent squeo/.e on cash limits if the; Reporlwas accepted could then be over  197 million.     Sums of thiis magnitude couldnot be found without very substantial cute in services, particularly in certainparts of the country.3. I therefore see no alternative but to reject the Report.    Such outrightrejection would be unprecedented.     The professions would probably not !&gt;&lt; altogether surprised against the background of the 31 per cent and Zf&gt; per centincreases they received in the last two years.    The difference between theReview Body award and that which I recommend is email;   while this means asmall drop in pay from what they might have expected, it will also  n ike thereasons for rejecting the Report less convincing (to the professions).     I expectthem to abject strongly.     While they are unlikely to take any form of. industrialaction they do set a great importance upon an independent review body toprevent medical salaries &quot;being determined by considerations of politicalconvenience&quot; (Pilkington).    There is bound to be some adverse effect onmorale, and there might be special problems with the dentists (feeparagraph 8).1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. Tho attitude of the Review Body is harder bo prcdictt    The tona oftheir Report is less helpful than wo might have hop. &lt;i fori they g&lt; ou1 of ihoirway to stress that they have taken lull account oi tha national e&lt; onomicsituation in their recommendations,    Their resignation cannot be ruled  ut; Laany event four of tho eight m authors ore coming to the end of thoii term oloffice anyway and it co&quot;.id i&gt;e difficult to persuade them to an . pt reappointmentor to find now members willing to .nerve.     The crucial fa&lt; tor In determiningthe attitude of the Review Body - and the professions  - m.iy wo&apos;I he wliat theythink will happen next year.    The professions will certainly expel I any lostground to bo made up, and the K. view Body syHtom could not survive tworejected Reports in a row.     Wo may he asked for some assuram .  about lliofuture, which would be difficult to givo.    Wo will almost certainly have to startdiscussions on the role    the Review Body in a cash limited world, and it maywell prove- necessary to modify tho system for determining the pay of thoprofossions.5. If the Roport ia rejected, what should be put in its place?     it Li unlikelythat the Review Body themselves would accept this task of making altemativ,recommendations consistent with cash limits, ana ovon if they did it . ouldcompromise their independent e in th.   eyes of the profession.     The practicalpossibilities soot.i to be either to scale down all their recommendations l&gt;y thesame factor - which would at leant help to preserve  | e rolal iv i&apos; i en they havesuggested - or lo apply a straight percentage increase on present rales n&lt; roiisthe board.     The key question is what overall level of settlement would heappropriate.6. The profe.aai.onH will find a figure of 6 per cent very unpalatable Nogroup in the public hoc tor has yet accepted such a settlement (though Nil.*;ancillary workers have /allied for l\ per cent OVOJf 15 months, which isconsistent with a 6 per cent pay factor for the CVirre&amp;t year).     Tho professionsare also bound to look at the 7! per &lt; &lt; nt settlomunt for toa&lt; hers and lo&lt; a Iauthority manuals,  and at whatever  oiler in made to the oilier Review Bodygroups.     They will note parti&lt; u!arly tho 7 per &lt; ent on oiler to tho C&apos;vllService (though this can be ret onciled with a 6 per cent cash limit whereas acorresponding offer to the professions could not, as no manpower reductionsa r e planned).7. An overall level of settlement very slightly above 6 per cent might befunded without damaging erosion of NILS development money.     On the otherhand,  a figure in excess of 6 per &lt; ent would appear totally arl.it rar    and wouldbe provocative to the nurses (who have only been offered (&gt; per &lt; ent). Jtherefore recommend an offer at 6 per cent, though I shall consider whetheranything should be done to temper the wi nd to the dentists,   whose spe&lt; nilproblems are mentioned in paragraph 8 below.     (For general medical anddental practitioners, this would be a 6 per cent Increase in net remunerationie after meeting practice expenses).     The professions are likely to delay afinal decision until it is clearer what other groups in the public sector willaccept:   the British Medical Association may well wait until after their AnnualRepresentative Meetiag in June.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8. There is a further problem.    Th&gt;- fees paid to dentist I are set so as toproduce, the average net income recommended by &gt;lw Hevicw Bod*, ,  taking intoaccount an estimated level of practice expenses.    For 1977-78 aiul L978.-7&apos;),actual expenses were well below those estimated as the profession managed tokeep their costs down below the level of inflation.    The result is an over-payment above the Review Bodv recommendations amounting to seme 23 million.     The Feview Body now recommend that about  10 million of thisshould be rocoveied this year and propose a standstill in dentists&apos; &quot;targetaverage net income&quot; until 1 Octooer 1981 to achieve this, with a &apos;) per centincrease from that date.     The dentists would probably go along wi*h this; theywill however obviously resent the combination of a reduced award and B six-month delay in implementation.     Experience lias shown that dentists areprepared to reduce their commitment to tho NFS,  even if they cannot fullymaintain their incomes by private work.    I shall therefore consider what mightbe done to reduce the risk of a substantial reduction in NHS dental services, ifonly in the short term.9. The DDRB and the professions will need careful handling andpreparation, and time must be allowed for this.    I support that we should aimonly at reaching a provisional conclusion on Thursday, and that an announ&lt;ment - which for presentational reasons should deal with our conclusions on allthree Review Body reports - should not be made befo e the Latter part of nextweek.10. In summary, I ask colleagues to agree provisionally -a. that the full recommendations cannot be accepted; andb. that our effer to the professions 6hoi.ld be an increas averaging6 per cent, with some small margin to temper the wind for thedentists.P JDepartment of Health and Social Security28 April 1981CONFIDENTIAL
