CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 1928 April 1981CABINETARMED FORCES PAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence1. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPR.B) has now submittedits Tenth Report (for 1981).       It deals with the combatant ranks up to andincluding Brigadier;  the more senior military ranks being covered by theTop Salaries Review Body.    It does not apply to Service Medical and DentalOfficers, whose pay will be the subject of a supplementary report by theReview Body in the light of the latest report of the Doctois and DentistsReview Body.GENERAL APPP.OACH2. The Review Body has acknowledged both the constraints on publicexpenditure and the Government&apos;s public commitment to maintain the pay of theForces at the levels of their civilian counterparts (which the Cabinet at itsmeeting on 4 November last year(CC(80) 38th Conclusions) agreed shouldstand).    It has, therefore, applied the usual process of earnings comparison,and its own judgment of the less easily quantifiable elements of total rerrum-i ation.    Among these elements it has looked particularly at relative jobsecurity (though it has found insufficient change to alter its judgment of lastyear, which weighed heavily in its consideration of the rates appropriate for1 April 1980);   the relative value of pensions which, by contrast, has had amarked impact on the salary levels which it now considers appropriate; andat relative fringe benefits.    It recommends substantially increased chargesfor both food and accommodation.PAY LEVELS3. The report recommends increases for officers of between approxi-mately IZj per cent and 15 per cent, and for other ranks of between  8 per centand 13^ percent.    The pattern reflects the widening of differentials in outsideemployment.    In arriving at these figures the Review Body has adjusted thecomparable earnings for both officers and other ranks for the relative pensionbenefit on the basis of a detailed comparison by the Government Actuary of thebenefits of the Armed Forces pension scheme with those of the relevantcomparator   schemes;  it proposes to give further consideration to thisdeduction next year in the light of the results of the Government&apos;s consideration1of the Scott Inquiry.    It has also taken account in its judgment of tho shorterworking week in outside employment, as well as of some opposing (butunspecified) factors.1COPY NO 35CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCHARGES4. The Review Body recommends an increase of 26 per cent in thecharge for food and of between 23 per cent and 26 per cent for mostaccommodation, bringing these charges into line with comparable civiliancosts:   these increases are of necessity, based on information about levelsof cost earlier than the date from which the new charges are to be applied(1 April 1981).OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS5. The report also contains a number of miscellaneous recommendationsconcerning minor forms of pay and allowances:  none of these is of anysignificance - apart, perhaps, from the negative one not to recommendincreased Territorial Army boxinties with effect from 1982, which ma} attractseme criticism in the House0    If we were to wish to offer higher financialinducements in order to recruit more reservists this would not prevent usfrom doing so as a separate exercise later in the year.COST6. The gross cost oi the award would be 10^ 3 per cent;  the Ret cost,taking account of the increased charges for food and accommodation, would be9.4 per cent ( 197 million).    On 19 November last year (CC(80) 4lstConclusions, Minute 5) the Cabinet agreed that if our decisions on therecommendations of the AFPRB entailed an increase in the Armed Forces paybill beyond the 6 per cent already provided in the defence cash limit, thecash limit should be increased by the full amount involved.RECOMMENDATION7. I invite colleagues to agree to accept the recommendations of theAFPRB in their Tenth Report, on th^ basis of Cabinet&apos;s conclusions lastNovember,J NMinistry of Defence28 April 19812CONFIDENTIAL
