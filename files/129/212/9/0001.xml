TRADE POLICYGovernment Reply to Imports and Exports, the First Report fromthe Industry and Trade Committee in the Session 1980-81INTRODUCTION1. Imports and Exports, the Report by the Select Committee on Industry andTrade on its major inquiry during 1980 into why the United Kingdom does notexport more and import less, was published in February 1981 (HC 109). TheGovernment is grateful to the Committee for its comprehensive consideration ofthe very wide range of issues which arise, and for its valuable independent analysisof the often conflicting considerations that the Government has to weigh both insetting the broad direction of the United Kingdom&apos;s international trade policy andin reaching day-to-day decisions on its implementation.2. This White Paper falls into five parts. Part I, paragraphs 3 to 7, summarisesthe Government&apos;s general approach to trade policy, and deals with some generalissues that arise in several places in the Committee&apos;s Report. Parts II-V,paragraphs 10 to 73, reply in detail to the Committee&apos;s specific recommendations,dealt with in an order set out and explained in paragraphs 8 and 9.PARTI3. Since the United Kingdom is a member of the European Community, theframework for our commercial relations with other member states of theCommunity is fundamentally different from that for external trade policy, that ispolicy in relation to countries outside the Community, often called thirdcountries. The basis of the Community Treaties is to establish a single internalmarket within the Community. Any problems arising regarding trade within theCommunity fall to be dealt with under their provisions for the free movement ofgoods and other rules, particularly those on competition; the implications of theseare discussed in paras 48 and 49.4. Regarding trade with third countries, Article 113 of the EEC Treatyestablishes that the Community is to have a common commercial policy. Thesubstance of this is settled by the Community machinery, notably the Council ofMinisters. The decisions and actions of the Community are mostly taken either inthe framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), theinternational agreement to which all major market-economy countries are parties,which establishes the basic rules for international trade, or in the context of itsother international obligations to particular trading partners. The decisions thatthe Government has to take on external trade policy are therefore largely as to thedirection in which the influence of the United Kingdom in the Council of Ministersand other Community machinery should be exerted. The Committee attachedimportance at several points in its report to the ability of the United Kingdom andCommunity to act unilaterally on trade issues. However, the existence of acommon commercial policy naturally constrains the scope for such action by theUnited Kingdom. When action is required, it has to be taken by the Community onbehalf of the UK. Of course, the Community, with its tariff - free access to a largeand prosperous West European market, also enables the United Kingdom tonegotiate internationally with the weight of a major trading group.3
5. As the Committee recognises, among the fundamental facts underlying theUnited Kingdom&apos;s policy toward international trade is that we lack self-sufficiency in food and raw materials and therefore depend heavily on exports ofmanufactured goods, as well as on our invisible exports. No other major indus-trialised country exports such a high proportion of its gross domestic product, sointernational trade is of greater importance to us than to other countries. Openinternational trade promotes economic growth and the satisfaction of consumerneeds and acts as a valuable spur to efficiency and innovation. So the Governmentconsiders the right trade policy for the United Kingdom is to support theinternational consensus that both tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade should bereduced, in accordance with the agreements reached in the Tokyo Round ofGATT Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTNs), and that all governments shouldresist pressures for unjustified protectionist measures.6. Within this policy framework there is nevertheless substantial scope foraction on imports either to assist industries in serious structural difficulties causedby low cost competition or to protect established industries from damage byunfair competition through dumping or subsidisation. Under the Multi-FibreArrangement the Community operates a very extensive range of quantitativerestrictions on imports of textiles and clothing, and the Government is very activein using these arrangements to protect the British market. Like some otherindustrialised countries, the Community has special arrangements for steelimports reflecting the particular characteristics of trade in that sector. TheGovernment is ready to consider most carefully appropriate cases for emergencysafeguard action under Article XIX of the GATT, and it attaches high priority tohelping British industry put forward cases for anti-dumping action to theEuropean Commission.7. But as the evidence to the Committee illustrates&apos;, the Government cannotlook at cases for protective action in isolation. Article XIX of the GATT allowsretaliatory action if agreement cannot be reached to compensate a party adverselyaffected by emergency safeguard action by some other concession. There can beadverse effects on the whole of our commercial relations with another country,and our exports to it, if we take protective action in one sector such as textiles. Anyrecourse to protective action can increase pressures for protectionist action on allindustrialised governments and the danger of starting a slide into widespreadprotectionist action, which it is absolutely essential should be avoided. TheGovernment takes all these considerations into account in reaching its decisions,and is determined to continue to pursue, both in general and in particular cases,trade policies that will further a sound revival of the United Kingdom economy.8. This paper now turns to deal specifically with the various recommendationsmade by the Committee. Some, notably recommendations 6, 9, 10, 13 and 21,have been dealt with in Part II because there are specific relevant GATTagreements, but are also relevant to trade within the Community. Therecommendations have been grouped as follows:Part II:       Issues arising in the framework of the GATT and the relatedagreements.Part III:      Issues to do with trade within the Community.&apos;HC 109-11, page 619.4
Part IV:      Issues to do with the promotion of exports.Part V:       Wider issues of economic and industrial policy affecting importsand exports.9. The following table shows where each recommendation from theCommittee is replied to:Recommendation ParagraphNos.

Untilit is more widely obeyed HMG and the Community should stand ready to takeunilateral action whenever appropriate. This applies specifically in the case of thecodification of safeguard measures under Article XIX of the GA TT.5
10. The Government recognises that the various agreements within the GATTframework are not always fully observed. In particular cases there can belegitimate differences of opinion about how the agreements apply, and manyother Contracting Parties to the GATT would take the view that the Community,no less than many others, sometimes does not fully observe them. Mostgovernments at times encounter problems in adhering to their GATT obligations,notably when strong domestic interests are at stake or when these obligationsrequire changes in national legislation. Such cases however are relatively rare. Anenormous and increasing volume of goods is traded internationally year by year infull compliance with international rules. Thus the GATT system encouragesinvestment in trade-dependent enterprises by providing reasonable securityagainst arbitrary interruptions of trade flows.11. Where there are difficulties the GATT system provides valuable alterna-tives to bilateral confrontation, retaliation and disruption; a multilateral forumfor consultation, conciliation and negotiation, a panel system which provides forimpartial assessment of the merits of a dispute, and neutral assistance in disputesettlement. In very many cases difficulties can be solved or contained by thesemethods. The Government considers that these resources for the settlement ofgrievances should, except in emergencies, be used to the full before consideration isgiven to recourse to unilateral action. But where they fail, the Government willnaturally consider the whole range of options available within the GATTframework for the defence of the trading interests of the United Kingdom, whichin some circumstances include retaliation, and firmly press its view in theCommunity.12. The Government however considers that actions incompatible with theGATT framework should be ruled out, because it firmly adheres to the principlethat international commitments must be observed and because the alternativewould be damaging to the UK. Since the UK is more dependent on its exports thanalmost any other large trading nation it has a major interest in strengthening theopen world trading system. Rather than undermining this system by flouting itsrules the Government seeks to ensure through the Community that breaches of therules by other countries are speedily identified and remedies obtained, particularlywhere the UK&apos;s interests are involved.13. As regards the application of Article XIX of the GATT, occasionalinstances where that Article has been used selectively (that is, not against all tradepartners who do not have preferential agreements), demonstrate that action ofthis kind is possible. Negotiations for a safeguards code are continuing in theGATT but the Government does not think it would be helpful to press in theCommunity for further codification on selectivity, since the absence of specificcodification does not debar selective action. Assessment of whether selectivemeasures, as distinct from non-discriminatory actions, are appropriate inparticular cases has to take account of the different repercussions of each type ofmeasure.Recommendation 23: Lowering tariffs and retaliationHMG and the EEC must maintain the international momentum developed inthe Tokyo Round of trade negotiations within the GA TTto ensure that remainingtariff and non-tariff barriers are gradually eliminated world-wide. While thisshould preferably take place by general international agreement, in default of6
such agreement we recommend that HMG and the Community should take actionto apply pressure on those countries which maintain excessive tariffs or unilateralnon-tariff barriers. So far as the UK is concerned, HMG should consider thepossibility, if persuasion fails, of a measure of retaliation.14. The Government recognises that there are some sectors, such as wooltextiles, where our exporters face in overseas markets tariff barriers much higherthan those operated in the same sector by the Community. The current pattern oftariff levels reflects those in operation at the inception of the GATT, which in turnreflected the industrial structure of the country concerned, and the extent (varyinggreatly from country to country and product to product) to which they have beenreduced in subsequent rounds of GATT tariff negotiation. Some smallerdeveloped countries and developing countries have retained GATT rights to usehigh tariffs, as the Community has done in some sectors, notably on someagricultural products. Where others&apos; tariffs are important obstacles to UKexporters, the Government has taken the opportunity of successive rounds oftariff negotiation to get them reduced as far as possible, but negotiating partnershave the right not to offer concessions, or to offer them only at an unacceptableprice in terms of import concessions by us in the same or other fields.15. The tariff cuts agreed in the Tokyo Round are taking place on a phasedbasis, and will not be complete until 1987. The Community and its partners havebound themselves in the GATT not to exceed the tariff levels then agreed, and itwould not be possible to re-open a part of that negotiated package. While it ispremature to consider a further general round of tariff negotiations, theGovernment takes every appropriate opportunity in the course of its own and theCommunity&apos;s bilateral commercial relations to press for the removal oramelioration of tariff and non-tariff barriers where this would help Britishexporters. Where non-tariff barriers are unilateral in the sense of being contrary tothe GATT or to one of the Tokyo Round agreements, the Government pursuestheir removal in the various GATT fora, and where possible will take retaliatoryaction. In each case the extent to which pressure can usefully be applied and themerits of retaliatory action, or threat of it, have to be assessed in the light of thewhole of our commercial and political relationship with the country concerned.16. The Government agrees with the Committee that the process of gradualreduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade should continue. It could not,however, in the present state of world economic development subscribe to the viewthat the objective is necessarily the complete elimination of tariffs. Reasonable (asdistinct from excessive) tariffs have long been regarded as having a legitimate rolein commercial policy. Their complete abolition would require, at the least, a muchgreater degree of economic integration world-wide than presently appearspossible.17. On the subject of tariffs, the Committee commented1 on the state of ourinternational obligations on tariff levels. Under the EEC Treaty the UnitedKingdom cannot have its own tariff in addition to the Common Customs Tariff.While there are GATT provisions which could cover a re-negotiation of theCommunity&apos;s commitments to its present tariff levels, a general tariff increase ofany significance could not be undertaken without major disruption of the gradualtariff cutting process which has been going on now for some thirty years, and the&apos;Report, paragraph 109.7
likelihood that our major trading partners would take corresponding retaliatoryaction against our exporters.Recommendation 11: GATT Article XIX - recognition of serious injuryThe Department of Trade should draw up a guidance document for tradeassociations so that industry may clearly understand the factors which, takencumulatively, provide grounds for establishing that &apos;serious injury&apos;, asunderstood within GA TT, has taken place.18. Following the Committee&apos;s recommendation the Department hasproduced a guide for industry on the factors that should be considered inestablishing that serious injury has taken place within the meaning of Article XIXof the GATT. Since the term &apos;serious injury&apos; is not defined in the GATT no preciseindication can be given of the degree of injury which in the view of the parties tothe GATT would justify emergency safeguard action. Each case is considered onits merits and the guide simply reflects practice in the operation of Article XIX.The text of the guide is to be found annexed to this paper (page 24).19. The guide relates only to imports from countries whose trade with theCommunity is governed by the GATT. Trade within the Community is governedby the EEC Treaty while trade between the Community and certain other - mainlydeveloping - countries is governed primarily by the provisions of bilateralagreements which they have concluded with the Community.Recommendation 4: Assistance to industries on inter-industry agreementsWe recommend that HMG, like overseas governments, provide support forindustries during negotiations relating to inter-industry agreements. If an industrydraws attention to a breach of any agreement HMG should be ready to use itsresidual powers.20. The Government is in favour of direct industry to industry discussions inorder to resolve specific sectoral trade problems, wherever possible. Inappropriate cases the Government does provide support. If such discussions werenot to succeed the dangers of retaliation against our exports would have to be fullyassessed if restrictions on imports were to be called for in any sector.21. In the case of trade with Japan, regular discussions between industries inparticular product areas have been important in encouraging Japaneseunderstanding of difficulties facing UK industry and the voluntary restraint ofJapan&apos;s exports. The Government fully supports these discussions and continuesto watch closely their effectiveness in moderating exports to the UK.Recommendation 1: EEC and dumpingThe EEC must take much more rapid and effective action when complaints ofdumping are made and be seen to be doing so. To this end we recommend thatHMG should redouble its efforts to persuade the Community through its BudgetCouncil to provide a substantial increase in the very modest staff now allocated tothe anti-dumping team in the Commission. If necessary HMG should offer tosecond members of the DoT anti-dumping unit to the Commission. We support 38
of the recommendations of the CBI Working Party on Instruments ofCommercial Defence the full text of which is given in paragraph 22.22. The Government fully accepts the need for rapid and effective measures tocounter the harmful effects on Community industry of dumped or subsidisedimports and the need for sufficient resources to be allocated to work in this area toensure that it is carried out as swiftly as possible. It was with these considerationsin mind that in discussions in the Community Budget Council last year theGovernment argued strongly for a strengthening of the Commission&apos;s anti-dumping staff and now welcomes the additional provision that is being made. It isnot yet clear whether the new staffing level will prove sufficient to meet theCommission&apos;s increasing workload and the Government will, therefore, keep upits pressure for the provision of adequate resources for anti-dumping work. Inaddition it will continue to maintain within the Department of Trade an Anti-Dumping Unit to assist UK industry in the preparation of applications for anti-dumping action and to support the Commission in its investigations into caseswhere there is a UK interest. The unit has recently issued an information packdesigned to explain what can be done to remedy dumping and what forms of helpthe unit can give. Through close co-operation with the Commission the unit seekswherever possible to remove obstacles in the way of rapid progress on cases ofinterest to UK industry.23. The Department of Trade is already prepared to second members of theanti-dumping unit to serve with the Commission as national experts and one UKexpert is on secondment to the Commission at the moment. However, under theregulations governing the Community Budget, while the salaries of nationalexperts are paid by their national administrations, allowances and local costs arepaid by the Commission. Thus secondment of national experts is in practicelimited by similar financial constraints to those affecting the use of additionalCommission staff.24. In its recommendation the Committee expressed support for three of therecommendations of the CBI Working Party on Instruments of CommercialDefence:(i) The Commission should be ready to make demands on the importer orsupplier of dumped goods to provide prompt and adequate information.25. In practice the Commission already imposes reasonable time limits for theprovision of evidence needed for the investigation of an anti-dumping case. Whileit is true that unlike United States law the Community legislation contains noformal time limits for the various stages of an anti-dumping case, in fact theCommission applies time limits for the provision of information from suppliers,importers or other interested parties. There have been few, if any, cases whereprogress has been seriously impeded by delaying tactics on the part of a supplier orimporter in the provision of essential information. In any event where delayappears excessive the Commission can act on the best available information1, andit has done so in several recent cases.(ii) When a case has been established the Commission should be more ready toimpose a definitive anti-dumping duty than a price undertaking.&apos;Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3017/79, Article 7 (7)(b).9
26. The decision whether to accept a price undertaking or to impose adefinitive duty is taken by the Commission (after discussion with the MemberStates) in the light of the circumstances of each particular case. In 1980 the greatmajority of cases were concluded by the acceptance of price undertakings fromsome sources of supply and the imposition of duties on others. The underlyingrationale of the CBI recommendation appears to be that price undertakings maybe more easily evaded than duties but undertakings are monitored by theCommission (and the Development of Trade in cases of interest to the UK) andmay be reviewed at the request of an interested party who submits evidence tosupport the need for review. Where a price undertaking has been violated theCommission may reopen investigation of the case and may apply provisionalmeasures if that is warranted.(iii) Once it has been established that goods are being dumped and are causinginjury appropriate measures should be taken as a matter of course. There shouldbe no further exercise of discretion.27. As the CBI Report points out, Article 12 of Council Regulation (EEC)No. 3017/79 requires the Commission and Member States to take account of theinterests of the Community in determining whether or not a definitive anti-dumping or countervailing duty should be imposed. This requirement is howeverrarely, if ever, invoked to the detriment of a producer. It is mainly intended tocover special circumstances, for instance if the Commission&apos;s investigationsreveal that a price fixing cartel is behind an anti-dumping application. In practiceit has not been an obstruction in the path of industries which have a legitimateclaim to protection.Recommendation 7: Import duty on componentsWe recommend that where manufacturers can show HMG that the import dutyon component parts as opposed to finished goods is to the detriment of Britishproduction this should be rectified.28. The customs duties chargeable in the United Kingdom are thoseestablished in the Community&apos;s common customs tariff (CCT). Amendments tothe CCT require Community agreement as it provides general protection for theCommunity&apos;s economy and has to take account of the variety of trade interests inall parts of the Community. The tariff is also a negotiating instrument used toobtain reductions in the tariffs levied on our exports by third countries. Thepresent tariff levels have evolved in the course of successive multilateral tradenegotiations in which the Community has aimed to strike a balance between theadvantages of securing more favourable tariff treatment for exports to thirdcountries and the need to maintain protection for Community producers.29. For most industrial products the Community has a commitment under theGATT to maintain the tariffs within certain specified levels. The Communitywould be liable to pay compensation, in terms of tariff reductions on otherproducts, if any of these levels were exceeded. On the other hand to reduce a dutyautonomously would lessen the level of protection afforded to Communityproducers without any compensating advantage to them.10
30. The Government is aware of the possibility that the duty structure of theCCT may be a factor contributing to problems for certain sectors of UK industryand is ready to consider means of providing a measure of relief, for example bysecuring the agreement of our Community partners to the temporary exemptionfrom, or reduction of, the duty on certain specifically defined products notavailable from Community sources, whilst at the same time maintaining thegeneral level of tariff protection for Community producers. Furthermore, whereit is necessary to import third country goods for use in products for export to thirdcountries, and to do so would not conflict with the essential interests ofCommunity producers of goods identical or similar to those being imported, relieffrom customs duty is available under the Community&apos;s inward processing reliefarrangements. Individual authorisations for such relief on motors for lawnmowers have in fact been granted for a number of years to United Kingdommanufacturers including the company whose evidence is referred to in paragraph81 of the Report.31. The Government recognises that other Member States may sometimesadopt a different interpretation of the rules governing tariff classification. Thereare problems however in achieving complete harmonisation of classificationbecause of the many thousands of tariff subheadings and numerous customsoffices throughout the Community. Nevertheless close liaison exists between thecustoms services of the Member States and the Commission aimed at securing theuniform application of the CCT.Recommendation 8: Consultation with Customs and ExciseThe Departments of Trade and Industry should initiate urgent discussions withH M Customs &amp; Excise to ensure that the Board&apos;s activities strike the correctbalance between the interests of the importer, the consumer and the Britishmanufacturer.32. After consideration and discussion between the three Departments, theGovernment is satisfied that the arrangements for interdepartmental consultationenable the Board of Customs &amp; Excise, in exercising their statutory responsi-bilities, to take full account of, and balance, the various interests affected by theiractivities.33. More specifically, this recommendation reflects concern expressed byrepresentatives of the UK motor industry that there exists in this country nonational type approval system for goods vehicles under which compliance withprescribed constructional standards must be checked before the vehiclesconcerned can be used on the roads. In the absence of such a system they suggestedthat Customs officers should assume certain extra responsibilities for checkinggoods vehicles entering the country.34. Since this evidence was taken, the Secretary of State for Transport hascommenced consultations with industry on a scheme of national type approval forgoods vehicles. With the setting up of such a scheme the fundamental point madeby the Committee would be met.35. The national type approval scheme currently proposed covers only basicconstruction standards. In so far as there is a need to supplement type approval11
arrangements, the Government considers that the Department of Transport&apos;sGoods Vehicle Centre, which already assembles details of heavy goods vehiclemodels coming on to the market for the use of testing stations, is best equipped toassess the compliance of imported commercial vehicles with complex technicalstandards and to take appropriate follow-up action. Such action has been pursuedeffectively in a number of cases recently.Recommendation 22: Japan&apos;s role in international tradeWe welcome Japan&apos;s indication that it will become more open to imports fromother countries. We recommend that in international negotiations HMG and theCommunity should persuade the Japanese Government to play a full part in themanagement of the world economy, to exercise &apos;prudence&apos; in its export policiesover a wide front and on a far greater scale than at present, and to facilitate theentry of manufactured imports to the Japanese market. The Japanese must bebrought, by persuasion, or if that fails by the possibility of retaliation, to realisethat it is in their own interest to take such action.36. The Government is generally in agreement with the view expressed by theCommittee in this recommendation. It will continue to take every opportunity tostress to the Japanese Government that it is in Japan&apos;s own interest to import a fargreater proportion of manufactured goods and to export in a responsible manner,which does not cause serious damage to our own industries. Several tradeassociations have discussed with their Japanese counterparts trade with Japan intheir sectors. This has led to Japanese restraint in their exports to the UnitedKingdom. The Government gives its full support to these discussions.Furthermore it has fully supported the recent declarations by the CommunityCouncil of Ministers on trade relations between Japan and the Community. Thesehave expressed serious concern at the imbalance of trade between the Communityand Japan, and have called on Japan to moderate exports to the Community, andto increase imports. In addition surveillance has been introduced by theCommission on imports from Japan of passenger cars, colour televisions andtubes and certain machine tools. It has been made clear to the JapaneseGovernment that if it does not take action, there is a real risk that the Communitymay be forced to take steps to deal with the situation itself. There would bedangers in this course of action, referred to in paragraph 7, which would have to beweighed carefully.Recommendation 25: Barriers to trade in Newly Industrialised CountriesWithin the framework of the GA TT a sustained international effort needs to bemade to persuade the most developed of the newly industrialising countries (NICs)to remove their remaining - and sometimes increasing   restrictive barriers totrade. We welcome the action recently taken by the Community to alter thetreatment to be accorded to those countries under the Generalised Scheme ofPreferences, and we recommend that HMG should continue to press strongly forsimilar action to be taken in any future negotiations.37. The Government accepts this recommendation. The restrictive barriers totrade in the newly industrialising countries vary widely. A few countries have veryliberal import policies. Under the Community&apos;s Generalised Scheme ofPreferences for 1981, firm tariff quotas are imposed on imports of sensitive items12
from the most competitive newly industrialising countries in each case. TheCouncil of Ministers also agreed to examine closely in each annual review the levelof benefits granted to those countries, and called upon the Commission, in itsbilateral contracts with such countries, to point out to them that the Community&apos;sattitude in its annual reviews of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences is likely tobe affected by progress made by these countries in removing restrictions in theirmarkets to imports from the Community.38. The Government intends to use available opportunities, both in GATTand otherwise, to press for the removal of restrictive barriers to trade in the NICs,which is in the interests of the trade of developing countries as well as of our own.Recommendations 9,10,13 and 21: Standards and technical regulationsHMG and the Community should devote increasing efforts to work onstandards, testing and approval of goods and materials. Urgent considerationsshould be given to methods of speeding up the Community&apos;s harmonisationprogramme as part of a wider process of standardisation internationally. (Recom-mendation 9.)In general we do not favour the use of standards as barriers to imports exceptwhere, for instance, genuine consumer safety issues are involved. The use by othercountries of technical barriers to imports is a serious matter and we believe that atleast as a negotiating counter HMG and the Community should be ready toconsider the erection of &apos;countervailing&apos; standards where appropriate.(Recommendation 10.)If a Community-wide agreement on standards cannot be reached HMG shouldspeed up progress by negotiating on a bilateral basis with countries with which wehave particular problems. We recommend that HMG should make it clear thatthey will be more ready to take bilateral action and to do so more quickly.(Recommendation 13.)HMG must accept the need for a UK national body to set mandatory standardsfor, to test and to certify, appropriate products, whether for domesticallyproduced goods for home consumption, or export, or for imported goods.(Recommendation 21.)39. Regarding Recommendation 9, the Government readily accepts theimportance of standards in contributing to the efficiency and competitiveness ofUK industry. The Government makes a substantial contribution to the BritishStandards Institution (BSI) by providing both technical and policy advice on itsCommittees. The Government interest is further reflected in its grant-in-aid to theBSI which matches allowable subscription income on a pound for pound basis. Inthe last financial year the grant amounted to about  2,150,000 and for 1981-82provision has been made for a grant-in-aid of up to  3,024,000 provided matchingsubscriptions are forthcoming. After allowing for inflation this provides for asubstantial increase. The Government also shares the concern of the Committeeabout the need to speed up the Community&apos;s harmonisation programme. Itwelcomes the fact that since we joined the Community 88 directives harmonisingtechnical regulations in the industrial sector have been agreed. Its objective is toimprove the effectiveness of the programme by relating it to real market needs. It13
is also supporting a Commission proposal for a Council Decision on technicalregulations and standards (COM(80)400) which is aimed at improving co-operation between the standards bodies of the Member States and providing amore responsive and effective means of dealing with future barriers to trade thatmight arise.40. Recommendation 10 is concerned with the use of standards, as barriers toimports, and the Government accepts that standards should not be used in thisway. As a signatory of the GATT Agreement on technical barriers to trade the UKis committed to working towards their elimination. There is however provision inthe GATT Agreement for dealing with loss of mutual economic advantage whereother participants are failing to honour its obligations and the Government isprepared to initiate such action where it is clear that another country is deliberatelyusing standards as technical barriers to trade. As a major exporting country it isvery much in our interest to support and encourage acceptance of internationalobligations and the greater the success we have in this direction the more we willenhance the opportunites for UK exporters.41. Recommendation 13 encourages bilateral discussions with other MemberStates where there are problems of concern to the UK. An agreement has now beenreached between Member States whereby problems facing manufacturers in thewhole area of standards and certification procedures can be discussed on abilateral or trilateral basis. Each Member State has been asked to designate acontact point in order to ensure rapid and effective liaison and the Governmentintends to take the maximum advantage of this new procedure. The existence ofthis new arrangement has been made known widely amongst UK manufacturersand they have been urged to provide the Department of Trade with details of caseswhere they have problems so that these can be taken up with the Member Stateconcerned through these contact points.42. Recommendation 21 calls for the establishment of a UK national body toset mandatory standards and certification procedures. Adequate powers alreadyexist for setting mandatory standards and certification procedures where these arenecessary. The responsibility for setting such requirements lies with differentDepartments but there is close co-operation between them when taking suchaction.43. The Government is well advanced in a detailed examination of the scopefor making wider use of certification and testing schemes for both regulatory andpublic purchasing purposes. Guidelines and criteria are being developed for theco-ordinated recognition of certification bodies to serve the Government&apos;s needs.The existence of bodies recognised in this way should make it much easier tonegotiate bilateral arrangements with similar bodies overseas. The setting up ofthe National Testing Laboratory Accreditation Scheme (NATLAS) wasannounced in 1980. It should be operational later this year and will provide a solidbasis for supporting certification schemes, and a means for enhancing the statusof UK testing houses, if they so wish, to strengthen their contribution to the exporteffort. In the light of these developments, the Government does not consider itnecessary to create a new body to set mandatory standards and certificationprocedures.14
Recommendation 6: Public purchasingHMG must give high priority to its recently announced policy of using publicpurchasing to assist British industry. We recommend that this policy must befollowed to the fullest extent possible compatible with our internationalobligations and that HMG should investigate further how this policy can be madeto work.44. The Government can firmly assure the Committee that high priority isbeing given to the effective implementation of its policy that public purchasingshould be used to promote the competiveness of suppliers as they can win businessonly on value for money grounds.45. The Government has asked public purchasers to seek to improve theindustrial performance of their suppliers. Government Departments,nationalised industries and local authorities can do this by such means as:  discussing their possible requirements at an early stage with potentialsuppliers;  encouraging product and process innovation, particularly better design andmanufacturing methods;  avoiding over detailed specifications and, often, by setting specifications inperformance terms;  maintaining even ordering patterns where practicable;  de-briefing unsuccessful tenderers on the deficiencies in their bids.46. As it stated in its reply1 to the Committee&apos;s Report on the Civil AviationAuthority radar replacement programme, the Government is fully committed to apolicy of this nature, consistent with its international obligations. Public sectorpurchasers cannot, however, give effect to this policy acting alone. It is industrythat has to develop products and processes which are competitively conceived,designed and priced both for national and international markets.PART III: TRADE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY47. In addition to the issues specific to trade within the Community dealt within paragraphs 48 to 51, paragraphs 39 to 46, dealing with standards, technicalregulations and public purchasing, are in general relevant to trade within as well asoutside the Community. Similarly relevant are many of the replies to recommen-dations affecting exporting and economic and industrial policy generally, set outin Parts IV and V of this paper.Recommendations 2 and 3: EEC competition cases and HMG assistanceWe fully share the Government&apos;s continuing dissatisfaction with the outcomeof competition cases in the EEC and urge that, if the Commission is unwilling orunable to enforce the rules, HMG should be ready to take strong action,unilaterally if necessary, where important British economic interests are involved.(Recommendation 2.)&apos;HC (1980-81)33.15
The Department of Trade must provide more effective assistance to Britishindustries which believe that they have a case to make within the Community&apos;scompetition rules. (Recommendation 3.)48. The government is sensitive to the right of industry in the United Kingdomto the full benefit of the Community&apos;s competition rules. It has no grounds forbelieving that the Commission is unwilling to enforce them. The Commission&apos;sability to do so depends first and foremost - as always in implementing the rule oflaw-on solid evidence that the rules have been breached. The Governmentcannot agree that it would be acceptable, or in our economic interests, for anyMember State to take unilateral action, which would be illegal.49. Within the single market of the European Community &quot;dumping&apos;&apos; has nolegal meaning: imports cannot be considered &quot;unfair&quot; solely because they arecheap. The Department of Trade, along with sponsoring Departments, does givepractical assistance to industries which feel they have a case of a possible breach ofthe competition rules of the Treaty of Rome. It advises on the type of evidencerequired by the Commission, and will give help in assembling that evidence and inthe presentation of it. So although the primary responsibility rests with industry,the Government stands ready to help.Recommendation 20: EEC opportunities for British businessWhatever their views on the UK&apos;s accession to the Community, Britishmanufacturers must make the most of all the opportunities arising from ourmembership of it, familiarise themselves with its institutions and methods ofworking, and accept the possibilities it offers as a large tariff-free market close athand.50. The Government agrees. These points are of crucial importance to makingthe most of the commercial opportunities presented by Community membership.It endorses the Committee&apos;s references to the importance of the tariff-free marketavailable in Western Europe. In October 1980 the Secretary of State for Trade setup a new Banch   Exports to Europe Branch - within the Department of Tradewith the aim of assisting UK industry to focus its attention on the opportunities ofthe Western European market. During 1981 this Branch will be organising a majorcampaign, including a series of conferences around the UK, to underline theeconomic importance of the Western European market to United Kingdom trade.51. There is a wealth of advice available to firms on the workings of theCommunity, not only from Government Departments, the United KingdomPermanent Representative in Brussels and the European Commission (which alsohas information offices in London, Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh), but alsofrom trade organisations. The Government welcomes the CBI&apos;s current attentionto means of improving communications between industry in the United Kindomand the Community institutions.PART PV: EXPORTINGRecommendation 16: Exporting not a marginal activityWe recommend that the BOTB and the Departments of Trade and Industryincrease their efforts to impress upon British firms engaged, or thinking of16
engaging, in the export trade that exporting must be a central rather than amarginal activity. It requires a great effort but it brings great rewards.52. The Government notes the Committee&apos;s recommendation. This theme isalready central to much of the counselling on export activities which is available tocompanies through the British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) and theDepartments of Trade and Industry. It is also a central part of the programme ofexport conferences mounted by the Board. The BOTB is currently reviewingpriorities in its publicity activity and will take account of the Committee&apos;srecommendations in the course of this review. The resources available for exportpromotion are necessarily limited and therefore much of the advisory workcarried out by Government must concentrate on helping with companies&apos; specificproblems rather than on more general issues which may not be relevant to theparticular problems confronting individual companies.Recommendation 17: Exporting by small businessesWe recommend that proprietors of small businesses should co-operate withother businesses in the same or associated trades in efforts to increase theirexports. They should make use of the services of a UK export house, either onealready in existence or one to be specially formed, but operating on a strictlycommercial basis.53. The Government has sympathy with the Committee&apos;s recommendationthat proprietors of small businesses should co-operate with other businesses in thesame or associated trades in efforts to increase their exports and that they shouldmake use of the services of UK export houses. However the individualcircumstances of companies vary widely and there may well be cases where suchco-operative ventures are not practicable. A number of the services provided byGovernment through the BOTB do in fact provide opportunities for inter-company co-operation, and for experienced export companies to provide help andguidance to the newcomers.Recommendation 24: Scotch Whisky   export problemsWe draw attention to the widespread discrimination against Scotch Whisky andin favour of locally produced spirits, both inside and outside the EEC. HMGshould exert itself more forcefully and successfully to safeguard the faircompetitive opportunities of this important British export.54. The Government appreciates the unique position and prformance of theScotch Whisky industry (1980 exports of  748m represented 27 per cent of totalexports of food and drinks, and were second only to the vehicles industry as thelargest single exporter of manufactured products) in overcoming many difficultiesin expanding its exports. The Government and the Scotch Whisky Associationhave long co-operated in seeking to eliminate discrimination against ScotchWhisky imports within and outside the Community, and the abolition of the WineGallon method of tax assessment in the US and alterations of taxation affectingScotch Whisky in Japan illustrate that this approach can be effective. Officialefforts on behalf of the Scotch Whisky industry are likely to be most effectivewhen they are pursued bilaterally or through Community procedures, at times and17
in places which present the best opportunities for success, in the judgement of theScotch Whisky Association and the Government Departments involved. Therecent formation of a Scotch Whisky Exports Steering Group, under Departmentof Trade chairmanship, brings together representatives of the appropriateGovernment Departments and of the Scotch Whisky industry to facilitate this co-operation.1.Recommendation 26: Industrial relationsThe British Overseas Trade Board and British posts overseas should do all intheir power to publicise the true state of industrial relations in the UK, pointingout how the incidence of strikes here compares favourably with that of many ofour competitors.55. The Government accepts that the BOTB and British Posts overseas shouldpublicise the true state of industrial relations in the UK. It is certainly necessary toensure that people overseas have an accurate impression of the state of industrialrelations in this country and the Government accepts that it is an important part ofthe task of the Board and of Posts overseas to make sure that this is so.Recommendation 28: Membership of trade missionsIn officially funded and in privately sponsored trade missions to other countriesrepresentatives of the work-force as well as of management should take part, sincewe believe it essential that there should be a fuller and wider understanding of thenature of the competition which UK industries now face.56. The BOTB agrees with this recommendation and encourages industry toinclude representatives of the work-force in trade missions. Under the Board&apos;sOutward Mission Scheme (which covers most markets except North America,Western Europe and the Mediterranean sea-board) members of approved trademissions, normally one per company, receive grants towards costs. Consistentwith its wider aim of encouraging closer association between management and theshop-floor in export activity, the Board offers participating firms second grants toinclude shop floor representatives. This facility has not been used much in the pastbut sponsors of missions will continue to be reminded of it in letters givingapproval in principle to missions and in discussions. Virtually all BOTB supportedmissions consist of firms undertaking their own hard-selling work in the marketvisited; it is up to them to decide in conjunction with the sponsor whether toinclude a shop-floor representative in the mission but they have everyencouragement from the BOTB to do so.PART V: ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL POLICYRecommendation 5: Energy pricesUK industry must not continue to be placed at a disadvantage compared withother countries over energy prices, especially when those prices are within thecontrol of HMG. We welcome the recent announcement by the Government oftheir intention to participate in the NEDO inquiry into energy prices.&apos;See Department of Trade note, 23 October 1980 (Evidence, page 724).18
57. Oil prices are determined by world market conditions. For other fuels,although the Government agrees the financial framework within which thenationalised energy supply industries operate, prices are set not by Governmentbut by the industries themselves. The Report of the NEDC Energy Task Force1found that for the vast majority (over 95 per cent) of industrial consumers, pricesof electricity and gas were broadly in line with those in Europe. For a limitednumber of large users, however, by the end of 1980 prices had moved ahead ofthose charged to some major competitors on the Continent. A major reason givenin the NEDC report for these differences was the strengthening of sterling againstother European currencies during 1980.58. The NEDC findings were taken fully into account in reaching decisions onthe measures being taken by the gas and electricity industries to assist theircustomers. The measures announced by the Government on 10 March 19812,which are additional to steps already taken by the fuel industries, should benefitindustry by some  120m in the current financial year and are directed as far aspossible at the larger energy intensive users.59. Energy pricing cannot be based on matching energy prices to movementsin exchange rates or on the cost structure of another country. UK prices have tobalance UK markets and cover UK costs. It is in the interest of industry that thereshould be sufficient and secure supplies of energy for the future produced in themost efficient way. If we were to subsidise indiscriminately industrial use ofenergy, prices would not give the right economic incentive for producers todevelop new sources of supply and for consumers to invest in energy savingequipment and to make the correct fuel choice for their future needs.60. But the Government is concerned at difficulties of adjustment whichmany larger users face during the recession. The present measures represent asubstantial degree of further help, and the Government will continue to explorewith the supply industries all worthwhile measures of flexibility that might bemade available within their pricing arrangements.61. The Government welcomes the US action to decontrol domestic oil prices,allowing them to rise to world market levels. But distortions to trade will continuewhile US gas prices remain artificially low, and the Government therefore willcontinue to press for similar action on gas price controls to be taken as soon aspossible. All the Member States of the Community have agreed that energy shouldbe economically priced. The UK is taking every opportunity both in internationalfora and in bilateral exchanges to emphasise the importance of realistic energypricing.Recommendation 14: Multinational companiesHMG should keep under review the impact of the operations of multinationalcompanies on the UK&apos;s balance of payments and levels of employment.62. In general, multinational enterprises respond to changes in economiccircumstances in much the same way as do other companies. However, they dohave the ability to prepare and pursue strategies on a global level, and a capacity to&apos;National Economic Development Office, March 1981.2Houseof Commons Official Report, 10 March 1981, Cols 776-777.19
make changes in the pattern of their activities in different countries in response toeconomic stimuli. This means that decisions by individual multinationals, basedin the UK and overseas, can at times have significant effects on aspects of thedomestic economy. The Government therefore agrees that it should keep theiroperations under review as part of its general monitoring of commercial andindustrial developments.Recommendation 15: ProductivityAlthough we claim no originality for this recommendation, we urgeGovernment Departments to lose no opportunity of bringing to the attention of allin industry - employers&apos; associations, unions, boards of directors, managementand work-force  the need to raise productivity throughout all processes ofindustry. If productivity at all these levels reached that attained by our foremostforeign competitors, many of our other recommendations would be renderedunnecessary. Furthermore we believe that there is no long-term alternative togreater efforts on research and development and to a restructuring of Britishindustry in order to raise its overall efficiency at every level and to raise the value ofits output.63. The Government attaches the highest importance to the improvement ofproductivity as fundamental to reversing the decline in the UK&apos;s competitiveness.This will depend primarily on the ability of managements and the commitment oftheir work-forces to find more efficient ways of producing goods which peoplewant to buy. The main role of the Government is the creation of the right climatefor enterprise by defeating inflation, removing unnecessary distortions of marketforces and creating incentives.64. The subject is regularly discussed at the meetings of the NationalEconomic Development Council. The fifty sectoral Economic DevelopmentCommittees and Sector Working Parties, which report to the Council, areworking to a Steering Brief which asks them to &apos;encourage the widespreadadoption by companies of practices to promote the more efficient use of allresources including manpower, plant and equipment, materials, components andenergy, etc, and to promote an integral approach to marketing, product designand production technology, the use of appropriate manpower policies and theeffective targeting and monitoring of energy use&apos;. Nearly 1000people - employers, trade unionists, civil servants and others-are directlyinvolved in this work.65. In conjunction with the Production Engineering Research Association,the Department of Industry operates a Manufacturing Advisory Service whichprovides advice for small and medium sized firms with the objective of improvingefficiency and productivity by stimulating the adoption of equipment andtechniques using modern but well proven technology, and associated managementpractices.66. Judicious use of financial help under the Department of Industry&apos;svarious schemes of selective assistance can also assist new investment projectsinvolving improved performance, but in general the role of the Government is tocreate and maintain an environment in which industry can prosper.20
Recommendation 18: Minimum Lending RateWe recommend that HMG should as soon as possible reduce the MinimumLending Rate further so far as is compatible with the battle against inflation, inorder to reduce industrial costs and promote investment.67. The Government has always intended to reduce interest rates whenever itwas consistent with the broader objectives of achieving control of the moneysupply and thereby reducing inflation. With the Government&apos;s anti-inflationarypolicy showing clear signs of success the Government has been able to reduceMLR by five points to 12 per cent since last summer. UK short-term interest ratesare now among the lowest in OECD countries.Recommendation 19: Rate of exchangeWe recommend that in its consideration of policies which may affect theexchange rate HMG should bear in mind the assistance which would be given toexporters and to firms facing pressures from imports, by any measures whichcould be taken to restrain the present high values of sterling, if only for a period.68. The Government&apos;s policy is to allow the exchange rate to be determined bymarket forces, with intervention limited to &apos;smoothing&apos; excessive fluctuations andpreserving orderly markets. Competitiveness depends not only on the exchangerate but also on domestic costs, of which labour costs are the most importantcomponent. Over the last two years excessive pay settlements have had a greaterimpact on competitiveness than sterling&apos;s appreciation, accounting for well overhalf the change. Experience in the UK and elsewhere has shown that in order to tryto reduce exchange rates, governments have to cease to give priority to monetarytargets and to controlling inflation. Nevertheless, the level of the exchange rate isan important factor that is taken into account in determining the overall stance ofmacro-economic policy. For example, the strength of the exchange rate in 1980-81was one of the indicators (along with the high level of nominal and real interestrates, the absence of any marked upward movement in the prices of houses andother real assets, and so on) which suggested that financial conditions were tightand which, taken together with the progress made in reducing inflation, allowedfor the reductions in MLR announced in November and in the Budget.Recommendation 27: Inward investmentHMG ought urgently to review its policy towards inward investment and shouldseek to co-ordinate efforts to attract it.69. It is the Government&apos;s policy to welcome inward investment where itimproves our industrial base, creates additional employment, adds to net output,introduces new products and processes or brings new managerial skills.Investment from overseas is encouraged through the absence of restrictions suchas exchange controls, the availability of competitive financial incentives and bypositively promoting the UK as a location for investment. The Invest in BritainBureau, a unit within the Department of Industry, was set up specifically toencourage overseas companies to invest in the UK. It provides information andadvice to companies and arranges promotional events. The Bureau&apos;s remit coversthe UK as a whole but industrial promotion is also carried out separately on behalf21
of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, certain English regions and localauthorities and New Towns throughout Great Britain. The Governmentrecognises that the multiplicity of organisations thus involved in seeking to attractinward investment can result in duplication of effort and even confusion for thepotential investor.70. In April 1980, therefore, the Government established an officialcommittee, the Committee on Overseas Promotion, to co-ordinate overseaspromotion of inward investment. The Committee&apos;s terms of reference require it,inter alia, to keep under observation the distribution of resources being devoted tooverseas promotion by all the organisations represented on the Committee; toprevent clashes between overseas promotional activities and to discouragewasteful competition between those organisations. The Committee includesrepresentatives of the Department of Industry, the Department of theEnvironment, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Scottish EconomicPlanning Department, the Welsh Office Industry Department, the NorthernIreland Department of Commerce, the Scottish Development Agency and theDevelopment Corporation for Wales.71. A background of rising unemployment, pressures on public expenditureand a dearth of internationally mobile projects has made the work of theCommittee both more necessary and more difficult. It has, nevertheless, madeuseful progress in co-ordinating the activities of the Departments and agenciesrepresented on the Committee, and of the main English regional developmentbodies, and improved co-operation and understanding between Departments.Recommendation 29: Maximising the UK&apos;s advantagesHMG should work closely with both sides of industry to identify as a matter ofurgency those products and services where the UK enjoys an actual or potentialcomparative advantage and facilitate their development.72. The Government believes that the products and services which will begrowth areas of the future will be determined by the market. It is thereforeprimarily the responsibility of companies to respond to these marketopportunities. The Government assists companies to do this by supporting newtechnologies, products and processes under the Science and Technology Act andby selective assistance under the Industry Act. Similarly Government assistscompanies seeking major overseas project opportunities which industry itself hasidentified as worth pursuing. But these kinds of assistance cannot, however,substitute for industry&apos;s own efforts. The Government sees itself as beingprimarily responsible for improving the framework within which industryoperates by defeating inflation and creating an economic climate encouraging toenterprise and effort and the formation of new businesses. It does not believe thatefforts by Governments to identify and assist particular &apos;strategic&apos; industries havebeen successful or are likely to be in the future.73. The Government works closely with both sides of industry under theauspices of the National Economic Development Council, which meets regularlyto discuss general ways of improving our economic and industrial performance,and has considered work by NEDO identifying broad areas of potential UKgrowth, stability and decline. The Council is at present considering how to take22
this work forward. The NEDO&apos;s Economic Development Committees and SectorWorking Parties make a contribution to our trade performance by identifyingways in which their sectors could become more efficient and more competitive andthereby increase their share of world and UK markets.CONCLUSION74. The Government&apos;s decisions on both general and specific issuesconcerning the trade policy of the United Kingdom require it to balance all thedifferent interests involved. These include those of manufacturers here, whetherthey are producing primarily for our own market or for export, not only as sellersof finished products but also as users of intermediate products. Also of majorimportance is the interest of our own consumers in being able to buy both domesticand imported products at competitive prices. Sometimes this balancing comesdown in favour of protective action, sometimes against. But the Governmentbelieves that in all cases it can best protect and advance these various interests byreaching its decisions in a framework that supports and defends the open tradingsystem.23
ANNEXThe text of the Department of Trade guidance document on &apos;serious injury&apos; withreference to Article XIX of the GATT, referred to in paragraph 18, is below.Guide on proving injury for the application of import restrictions under ArticleXIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)1. Under the rules of the European Community Member States may introduceimport restrictions only with the Community&apos;s agreement. In consideringapplications for restrictions the Community in turn must take account of itsobligations under the GATT and in particular of the provisions of GATTArticle XIX.2. This note provides guidance for establishing that imports have causedserious injury within the meaning of Article XIX, which says inter alia:&apos;If, as a result of unforeseen developments and of the effect of the obligationsincurred by a contracting party under this Agreement, including tariffconcessions, any product is being imported into the territory of the contractingparty in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause orthreaten serious injury to domestic producers, the contracting party shall befree, in respect of such product, and to the extent and for such time as may benecessary to prevent or remedy such injury, to suspend the obligation in wholeor in part or to withdraw or modify the concession&apos;.3. The effect of the Article is that, in the specified circumstances, quantitativerestrictions may be imposed, or a duty increased beyond the ceiling otherwisepermitted by the party&apos;s obligations under the Agreement. In order to justifyaction under Article XIX it is necessary to demonstrate that serious injury to adomestic industry has been caused or is threatened by a surge in imports.4. Since the term &apos;serious injury&apos; has never been defined by the parties to theGATT no precise information can be given about the degree of injury whichwould necessarily justify emergency safeguard action. Each case is considered onits merits and the attached list simply indicates, on the basis of GATT practice andCommunity discussion of it what the relevant factors are likely to be. It must beemphasised that there has been relatively little recourse to this provision of theGATT and there is accordingly no substantial body of case history upon which tobase definitive or comprehensive criteria. The attached list is neither exhaustivenor exclusive.5. It is not necessary in each case to provide data on every factor in the list. Noris it essential for each factor to point to a worsening situation, though the generalpicture that emerges must be one of sharply deteriorating circumstances.6. It is open to any UK manufacturer suffering serious injury from imports tosubmit a case for emergency safeguard action. The normal procedure is for themanufacturer first to seek the support of his Trade Association, and for thatTrade Association then to discuss the matter with the Department of IndustryBranch responsible for sponsoring the industry in question. It is for theGovernment to decide, in the light of the facts put to it and any wider24
considerations of commercial or economic policy, whether and in what terms thecase should be submitted to the European Commission.7. It should be noted that Article XIX entitles countries whose exports areaffected by trade restrictions introduced under that Article to obtaincompensation in terms of tariff or other trade concessions and, in the absence ofadequate compensation, to retaliate against the trade of the country imposing therestrictions. For these reasons and for wider considerations of trade policy theCommunity is reluctant to use Article XIX and has only invoked it three timessince the UK joined the Community.8. The guide relates only to imports from countries whose trade with theCommunity is governed by the GATT. Trade within the Community is governedby the Treaty of Rome while trade between the Community, and EFTA andcertain other-mainly developing - countries is governed primarily by theprovisions of bilateral agreements which they have concluded with theCommunity.Department of TradeMay 198125
List of factors relevant to the establishment of &apos;serious injury&apos; in the context ofGATT Article XIX1. In the event of claimed serious injury:(a) the volume of imports; in particular whether there has been asignificant increase, either in absolute terms or relative to productionor consumption.(b) import prices; in particular whether there has been any significant priceundercutting compared with the price of a like product in the domesticmarket.(c) the consequent impact on domestic producers of similar or directlycompetitive products as indicated by trends in the relevant economicfactors such as:  production,  utilisation of capacity,  stocks,  sales,  market share,  prices (ie depression of prices or prevention of price increaseswhich otherwise would have occurred),  profits,  return on investment,  cash flow,  employment.2. In the event of a threat of serious injury:(a) rate of increase of exports to the domestic market.(b) export capacity (if known) in the country of origin or export, already inexistence or which will be operational in the foreseeable future, and thelikelihood that the resulting exports will be to the domestic market.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Commercial Colour Press, London E.7.Dd.0164O08 C20 5/81
