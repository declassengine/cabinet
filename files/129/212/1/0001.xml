CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 1INTRODUCTIONOur terms of reference11. Our last report on top salaries was published in July 19o0 .   In that reportwe explained that we were doubtful whether it continued to be appropriate for us tomake recommendations on the remuneration of Chairmen and members of tho Boards ofnationalised industries.   In particular it seemed to us that it was becomingincreasingly difficult to reconcile a &apos;Review Body&apos; approach with the &apos;market rate1approach which the Government wished to apply in individual cases.   We thereforeurged the Government to think carefully about our terms of reference in relationto the nationalised industries.    In announcing the Government&apos;s decisions on our2report , the Prime Minister made it clear that the Government shared these doubl.r,and had decided that in future years the salaries for top posts in the nationalisedindustries should be determined by the Minister concerned in each case, with theapproval of the Minister for the Civil Service.   The present review, therefore, isconfined to three groups: the higher judiciary and certain other judicialappointments; the most senior grades of the civil service; and senior officers ofthe armed forces.The 1980 report2. In our last report we recommended the salaries that we considered to beappropriate at 1 April 1980.   We pointed out that in conducting the review for1979-80 we had faced the choice between two courses: either to embark on acomprehensive review of the areas of remuneration within our remit, recognisingthat this would entail an interim report and a final report; or to undertake amore limited review designed simply to update the recommendations which we hadmade in 1979     In practice, we decided to steer a middle course.   As well asupdating our previous recommendations we examined certain structural problems whichwe judged to be in need of urgent attention, while reserving a more fundamentallook at the overall structure for the present review.   We gave particular attention,in the case of the judiciary, to certain adjustments in relativities which seemedReview Body on Top Salaries, Report No. 14: Fourth Report on Top Salaries -Cmnd 7952.See the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the House of Commons, Hansard, 7 July 1980,Cols 29-5^*Review Body on Top Salaries, Report No. 11: Third Report on Top Salaries -Cmnd 7576.1CONFIDENTIAL
Ito us to be desirable and, in the case of the other groups within our remit, tothe need to maintain a reasonable relationship with salaries at lower levels.3-        The Government took the view that there were &quot;clear and compelling reasons,of a kind which the Review Body could not take into account, for not acceptingthe Review Body&apos;s recommendations in full&quot; .   They said that the overriding priorityto which their economic and monetary strategy was directed was the reduction ofinflation; that levels of pay increase in the public sector must be reduced ifpublic expenditure were to be kept under control and the Government&apos;s monetaryobjectives achieved; and that it was right to expect those in positions ofresponsibility and leadership in the public services to act in a way which theGovernment hoped others in the country would follow.    On these grounds theGovernment reduced our recommendations substantially; and the increases receivedas from 1 April 1980 by the four groups then within our remit were, in the evenI,generally about half as large as those recommended in our report.   While theGovernment sought broadly to preserve the pattern of differentials andrelativities which we had recommended, they made some changes with a view tomitigating the compression of differentials or for other reasons.Approach to the present reviewk.        The Government&apos;s treatment of the recommendations in our last report hasput us in a difficult position in relation to the present review.   We calculatethat merely to implement those recommendations in full would entail salaryincreases ranging from 7*5 to 15.^ per cent, producing an overall increase in salarycost of about 12 per cent for the three groups within our terms of reference.In these circumstances we have had to ask ourselves whether it would be right toproceed, as proposed in our last report, with a comprehensive review along the2 3lines of those undertaken in 1972-7^   and 1977-78 .   We decided that we must do so.Our task is not to apply percentage increases from year to year.   It is rather,in the national interest, to keep salary levels under review, in order to ensurethat they are both fair and adequate so that the important posts with which we are1 Hansard, 7 July 1980, Col 30.Review Body on Top Salaries, Report No. 6: Report on Top Salaries -Cmnd 58^.Review Body on Top Salaries, Report No. 10: Second Report on Top Salaries -Cmnd 7253.CONFIDENTIAL
 CONFIDENTIALconcerned can continue to be filled by people of the necessary calibre.   For thispurpose it is essential that we should from time to time undertake a thoroughre-examination of the relevant salary structures and of the problems which affectthem.5.        Although we have been able to make good progress, oar work for this wide-ranging review is not yet complete.   The studies and surveys carried out onour behalf have indicated a number of key issues which we wish to examine ingreater depth with a view to submitting a full report by April 1982.   This w&lt;-will do over the coming year.   We hope that before then certain questions ofstructure at present under examination within the civil service will also havebeen clarified.   This is, therefore, an interim report.    In the next chapterwe briefly describe the work which has been done so far and some of the mainquestions to which we shall be giving further attention, before turning in thefinal chapter to the question of what recommendations we should make at thisstage.3CONFIDENTIAL
I CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 2OUR INQUIRIES AND SOME MAIN ISSUESWrit.ton and oral evidence6. We have, as on previous occasions, received a groat deal of written evidencefrom individuals, representative organisations and Government departments. Whoronecessary, this has been supplemented by oral evidence.   A list of those who haveso far helped us in this way is in Appendix A.   We are most grateful to thorn allfor the time and trouble which they have taken.Romunor:11.1 ojl Lwwvcy7. We have again carried out a survey of remuneration in the private sector atlevels of responsibility broadly corresponding to those with which we areconcerned.   The surveys for Reports Nos 11 and *\k were confined to collectinginformation on cash remuneration, that is, salary plus bonus, commission andprofit-sharing payments.   On this occasion a larger sample has been used and, asin the 1972-7^ and 1977-78 reviews, information has also been collected on pensionsand fringe benefits.   Details of the survey and an analysis of the results aroin Appendix B.8. We must stress that the results of this survey should not be taken asindicating the levels of salary that we might eventually recommend.   The surveyinformation, particularly on pensions and fringe benefits, will need considerableinterpretation and evaluation.   The Government Actuary has undertaken to provideus in 1981-82 with an assessment of the differences in benefits and contributionsbetween the private sector pension schemes covered in the survey and the schemesfor those within our remit.   We shall also need to consider the implicationsof the Report of the Inquiry into the Value of Pensions under the Chairmanshipof Sir Bernard Scott   and whatever cone I u:; ion;; ma.y emerge from I. ho Government&apos;isdeliberations on that report.   In addition, it will be necessary to decido whatweight should be given to elements other than these, such as relative job socurityand the different environment in which work is done.   All these matters call forjudgment rather than precise calculation.   Finally, it should be emphasised that thoremuneration survey is just one part, albeit an important part, of the evidence.Report of the Inquiry into the Value of Pensions, Chairman Sir Bernard ScottCmnd 81^7.CONFIDENTIAL
9. The problems of setting salaries for the judiciary are different from thosewhich arise in relation to the other two groups within our remit.   The civil serviceand the armed forces are essentially career servicos in which senior appointmentsare almost invariably filled from lower levels.   The majority of appointments tothe judiciary, on the other hand, are filled, in tho nature of things, from thosealready established in private practice at tho Bar or as solicitors.   For theappointments of Circuit Judge and High Court Judgo, which we regard as tho twocrucial &apos;benchmarks&apos; in constructing a salary framework for the judiciary,recruitment is mainly direct from the Bar.   A key question for us to consider,therefore, is that of the relationship which the salaries for these appointmentsshould bear to earnings opportunities at the Bar.   Indeed, our primary purposeis to recommend appropriate salaries rather than to maintain relativities with thocivil service or other groups.10. We have always stressed the importance, in reviewing judicial salaries, ofup-to-date information on levels of earnings at the Bar of those who, in terms ofage and experience, are within the field for the appointments of Circuit Judgo andHigh Court Judge.   For the 1972-7^ review, we carried out a survey of earnings atthe Bar.   For the 1977-78 review, we had access to information collected for theRoyal Commission on Legal Services.   For the review leading to Roport No 1&apos;i, wocarried out a survey of earnings prior to appointment of High Court Judges appointedin the previous three years.   Although we were reluctant to ask for a new survoyfrom the Bar as a whole, we decided that we could no longer roly on tho informationused for Report No 10.   We have therefore carried out now surveys of rocoipts atthe Bar in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.   We are most gratofulfor the co-operation of those concerned.   We also sought information on thereceipts before appointment of those appointed in the last year to tho High CourtBench and the Circuit Bench.   Details of these surveys and an analysis of theresults are given in Appendix C.11. As with the remuneration survey, we must emphasise that it would be wrongto attempt to form conclusions about the appropriate salary levels for thejudiciary, or the salaries which we might recommend, simply from the findings onearnings at the Bar.   It is not easy to say what relationship judicial salariesshould bear to different levels of earnings among barristers.   Other factors suchas the judicial pension must be taken into account, though we understand this hasbecome relatively less attractive with the improvement made in tax allowances forthe provision of a retirement annuity.   There are also factors which are difficult5CONFIDENTIAL
 CONFIDENTIALto assess, such as the status and security of the Bench, the opportunity tocontribute significantly to the development of the law and differences in thenature and exigencies of work at the Bar and on the Bench.12.       Leaving aside other factors, it is apparent from the results of our Barearnings surveys that many of those who have become judges, especially thoseappointed to the High Court, have incurred a substantial loss of earnings afterallowing for the expenses of practice.   This in itself is not new.   It is obviousthat judicial salaries cannot match the highest levels of earnings at the Bar.We do, however, find cause for concern.   While there are as yet relatively fewrefusals of High Court appointments, the recruitment position is finely balancedand could deteriorate sharply if judicial salaries were allowed to get too far outof line with the receipts of those practising barristers from whom appointmentsare made.   It has been put to us that it would be indefensible to wait until thequality of the Bench has been prejudiced before taking action.   This will receivedetailed attention in our next report, since it is of the utmost importance tocontinue to recruit the best practitioners to the High Court Bench.   Refusals bythose selected as suitable should be very much the exception.   We shall be lookingclosely, too, at the salary of our other &apos;benchmark&apos; appointment, the CircuitJudge.   Here there is an actual shortage in recruitment, but we shall have toconsider whether this may be due to the lack of a sufficient number of suitablecandidates for the much enlarged Circuit Bench rather than to the level ofremuneration.13-       We also have the task of assessing what, differentials should be between thevarious posts and groups of posts within that part of the judiciary which issubject to our remit.   There are over fifty separate posts to deal with, dividedinto several categories and spread throughout the United Kingdom.   Seven posts havebeen added to our remit since the last review.1*K       We therefore decided, as in the 1977-78 review, to set up a sub-committeeto examine and make recommendations on relativities within the judicial structure.The Chairman was Sir George Coldstream and the other members were Lord Hirshfieldand Andrew Leggatt QC, together with two co-opted members: Sir George Baker,formerly President of the Family Division of the High Court; and His Honour Edgar FayQC, a former Official Referee.15-       The Sub-Committee&apos;s report is in Appendix D.   Their recommendations areshown on a points basis and have been determined essentially by job weight. TheSub-Committee&apos;s task has been to advise only on relativities.    It is for us as aCONFIDENTIAL

We have also to consider the effects onrelativities of the payment of London Weighting which, although intended toprovide an adjustment for differences in cost of living, has in its applicationunder existing rules led to what are widely regarded within the judiciary asanomalies between one group and another in terms of total remuneration. TheSub-Committee&apos;s report will help us to form our conclusions on the appropriatesalary framework for the judiciary, including the simplification of the structure.Civil service and armed forces16. The results of the remuneration survey are particularly relevant to thecivil service and armed forces posts.   We have in this review also received someassistance from the Civil Service Pay Research Unit (PRU), which has helped usin applying our judgment   to these results.   On the basis of their oxporioncothe PRU have been able to provide guidance on posts or levels which broadlycorrespond to Under Secretary in companies covered by the remuneration survey.17. The civil service and armed forces posts which we cover have not beenevaluated in depth in relation to the private sector since the 1972-74 reviow,when they were the subject of a job comparison exercise.   We decided, therefore,that it would be appropriate to carry out some fresh comparisons between posts inthe civil service, the armed forces and the private sector.   We commissionedmanagement consultants to analyse and evaluate a sample of jobs in the two servicesand to provide information about remuneration at equivalent job weight levelsin the private sector.   We have recently received the consultants&apos; report and areconsidering their findings along with the other evidence.   Although the jobs theyexamined were not a representative sample, we believe that they covored sufficientof the range and variety of work across the &apos;open structure&apos; of the civil sorvicoand top levels of the armed forces to provide us with some valuable insights.18. It is clear from the work which has so far been done for the present reviewthat there are several matters which will require further consideration. First,we are concerned about the adequacy of differentials, as distinct from absolutesalary levels, at the highest levels of the civil service and the armed forces.Our studies indicate that pay rises much more slowly with job weight at these lovolsthan at the lower levels.   There has been a general narrowing of pay differentialsat the top of both the public and private sectors.   However, while the degree ofcompression has varied greatly from one private company to another, it has beenCONFIDENTIAL
substantial throughout the public&apos; sector \ &quot;including the civil sorvico and the armedforces.   The reduction in 1980 in the top rates of income tax will have offset theeffects of this compression to some extent, but the problem still remains. Incareer services such as the civil service and armed forcos internal relativitiosare of prime importance.   It is true of course that external factors oannot beignored even though, as we have pointed out, appointments at theae levels are rarelymade by direct recuitment from outside.   While we continue to believe that salariesfor the civil service and armed forces posts within our remit should not attempt tomatch the highest levels obtainable in business and industry, thero can be littledoubt that the quality of these services in the upper ranks would eventuallydeteriorate, even though slowly over a long period, if prospects at tho top wereto fall too far behind those available to the talented in othor walks of life. Insuch an environment, however, internal differentials may convoy an even strongermessage to employees, especially where, in tho absence of any diroct relationshipbetween pay and performance, motivation is strongly governed by opportunities forpromotion and the rewards that go with it.   If the rewards at the top areinsufficient, retention will become more difficult and there will be a reduction inthe quality of those seeking appointment.   We shall give special attention to thequestion of differentials in our full report.19. We noted in Report No 1*f that a study of performonce-rolatod pay had boonprepared by the Office of Manpower Economics for the Civil Service Department, butthat we had not yet received evidence relating to it.   We now understand that theGovernment doubt whether individual financial incentives are tho bost way ofimproving motivation in the civil service.   Apart from that, howover, there is aquestion which we ourselves propose to examine further; that is, whether it mightbe appropriate to introduce in the &apos;open structure&apos; ranges of pay related to jobweight rather than to performance or merit.   We shall wish to investigate theadvantages and disadvantages of moving in that direction.   Our studies tend toindicate an extremely wide variation of job weight within grades, especially at theUnder Secretary level, as well as some degree of overlap in job weight botweengrades.20. We understand that a review team within the civil service is looking at thocase for shortening the chain of command by abolishing grades, or at least bydispensing with the use of particular grades in areas of work whore there may notbe an organisational requirement for them.   The team&apos;s recommendations, and anydecisions which may stem from them, could well be relevant to our future work.21. Lastly, the evidence suggests that there may be some distinction botweon thoCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALjob weights of civil service and armed forces appointments.   We shall thereforeneed to give some thought to the desirability of maintaining the salary linkbetween the two services, though we would not wish to disturb this except forcompelling reasons.    One incidental effect of the Government&apos;s treatment of ourrecommendations in Report No 1A- is that medical officers in the armed forces ofthe rank of Major General or equivalent are now paid more than their combatantcounterparts.   This we must regard as an anomaly which we would wish to see removedat the earliest opportunity.Our general approach for the future22.       These and other questions we shall pursue with a view to producing acomprehensive report in 1982.   We shall aim to update our factual material so faras this may be necessary.    Our object as hitherto will be to achieve coherent salarystructures which take due account of both internal and external relativities inthe light of the manpower requirements, interpreted in the widest sense, of eachof the services within our terms of reference.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 3OUR RECOMMENDATIONS23.      An increase of about 12 per cent overall in the current salary cost of thethree groups within our remit would be needed to pay the salaries which weconsidered appropriate for 1 April 1980.   During the last year earnings in thoprivate sector have increased, though by varying amounts, at all salary levels.Substantial increases would therefore inevitably be needed in order to bring thesalaries of these three groups up to a level appropriate for 1 April 1981.2k.       Several of those who have given evidence have urged us, whatever thedifficulties, to put forward figures which we consider to be &apos;right&apos; at that date.We have explained, however,  thai, wo still have come way to go before we completethe comprehensive review on which we have embarked I hit; .year-; and we have had toconsider whether it would be reasonable in the context of an interim report, andagainst the background we have set out, to put forward a new set of figures. Wehave always recognised the need to operate with due regard to curront economicrealities, but it is not for us to judge the merits or demerits of any particularGovernment&apos;s economic policies.   Nonetheless, we must emphasise that our credibilityas a Review Body depends on the Government&apos;s willingness to accept that ourrecommendations will normally be implemented.25. We have therefore, and after much discussion, reached the conclusion that nouseful purpose would be served by our recommending in this interim report nowsalary levels beyond those which still remain to be implemented.    Instead, we . d.rongl yurge the Government to implement our Report No Vi- recommendation:; in full and a:: ;; nnas possible.   We are firmly of the view that the salaries which we recommended ayear ago were reasonable on the basis of the factors which it fell to us to tuk&lt;into account; and no evidence in the current review has led us to change thatassessment.26. Our Report No 1^- recommendations and those which we make, in Report No V\terms, for the additions to our remit in respect of the Northern Ireland judiciary,are set out below, alongside the salaries so far implemented by the Government.For the future, we are continuing our work with a view to submitting a lull reportby 1 April 1982.    We intend that report to contain full recommendations on thesalary levels which are appropriate at that date.10CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALSURVEY OF REMUNERATION IN THE PRIVATE SECTORIntroduction1. On behalf of the Review Body on Top Salaries the Office of Manpower Economicscarried out a survey of remuneration of full-time Board members and seniorexecutives in the private sector.    The survey, which was the sixth of this kindto be carried out, covered the period 1 September 1979 to 1 September 1980 .The Review Body aire grateful for the cooperation of those who have replied to theBesurveys which are important to their work.Selection of tho sample2. In previous surveys, companies in the non-financial sector were selected from&apos;The Times 1,000&apos; list of the largest companies in the United Kingdom using the sizeof net assets as the basis of stratification.    On this occasion, it was decidedthat turnover gave a better, though not ideal, indication of the responsibility ofsenior posts.   Accordingly, company turnover rather than net assets was used as thebasis for selecting companies for the survey.    In addition, compared with the lastsurvey of remuneration in 1977 when 299 non-financial companies were approached,a smaller sample of 191 companies was used.   An examination of the results of previoussurveys showed that the use of a smaller sample, which would lessen the burden placedupon companies, would not lead to a significant loss of accuracy.    In the financialsector, questionnaires were sent to 23 organisations, most of which were clearingbanks, insurance companies or building societies, compared with 29 in 1977-Scope of the questionnaire3.     The questionnaire covered pay, pensions arrangements and other fringe benefits.All companies were asked to provide information for full-time members of the mainBoard and senior executives who reported to a Board member.    In addition, non-financial companies with turnover of at least &amp;k00 million and all those in thefinancial sector were asked for information about senior executuves at the next leveldown and about full-time Board members of subsidiaries with a turnover of at least 400 million.    In all cases companies were asked to provide the information for poststhe nature and responsibility of which had not changed in the year up to 1 September1980.1    Reports on the previous five surveys are given in Report No 2,  Interim Report, onTop Salaries (Cmnd. 5001, June 1972), Appendix E; Report No 6, Report on TopSalaries (Cmnd. 58^6, December 1974), Appendix L; Report No 10, Second Report onTop Salaries (Cmnd. 7253, June 1978), Appendix E; Report No 11, Third Report onTop Salaries (Cmnd. 7576, June 1979), Appendix C and Report No 14, Fourth Report onTop Salaries (Cmnd. 7952, July 1980), Appendix C.

CONFIDENTIALk.     Usable questionnaires were received from 138 organisations which, afterallowing for those replies which were unsuitable - for example, because of a merger -1gave an overall response rate of 67 per cent .   Table A shows the response oforganisations in different sectors.   Compared with the financial sector, theresponse was lower for companies in the non-financial sector.   Details of the postscovered by the replies are given in Table 1 at the end of this Appendix.TABLE AOrganisations&apos;  response to tho     urvoy	Number	Number selected	I&apos;rov rep	i (i i tig , &gt; Lies	Sector	in &apos;Times 1,000&apos;		Number	A;; ;i pe reen l.age of number ;;e 1 ec Led	Number used	No.	No.	No.	%	No.Non-financial					Turnover(  million)					800 and over	61	30	19	63.3	18kOO but under 800	62	31	21	67.7	20200 but under kOO	89	30	18	60.0	18100 but under 200	1*+2	35	25	71.4	2250 but under 100	265	33	19	57-6	1625 but under 50	381	32	3 p	68.8	2kAll non-financial	1,000	191	124	6k.9	118Financial	NA	23	20	87.O	20All organisations	NA	214		67.3	138Notes:    (a) 2 companies gave combined returns involving another company in the sample.12 companies gave information for a subsidiary in a lower size band,k having a turnover of under  25 million.

CONFIDENTIALScaling up of the replies5. The 118 usable replies received from non-financial companies have been adjustedso as to provide estimates for all 1,000 companies inihe &apos;Times&apos; list with theresult that the number of posts covered by the replies has been scaled up from2,913 to 23,362.    For these companies, the scaling up required two adjustments.First, companies with more than 30 posts at the levels covered provided figuresfor a selection of posts below Board level and their returns have been adjustedto allow for this.    Second, different proportions of companies were selectedin each size band; for instance, 1 in 2 of companies in the largest and 1 in 12in the smallest size band, and a further adjustment for this has been made in theresults.   For the financial organisations covered there was no suitably structuredlist by size so that different sampling fractions by size were not used. However,some financial organisations with more than 30 posts at the levels covered providedinformation for a selection of posts below Board level and in these cases therehas been an adjustment, the result of which has been to scale up the number ofposts from 372 to 581.    Tables 2-13 at the end of this Appendix give both theactual number of posts covered in replies and the number of posts produced by theadjustments described above.Comparison with previous surveys6. Changes,in the method of drawing the sample (from the use of net assets tothe use of turnover), in the definition of levels of posts to take more accountof executive responsibility and in the method of producing results to take accountof the different sampling fractions for different size bands, make it difficult tocompare the results from this survey with those from previous surveys.    Table Bcompares the distributions of salary plus bonus etc for all posts in the two mostrecent surveys.    In view of the differences mentioned above and the differencein the dates to which the information relates, the two distributions show a reasonablemeasure of agreement.19CONFIDENTIAL

The information aboutpensions will be published in a future report when the results of the GovernmentActuary&apos;s evaluation have been received by the Review Body.Mean levels of pay and increases in pay8.      Table 2 shows that for all posts in the survey the increase in mean salary plusbonus, commission and profit-sharing between 1 September 1979 and 1 September 1980was just over 19 per cent.    There was some evidence of smaller increases in averagesalary plus bonus etc for those whose pay in 1979 was  50,000 and over,  the averageincrease being about 11-J per cent.    For salary alone the overall average increasewas just under 20 per cent, with evidence of lower increases for those whose salarywas  60,000 and over where the average increase was about 12-J per cent.    For allposts in the survey, bonus and other similar payments averaged about 5 per centof total pay.CONFIDENTIAL20
CONFIDENTIAL9. Table 3 compares mean pay for 1 September 1979 and 1980 for the main levels ofpost in the survey, namely, chief executives on the main Board, deputy chiefexecutives on the main Board, other main Board members and aenior executives atvarious levels.   Mean levels of pay (with or without bonus) are higher in thefinancial sector than in the non-financial sector as a whole.   Increases in meanpay in the financial sector over the period are generally higher as well.   In thenon-financial sector there is a slight tendency for increases to be higher forthe lower level posts.   The table also shows that in the non-financial soctor themean level of pay increases markedly with turnover.   For example, for the seniorexecutives reporting to the main Board as heads of function, mean salary plus bonusetc at 1 September 1980 ranges from  1^,900,for companies with turnover of  25 to  50million,to  28,500 for companies with turnover of  800 million or over.   At thisparticular level of post the corresponding figure for the financial sector is 29,600.   Generally, mean pay in the financial sector matches that of companiesin one of the top three size bands in the non-financial sector, ie companies witha turnover of  200 million and over.Date of last increase in .salary10. Table k gives information about the timing of the last increase in salary for thedifferent levels of post identified in the survey.   Salaries for 40 per cent of postshad been increased in the period 1 May 1980 to 1 September   1980, leaving 60 per centwith an annual increase due in the period 2 September 1980 to 1 April 1981. Fordifferent levels of post the proportion of posts receiving salary increases betweenMay and September varied between Zq- and 51 per cent.   As in previous surveys, January,April, July and October were the most frequent months for increases, these h monthsaccounting for 70 per cent of the posts.Medians, quartiles and decile.-:11. Table 5 shows the medians, quartiles and deciles for the main levels of postsin the survey.    The figures confirm the tendency shown in Table 3 for levels of payin the non-financial sector to be higher for the larger size bands. The table alsoindicates the variation in pay at a given level of post in a given size band. Forexample, for senior executives reporting as a head of function to a main Board memberin companies with turnover between  200 million and  400 million the quartiles,which contain the middle half of the posts covered, were, at  17,300 and  2^,300,both within about 17 per cent of the median of  20,800.21CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALBenefits other than pensions (Tables 6-13)Life assurance outside pension schemes12. Many pension schemes contain an element of life assurance in that a lump sumis payable in the event of the death of a member of the scheme.   Some employersprovided life cover for their employees outside their pension schemes, usuallyin addition to death benefits within the scheme.   Details of the extent of thisprovision and its costs are given in Table 6.    In the non-financial sector about20 per cent of Board members and of senior executives received additional lifecover at an average cost to the employer of  200 and  100 respectively.   Since thenumbers involved, particularly of Board members, are small, the results for thefinancial sector should be treated with caution.   Hardly any Board members and justover 15 per cent of senior executives received the benefit, at an average cost tothe employer, in both cases, of less than  10.   No employee in either sectorcontributed towards the costs.Provision of company cars13. Table 7 gives details of the provision of company cars and assistance withmotoring expenses.    The proportion of main Board members and senior executivesprovided with a company car for private use was over 90 per cent.    Those companieswhich provided a car for private use usually provided maintenance and repair. Therewas little difference between sectors in the extent of provision.    For Hoard member::the average price, when new, of the car provided was about  12,500.   For seniorexecutives it was about  8,500.    There is some evidence in the table that the largercompanies in the non-financial sector provided more expensive cars.   The provisionof petrol and oil for private motoring was relatively unusual in the financialsector, where it was received by about 7 per cent of main Board members and 15 percent of senior executives.    In the non-financial sector it was received by overhalf of the Board members and senior executives.    Provision of petrol and oil was morefrequent in companies whose turnover was between  100 million and  800 million, whereit was received by over 70 per cent of Board members and over 75 per cent ofsenior executives.22CONFIDENTIAL
Loans for house purchaseCONFIDENTIAL14.     Details of the provision of loans for house purchase are given in Table 8.This is a benefit which is mainly confined to the financial sector where 50 percent of Board members and just under 90 per cent of senior executives received aloan.   The average outstanding loan for Board members and senior executives in thefinancial sector were  13,500 and  15,000 respectively, at an average rate ofinterest of h\ per cent in both cases.    In the non-financial sector less than4 per cent of Board members and about 10 per cent of senior executives received aloan.    The average outstanding loan for Board members and senior executives in thenon-financial sector was  16,000 and  13,500 respectively, with average rates ofinterest of 8 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.   The results for the non-financial sector should be used with caution as in most cases they are based onsmall numbers of posts.Loans for purposes other than house purchase15-     Table 9 contains information about financial assistance for purposes otherthan house purchase.    In the financial sector the proportion of Board members andsenior executives who received such assistance was about 20 and 25 per centrespectively.    In the non-financial sector these proportions were both about5 per cent.   For Board members in the financial sector the average size of theloan which was outstanding was  3,400 with an average rate of interest of 5 percent.    For senior executives in the same sector the average loan was  2,400 withan average rate of interest of 4J per cent.   In the non-financial sector therewas a good deal of variation between companies in different size bands.   In thesector as a whole, the average size of outstanding loan for Board members wasabout  5,100 with an average rate of interest of 3 per cent.   For senior executivesthe corresponding figures were  4,500 and 4 per cent.Assistance with medical insurance16.     Assistance with, or in some cases, provision of free, medical insurance bythe employer was quite common.    In the non-financial sector 75 per cent of Boardmembers received this benefit at an average cost to the employer of about  120.The proportion&apos; for senior executives was similar with a slightly lower cost ofprovision ( 104).    In the financial sector fewer Board members and senior executivesreceived the benefit (66 per cent and 55 per cent respectively).   On the other handthe average cost of provision was higher ( 144 and  112 respectively). Furtherdetails are given in Table 10.23CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFree or subsidised lunches17. Table 11 shows that the provision of free or subsidised lunches is alsocommon.    In the non-financial sector over 60 per cent of Board members and over70 per cent of senior executives received free or subsidised lunches at an averageannual cost to their employer of about  400 and  350 respectively.    In the financialsector the provision was more generous.    86 per cent of Board members and over70 per cent of senior executives received lunches at an average annual cost totheir employer of  920 and  535 respectively.Share option and profit-sharing schemes18. Information about share option schemes and the allocation of shares undera profit-sharing scheme approved under the 1978 Finance Act is contained inTable 12.    In the non-financial sector, share option schemes were relatively unusualwith 4 per cent of Board members acquiring shares in the year to 1 September198O.    The average excess of the market price over the price paid was  2,200.For the 2 per cent of senior executives in this sector acquiring shares the averagevalue was  1,800.    In the financial sector, share option schemes were more commonalthough the average values were smaller than those in the non-financial sector.The allocation of shares under an approved profit-sharing scheme was also morecommon in the financial than in the non-financial sector.    In the financial sectorover one third of Board members and a quarter of senior executives received inthe year shares to the average value of  500, half the annual limit under thelegislation.    In the non-financial sector just over 10 per cent of Board membersand 7 per cent of senior executives participated in such schemes.    The averagevalues of their allocations were about  450 and  350 respectively.Other benefits19. Other benefits are covered in Tables 13(i) and (ii) for Board members andsenior executives respectively.    There was a large number of different benefitsin this category provided by one organisation or another but none were widespread.The most common were discounts on company goods or services, which were receivedby about 20 per cent of Board members and 30 per cent of senior executives.24CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALSURVEYS OF EARNINGS AT THE BARIntroduction1. At the request of the Review Body the Office of Manpower Economics carried outsurveys of the receipts and expenses of those practising at the Bar in England andWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.   The three surveys, which were conductedwith the co-operation of the respective professional bodies concerned, were restrictedto those barristers whose year of call or of taking silk was compatible with a possibleappointment as a High Court or Circuit Judge in England and Wales or to equivalentpositions in Scotland or Northern Ireland.    In addition to the survey of barristersin practice in England and Wales, surveys of receipts prior to appointment of HighCourt Judges and Circuit Judges appointed from the Bar in the period 1 January I98Oto 1 October 1980 were also carried out.   The surveys are described in detail inparts A to E of this Appendix.     The co-operation of those who replied and of thevarious professional bodies who helped in the conduct of the surveys is much appreciated.Their assistance plays a crucial part in the success of these surveys.2. In all cases the questionnaires asked for receipts and expenses, excluding VAT,in the last full tax year for which information was available.   However, because ofthe time lag between the carrying out of a brief and the receipt of payment for it -often between 1 and 2 years - receipts for a particular year will not necessarily befor work carried out in that year.    In addition, it should be noted that for QCs whohave recently taken silk, some receipts may be for work done as a Junior.   In theanalysis which follows &apos;gross receipts&apos; is the sum of receipts from practice andreceipts from other professional activities.  &apos;Net receipts&apos; is the result of sub-tracting from gross receipts payments for personal pension premiums and otherprofessional expenses deductible for tax purposes.Part A - Survey of earnings of barristers in private practice in England and Wales3. In the survey of barristers in private practice in England and Wales, questionnaireswere sent to 894 barristers identified as being in private practice in  &apos;The Bar Listof the United Kingdom 1980&apos; and with between 20 and kO years call at 1 April 1981.In addition to details of gross receipts and expenses, the questionnaire asked forthe main category of practice and the age of the barrister.   Paragraphs 4 to 11The results of previous surveys for 1970-71 and 1974-75 are described in ReviewBody on Top Salaries, Report No 6: Report on Top Salaries (Cmnd. 5846) and ReviewBody on Top Salaries, Report No 10: Second Report on Top Salaries (Cmnd. 7253)respectively.CONFIDENTIAL45
CONFIDENTIALdescribe the results of the survey for those in practice at the time they receivedthe questionnaire.   Parts B and C describe the results for those barristers who,since the production of the Bar List, had been appointed as High Court or CircuitJudges.Response4. Of the 894 questionnaires 7 were sent to recently appointed High Court Judgesand 29 to recently appointed Circuit Judges.    Of the remaining 858 questionnaires,344 were sent to QCs and 514 were sent to Juniors, which produced 203 and 183usable returns respectively.   After allowing for replies which were unsuitable -because, for example, they did not cover full-time practice - the response rates were66 per cent and 46 per cent for QCs and Juniors respectively giving an overallresponse rate of 54 per cent.   A more detailed analysis of response is givenin Table 1 at the end of this Appendix. The low response rates, mainly for Juniors,lessen the confidence that can be placed in the results in some parts of the survey,particularly as little is known about the non-respondents.    However, it can be surmisedthat some of the older barristers may either have ceased full-time practiceor no longer regard themselves as potential candidates for a judicial appointment.Results5. Tables 2(i) and 2(ii) show median gross and net receipts, excluding VAT, forthe year ending April 1980, for Queen&apos;s Counsel and Junior Counsel who stated thatthey were in full-time practice.    Those returns which did not cover the year endingApril 1980 have been adjusted by applying the appropriate movement in the RetailPrice Index.    In addition, in those relatively few cases where the personal pensionpremium was over  3,000, the normal annual limit qualifying for relief from incometax&quot;^ the amount quoted was reduced to  3,000.)6. For QCs, median net receipts for different years of taking silk range from 20,141 to  46,106 with an overall median of  28,700.   For gross receipts themedians range from  33,386 to  70,533 with an overall median of   43,948.   There isconsiderable variation in receipts, an indication of which is given by the quartiles.For net receipts,the central half of the data lies between  20,834 and  42,776 and forgross receipts between  33,380 and  61,603.At the time of the survey, the normal annual limit was the smaller of 15 per centof net relevant earnings and  3,000. The limit has now been increased to 17j percent of net relevant earnings.46CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. For Juniors, median net receipts for different years of call lie between  9,441and  15,355 with an overall median of  13,345, and for gross receipts the medians liebetween  16,032 and  24,547 with an overall median of  20,502.   The lower and upperquartiles show that, for net receipts, the central half of the data lies between 8,387 and  19,351, and for gross receipts the lower and upper quartiles are  15,646and  28,302 respectively.   Medians, quartiles and the lowest and highest deciles forQCs and Juniors are shown in Table 3 8. Table 4 shows the composition of receipts for QCs and Juniors of differentseniority.   For QCs, as with the medians shown in Table 2, the highest levels ofmean net receipts occur for those who took silk in the period 1968-1974, ie for thosewho took silk about 6 to 12 years ago.   For Juniors, the highest levels of netreceipts generally occur for those whose year of call was between 1955 end 1960, iefor those of between 20 and 25 years call.   This suggests that these are the periodswhen barristers&apos; receipts tend to be at their highest.    However, because of thevariation in receipts it does not necessarily imply that receipts for individualswith different seniority are below the mean levels indicated for these periods.9. For QCs the mean personal pension premium was over  2,000 for most levels ofseniority.    Indeed,  just over half of the 203 QCs paid a personal pension premiumof  3,000.   The mean personal pension premium for Juniors showed greater variation,with an overall mean of about  1,100.   Fifty (27 per cent) of the 183 Juniors paidno premium at all and 26 (l4 per cent) paid a premium of  3,000 or over. Theremay well have been others who paid the maximum allowable for tax relief at thetime of the survey, namely, 15 per cent of relevant net earnings where this is lessthan  3,000.10. Table 5 gives medians of both gross and net receipts for QCs and Juniors forthe different categories of practice used in the survey.    It can be seen that, forQCs, the most common categories of London Specialist, London Common Law and Circuit,ie practice outside London, accounted for 155 (76 per cent) out of the 203 replieswhich were used.    As might be expected median net receipts for QC &apos;Circuit&apos; practi-tioners were lower than those for London practitioners.    For all years of seniority,median net receipts, at about  40,000, for London Chancery ana London Specialistwere higher, by about 45 per cent, than those of about  27,500 for London Common Lawand London Criminal.47CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL11. The three most common categories of practice among the survey replies fromJuniors were Circuit, London Criminal and London Common Law, which togetheraccounted for 130 (64 per cent) of the 203 replies used.   The proportion of Circuitpractitioners among the replies was higher for Juniors than for QCs, 43 per centcompared with 24 per cent.   For Juniors as a whole, median net receipts for thoseclassified as London Specialist were, at about  20,000, some 50 per cent higherthan those for the other London categories each of which were at the same level ofabout  13,000.   Median net receipts for Circuit practitioners were, at about 12,250, slightly lower than this.    In assessing these results the low responserate for Juniors (46 per cent) should not be forgotten.Part B - Survey of earnings of recently appointed High Court JudgesIntroduction12. In the period 1 January I98O to 1 October I98O there were 7 barristers in full-time private practice who were appointed as High Court Judges.   As part of the surveyof barristers in full-time practice in England and Wales, which is described inPart A, they were sent the same questionnaire.   All 7 completed and returned it.Paragraphs 13 and 14 describe the results of this very small survey and of combiningit with the survey of High Court Judges appointed in the period 1977-79&quot;&apos;&quot; Results13. Of the 7 judges appointed in 1980, one provided information for part of afinancial year and this was converted, pro rata, to figures for a full year. Also,the financial years of two replies ended earlier than April 1980.   These were revaluedto April 1979 - April I98O prices using the appropriate change in the Retail PriceIndex.   Median gross receipts were  64,352 and median net receipts were  39,938.14. Clearly, little weight can be attached to conclusions based on 7 returns.However, this information can be combined with that obtained from the previous surveyof receipts prior to appointment of High Court Judges appointed from the Bar in theThe results of the survey of High Court Judges appointed in 1977-79 were reportedin paragraphs 65 and 66 of Review Body on Top Salaries, Report No 14: Fourth Reporton Top Salaries (Cmnd. 7952).48CONFIDENTIAL
I CONFIDENTIAL&quot;5 years from 1977 to 1979-   Table 6, which brings together the results of bothsurveys, shows medians of about  66,000 and  46,000 for gross and net receiptsrespectively.    (Returns which did not cover the year ending April 1980 have beenadjusted by applying the appropriate change in the Retail Price Index.) Thevariation in receipts is indicated by the quartiles in the table.   For grossreceipts the central half of the returns between the quartiles lay between  57,000and  98,000, and for net receipts the corresponding figures are  39,000 and  69,000.Even though they are at 1979-80 prices, these figures show little or no increase and,in some cases, a decrease compared with the figures in Table C of Report No 14 whichare at the prices for one year earlier.   A possible reason for this is that, afterthe allowance made for price changes, the receipts reported by judges appointed in198O appear to be at a lower overall level than in previous years.Part C - Survey of earnings of recently appointed Circuit .ludge:-,Introduction15. In the period 1 January I98O to 1 October I98O there were 29 barristers infull-time private practice who were appointed as Circuit Judges.   As part of thesurvey of barristers in full-time practice in England and Wales, described in Part A,the same questionnaire was sent to these 29 Circuit Judges.   The results of thesurvey are described in paragraphs 16 to 19.Response16. Twenty two of the 29 Judges provided completed questionnaires - a responserate of 76 per cent; replies came from 6 of the 8 QCs and 16 of the 21 Juniorsappointed from the Bar.Results17. Table 7 shows quartiles and medians for gross and net receipts for Juniorsappointed as Circuit Judges and for Juniors and QCs combined.   As in the othersurveys, figures which were for a year not ending at April 1980 were adjustedby applying the appropriate change in the Retail Price Index.    In one case wherethe personal pension premium was over  3,000, the normal annual limit, the figurequoted was reduced to  3,000.49CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL18. For Juniors appointed as Circuit Judges median net receipts were  17,625and median gross receipts were  26,000.   The effect of including QCs is toincrease the medians by about 14 per cent to  20,196 and  29,405 respectively.The amount of variation in the returns is indicated by the quartiles.   For netreceipts the central half of returns for Juniors lay between  14,097 (80 percent of the median of  17,625) and  21,068 (120 per cent of the median). ForJuniors and QCs combined the corresponding figures (for net receipts) are 15,922 (79 per cent of the median) and  24,517 (121 per cent).19. Table 8 shows the composition of receipts for Juniors and for Juniors andQCs combined.   Mean net receipts for Juniors appointed as Circuit Judges are,at  18,071, slightly higher than the median.   The effect of including QCs, whosereceipts are higher, is to increase the mean to  21,737 compared with the medianof  20,196.   Only one of the Juniors paid an annual personal pension premium ofover  2,000 and three paid none at all.   All 6 QCs paid a premium of or near  3,000.Part D - Survey of earnings of advocates in private practice in ScotlandIntroduction20.     The questionnaire which was used in the survey of advocates in privatepractice in Scotland was similar to that used for the survey in England and Walesexcept that, because of the smaller extent of specialisation in Scotland, thequestion on category of practice was omitted.   Questionnaires were sent to 62advocates identified by the Faculty of Advocates as being in full-time privatepractice with between 10 and 35 years call at 1 April I98I.   The results of thesurvey are described in paragraphs 21 to 24.Response21.     Replies were received from 38 of the 62 advocates who were sent a questionnaire.4 of -the returns were ineligible because, for example, the advocate was not infull-time practice.   The overall response rate was 6l per cent.   Separate figuresfor QCs and Junior Counsel are given in Table 9, which shows response rates of67 and 55 per cent respectively.50CONFIDENTIAL
ResultsCONFIDENTIAL22. Table 10 shows the quartiles of gross and net receipts, excluding VAT, forthe year ending April 1980 for the QCs and Juniors who stated they were in full-time private practice.   The figures include those who stated that they held apart-time post as Advocate Depute.   The returns which did not cover the year endingApril 1980 have been adjusted by applying the appropriate movement in the RetailPrice Index.   In addition,in a few cases where the personal pension premium was over 3,000, the normal annual limit qualifying for relief from income tax, the amountquoted was reduced to  3,000.23. It can be seen from Table 10 that median net receipts for the QCs, whoseyear of taking silk ranged from 1968 to I98O, were  18,800.   For the Juniors, whoseyear   of call ranged from 1963 to 1971,median net receipts were  11,639.    Given thelag of about 1-j years between the carrying out of a brief and the receipt of paymentfor it, the receipts of the more recently appointed QCs are more likely to representtheir earnings as Juniors rather than QCs.   An indication of the spread of receiptsof those who replied to the survey is given by the quartiles in Table 10. Forexample, the middle half of QCs&apos; net receipts in 1979-80 lay between  14,326 and 21,444.   The corresponding figures for Juniors are  8,500 and  22,193, thus showinga much wider spread than that for QCs.24. Table 11, which gives details of the composition of advocates&apos; receipts, showsthat the average annual personal pension premium of the 21 QCs in the survey was 1,549.   Of these 21 QCs, 6 paid no premium and 6 were at, or above, the annuallimit at the time of the survey   of  3,000.    The average premium for the 13 Juniorsin the survey was  35Q.   Seven Juniors paid no premium and none paid a premium ofover  2,000.   The differential between mean net receipts for QCs compared withJuniors is 51 per cent whereas for the medians it is 62 per cent.   This is areflection of a number of Juniors having relatively high net receipts.Part E - Survey of earnings of Queen&apos;s Counsel in private practice in Northern IrelandIntroduction25. The questionnaire which was used for barristers in practice in Northern Irelandwas similar to the one used for the survey in England and Wales, the main differenceas in Scotland, being that, because of the smaller extent of specialisation in Northern51CONFIDENTIAL
I CONFIDENTIALIreland, the question on category of practice was omitted.   Questionnaires weresent to 2k practising QCs identified by the General Council of the Bar of NorthernIreland.   Juniors were not approached as we were informed that it was most unlikelythat a barrister who had not taken silk would be appointed to the Bench.Response26. Replies were received from 10 QCs, one of which was unsuitable because the lastfull year for which information was available was for practice as a Junior, thusgiving a response rate of 9 out of 23, ie 39 per cent.Results27. As in the other surveys figures which were for years not ending at April I98Owere adjusted by applying the appropriate change in the Retail Price Index. However,with only 9 returns it is difficult to analyse the data in a useful way.   The mediansfor gross and for net receipts were  40,864 and  30,328 respectively.   All but oneof the QCs paid an annual personal pension premium of  3,000, the usual maximumallowable for relief from income tax.    Clearly the low response rate means that theseresults should be used with great caution.52CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX DRELATIVITIES WITHIN THE JUDICIAL STRUCTURE: A REPORT BY A SUB-COMMITTEEUNDER SIR GEORGE COLDSTREAM&apos;S CHAIRMANSHIPIntroduction1.     The Sub-Committee on the Judiciary was appointed by the Review Body onTop Salaries.   Three members of the Sub-Committee were members of the ReviewBody: Sir George Coldstream, who was appointed as Chairman, Lord Hirshfield andAndrew Leggatt QC.   There were two co-opted members: Sir George Baker, latelyPresident of the Family Division,and His Honour Edgar Fay QC, a former OfficialReferee.   We also had the benefit of advice from three special advisers, theLord Chief Justice of England, the Lord President of the Court of Session, andthe Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, on matters affecting the judicialstructure in each of the countries.Terms of reference2. The Sub-Committee was given the following terms of reference.&quot;To examine the relativities within the salary structure forjudicial appointments covered by the Review Body on Top Salaries,and to advise the Review Body on what changes, if any, should bemade in the relative position of these appointments for salarypurposes.   The Sub-Committee is not expected to recommend whatthe salaries should be, but is invited to draw the Review Body&apos;sattention to any points or factors which it considers meritparticular attention in assessing salary levels.&quot;Approach3. Previous studies of this kind, by the Advisory Group appointed in the1 21972-7^ review   and by the Sub-Committee appointed in 1978 , followed broadlysimilar approaches, assessing each job on the basis of its content and &apos;weight&apos;relative to other judicial appointments.    Both the Advisory Group and the Sub-committee concluded that there was no objective method that would enable them toquantify the various elements of each judicial appointment.   Assessments werederived from individual and subjective judgments, taking account of factors,Review Body on Top Salaries, ReportCmnd. 5846 (Appendix E).Review Body on Top Salaries, ReportCmnd. 7253 (Appendix J).No 6: Report on Top Salaries -No 10: Second Report on Top Salaries -59CONFIDENTIAL
 CONFIDENTIALsuch as size and quality of workload, that were of direct relevance to jobweight.   Other factors, such as particular recruitment difficulties, ordifferences in cost of living or in levels of Bar earnings between each of thecountries,were considered more appropriate to the Review Body itself when determiningactual salaries.If.     Our task has been essentially the same as that of the Advisory Group andthe 1978 Sub-Committee.    Our terms of reference, while making it clear thatwe should not recommend salaries, invite us to make recommendations onthe relative positions of the appointments &quot;for salary purposes&quot;. Althoughjob weight must obviously be the main factor in any exercise of this kind,we have also considered whether we should take account of any other matters whichin previous studies would have been regarded as more appropriate for considerationby the Review Body in determining salary levels.   We have also considered afreshour approach to job weight.5. We agree with the conclusion of the Advisory Group and the 1978 Sub-Committee that assessment of the relative level of judicial appointments mustto some extent be subjective.   We consider that the factors taken into accountin previous studies are still valid.   We have given particular consideration tothe relevance of size of workload.   It has been suggested that where workload isexcessive the burden can be eased by appointing more judges or more support staff,as appropriate, and that salary levels should in such cases be determined purelyon the basis of quality of work.   On the other hand, it has to be recognised thatit is not always possible to make or accommodate more appointments.6. In considering whether to take account of elements other than those relateddirectly to job weight, the Sub-Committee has looked at a number of pointsmentioned in the course of the review.   The main points that have been raised are:(i) recruitment difficulties affecting particular appointments;(ii) the effect on differentials of payment of London weightingto some members of the judiciary;(iii) differences in cost of living and in Bar earnings between each of thecountries;(iv) external relativities, particularly with the civil service;(v) differences in the pension arrangements for different judicialappointments.CONFIDENTIAL60
CONFIDENTIALWe concluded that it would be right for us to take some account of the evidenceabout recruitment difficulties in making our assessments.   It would be unrealisticto ignore this factor.   While we are concerned about the effect of the presentLondon weighting arrangements on differentials, we have decided that it would notbe appropriate for us to attempt to make allowances for this in our recommendations.We should also make it clear that our recommendations take no account of whetherappointments are based in London.   The Review Body will need to consider Londonweighting when determining salaries.   London weighting is payable to the twocategories at the bottom of the list in paragraph hj&gt;.   When the office holder isbased in inner London he receives a London weighting payment which is at present  1,016a year. It will be obvious that a payment of this size will have a significant effecton the salary equivalent of the differentials which we recommend. Whether London weighting should continue to be paid to any members of the judiciary and, if so, in what formare questions which we consider it would be more appropriate for the Review Body toexamine in relation to practice elsewhere, including the other groups covered by itsremit.   We consider that the question of whether there are any relevent differencesin cost of living and Bar earnings as between each of the countries is primarily amatter for the Review Body in assessing salaries.   We have made some generalcomments on this matter, based on our own knowledge and experience, in the sectionsof our report which deal in detail with the appointments concerned in Scotland andNorthern Ireland.   With regard to external relativities, we have decided that, sincethe Sub-Committee has been asked to look at relativities within the judicialstructure, it would not be appropriate for us to take account of other groups; itwould be more logical for the Review Body to do this in considering salary levelsfor all the groups within its remit.   Finally, the question of pensions is notwithin the terms of reference of the Review Body.   The logical way to tacklepension anomalies is by amending legislation, not by adjusting relative levelsin the structure.The evidence7.     Written evidence has been provided to both the Review Body and theSub-Committee by individual members  of the judiciary and by representativegroups.    This has been supplemented where necessary by oral evidence.    We have61CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALreviewed all this evidence and have some observations to make aboutit.   We are asked to assess the relativities between no less than 53separate posts in the judiciary in the United Kingdom.   Seven of theseposts come within our remit for the first time.   The remaining 46 postsare at present divided into 13 separate categories, ranging from theCounty Court Registrars and District Registrars of the High Court up tothe Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.     Since the Review Body&apos;sSixth Report in 197&quot;+, new categories have been added, appointments havebeen moved from one category to another, and relativities have been alteredupwards and downwards.8. These alterations have on occasion caused dissatisfaction to theholders of individual appointments.   This is not surprising as some ofthe categorisation is historical; for example, when a new judicialappointment has been created by Parliament, the salary has been fixedin a more or less arbitrary fashion at a particular point in the judicialsalary range current at the time.   Yet, over the years, the job weight ofthe appointment may have diminished relative to other appointmentsoriginally assessed at a point considerably below it. Notwithstandingthat the Review Body have emphasised that the advancement of a particularappointment does not mean the downgrading of existing appointments in thecategory into which it moves, office holders in that category feel letdown.   This is so although the actual salary differentials may bequite small in relation to the level of salaries involved.   Thus theevidence before us indicates that many members of the judiciary considerthat they should be at a higher level in the total scale, with a smallerdifferential between them and the category above, and a larger dif-ferential over the category below.   Few are content to remain wherethey are, and even some of them would wish to move up to highercategories if others with whom they are at present ranked were toimprove their position.9. These matters assume a special importance for us since one of theReview Body&apos;s objectives has been to reduce the unusually large numberof different salary levels within the judicial structure&quot;&apos;&quot;.   We havecome to the conclusion that it is desirable to make some reduction,Review Body on Top Salaries, Report No 14: Fourth Report on Top Salaries -Cmnd 7952 (paragraph 68).62CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALtaking due account of differences in responsibilities and of the need to distinguishbetween posts at different levels within the same general area of the judiciary, forexample, as between Masters and Chief Masters.   Such a reduction would enable theReview Body to set adequate differentials in cash terms between one category andanother.   We have therefore made proposals which will reduce the number of categoriesfrom 13 to 11.   Although we recognise that they will not be universally welcomed,we are satisfied that they will not affect recruitment to the various officesaffected.   The main reduction proposed is in the middle of the existing structure.We think it impossible to make any significant reduction in the considerable numberof categories above High Court Judge level.10.   To achieve this result, we examined first the individual structure in each of thecountries.      We made provisional assessments for each country on which we soughtthe advice of the special adviser concerned.   We then brought together and refinedthe results of these deliberations to produce a consistent structure.   We have followedthe practice of the Advisory Group and the 1978 Sub-Committee in presenting therecommended relativities in points on a base of 100.11.   We have described our approach to our work and have indicated certain aspectsthat will need to be given further consideration by the Review Body.   There remaintwo points that should be noted by the Review Body.   First, the appointments of thePresident of the Transport Tribunal and President of the Lands Tribunal in England andWales take up only part of the office-holders&apos; time; the rest of their time is takenup with other judicial work of a similar level of responsibility.   We have nottaken this additional work into account but have assessed the level of the appointmentson the basis of the quality of the Transport Tribunal and Lands Tribunal work.Secondly, with regard to Northern Ireland, we wish to record that, like the 1978Sub-Committee, we have considered whether the stress and strain on the judiciaryresulting from the situation in Northern Ireland and its effect on their privatelives should to some degree be taken into account in assessing the level of theappointments in relation to those in Great Britain.    We have concluded that it wouldnot be right to do so.   We would like to record that those members of the NorthernIreland judiciary who have given evidence have not sought to raise the matterdirectly with us and, when questioned, have firmly rejected any suggestion that itwould be appropriate to take account of the effects of the present circumstances ~in making assessments of the Northern Ireland appointments.63CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe structure12. Our conclusions are summarised in the following paragraphs.    The startingpoint for our assessments was the relationship between the Circuit Judge and theHigh Court Judge.    This is dealt with in paragraph 19-    A list showing ourrecommendations on a points basis in relation to the relativities recommended inReports Nos 10 and Ik is given in the table in paragraph kj&gt;.A.       ENGLAND AND WALESCounty Court Registrars and District Registrars of the High Court13. These appointments were brought within the Review Body&apos;s remit for the firsttime in 1980.   The Review Body&apos;s recommendations in Report No Ik placed theappointments below the Masters and Registrars of the Supreme Court and the otherappointments in that group.    It has been suggested in evidence that these appointmentsshould rank with the Masters and Registrars of the Supreme Court.   Emphasis hasbeen placed on the considerable variety of the work and on the fact that someRegistrars are under considerable pressure.   We have concluded, however, that thereis overall a significant difference in job weight between the work of the SupremeCourt Masters and Registrars on the one hand and of County Court and DistrictRegistrars on the other, and that the evidence does not justify merging theCounty Court and District Registrars with the group above.   We consider that therelativity with the Masters and Registrars of the Supreme Court recommended inReport No Ik was right and that the recommended level is also right in relation tothe levels that we recommend for the High Court and Circuit Judges.Masters and Registrars of the Supreme Court, Metropolitan Magistrates, and Provincial_Stipendiary Magistrates14. We consider that these appointments should continue to be grouped together.Some of the evidence has laid emphasis on comparison with pay levels in the civilservice and on the effect of London weighting on relativities within the judicialstructure.   These are matters for the Review Body.   We see no justification on grounds f job weight for any change in the position of these appointments.6kCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALChairmen and Regional Chairmen of Industrial. Tribunals15. The 1978 Sub-Committee concluded that Chairmen of Industrial Tribunals had beenovervalued in Report No 6 and that they should rank with the Masters and Registrarsand with the Metropolitan Magistrates.    In evidence for this review it has beensuggested that the 1978 assessment undervalued the position of the Chairmen and tookinsufficient account of the difficulty, importance and sensitivity of their work.We have, therefore, given particular consideration to their position in thestructure.   We agree that the complexity and difficulty of the work have increasedsignificantly since the appointments were first introduced.   This was also notedin the 1978 Sub-Committee&apos;s report.    On the other hand, the work is confined to aspecialised field; and, although there have been some increases in jurisdiction sincethe 1978 review, the evidence suggests that there has been no major increase in thegeneral level of responsibilities of Chairmen since then.    There is no doubt thatthe work of the Industrial Tribunals is important and sensitive.   We could not,however, justify placing the Chairmen at the next level of the structure and we havehad to bear in mind that one of our aims is a reductionj not an increase, in thenumber of levels.   We conclude that, on balance, Chairmen of Industrial Tribunalsshould continue to rank with the Masters and Registrars and with Metropolitan Magis-trates.16. The position of the Regional Chairmen is directly related to that of Chairmen.Since no change is proposed in the position of Chairmen we see no reason to recommendany change in that of Regional Chairmen.    However, to produce a balanced overallstructure, we have, as in other cases, made a marginal change in the relative levelof the group.Vice-Judge Advocate General17- This appointment was considered for the first time in the 1978 review. TheVice-Judge Advocate General is now paid the same as most of those holding thesubordinate appointment of Assistant Judge Advocate General.    The Assistant JudgeAdvocates General are outside the Review Body&apos;s remit.   As explained in paragraph 6,we have not taken account of relativities with groups outside the terms of referencewhen making our assessments.   We have, however, had evidence on the weight of theVice-Judge Advocate General&apos;s responsibilities which indicates that the appointmentis undervalued.    We recommend, therefore, that it should be moved up to the nextlevel in the structure.65CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhail-man  of   I lie  Kore i.gn Coiiipen: -,a 1. i on  Cmmiiii i s::&apos;u m i18. We consider that this appointment should continue to be grouped with the RegionalChairmen of Industrial Tribunals.Circuit Judges and High Court, Judges19. As in previous reviews, the relationship between Circuit Judge and High CourtJudge continues to be the key relationship in the structure.   The 1978 Sub-Committeeconcluded that, taking account of developments in the work of the Circuit Bench since1972, some improvement was justified in the position of the Circuit Judge relativeto that of the High Court Judge.    It was recommended that the ratio should be 2:3 That differential was reduced in the Report No Ik recommendations which if adoptedwould have produced a ratio of -4.8:7.   We do not have any evidence to suggest thatthere has been any significant change in the responsibilities of the Circuit Benchsince 1978 corresponding to that which took place between 1972 and 1978.   We have,however, had evidence that recruitment to the High Court Bench is potentially difficultand that this is partly because in the structure the appointment has become depressed.Difficulty in recruitment may have a number of causes; and the evidence we have hadindicates that there are recruitment difficulties (not necessarily related to salaryimplications) at lower levels in the judicial structure, particularly the CircuitBench.   It is essential that the weight and importance of the work of the High CourtJudge should be adequately recognised by the position of the appointment in thestructure.   We have been particularly impressed by the weight of responsibility thatfalls on the High Court Judge as a result of duties and obligations in addition toCourt work.   We feel that insufficient account may have been taken of these in previousreviews.   We conclude that a substantial improvement is required in the relative levelof the High Court Judge.   We consider that a ratio of 5:8, as produced by the salariesrecommended in Report No 6, would now be right.   Our recommendations represent adeliberate improvement in the position of the High Court Judge relative to all thegroups below.   Our recommendation for the Circuit Judge slightly improves the positionof the appointment in relation to the Masters and Registrars and to the County Courtand District Registrars compared with the level recommended in Report No 14.20.    We consider that the Senior and Chief Masters and Registrars of the Supreme Court,the Master of the Court of Protection, the Registrar of the Court of CriminaJ Appealand the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate should all continue to be grouped with theCircuit Judges.   We have considered whether the Social Security Commissioners and theMembers of the Lands Tribunal should be moved to a higher level but have concludedthat the evidence does not provide sufficient justification for moving theseappointments into the next group. A minor improvement in the level of the appointmentsCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcould only have the effect of introducing a new level into the structure whereas,our intention is to reduce the number of levels.   We have given particular consi-deration   to the position of the Judge Advocate General.   We consider that theappointment should continue to rank with the other appointments in this group,even though the differential over the Vice-Judge Advocate General will be reducedif, as we recommend, the Vice-Judge Advocate General is ranked with the RegionalChairmen of Industrial Tribunals and Chairman of the Foreign Compensation Commission.The Judge Advocate General accepts that a reduction in the differential is anecessary consequence of raising the Vice-Judge Advocate General to a level moreappropriate to his responsibilities.Appointments between Circuit Judge and High Court Judge21. The Recorders of Manchester and Liverpool and the Senior Circuit: Judge atNewington Causeway are all &apos;Senior Circuit Judge&apos; appointments and carry a burdensignificantly greater than that of Circuit Judges in general.   The Vice-Chancellorof the County Palatine of Lancaster and the London Official Referees, with whom theyare grouped, do only High Court civil work.    All of these appointments merit asignificant differential over the Circuit Judge.    Their differential is now substant-ially less in both cash and percentage terms than that recommended in Report No 10and is insufficient.   We consider that the level of all these appointments should beraised.    We also recommend an improvement in the level of those in the group above -the Presidents of the Lands, Transport and Industrial Tribunals and the Chief SocialSecurity Commissioner.The Higher Judiciary22. We have dealt with the position of the High Court Judge in paragraph 19- Therehas been considerable evidence in support of an improvement in the position of theLords Justices of Appeal. We agree that their present differential over the High CourtJudge is insufficient recognition   of the heavy burden of their work in the Court ofAppeal.    The level of the appointment should be raised to a point halfway betweenHigh Court Judge and Lord of Appeal.67CONFIDENTIAL
I CONFIDENTIAL23.    The evidence has also pointed to the need for some improvement in the positionof the Vice-Chancellor.    It has been suggested that the appointment might be placedeither above the Lords Justices and below the President of the Family Division orat the same level as the President.    In view of the changes we recommend in therelative position of the Lords Justices, the appointment can be ranked either withthe Lords Justices or with the President.   The President is responsible for a largerDivision and carries a particularly heavy administrative burden which we consideris not matched by that of the Vice-Chancellor.    On balance, therefore, we concludethat the Vice-Chancellor should be at the same level as the Lords Justices. Inreaching this conclusion we have not ignored the precedence proposed to be accordedto the Vice-Chancellor by the Supreme Court Bill now before Parliament.Zk.    Our recommendations for Lord Chief Justice, Master of the Rolls, Lords of Appealand President of the Family Division have been dictated primarily by the need topreserve reasonable differentials between the distinct levels at the top of thestructure.B. SCOTLANDSheriffs25. Sheriffs A and Sheriffs B are within the Review Body&apos;s terms of reference.Sheriffs C are outside the terms of reference but have been covered in evidence tothe Review Body.    There is no difference between the jurisdiction and quality of thework of the three groups of Sheriffs.   The distinction has been drawn on the basisof differences in workload.   Sheriffs A work only in Glasgow.   There are only twoSheriffs C, who are employed in the North of Scotland.   All other Sheriffs aredesignated Sheriff B.26. Sheriffs A have hitherto been equated with the Circuit Judge in England andWales.   We see no reason to disturb this relationship.   Sheriffs B have been paidless than Sheriffs A on the grounds that there are greater burdens associated withthe work of the Sheriffs Courts in Glasgow.    The evidence we have received indicatesthat while a case can be made for maintaining a very small differential betweenSheriffs A and B to provide a recruitment incentive for the Glasgow appointments,the distinction cannot be justified on the basis of difference in workload.    In theabsence of strong justification for maintenance of a differential, we recommendthat the Sheriffs B should be brought up to the same level as the Sheriffs A.27. Sheriffs C are paid substantially less than Sheriffs A and B.   We understandCONFIDENTIAL68
mk that this is because they are of as part-time appointments. Wealso understand that there are different views on the question of the appropriatepayment.   The appointments are outside the terms of reference and it would notbe appropriate for us to make any recommendation on the level of these appointments.In our view, if they are full-time appointments then they should be at the samelevel as other Sheriffs.    If they are part-time, then they should be paid pro ratato the full-time rate.    In either case, the decision is an administrative one.Sheriffs Principal28. We recommend that these appointments should be at the same level as theOfficial Referees, the Vice-Chancellor of the County Palatine of Lancaster, theRecorders of Liverpool and Manchester and the Senior Circuit Judge in Englandand Wales.   This will improve the level of the appointments in the structurecompared with the recommendations in Report No lh, but not to the extent whichhas been urged on us.   Nevertheless, we do not consider that the Sheriffs Principalmerit grouping with the category above (which includes the Presidents of Tribunalsin England and Wales) and we should be most reluctant to propose a special groupfor them.Industrial Tribunals (Scotland), Lands Tribunal for Scotland, and Scottish Land Court29. The 1978 Sub-Committee saw no reason to differentiate between the Members ofthe Industrial and Lands Tribunals in Scotland and their counterparts in Englandand Wales.    It also concluded that the appointments of President of the IndustrialTribunals (Scotland) and President of the Lands Tribunal for Scotland, althoughsimilar to the equivalent appointments in England and Wales, did not justifybeing ranked with the English appointments because of the difference in the scaleof the operation in each country.    We agree with the views of the 1978 Sub-Committee.We recommend that the Members of the Scottish Tribunals should continue to rank withtheir counterparts in England and Wales and that the President of the IndustrialTribunals (Scotland) should continue to rank with the Sheriffs Principal.30. The appointments of Chairman of the Scottish Land Court and President of theLands Tribunal for Scotland are now held by one person and are, in practice, oneappointment.    We understand that this arrangement is expected to continue. Theweight of both appointments, while held jointly, is greater than that of eitherappointment taken individually.    We do not consider, however, that the increasein job weight is such that we would be justified in ranking the appointments,while held by one person, at the same level as the President of the LandsTribunal in England and Wales.    Nor do we consider that it would be desirable,given the aim of simplifying the overall structure, to have a separate salarylevel for what amounts now to one post.    We recommend therefore that the appoint-ments should continue to be at the same level as the Sheriffs Principal.   We wouldagain emphasise, however, that th^^j^Wji^^p^ji^jriOve the level of the appointments69
CONFIDENTIALin the structure compared with the recommendations in Report No lk.Judges of the Court of Session31. The 1978 Sub-Committee recommended that in job weight terms the Judgeof the Court of Session should equate with the High Court Judge in Englandand Wales.    The Review Body recommended in Report No 10 that both appointmentsshould carry the same salary.   We have mentioned that we consider it moreappropriate for the Review Body to decide whether there are any relevantdifferences in cost of living and Bar earnings as between each of the countriesin assessing salaries.    We ourselves are firmly of the view that parity betweenthe English and Scottish appointments should be maintained.Lord Justice Clerk and Lord President of the Court of Session32. The appointment of Lord Justice Clerk is equated with the Lord Justiceof Appeal in England and Wales.    The Lord President of the Court of Sessionis at the same level as the Lords of Appeal and the Master of the Rolls. Thedifferential between Lord President and Lord Justice Clerk, already small, isslightly reduced by our recommendations.   Possible solutions to the difficultywould be to place the Lord President above the Lords of Appeal or to placethe Lord Justice Clerk below the Lords Justices.    However, quite apart fromthe case on merits for or against such adjustments, we are most reluctant tointroduce fresh levels at the top of the structure.C. NORTHERN IRELANDResident Magistrates33     These appointments are currently equated with the group containing theProvincial Stipendiary Magistrates in England and Wales.   We see no justificationfor any change.Masters of the Supreme Court, Northern Ireland34.    These appointments have been brought within the Review Body&apos;s terms ofreference for the first time in this review.   The appointments correspond tothose of Masters and Registrars of the Supreme Court in England and Wales andthe duties and responsibilities are broadly similar.    The salary for the appoint-ments is at present the same as that for the English appointments. We recommend70CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthat the Northern Ireland appointments should continue to be at the samelevel as those in England and Wales.Chairmen of Industrial Tribunals (Northern Ireland)35     These appointments, which have also been included in the remit forthe first time, are at the same salary level as their counterparts inGreat Britain and their responsibilities are similar.   We consider thatthey should continue to be at the same level as the corresponding appointmentsin Great Britain.County Court Judges36.   The County Court Judge is equated with the Circuit Judge in Englandand Wales and the Sheriff A in Scotland.    It has been strongly urgedin evidence that the County Court Judge should be placed above the levelof the Circuit Judge.    The County Court Judge has the particular responsibilityof presiding at trials of scheduled criminal offences without a jury. Wehave given particular attention to this argument but we have reached theconclusion that the responsibilities of the appointment, taken overall,do equate broadly with those of the Circuit Judge.    We are not persuadedthat it would be appropriate to differentiate between the two appointments.Social Security Commissioners (Northern Ireland), Members of the LandsTribunal (Northern Ireland), and President of the Industrial Tribunals(Northern Ireland)37    These appointments, which are included in the Review Body&apos;s termsof reference for the first time, are paid at the same level as the CountyCourt Judge.   The Social Security Commissioners and the Members of theLands Tribunal   are equated with the corresponding appointments in GreatBritain.    Their duties and responsibilities are broadly similar in weightto those of their counterparts in Great Britain and we consider that thepresent parity should be maintained.    The President of Industrial Tribunals,on the other hand, is ranked substantially below the level of either ofthe corresponding appointments in Great Britain.    We consider that thesize of the operation in Northern Ireland would not justify parity withthe President of the Industrial Tribunals&gt;(Scotland).    We have concludedthat the present level of the appointment, alongside the County Court71CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALJudge, and above the Regional Chairmen of Industrial Tribunals in GreatBritain, is right.Recorder of Belfast38.   This appointment is equated with the Senior Circuit Judge appointmentsin England and Wales.   Since the 1978 review, the Recorder&apos;s differentialover the County Court Judge has decreased in both cash and percentageterms while the burden of the appointment has increased following theJudicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978.   We have no doubt that the differentialshould be increased and we recommend that the appointment should continue tobe ranked with the Official Referees and Senior Circuit Judge, at the higherlevel which we propose for that group.Chief Social Security Commissioner (Northern   I n   I ,-i in I)  and I Yesident of theLands Tribunal (Northern Ireland)~39-   These appointments, which are included in the Review Body&apos;s termsof reference for the first time, are at the same salary level as theRecorder of Belfast.   As in the case of the President of IndustrialTribunals (Northern Ireland), we consider that the difference in thesize of their organisations in Northern Ireland compared with the sizeof the equivalent organisations in Great Britain must rule outany question of parity with any of the corresponding appointments inGreat Britain.   The evidence suggests that the appointments should continueto be ranked with the Recorder of Belfast.Puisne .JuageskO,    The Review Body recommended in Report No 10 that the Puisne Judgeshould be equated with the High Court Judge in England and Wales and theJudge of the Court of Session in Scotland.    Both the 1972 Advisory Groupand the 1978 Sub-Committee had recommended parity on the basis of jobweight; but, in Report No 6, the Review Body took account of differencesin cost of living and Bar earnings and recommended a lower salary for thePuisne Judge (and for Judge of the Court of Session) than for the High CourtJudge in England and Wales. As we have explained, final consideration72CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof the question of parity will be a matter for the Review Body in determiningsalary levels.    On the basis of our own knowledge and experience, however, wewould strongly support maintenance of the parity principle established in ReportNo 10.    We consider it fully justified on both job weight and other grounds.Lords Justices of Appeal4l.    These appointments rank with the Lords Justices in England and Wales and theLord Justice Clerk in Scotland.    Our recommendation for the Lords Justices inEngland and Wales and, consequently, for the Lord Justice Clerk, is that they shouldbe raised to a higher level in the structure, in recognition of the substantialburden of their work.    In Northern Ireland, the position of the Lords Justicesdiffers in some respects from that of the Lords Justices in England and Wales.In Northern Ireland they are not exclusively employed in the Court of Appeal; theysit in the Crown Court and may also sit in the High Court.    However, we have beentold in evidence that the business of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland hasbeen increasing.    We have also noted, as did the 1978 Sub-Committee, that for some35 years now appointments of Lord Justice in Northern Ireland have been made fromthe High Court and that the appointment is regarded as a promotion.    Taking allfactors into account, we consider that a differential over the High Court Judgecontinues to be appropriate and that the appointments should continue to equate withthe corresponding appointments in England and Wales.Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland42.   The 1978 Sub-Committee considered whether this appointment should equate withthat of Lord President of the Court of Session.    It concluded that the relative sizesof the judiciaries and of the populations served could not be ignored in determiningthe relative weight of the appointments.    The Sub-Committee drew attention to thepossible effect of changes in the responsibilities of the Lord Chief Justice thatmight result from legislation.    The legislation concerned, the Northern Ireland(Judicature) Act 1978, has had some effect on the responsibilities of the Lord ChiefJustice but we do not consider that the changes are such that, taken overall, theywarrant a significant change in the ranking of the appointment in the structure.We share the view of the 1978 Sub-Committee that size of population and judiciary(particularly the higher judiciary) is relevant.    The figures are:Population Higher JudiciaryEngland and Wales                4-9-2 million 105 (1:4-70,000)Scotland                                 5.2 million 21 (1:250,000)Northern Ireland                   1.5 million 8 (1:190,000)CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 1THE BACKGROUND TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS1. We put forward recommendations in this report against a backgroundof constraints on public expenditure, including restricted provision forpay increases within the cash limit system, but also in the light of theGovernment&apos;s continued commitment to keep the pay of members of the armedforces -at levels comparable with those of their civilian counterparts.  In our last report   we made clear that we attached the greatest importanceto this commitment because of its value in restoring and maintainingconfidence in the armed forces as a career and, consequently, in helpingto overcome the serious manning problems that had developed in earlieryears.2. Our belief that this renewed confidence could provide a basis forthe improvement of recruitment and, above all, retention in the armedforces has been borne out in the last year.    The latest manning informa-tion indicates that overall recruiting targets are being met. Furthermore,the number applying to leave the Services prematurely has continued to fall,and it is clear from our visits to Service units, both in the UnitedKingdom and in Germany, that the improvement in morale we noted in our lastreport has been maintained.3. In the course of many discussions with Service personnel, however,we have been left in no doubt that their continued confidence depends &apos;crucially on our continuing to make independent recommendations in thelight of all the factors we consider relevant, and on the Government&apos;scontinued willingness to implement those recommendations.   Moreover, thegeneral improvement in recruitment and retention conceals difficulties ina number of key areas.   There are still serious problems in attractingrecruits into commissioned service in the numbers needed, and persistentdifficulties of recruitment and retention in certain areas where technicalskills are required - which, as we noted last year, may be indicative ofa more general national problem.   We share the concern of the Ministry ofDefence that average length of service in a number of areas in the armedforces is still inadequate either to recoup the investment in training or toachieve desirable levels of experience.    Finally, despite the general1Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report, I98O, Cmnd. 7899, May I98O(paragraph 103).1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALimprovement in retention and a satisfactory overall rate of recruitment,the Services are still short of their total requirement, although thisis in part a legacy of earlier periods when pay in the armed forcesdeteriorated in relative terms.k.       Our review this year has also taken place during a period ofrecession in the economy which has affected both earnings and securityof employment in many areas, though with differing degrees of severity.We have taken these developments into account in framing our recommenda-tions as part of our normal approach.    The evidence that we obtain onearnings levels results from well-tried procedures of comparison basedon job evaluation, and we are confident that they produce representativeand reliable information on which to base our judgments,    The informationin the surveys that we use relates to levels of earnings a few monthsbefore the 1 April date for our recommendations and we update it to1 April by using forecasts of movements in earnings and estimates oftrends in levels of settlements across the economy as a whole. Thisavoids placing undue emphasis on immediately current experience inparticular areas of the economy where the effects of the recession maybe especially severe.   The system of annual review is thus underpinnedby comprehensive pay surveys which are continually brought up to date andwe consider it to be the most appropriate method for ensuring that, fromyear to year, general trends in earnings are reflected in military salaries.5-       Relative security of employment cannot in our view be quantifiedprecisely.    It is accordingly a matter that we take into account whenassessing the level of the X factor.    It is one of the current advantagesof Service life to be weighed against the inherent disadvantages, such asthe liability to danger, the degree of separation from family combined withthe turbulence that the serviceman has to face, and the exceptional degreeof commitment to a term of engagement.    We regard it as desirable, however,that there should be some stability in the level of the X factor, and wehave not sought to revise it in the past with each and every change in therelative advantage or disadvantage of individual elements.    We examined itin detail in our last review and concluded that there was no case for anincrease in its relative value, as had been proposed by the Ministry ofDefence.    The degree of job security recently (but by no means always)afforded to members of the armed forces as compared with civilians2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALweighed heavily in our consideration on that occasion&apos;.    We do not,however,  judge it to be sufficiently different now to justify a changein the relative level of the X factor.6. While the concept of the military salary, which is fundamental toour approach involves comparisons with relevant earnings outside the armedforces, it also requires many other factors to be brought into the balancebefore we form our final judgments.   We are concerned with total remunera-tion, which entails the need to strike a balance on such matters as therelative value of pension arrangements and of fringe benefits. Theassessment of pension benefits this year has been made in the light of aspecific evaluation carried out by the Government Actuary, as foreshadowedin our last.report.    The results of this assessment have had a markedimpact on the salary levels that we consider to be appropriate for thearmed forces this year, particularly for the more junior ranks. TheGovernment Actuary&apos;s report is at Appendix 1, and we discuss it and theconclusions we have drawn from it in Chapter 2.   The report demonstratesthat armed forces pension arrangements provide a relatively greater benefitthan we have previously allowed for, given that there are certain featuresof Service arrangements - in particular the provision for early retirementwith an immediate pension - that are superior to those found elsewhere.We have hitherto relied mainly on the comparative evaluations carried outin relation to the non-industrial civil service, but it is right that theresults of the specific evaluation should now be reflected in militarysalaries, and our recommendations have made due allowance for this.7. All the factors we have mentioned provide essentially a guide tojudgment, and not a mechanistic substitute for it.    Broader considerationsalso enter into our judgments.   We are concerned to provide rates of bothpay and charges that are founded on reliable methods of comparison; toprovide effective inducements to recruitment and, in particular, retention;to relate total remuneration to the special features of a Service career;to match pay to the complex rank and trade arrangements in the armed forcesstructure; to further, where possible, the general aim of simplifying thepay structure; and, finally, to be fair to serviceman and taxpayer alike.It is with these considerations in mind that we put forward recommendationsthat we believe to be appropriate for the armed forces at 1 April I98I.1Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report, I98O, Cmnd. 7899, May I98O(paragraph 16).3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALciiaptkr 2MILITARY SALARIES8. Before moving to our recommendations on military salaries, we wish tocomment on a number of important aspects of the approach we have describedgenerally in Chapter 1 and which we have followed in this review.Earnings comparisons9. Job evaluation is the main technique used to compare the relative sizeof jobs at key levels in the Services and jobs outside.    Three systems arein use: for Corporals, for senior NCOs and Warrant Officers, and for officers1from Captain to Brigadier .    In each, a job is analysed by factors that relateto its demands - for example, the skill and training required and the degreeof responsibility involved.    The range of points available for each factorreflects its relative importance and the sum of the points judged appropriateto each factor for a particular job in the armed forces provides a total &apos;scoreThis allows direct comparisons to be made with jobs in a wide range of outsideemployment evaluated on the same basis, and with the remuneration for thosejobs.10. The job evaluation studies are carried out by specially trained membersof the armed forces who make up the Joint Services Job Evaluation Team.They operate under the guidance of management consultants who are employedon our behalf to monitor the process: in this way, the Services themselvescan be confident that their own jobs are properly understood, and we can beassured of the consistency and objectivity of the standards and judgmentsapplied.   Care is taken to ensure that the information obtained from theearnings surveys, based on job evaluation, is both comprehensive and repres-entative.    At Corporal level, a sample of over 600 civilian jobs in 172organisations of widely different size is used for comparison, to reflect asfar as practicable the distribution of occupations within industries and with-in geographical regions that is indicated by the Department of Employment&apos;sNew Earnings Survey.   At officer level, the system of job evaluation employedis used extensively throughout industry and commerce.   This system allowsready access to evidence on earnings levels in a sample of almost 400 organ-isations of many types and sizes.Throughout this report, references to Army ranks relate also to equivalentranks in the other Services where the context allows.kCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL11. For this review, we have extended the range of information we obtainon earnings to provide a further check on its reliability.   A key point inthe armed forces structure is at Warrant Officer 1 level where we seek toset an appropriate relationship between commissioned and non-commissionedofficers&apos; salaries.    Previously, evidence on earnings levels for these twogroups had come from separate surveys but, for this review, the system ofevaluation which up to now has applied only to commissioned officers hasalso been extended on a trial basis to a limited number of Warrant Officerjobs, in order to provide a cross-check with the evidence obtained from themore traditional approach that applies at this level, based on a job evalua-tion survey (of some 275 jobs in 125 organisations) similar to that forCorporals.   We have also developed further the method that we first used in1978, in which outside organisations were asked to &apos;price&apos; Service jobs atNCO and Warrant Officer level in relation to their own internal structuresand job evaluation systems: this survey, in itself, produced for this review7^2 observations on pay levels from 5^ organisations.    Overall, the degreeof consistency in the results obtained from the separate approaches has servedto confirm the validity of general pay relationships in the armed forces andthe reliability of the earnings data.Pensions12. The Government Actuary has now undertaken a comparative evaluation ofarmed forces pension arrangements and those in the areas where we draw paycomparisons, so that we may take into account in our comparison of totalremuneration the relative worth of pension benefits.   As we have indicated(paragraph 6) we have in the past relied on comparative evaluations carriedout in the context of the non-industrial civil service as a guide to theappropriate adjustment for differences in superannuation benefits; but wetook the view last year that a specific evaluation should be made for ourpurposes.    The Government Actuary&apos;s report is at Appendix 1.13. The Government Actuary has pointed to a special problem in evaluatingarmed forces pension benefits.    This arises from the fact that ah averagecareer in the armed forces is relatively short: very few complete a fullcareer in the accepted sense and this is reflected in the pension arrangements.Officers with at least sixteen years&apos; reckonable service and servicemen withat least twenty-two years&apos; reckonable service qualify for an immediate pensionand in some cases, therefore, it is possible to leave with a pension in the5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALearly forties or even late thirties.    Pension schemes do not generallyprovide for such early payment of pension except in very limited circum-stances, such as serious illness.    The Government Actuary has not beenable, therefore, to undertake his evaluation as he would normally on thebasis of having pension schemes designed for a full working life on bothsides of the comparison, thus enabling him to compare like with like.Instead, he has taken into account the superannuation benefits accruingover the whole working life of members of the armed forces including thatpart of it which may be spent in civilian employment: he considers thisto be an appropriate and equitable way to allow for the benefits associatedwith the Armed Forces Pension Scheme.    The comparison undertaken by theGovernment Actuary is, therefore, between:(a) the value of the pension benefits accruing during a careerin the armed forces (including the provisions for inflation-proofing of pensions) together with - in the case of thoseretiring from the Services with an immediate pension otherthan invaliding pension - the value of superannuation benefitswhich might accrue from subsequent civilian employment; and(b) the value of the pension benefits accruing over a wholecareer under the terms of comparator schemes (including theage of retirement prescribed under the schemes).14.    On this basis, and after converting the assessed difference in thevalue of superannuation benefits to a pay deduction in his established .manner, the Government Actuary has suggested potential adjustments torecognise the better benefits provided by the Armed Forces Pension Scheme,in the range 7.1 per cent to 17 6 per cent (for officers) and 9 6 per centto 14.0 per cent (for other ranks).    These ranges, which incorporate theaverage superannuation contribution made by employees subject to the comp-arator schemes and embody the Government Actuary&apos;s preferred economic assump-tions (which are more stringent than those he has applied previously toevaluations of this nature), arise from two different but interdependentassumptions about (i) the extent to which early pensionability in thearmed forces might be regarded as a benefit or as compensation for careerdisruption; and (ii) the extent to which subsequent civilian employment shouldbe taken into account for the purposes of comparative evaluation.    The result-ant range is wider for officers than for other ranks because of the signific-antly greater proportion of officers who retire with an immediate pension. &quot;&gt; 6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHowever, the lowest point of the range for other ranks is above that forofficers because the pension benefits available to servicemen are relative-ly better when compared with benefits at equivalent levels among compara-tors than in the case of officers and their comparators.15-    So far as early pensionability is concerned, we consider that thearrangements in the armed forces might reasonably be deemed to confer abenefit on those who have qualified to leave with an immediate pension andwho volunteer to do so.    Conversely, others are required to leave with animmediate pension and, for them, the arrangements can be seen more as acompensation.    Distinguishing between the two is not entirely straight-forward, but the Ministry of Defence have provided us with statistics fromwhich we have been able to form a judgment about the numbers falling intoeach categoryc   The extent to which subsequent civilian (superannuable)employment should be taken into account raises even more difficult issues.We have reservations about the extent to which it is right in principle tohave regard to such employment in assessing the adjustment to be made, and wewish to examine this question more fully before reaching a firm conclusion.There is also a practical difficulty in that, so far as we can establish,there is no reliable information on the numbers of ex-servicemen who do infact take up further employment, and the conditions (including the pensionarrangements) under which they do so.16. Insofar as these two factors are concerned, therefore,  the pensionsadjustment we have made for the purposes of this review primarily reflects,within the range suggested by the Government Actuary, the extent to whichwe judge the provision in armed forces pension arrangements for early retire-ment with an immediate pension (and eventual inflation-proofing) to confer abenefit.    Taking account of information on the numbers of officers and other .ranks who volunteer to leave the armed forces on such terms, we consider thatit is appropriate to deduct 11 per cent from comparator earnings, in relationto both officers and servicemen, as part of the process of total remunerationcomparison which assists us in judging the appropriate levels for militarysalaries.    Our recommendations reflect this.17. An adjustment of this order is significantly higher than previous adjust-ments and has had a marked impact on salary levels this year, particularly forthe more junior ranks. This is because a general entitlement to pension bene-fits is a recent innovation for these ranks and the benefit conferred now needs7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALto be taken into account.    It in true that a number of those in juniorranks do not complebe five years&apos; service, and therefore do not qualifyfor a deferred pension; but in their case there is still a benefit becausewhen they leave the armed forces a transfer value is paid into a newemployer&apos;s pension scheme (if it is approved for the purpose) or theserviceman is bought back into the upper tier of the State scheme by theMinistry of Defence.    This aspect has been taken into account in theevaluation as it has a bearing on the assessment of the benefits avail-able under the armed forces scheme.    In contrast, an adjustment to compara-tor pay of 11 per cent does not have such a marked impact for officersbecause the adjustment made previously has been higher than that used forservicemen.    However, this is the first occasion on which we have under-taken a specific comparison of the pension benefits in the armed forcesand of those with whom remuneration comparisons are drawn, and in the lightof the results we consider the adjustment to be a reasonable reflection insalary for this year of all the benefits available to members of the armedforces under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme in terms of early pensionability;eligibility for an immediate pension; the general benefits of inflation-proofingeither from age 55 (for those who have retired with an immediate pension) orfrom age 60 (for those who have qualified for a deferred pension); and thearrangements for those who do not qualify for deferred or immediate pensionrights.18. There are, nevertheless, a number of issues arising from the GovernmentActuary&apos;s report that we wish to examine in more detail with both theGovernment Actuary and the Ministry of Defence.   We also await the resultsof the Government&apos;s considerations of the report of the Scott Inquiry intothe valuation of public service pensions.    We shall need to return to thequestion of pensions in the future.Fringe benefits19. In comparing total remuneration we also need to weigh, so far as ispracticable, the value of any fringe benefits available to members of thearmed forces against those available in the areas where pay comparisons aredrawn so that, as with superannuation benefits, any balance of advantage ordisadvantage may be reflected when assessing military salaries.Inquiry into the Value of Pensions, Cmnd. 8lV7, February 1981.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL20. We have carried out a detailed examination of the range of benefitsavailable to members of the armed forces and to those in comparable civi-lian employment.    This has confirmed that the private use of a companycar remains the most significant benefit found among comparators, particu-larly at levels equivalent to officers in the armed forces.   V/e have takena fresh look this year at the level of provision of company cars that shouldbe assumed for the purposes of comparison and at how the benefit should beassessed.    We have decided to continue to rely on the information on carprovision contained in existing surveys of benefits among the organisationsthat provide pay comparators at officer level (and at senior NCO level).This suggests very extensive provision at levels equivalent to the moresenior officers within our terms of reference, but a lower (although stillsubstantial) incidence at levels equivalent to the more junior officers andsenior NCOs.21. For the purpose of evaluation we have concluded that the most approp-riate approach is to attempt to assess the value of the benefit as it mightbe seen by a potential recipient.   Accordingly, we have estimated theprivate motoring costs saved by the provision of a company car, on the basisof information on the private motoring expenditure of people who buy andrun their own cars (as shown by the Automobile Association&apos;s continuoussurvey of motoring costs) and who are at similar income levels to officersin the armed forces.   We have offset the expenditure that individuals incuron a company car - for example, in paying for petrol and oil for privatemileage - and have made an allowance for the perceived benefit of the newer,more expensive and generally more powerful cars provided by employers.Finally, we have made appropriate adjustments for tax and pensionability. Weconsider this to be a more realistic basis for evaluating the benefit of acompany car for our purposes than the former method which sought to estimatethe pre-tax income required to buy and run the cars provided by companies.22. We have made no adjustment this year for any balance of advantage deriv-ing from comparison of other benefits.   Many of them present difficulties ofassessment and quantification that will need to be examined further beforereaching a final judgment on where any balance of advantage might lie. Forexample, the provision of a uniform in the armed forces, although intrinsicto the nature of Service life, does confer some benefit in reducing theindividual serviceman&apos;s outlay on clothing.    In certain circumstances,assistance with some of the costs of home to work travel also results in9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe serviceman saving on personal expenditure.   On the other hand,some ofthe employees in the earnings surveys that we use also receive clothingor a clothing allowance and others are given assistance with travel.Incentives to retention23-    In forming our recommendations we take into account the need toensure that, within the general framework of the military salary and therank structure, there are sufficient incentives to encourage prolongationof service or commitment to a career in the armed forces.    Length of serviceincrements (LSI) and committal pay are the established means to this end.2k.   We began a fundamental examination of retention incentives in thearmed forces last year, when we considered Ministry of Defence proposalsthat committal pay and length of service increments should be increased. Weconcluded that the levels of LSI should be increased by 50 per cent, and the1recommendations in our Ninth Report   reflected this.   However, we reservedjudgment on the proposals for committal pay because we were not satisfiedeither that any increase was necessary at the time, given the improvementsin manning then occurring, or that the concept of committal pay could bereconciled with the general liberalisation of exit arrangements that hadtaken place in the Services in recent years.    This reservation appliedparticularly to the proposals put forward by the RAF - and, to a lesserextent, the Army - which were based on the concept of payment for servicepromised rather than completed.   We wanted to examine several other pointswith senior management in the Services and to look at the issues involved inthe wider context of providing incentives to retention for officers andservicewomen as well as for servicemen.25.    We have now received further evidence from the Ministry of Defence.They have yet to complete their examination of the arrangements for service-women and officers and have told us that, because of the continued improve-ment in recruitment and retention over the past year, they do not wish topropose any enhancement of the value of committal pay for servicemen at atime when there are more pressing demands on defence expenditure. Althoughthey are content for the time being to rely on the current improvement inretention (paragraph 2) to bring about gradually the desired increase inaverage length of service, the Ministry of Defence still see an improvement Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report, 1980, Cmnd. 7899, May 1980(paragraph 25).10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALin retention incentives as being essential in the longer term and haveput forward proposals which we are asked to endorse in principle now,with a view to their implementation later.26.    These proposals involve two radically different approaches. TheArmy and the RAF want to retain the existing committal pay approach,but with the current differentials between scales increased to providea greater degree of incentive for a longer initial commitment.    The casefor placing a premium on commitment at the outset of service is thatexperience suggests that those so committed generally serve to the end oftheir engagements.    It would also be the intention to increase rates ofcharges for premature voluntary retirement (PVR) in line with any increasesin committal pay, to ensure that payment.was in effect made only to thosewho completed the commitment.    The arrangements proposed for the RoyalNavy are quite different, and are designed to complement the introductionof a new engagement structure which would offer all ratings a career withminimum formal commitment.    Ratings would join the Navy on a notional 22year engagement but with a minimum service requirement of four years fromage 18 (against three now), with the option of giving 18 months&apos; notice toleave at any time after the first 2-J years.   For artificer apprentices,minimum service would be 8 years because of the length of training required,but they would be able to ask at age 33 for a guarantee of service to age55-    Those currently serving would convert to this structure.    The Navyhave proposed a new system of retention incentives aligned to the newengagement plan to replace committal pay.    They propose that this shouldtake the form of periodic lump sum bonuses, to be earned by service completed.Its main aim would be to secure service beyond the point at which noticemight first be given and, to this end, ratings completing k\ years&apos; adultservice without giving notice (and thereby effectively committing them-selves to serve for at least 6 years because of the 18 months&apos; notice period)would receive a bonus - currently, 35-40 per cent of non-technical ratingsleave the Royal Navy with between 4J and 6 years&apos; service.    A second bonuswould be given at 7i years on the same basis.    Under the proposed scheme allnaval ratings would be paid on the job-evaluated Scale B rate, and thebonuses offered at 4J and 7^ years would be based on the inter-scale differ-entials of committal pay in the other two Services, taking account of thedeferred nature of the payment.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL27. The proposals put forward by the RAF and the Army seem to us toretain many of the drawbacks inherent in the existing committal payarrangements.    They lead to a complex pay structure under which menwith the same experience are paid different rates of pay for doing thesame job.    Furthermore, the underlying case for an increase in therelative value of committal pay rests on the assumption that such anincrease would offer an inducement to long service that cannot beprovided by the existing &apos;comparable&apos; rates of pay together with theX factor, the financial flexibility inherent in the rank and paybanding structure and the attraction of the trade training offered.Finally, we see a fundamental objection to payments for service offeredrather than rendered (although the proposals involve an increase in PVRcharges).28. The proposals put forward by the Royal Navy would overcome manyof these drawbacks.    They would involve uniform rates of pay for allnaval ratings and thereby simplify the pay structure; would offer pay-ments for service rendered rather than promised; and would be based ona realistic assessment of the practical limits of formal commitment tospecific periods of service in the present day.    In view of these primafacie attractions we have asked the Ministry of Defence to examine whetherthe Navy&apos;s proposals might provide a basis for all three Services over thelonger term.    We wish to defer our conclusions until this examination hasbeen completed, and accordingly refrain for the moment from endorsing anyparticular scheme.29. The Navy attaches particular importance, however, to the earlyintroduction of the new engagement structure.   We have been asked toconsider a modified bonus scheme that might come into operation later thisyear, and which would provide bonuses linked to the savings generated bythe phasing out of existing inter-scale differentials.    This approach wouldapply only to new entrants to the Royal Navy (not to all ratings, as underthe approach described in paragraph 25)and would produce paybill savingsover the next four financial years because, at the moment, the majority ofnaval ratings join on Scale C terms of service whereas under the new arrange-ments they would be paid only Scale B rates.    We understand that the Navywould prefer to go ahead with this interim scheme, even in the absence ofany guarantee that the full scheme would eventually be accepted.   Nonethe- &quot;&apos;-less, it remains our view that it would not be right to endorse theirproposals at present.    We need to examine several features in more detail,12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALincluding the tax treatment of the proposed bonuses, their application tothe Royal Marines and members of the women&apos;s services and to the navalreserve services, and the relationship between the guarantee of serviceenvisaged under the proposals and the inter-scale differentials that applyin the other two Services.   We note, for example, that the proposed yearbonus guarantees only 6 years&apos; total service in the Royal Navy but is basedon an inter-scale differential that, in theory at least, is payable in theother two Services to those who are committed to or have served for nineyears or more.   Given reservations of this nature, we would be reluctantto endorse proposals which would, effectively, settle the pattern of reten-tion incentives in the Navy for the foreseeable future.   Moreover, we seeno urgent manning needs to justify the immediate changes that have beenproposed.   We conclude, therefore, that the existing arrangements for commit-tal pay and the rates in payment should be retained for the present.30. As we have said, the value of length of service increments was increasedbroadly by 50 per cent in the last review.    The Ministry of Defence haveproposed that the value of these increments should not again be allowed todeteriorate but should be updated in relation to increases in the militarysalary.   As length of service increments are effectively a reward for servicerendered rather than service promised, we recommend accordingly that therates set out in Appendix 3 should be introduced with effect from 1 April1981.Military salaries31. We turn now to our recommendations for the levels of military salary weconsider appropriate for 1 April 1981.Officers32.    The system of job evaluation used provides a means of comparing,  from acommon base, the range of earnings in jobs that are equivalent in size to thejobs held by officers in the armed forces from Captain to Brigadier.    It isour practice to take as a guide the earnings levels for jobs of the same weightas those that fall at the median of the points score range for all officerjobs evaluated within each rank.    On this basis, the range of increases inearnings levels suggested by the survey evidence for officers (over the 12months to January 1981) is from about 17^ per cent to about 18J per cent.15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL33-    This evidence provides a major guide to judgment, but there are anumber of other factors that we have to take into account in forming ourrecommendations.   For example, under the normal job evaluation process asignificant number of armed forces jobs are re-evaluated each year, inorder to keep the comparisons up to date, and any consequent changes intheir points scores can affect the median score for a rank.   When thishappens it has an effect on the level of &apos;outside&apos; earnings indicated for1that rank.    We noted last year   that there had been changes in the medianpoints scores at certain ranks but we did not take account of those indic-ated at Colonel and Brigadier level, as we were not certain whether theNavy&apos;s appointment policy at this level was creating distortions. TheMinistry of Defence, together with the management consultants who monitoron our behalf the job evaluation process at officer level, have now bothextended the sample of jobs at Brigadier and Colonel level and excludedthose naval jobs that might have had a distorting effect.    This furtherexamination has confirmed increases in median points scores for bothBrigadier and Colonel and the levels of &apos;outside&apos; earnings indicated forthese ranks are higher, particularly in the case of Brigadiers (wherethe increase in the median score was greater).   We have taken thesechanges into account in our recommendations, as it would be wrong toignore them when we are satisfied they are soundly based.34.    We also have regard to appropriate pay relationships between ranks,including relativities with the ranks above Brigadier (which fall withinthe terms of reference of the Review Body on Top Salaries) and the generalpay relationship between junior officers and senior NCOs, which is ofparticular importance*   Evidence on earnings from sources other than thejob evaluation process is also taken into account, particularly in relationto the more junior officers, below the rank of Captain, where we look atinformation on the starting salaries and early salary progression of2management recruits in other areas of employment.    We commented last yearthat the different approaches within the Services to the employment andearly career development of graduates made it difficult to determineappropriate rates of pay, and that we had asked the Services to examine thescope for rationalising their practice.

CONFIDENTIALtheir general policy more into line with that applying in the other twoServices.    The Ministry of Defence have looked again at this problem.They do not consider it would be right to force each Service into thesame mould, given the differing manning and training arrangements as wellas the different rank structures.    They have suggested that the primeconcern should be to ensure equity in the treatment of graduate and non-graduate officers within each Service, so long as graduate earnings arebroadly the same in all three Services over the first few years of service.35. The Ministry of Defence have, however, put forward certain limitedproposals for change in the treatment of graduates.   First, they proposea minor rationalisation,which we endorse, in the system for giving ante-dates of seniority to entrants to the RAF who have academic and profess-ional qualifications.    They also propose that, for the Army and RAF, cashbonuses ranging from  ^33 to  1,300 according to the qualification held,should be offered as an incentive to the more academically able to jointhe Services.   We do not consider that such payments should be introduced.We are not convinced that the offer of cash bonuses of this sort would belikely to have a significant influence on career choice: the attractionsof a military career should rest on broader grounds and a longer termview of prospects.    Moreover, we consider that the salary levels we recom-mend (Table 1) for the more junior officers - whether graduates or non-graduates - will place the Services in a competitive position in the recruit-ment market and ensure an appropriate salary progression: to this end, ourrecommendations involve some relative improvement in the pay of OfficerCadets    (and certain other junior officers below Second Lieutenant).36. We are satisfied that the structure of military salaries, which includesthe X factor, that we recommend (Table 1) adequately reflects all the evid-ence and considerations we take into account, including updating, theevaluation of relative pension and fringe benefits, and the variousstructural and other factors we have described.    The resultant militarysalaries for 1 April 1981 are higher than the equivalent 1 April 1980rates (Appendix 2) by between 12-5 per cent and 14.9 per cent.Warrant Officers and senior non-commissioned officers37-    Our information indicates that &apos;outside&apos; earnings at these levelsincreased,over the year to October 1980, by around 20 per cent.

Our recommendations also take structural considerationsinto account: in particular, we have sought in this review to improvefurther the differential over junior ranks, since the promotion stepbetween Corporal and Sergeant is a significant one in career terms andone to which Service management continues to attach great importance.38. The (Scale B) military salaries that we recommend in Table 2 forWarrant Officers and senior non-commissioned officers,  for implementat-ion from 1 April 1981, are between about 10 per cent and 13^ per centhigher than the equivalent 1 April 1980 salaries.Corporals and below39.

Quite apart from the more marked effects of the adjustments necess-ary for pension purposes at these levels (paragraph 17), there has beensome evidence from the pay surveys of a reduction in working hours in.civilian employment which has affected the average level of civilianearnings indicated in our annual survey.    The increases arising from therates of military salary (Scale B) recommended for Corporals and belowin Table 3 range from just over 8 per cent to just over 10^ per cent.41.

CONFIDENTIALThe pay of the permanent cadre of the Ulster Defence Regimenb45-    The current pay arrangements for members of the permanent cadre ofthe Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) differ from those applying generally tothe regular Army.   At Corporal level and below the UDR structure of rankand pay is less complex, with just four classes - two of Private and oneeach of Corporal and Lance Corporal.    This compares with nine in the mainArmy structure (as Table 3 shows).     The lower of the two classes ofPrivate provides an age-related pay scale introduced in 1974 following1recommendations in our Third Report .    Its main purpose is to providehigher rates of pay for recruits to the permanent cadre of the UDR whoare generally somewhat older than their counterparts in the regular Army.The whole structure below Corporal provides pay rates for the UDR thatexceed those for similar ranks in the regular Army.    Corporals in the UDRreceive the same rate of pay as Band 1 Corporals in the regular Army.UDR officers and senior NCOs, on the other hand, are paid 95 per cent ofthe pay of,respectively, regular officers and NCOs in Band 5     The differ-ential at officer and senior NCO levels is intended to recognise certaindifferences in conditions of service between the regular Army and the UDR,particularly the facts that UDR personnel do not suffer separation fromtheir families to the same degree as their counterparts and that they do nothave to make the same minimum commitment to the armed forces, as they canleave on a month&apos;s notice without financial penalty.   Another consequence ofthis reduced commitment is that members of the UDR are paid on Scale A ratesof pay from the outset, although those who attain more than six or nine yearsof reckonable service move at those points to higher rates of pay (Scale Bor C, respectively).46.    The role of the UDR has changed considerably in recent years. TheRegiment now constitutes an active and essential element in the securityoperation and its soldiers undertake broadly the same duties as regularinfantrymen in Northern Ireland.    Against this background, the Ministry ofDefence have proposed certain changes in the pay and rank structure of full-time members of the Regiment with a view to bringing current arrangementsmore into line with those applying in the Army as a whole. A range of jobsin the UDR has now been evaluated on the same basis as applies elsewhere in Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Third Report, 1974, Cmnd. 5631, May1974 (paragraphs 64-65)-20CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe Army and it has been proposed that, in future, members of the UDRshould be paid in the pay band indicated by job evaluation.   We agreewith this change: the effect will be to place UDR Corporals and WarrantOfficers 2 one pay band higher than at present (in Bands 2 and 6, resp-ectively).47      It has also been put to us that the full regular Army rank structureshould be applied to the UDR, to replace the separate arrangements belowCorporal.    The two main arguments that have been advanced are that theextension of the UDR&apos;s role now requires its soldiers to train to thesame standard as the regular infantryman and that the additionalclasses of the full structure are needed to provide an incentive forUDR soldiers to progress through the different levels of training qualifi-cations; and that the justification for the separate age-related structurehas lessened because the average age of UDR recruits has fallen. Alongwith this change, the Ministry of Defence have also proposed that allmembers of the permanent cadre of the UDR should receive 97? per cent ofregular Army rates of pay to reflect differences in conditions of service.48.   We have examined these proposals carefully and discussed them indetail with Services management.   We do not consider it right to changethe present UDR rank structure below Corporal.    There is no evidence tosuggest that members of the UDR are failing to meet their training object-ives and recruits to the UDR remain significantly older than their regularArmy counterparts.    The marked depression of earnings for new entrantsthat would result from the changes proposed (particularly the abandonmentof the age-related entry scale) could have serious manning implicationsfor the UDR over the longer term.   More generally, we remain sceptical ofthe need in the Army as a whole for such a complex rank structure belowCorporal, which is not found to the same degree at equivalent levels incivil life.   On these grounds, too, we would be reluctant to see such astructure in the UDR.   We consider that only a minor change is necessaryin the present structure and recommend that the pay of UDR recruits aged19 or below should be linked to that of a Private IV in the regular Army -the normal recruit rate of pay - not to the (higher paid) Private III, asat present: both groups are likely to be of broadly the same age and experienceand we see no case for perpetuating the present distinction.   We recognisethat the effect of this change will be to produce for this year a &apos;relative-ly small increase for all ranks below Corporal in the UDR.    However, weunderstand that, under present arrangements, recruits to the UDR can21CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALexpect on average (and irrespective of age) to reach the rank of Private Awithin 9 months of enlistment and it may be that a useful training incen-tive could be introduced if the qualifying conditions for reaching therank of Private A were made more rigorous to match those required to reachthe equivalent rank (Private I) in the regular Army.i+9-     We turn now to the overall pay relationship between members of theUDR and of the regular Army.    The Ministry of Defence have proposed that allranks in the UDR should receive 97^ per cent of the equivalent regularArmy rate, including X factor, because of differences in conditions ofservice.   We have already touched on these differences.   The argument isthat members of the UDR are not subject in the same degree as their regularArmy counterparts to certain of the disadvantages of Service life (particu-larly as regards commitment to the Services and in the degree of separationand &apos;turbulence&apos;) that we take into account when assessing the X factor.50.     We accept that members of the UDR do not suffer from some of thedisadvantages of Service life to the same extent, but we do not agree thatthis is sufficient to justify lower military salaries for the UDR. Giventhe widely differing impact of conditions of service on individuals acrossthe armed forces as a whole, we would not wish to distinguish betweenparticular groups in the way proposed.   It must also be borne in mind that mem-bers of the UDR do not enjoy some of the advantages of Service life to thesame extent as their colleagues in the regular Army.   Moreover, some ofthe disadvantages (in particular, the exposure to danger) are present to agreater degree.   We consider, therefore, that all members of the permanentcadre of the UDR should receive full military salaries, incorporating thefull X factor.   The rates for male officers in the UDR that we recommendfor implementation with effect from 1 April 1981 are therefore as set outin Table 1 for officers in the regular army.   For other ranks the ratesthat we recommend for implementation from 1 April 1981 are in Table 4 below.These rates incorporate the structural change for UDR recruits aged 19 andbelow recommended in paragraph 48 and the change in pay band for UDRCorporals and Warrant Officers 2 (paragraph 46) 22CONFIDENTIAL

We have considered proposals for an increase in some of the trainingbounties payable to members of the reserve forces.   These bounties weresubstantially increased in 1979 as part of a general restructuring. Thegeneral objective of the new proposals is to ensure that the favourablemanning trends which followed these changes are maintained, but with anemphasis on improving retention in the early years of service in the reserveforces.    We are not satisfied, however, that there is a case for increasingthe levels of training bounties at present, in the absence of particularmanning difficulties (although we do appreciate that, as training bountiesare paid retrospectively for the previous year&apos;s training, it is relativelydifficult to apply a financial remedy rapidly if unfavourable trends beginto develop).     We should make clear that members of the reserve forcesreceive military salary rates of pay for days spent in training or on oper-ations and that this, in itself, ensures that the value of income fromreserve service is broadly maintained.   We intend to examine training bountiesfurther next year.23CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 3ADDITIONAL PAY AND ALLOWANCES52. In addition to the military salary, there are various forms of supple-mentary payments to which members of the armed forces may be entitled.They fall under the general description of &apos;additional pay&apos; althoughdiffering considerably in character and importance.     We keep these undergeneral review to ensure that each continues to be justified and that itsstructure and level remains appropriate.53. Items of additional pay fall into two broad categories.   Some arepaid continuously and constitute a significant proportion of the totalincome of those who get them.   These items provide an incentive to recruit-ment and retention in certain areas of employment in the armed forces wherethe military salary alone does not provide sufficient inducement - areas,for example, where exceptional skills are scarce, or where experience hasshown that there are perceived disincentives.    We have consistently takenthe view that their value in relation to the military salary should bepreserved, so that they might continue to provide an effective incentive.Flying pay,  parachute pay, submarine pay, diving pay and hydrographic payare the items we have previously identified as falling into this categoryand for these (in addition to the specific recommendations in the followingparagraphs for those items we have reviewed in detail this year) werecommend that the current rates of payment should be increased with effectfrom 1 April 1981 broadly to maintain their value with reference to the over-all movement   in military salaries, as should the rates of those minor formsof additional pay closely associated with them.54. There are certain other items of additional pay that also fall intothe category of continuous career payments, although relatively few indivi-duals are likely to be eligible for them at any one time.   So far as theyare concerned, we consider that the value of additional pay for the SpecialAir Service Regiment and the Special Boat   Squadron of the Royal Marines,and of Gurkha Service pay, should also be maintained broadly by referenceto the overall movement in military salaries and recommend that the ratesbe increased accordingly with effect from 1 April 1981.   The additional payof the Academy Sergeant Major at Sandhurst should also be adjusted on the2kCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsame basis with effect from 1 April 1981 (by use of the formula we estab-lished last year of a link to the differential between Bands 6 and 7 atthe rank of Warrant Officer l).   We have also examined a Ministry ofDefence proposal for a new form of additional pay in this category, formembers of the Royal Marines Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre (para-graphs 70-72).55-    The second main category of additional pay comprises items that areof less importance, in that they are not paid continuously or the amountsinvolved are small in relation to the military salary or, in most cases,both.     We have undertaken a systematic examination of the justificationfor each of these minor items over recent years, and have consideredduring this review evidence from the Ministry of Defence on the approachthat should be adopted to maintaining the value of those that remain inpayment.   We discuss this matter in more detail in paragraph 80.56. Certain allowances that are in the nature of pay also fall within ourfield of review, and we have looked this year at a question relating toseparation allowance (paragraphs 81-82).Parachute pay57. Parachute pay is paid continuously at a flat rate (currently  1.30 aday) to some 2,500 members of the armed forces, the great majority in theParachute Regiment of the Army.    It has been put to us that the paymentcontinues to be necessary both to attract high quality recruits and tocompensate for the risks involved.   We agree that there is a strong casefor its retention on manning grounds as the Parachute Regiment is currentlywell below strength.   Although recruit allocation to the Regiment has beenincreased it will take some time for the position to improve, particularlyas the high standards required mean that a considerable number of recruitsfail to complete basic parachute training.   On the other hand, we do notsee parachute pay as offering a direct compensation for risk.   There areother areas of military life where a similar degree of risk occurs andwhere no financial compensation is offered and, in such cases, we take theview that the risks should be recognised by the application of rigoroussafety standards and by ensuring that proper arrangements exist for compen-sation in the event of accident.   We do not regard the risk factor as25CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALjustifying additional pay except, indirectly, to the extent that suchconsiderations might affect the willingness of individuals to undertakeparticular types of service.58.    We have considered whether there is a case for. a relative improvementin the value of parachute pay, given the present manning difficulties. Theevidence suggests, however, that these difficulties are attributable inlarge measure to training wastage rather than to an inability to attractsufficient recruits or volunteers in the first instance.    We consider,therefore, that the present relative level of payment is adequate, and werecommend that the rate of parachute pay be increased with effect from1 April 198l broadly to preserve its present value with reference to theoverall movement in military salaries.Parachute Jumping Instructors&apos; pay59-    Although the great majority of parachutists are in the Army&apos;sParachute Regiment, responsibility for instruction has rested historicallywith the RAF.    Parachute jumping instructors are drawn from among the RAF&apos;sphysical training specialists: when qualified they receive additional pay(currently  1.48 a day), in recognition of their training responsibilities,which is slightly higher than parachute pay.60.    In general, we see no need for special payments to compensate indivi-duals for instructing which should devolve upon those of more senior rankin the armed forces, as in civil life, without specific compensation.However, a case for continuing to make an exception for parachute jumpinginstructors has been advanced, first on grounds of precedent and, second,because of the need to recruit and retain more instructors to meet anincreased training requirement.    Precedent alone does not offer a sufficientjustification for continuing the present arrangements, but we are concernedthat the Ministry of Defence appears to be facing considerable difficultiesin recruiting the required number of instructors.   To some extent, therestricted field of recruitment must contribute to the recruitment problem,and it seems to us that consideration might be given to the possibility ofextending the field to include other sources within the Services as awhole,   where considerable expertise already lies and where volunteersmay well be found.    Given the manning difficulties, however,we   accept that the slight lead of parachute jumping instructors&apos;CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpay over parachute pay should be retained for the time being, and werecommend that its value should be maintained broadly with reference tothe overall movement in military salaries with effect from 1 April 1981.Payment for members of the Subsunk Parachute Assistance Group61. The subsunk parachute assistance group is composed of specialists insubmarine escape and rescue techniques.    Its members are drawn exclusivelyfrom the submarine escape tank training (SETT) staff at HMS Dolphin andare held available, as part of their normal duties, to lend rapid assis-tance in the event of submarine mishaps.    To carry out this role, membersof the group are trained to parachute into the sea.62. Under present arrangements, they qualify for parachute pay only onthe days on which they undertake a parachute descent (unless they alreadyqualify for continuous payment from a previous Service    appointment). Ithas now been proposed that, as the group is trained and constantly liablefor parachute service, its members should be eligible for parachute payon a continuous basis to put them on a par with others who have similarliabilities.    However, because of their limited parachuting role (they aretrained for descent into water only) it has been suggested that theyshould receive payment at only half the normal rate.63. We have concluded that as there is no case on manning grounds for thechange proposed - membership of the subsunk parachute assistance group isa direct, and for officers inevitable, consequence of volunteering forduty at the SETT - the present arrangements should remain for now. However,in view of the direct link between service at the SETT (which attracts aspecial form of diving pay) and membership of the subsunk parachute assis-tance group, we shall look at this again as part of a re-examination ofdiving pay that we propose to undertake during our next review.Submarine pay64. Submarine pay is payable to all naval officers in the rank of Captainand below, and to all ratings, in the submarine service.    Current rates are:27CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL  a yearLieutenant and above, and all SD List officersActing Sub Lieutenant, Sub Lieutenant (except1,489SD List) Fleet Chief Petty Officerand Chief Petty OfficerPetty OfficerMidshipman, Leading rates and below1,3801,146l.O&apos;lO65&apos; Submarine pay is intended to provide an inducement to join and remainin the submarine service.    It has been suggested to us that it continuesto be justifiable on these grounds and also as providing a degree of recog-nition of both the special environmental conditions attaching to service insubmarines and the higher level of responsibility, rank for rank, borne bysubmariners as against their equivalents in surface ships.66. As well as examining these arguments, we had an opportunity to meetmembers of the submarine service in the course of our visits last year.There are very special conditions attaching to service in submarines - forexample, the need to spend long periods in confined spaces, in artificiallight and often breathing recycled air, and with few of the opportunitiesfor relaxation and recreation that most servicemen would consider normal.We do not underestimate these factors but neither do we accept that it wouldbe right to use submarine pay to compensate directly for them, particularlyas submarine pay remains in continuous payment even when sea-going submarineduties are not involved.   Furthermore, job evaluation evidence does notsuggest that jobs in the submarine service are exceptionally demanding interms either of overall job size or of the particular elements that deter-mine it.67. The case for submarine pay rests on manning grounds and the manningstatistics reflect the inherently unattractive nature of the service.Although the majority of officers are volunteers, in recent years wellunder half the ratings entering the submarine service joined voluntarily.This is not a sufficient proportion.   The Ministry of Defence have emphasisedthe further problem of retaining men in the submarine service.    Because ofthe exceptional environmental conditions, both volunteers and those who areposted into the service have an option to return to general service after-.28CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfive years.     Training courses for submariners are among the longest inthe Navy and, to get the best return for this costly training, managementregards it as important that as many personnel as possible should remainfor the first five years and then volunteer to serve on.68. The main difficulty in retention at present arises from the numberwho leave the Navy altogether without completing the first five years ofsubmarine service (this is possible by transferring to the Navy&apos;s noticescheme which gives a statutory right to free discharge after 18 months&apos;notice, subject to completion of at least three years&apos; service beforedischarge).    It has been argued, therefore, that a solution to the problemmust lie in measures to improve incentives to retention in the Navy as awhole, which we discussed in paragraphs 25-30.   An improvement in overallretention might well have a beneficial effect on the submarine service,but it is also necessary to examine whether the structure of submarine payneeds changing to provide specific encouragement for more submariners tovolunteer for longer service.   We do not consider that the present rank-related structure meets this objective and believe there is a strong casefor linking the rewards within submarine pay to length of service. Anenhanced rate, payable after 5 years in the submarine service, could havea dual effect: it might help to dissuade men from leaving the Navy altogetherduring the early years of submarine service and might also increase thenumber prepared to stay beyond the five year point.     We intend to look atthis possibility in more detail with the Ministry of Defence before reachingconclusions.69. In the meantime, we have considered a proposal for a slight modifi-cation to the existing structure.   The Ministry of Defence have proposedthat Leading Ratings (equivalent to Corporals) should now receive the samerate of submarine pay as Petty Officers.   They argue that this would encourageLeading Ratings to volunteer for submarine service and might also encouragemore junior ratings to achieve promotion within the service.    Although amarginal improvement in the rate of submarine pay is unlikely to have asignificant effect on either recruitment or retention, we endorse the propo-sal as a step in the right direction.   We intend to return to the structureof submarine pay in our next review;  for the present we consider that theexisting structure should continue, subject to the minor change for LeadingRatings, and recommend that the rates in payment should be increased with&quot;--29CONFIDENTIAL

The Ministry of Defence have proposed a new form of additional pay formembers of the Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre of the Royal Marines. Therole of the Cadre is to train Royal Marine commandos in the techniques ofmountain and arctic warfare: it is staffed entirely by Royal Marine volun-teers, almost all at NCO rank, qualified as Mountain Leaders.   Reliance onvolunteers is considered necessary because of the nature of the work; theenvironment in which it is performed; the personal and physical qualitiesrequired; and the degree of separation involved.    We understand there areincreasing difficulties in attracting and retaining sufficient men of therequired calibre to meet training commitments and that the cadre hopes toattract some 56 additional volunteers for training as Mountain Leadersthis year.71. The case for the new form of additional pay rests essentially on man-ning grounds.   The proposal is for two rates of payment, linked to degreeof qualification, which would subsume the parachute pay for which MountainLeaders currently qualify.   We note the present shortage of MountainLeaders and recognise the demanding nature and operational importance ofthe role.    Nonetheless, we cannot endorse the proposals at present. Itwould in our view be premature to introduce this new form of additionalpayment before the review of the Navy&apos;s &apos;all of one company&apos; principle,and its application to the Royal Marines, has been completed (paragraph kl).One effect of this principle in the Royal Marines is that, whatever thenature of their employment, NCOs in the General Duties Branch are paidbroadly Band 5 or Band 6 rates of pay (depending on rank): none is paidin the highest band (Band 7) used where appropriate for equivalent ranksin the Army and RAF.    As part of the review, we intend to examine how farthe depression of pay rates that the &apos;all of one company&apos; principle canproduce is relevant to the problems confronting the Mountain and ArcticWarfare Cadre.72. We doubt also whether the new form of additional pay would signifi-cantly affect the numbers of volunteers coming forward to train as MountainLeaders.    We understand that volunteers are drawn only from those RoyalMarines who have qualified for promotion to Corporal, or who already hold50CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthat rank, and who do not already have a specialist qualification. Atpresent, just over 200 men fall into this category and it must be open todoubt whether the additional number now required can be extracted fromthis limited field, taking into account the necessarily high wastage ratein training and the fact that some may already have been unsuccessful inattempts to join the Cadre.   We suggest that, as part of a more detailedre-examination of the case for additional pay for members of the Cadre, theMinistry of Defence should look at the possibility of meeting its manningobjectives, at least in part, by extending the field of recruitment.Flying pay73.   We have already recommended (paragraph 53) that the existing rates offlying pay (and its associated forms) should be increased with effectfrom 1 April 198l broadly to maintain their value in relation to the over-all movement in military salaries.   Following a detailed examination offlying pay last year, however, we indicated in our Ninth Report that therewere certain issues we proposed to pursue&quot;*&quot;.     They are discussed in thefollowing paragraphs.Differentials7h-    Although the revised structure we recommended last year broadly main-tained the relationship between rates of flying pay for officers and NCOs,we were not convinced that this distinction should continue.   We have nowreceived further evidence on this point from the Ministry of Defence, whoconsider that the general differences in flying pay between officers andNCOs should be retained but that, exceptionally, NCO pilots should receivethe same rate of flying pay as officers.    They argue that because of thenature of their training, responsibilities and skills, NCO pilots (togetherwith officer aircrew) are more attractive to potential civilian employersthan other categories of NCO aircrew, and that there is, therefore, acase for paying them relatively more flying pay as an aid to retention.75*    We have now obtained detailed information on manning levels, recruit-ment and wastage rates in the various aircrew ranks and categories and we1Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report, 1980, Cmnd.    7899, May 1980(paragraphs 50-67).31CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALagree that it does not support the case for any general change at thepresent time.    However, this conclusion applies equally to NCO pilots,most of whom are in the Army Air Corps (AAC)^&quot; where they comprise aboutkO per cent of the pilot strength.   About one third of the NCO pilots inthe AAC are seconded for a tour of flying duty from elsewhere within theArmy.     We appreciate from our discussions with senior management in theServices that the present distinctions between officer and NCO pilot ratesof flying pay are a cause of concern: and when we visited the AAC last yearmany of the pilots we met - particularly officers - told us theythought the present distinctions to be unfair.     Nonetheless,    we do notaccept that it would be right to introduce the parity of flying pay pro-posed.     Recruitment of NCO pilots to the AAC is satisfactory: indeed, weunderstand that recruiting targets were exceeded in the last training year.The only manning problem is with the retention of seconded personnel in theArmy on completion of a tour of duty with the AAC.    It seems to us thatthis problem may be a direct result of the policy of secondment, in thatseconded NCOs - who have acquired very marketable skills - may leave theArmy altogether rather than return to their parent units at the end of atour, because of the significant drop in income that would result from theloss of flying pay.76.   The fact that the AAC relies to a significant extent on seconded person-nel also has the consequence that the Army cannot require as long a returnof service from its pilots as do the other two Services: provision has to bemade for return to a parent arm or corps within a reasonable time scale toavoid an unacceptable disruption to career development.     The Army has2reviewed the situation since we referred to this problem in our last report,and the minimum term of service required on completion of flying trainingis being increased from three to four years.    However, this change will notnecessarily increase productive flying service - the prime concern - as itwill ensure only that seconded personnel who do not transfer to the permanentcadre of the AAC, or extend their tour, serve at least one further year intheir parent unit.      The average productive return from flying training inthe AAC is likely to remain below that in the other two Services.There are less than kO NCO pilots in the RN, RM and the RAF, comparedwith some 160 in the Army. Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report 1980, Cmnd. 7899, May I98O(paragraph 59)-32CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL77-   We have examined with the Ministry of Defence whether it would beappropriate for the AAC to change to a policy of full permanent cadremanning.    They remain of the view that the partial reliance on a policyof secondment is desirable, as the flow of pilots into and out of the AACensures that the Corps as a whole does not lose touch with battlefieldneeds.    We are not in a position to gauge these management arguments butwe note that, at present, the policy appears to be working unsatisfac-torily, as few seconded NCO pilots return to their parent unit: most seekto transfer to the AAC permanent cadre; to extend their initial flyingtour in the hope of eventual transfer; or leave the Army altogether (forthe reasons we have outlined).     None of this improves the case for increa-sing the rate of flying pay for NCO pilots: indeed, to do so would belikely to exacerbate the retention problem, as the drop in income at theend of a period of secondment to the AAC would be greater.   We take theview that the Ministry of Defence should examine whether it might be appro-priate to introduce some form of mark-time or tapering arrangement forflying pay, to operate over a limited period at the end of a tour ofseconded duty in the AAC, so that an abrupt drop in income may be avoided.This might help to improve the flow between the AAC and other units in theArmy and thereby to meet management&apos;s general objectives.    Such arrange-ments would need to be confined to those who remained committed to a careerin the armed forces.Rates of flying pay for NCOs in the Royal Marines and Royal Navy78.    We expressed concern in our Ninth Report&quot;&apos;&quot; about the complex arrange-ments governing rates of flying pay for NCO aircrew in the Royal Navy andRoyal Marines.    We explained that in many aircrew categories, the rateswere higher than those applying in the Army or RAF because of the need, incertain instances, to balance the depression of military salary caused bythe  &apos;all of one company&apos; principle.    Our concern on this point remains and,until our review of the principle has been completed (paragraph kl), werecommend that the rates of flying pay for NCOs in the Royal Navy andRoyal Marines should continue to be set at levels that broadly maintainparity of total earnings at each rank with equivalent NCO aircrew in theRAF and the AAC, respectively: the rates we recommend for implementationwith effect from 1 April 1981 are in Appendix 5-1Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report, I98O, Cmnd. 7899, May 1980(paragraph 6l).33CONFIDENTIAL

We haveconcluded that they are satisfactory, and recommend that they should beretained.Minor forms of additional pay2 380. We identified in our Fourth   and Ninth   Reports various minor itemsof additional pay which we considered to be justified and for which werecommended appropriate rates of payment.   The Ministry of Defence haveproposed that we should review these items trienially, their value beingmaintained in the intervening years by reference to movements in the mili-tary salary.   We endorse the proposal for a basic review once every threeyears, and intend to look at these minor items again in detail during the1982-83 review.     We do not agree, however, that there should be automaticinterim increases, but intend to keep the level of payments under reviewbetween the triennial examinations.   We set out in Appendix 5 the rates of pay-ment that we consider to be appropriate, and that we recommend shouldapply with effect from 1 April 1981.Separation allowance81. Last year, we recommended an increase in the rates of separation allow-ance in order to maintain their value, and a change in the conditions attach-ing to payment of the allowance, to provide greater flexibility.    We alsosaid we would look again at whether duration of separation, rather thandistance   as under the present arrangements, might provide a better criter-ion for distinguishing between the higher and lower rates of the allowance.Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report, 1980, Cmnd. 7899, May I98O(paragraph 67).tReview Body on Armed Forces Pay, Fourth Report, 1975, Cmnd. 6063, May 1975.(paragraph 70).Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report, 1980, Cmnd. 7899, May 1980(paragraphs 68-82).34CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL82.   The Ministry of Defence have argued for  retention of the presentarrangements, primarily on the grounds that there are tangible extra costsarising from separation over long distances.    Although we consider thatneither distance nor duration alone provides a wholly satisfactory criter-ion, we agree that the present arrangements should be retained for the timebeing so that the changes introduced in our last review can have a chanceto settle down.    We recommend that current rates of payment should beincreased with effect from 1 April I98I to the levels set out inAppendix 5 35CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 4CHARGES83. Each year we make recommendations on the level of charges for foodand accommodation provided to members of the armed forces.   On thisoccasion, our recommendations involve significant increases which are,nonetheless, in our judgment a reasonable reflection of increases in costsborne by the population at large.   The principles of the military salaryrequire that members of the armed forces should be paid appropriately inrelation to levels of pay outside and should be charged a realistic pricefor food and accommodation.   The two aspects are inseparable: it would bewrong to set charges at an artificially low level when pay is kept up todate or, equally, to exact fully appropriate charges if pay were to be heldbelow up-to-date levels.   One other general point should be borne in mind.The information upon which we base our recommendations on charges relates,of necessity, to levels of costs up to one year earlier than the date fromwhich the new charges are applied.    In practice, this provides members ofthe armed forces with an advantage that should not be overlooked: they areasked to meet a fixed level of charges for the next 12 months that civilianshave already had to bear.Food charges84. We said in our last report&quot;*&quot; that it was time to take a fresh look atthe method of assessing the Service food charge, as the present system wasbased on the concept of the ration allowance that had become obsolete withthe introduction of the military salary in 1970.   The Ministry of Defencehave now completed a detailed examination of the current arrangement andtake the view that&apos;it has two particular drawbacks: firstly, it is based onan outmoded concept that is difficult to explain to servicemen and,secondly,the value of some of the items that it comprehends is difficult to updatefrom readily available data.85. The Ministry of Defence have examined various alternative approaches.They do not consider that the serviceman should meet the full retail cost ofhis food because, owing to the demands of Service life, above average nutri-tional standards are a management requirement (indeed, the concern to1Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report 1980, Cmnd. 7899, May I98O(paragraph 90).36CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDEN I IALmaintain those standards has remained the principal objection to intro-ducing &apos;pay as you dine&apos; arrangements in the armed forces).    Instead, theyhave suggested that the most acceptable basis for the food charge would beto set it at a level comparable to the costs borne by civilians, as shownby the Department of Employment&apos;s annual Family Expenditure Survey (FES).86. Several advantages are seen in this approach.    It would be consistentwith the principles of the military salary, and would be based on publishedinformation which could readily relate Service food costs to those borneby civilians; analyses in the FES of expenditure by income range withintype of household make it possible to identify the expenditure of those inthe survey who most closely correspond to the single serviceman; and thebase data can be updated by reference to movements in the food elements ofthe Retail Price Index (RPI).87. The proposals include two other main points.   The Ministry of Defencehave suggested that the element within the food charge that recognises thecosts, other than labour costs, of preparing meals - the Meals ServiceElement - should be retained.   This element covers, essentially, the costof fuel, and the Ministry of Defence have confirmed (with the Gas andElectricity Councils) that it provides a reasonable reflection of the fuelcosts that civilians bear in preparing food, and also that it can beupdated readily by reference to the fuel elements in the RPI.   They alsopropose that the food charge should continue to be reduced by 10 per centto take account of average weekend absences by members of the armed forces(food charges are remitted for authorised leave exceeding 48 hours but notfor weekend absences of a shorter period, because of the problem of colla-ting and recording information on the incidence of such absences). TheMinistry of Defence consider that it remains reasonable to assume thatservicemen will, on average, be away from their unit for one weekend inthree on this basis - approximately two days in twenty - and that a 10 percent abatement in the food charge is the most convenient way to ensure that,in general, servicemen do not have to pay for meals that they are not thereto eat.88.   We have adopted this new approach.    It is easy to understand and toexplain; is based on readily accessible information; and can be updatedannually to keep pace with the increase in food prices and in fuel costs.It is fully in keeping with the principles of the military salary and, inour view, produces an equitable charge.     On this basis we recommend a food37CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcharge with effect from 1 April 1981 of  1.67 a day ( 11.69 a week). Thisrepresents an increase of nearly 26 per cent.    If the existing method hadbeen retained, the charge would have been  10.71 a week.   We do notconsider the difference sufficient to justify any &apos;staging&apos; arrangements,bearing in mind that the charge we recommend reflects costs that civiliansin similar circumstances have already had to meet.89.   The Ministry of Defence have also reviewed the regulations governingthe payment of the food charge, in particular the waiver for married menwho are living voluntarily on an unaccompanied basis in a mess or barracks.This concession is linked historically to the qualifying conditions forpayment of the ration allowance, and we know from our visits to Serviceestablishments that it causes considerable resentment amongst singlepersonnel who believe that they are  &apos;subsidising&apos; the married unaccompaniedman&apos;s meals.    This is not so, nor will it be so under the new system wehave now adopted where the charge is related to costs borne by civilians.Nevertheless, we recognise the strong feelings that the matter raises. TheMinistry of Defence take the view that, under the new arrangements theyhave proposed, the free food concession for those who are voluntarily separ-.ated from their families should cease.   They believe that the existence ofthe&quot; concession encourages unaccompanied service, contrary to the Services&apos;general aim of keeping families together: they also consider that it ignoresthe savings in household expenditure in these circumstances.    However, theMinistry of Defence accept that the increasing tendency to opt for volun-tary married unaccompanied terms of service is also an inevitable conse-quence of Lhe increase in- the number of home owners in the armed forces andof the difficulty that married men face in uprooting wives and families ifposted some distance away from home.    They have suggested, therefore, thatabolition of the current concession should not take effect until measuresto assist home owners to move with their families have been introduced aspart of the intended assisted house purchase arrangements (paragraph 101):and that, because of the significant impact on individuals, the changeshould be phased in over a period of years following the introduction ofthese measures.90.   We see the argument that, once appropriate measures have been intro-duced to assist house owners in the armed forces to move with their families,it would be inappropriate to perpetuate the present free food concession formarried unaccompanied men.    However, there are certain aspects of the38 .CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALproposals we wish to eonsider further.   There are significant differencesin conditions of service generally between married and single personnel,and we do not think it would be right to endorse detailed change in justone aspect without examining the full range of differences more closely.We intend to undertake such an examination during the- next, review.   V/e arein any case not entirely convinced that it would be appropriate to levythe full food charge on the married unaccompanied man.   The food charge isrelated to civilian expenditure on food, but because it is applied tosingle servicemen the comparison drawn is with the expenditure of thesingle-person household in civilian life.    It is possible to argue that,in circumstances where a married serviceman is charged for food, the chargeshould be related to at least a two-person household: the food costs asshown by the FES for such households are less per individual than for asingle person.    The notion of &apos;home savings&apos; might accordingly suggest alower level of food charge.   Other points of detail that v/e want to examineinclude the interim arrangements that should be applied, and what needthere might be for exceptions - for example, for those awaiting allocationof a quarter before being joined by their families, or for very shortpostings.Accommodation charges91. The military salary concept, requires that Service accommodationcharges should be broadly in line with the amounts paid by civilians insimilar circumstances.    This is achieved by relating the charges formarried quarters to the average rents charged by local authorities forhouses of similar size; the average rates payable for each type of quarter:and a charge for the cost of maintenance and decoration that exceeds localauthority practice.    There is also a hire charge for furniture and house-hold equipment provided by the Services.92. The two principal constituent elements of accommodation charges arethose covering rents and rates.    We undertook a detailed examination ofboth last year and provided new bases of assessment&quot;&apos;&quot;.    V/e have determinedthese elements of the charges in the same way this year.]&apos;Heview Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report, I980, Cmnd. 7899, May 1980(paragraphs 91-95).39
CONFIDENTIAL93.    The effect of last year&apos;s change in the method of assessment of therent element was to abate it to reflect only that part of local authorityrents which related to the direct cost of occupancy - the running costs interms of supervision and management and expenditure on repairs - ratherthan capital costs.    This recognised the fact that those in Servicequarters do not enjoy the same degree of security of long term tenure asdo local authority tenants.    In the light of the latest analyses of localauthority housing expenditure, published by the Chartered Institute ofPublic Finance and Accountancy&apos; (CIPFA), we see no need for a change in thelevel of abatement of the rent element.    The increases in the rent elementof the charges that are incorporated, in our recommendations this year there-fore reflect, directly, significant increases in local authority rentlevels. This underlines the point that we made last year, that the rela-tively low order of increase was likely to be a once and for all effectresulting from the change in the basis of assessment.94.    There is, however, a further point that has a potential effect on thelevel of abatement.     As we have explained, the rent element of the Serviceaccommodation charge is now related to that proportion of local authorityrents that&apos; might reasonably be deemed to represent the contribution localauthority tenants make to cover the day-to-day running costs of the housingstock.    It is appropriate under the military salary concept to provide alink with local authority costs rather than with the costs actually incurredby the Property Services Agency (PSA) in running, managing and maintainingService accommodation.    The implicit assumption is that the basic standardsof management and maintenance of Service accommodation are broadly compar-able to those applying in local authorities, but there is some evidence fromour visits to Service units of a decline in basic maintenance standards asa result of recent cutbacks in the PSA&apos;s budget.    The Ministry of Defencehave also expressed concern to us about a decline in standards of accommo-dation (including maintenance standards) because of&apos;financial pressures,but the information we have does not justify further reduction in the rentelement of accommodation charges at&apos;present.    Any recent reductions inmaintenance expenditure will not have affected standards during the periodthat is relevant to this year&apos;s assessment of the rent element of thecharges, given that the most recent firm information that we have relates tolocal authority rent levels in April 1980, before the cutbacks in PSA expen-diture occurred.    Moreover, before any reduction on these grounds could beCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALconsidered, it would be necessary to demonstrate that there had been nrelative decline in the standard of maintenance for Service accommodationcompared with that applying in local authorities.   As yet, we have noinformation on this but note that general financial pressures are alsoaffecting local authority expenditure.    We shall look at these pointsnext year against the later information that will then be available.95-   There is a related issue.   We have mentioned the separate additionalmaintenance element in accommodation charges that is intended to cover thecost of certain types of maintenance work undertaken by the PSA which gobeyond the basic range normally undertaken in local authorities.    It coversrepairs to electrical and gas appliances, minor plumbing repairs and someof the costs of internal decoration (other than those arising from thefrequent changes of occupancy) that, in local authority practice, would bethe responsibility of the tenant.    In our Ninth Report&quot;&apos;&quot;, we indicated thatwe had asked the Ministry of Defence to undertake, in conjunction with thePSA, a fundamental review of the underlying assumptions made and the attri-bution of costs that flowed from them.    This review has now been completedand, although there are still some technical matters that we need toexamine further, we agree with the general conclusion that the PSAcontinues to provide a maintenance service that exceeds normal local author-ity provision.    We consider that the present attribution of costs - a fixedpercentage (around Ik per cent) of total maintenance costs incurred by PSAon the various types of quarter.- remains the most appropriate way ofdetermining the level of this element of the accommodation charge. However,the potential impact of expenditure cutbacks on the PSA&apos;s ability to under-take such maintenance will need to be kept in mind.    As with basic mainten-ance, the charge appropriate under this heading for 1 April 1981 is basedon PSA maintenance costs in a period before there was a general cut-backin expenditure.96. There are two other items arising from our Ninth Report that need tobe mentioned. We urged Service management last year to consider whethermembers of the armed forces should be given a greater choice of furnished,Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report,I98O, Cmnd. 7899, May 1980(paragraph 96).Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report.,1980, Cmnd. 7899, May I98O(paragraph 97).CONFIDENTIAL
partially-furnished or unfurnished quarters.   At present, there is littlechoice, as virtually all quarters are offered on a furnished basis: wethought this unnecessarily restrictive.   We have been told by the Ministryof Defence that consideration is being given to the scope for a moreliberal policy.   Several studies of the issues involved have been commis-sioned (including an attitude survey of members of the armed forces). V/eunderstand that such a change might have financial implications that wouldbe unacceptable in current circumstances but we hope, nonetheless, that theMinistry of Defence will be able to make some progress, as we are sure thatthe change we have advocated would have much to commend it.97. The second item concerns the classification of Service accommodation.We endorsed in principle in our last report   proposals for the reclassifi-cation of married and single accommodation.    They were aimed at putting thedesignation of sub-standard accommodation in each Service onto a consistentbasis, taking environment and amenity considerations into account, and withmore flexibility than hitherto.    We said that the Ministry of Defence andthe Civil Service Department should consider the range of features that wererelevant and that we would then consider the level of charges for the stan-dards of quarter identified.    We have now been told that, because of thepotential budgetary impact, the Ministry of Defence do not feel able toproceed with this proposal for the time being.   We have therefore this yearassessed the charges for sub-standard accommodation on the establishedbasis.    We understand, however, that until such time as a more flexiblesystem can be introduced, the Ministry of Defence intend to apply theexisting criteria for determining what is sub-standard accommodation in amore consistent fashion, to remove certain anomalies which have developedbetween the Services in interpreting the existing rules.   We regard thisas a step in the right direction but it does not remove the need for a moreflexible approach less dependent on size or space criteria.98. We recommend that the charges in Tables 5 and 6 should be introducedfor married and single accommodation,- respectively, from 1 April 198l. V/ealso provide in Table 7 a breakdown of the total annual charges for standardmarried quarters into their four constituent elements.&quot;&apos;&quot;Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Ninth Report, I98O, Cmnd. 7899, May I98O(paragraph 98).CONFIDENTIAL

Our concern is to set appropriate levels of charges for accommodationprovided by the Services, but we know from our visits to Service units, andfrom discussions with management, of the problems which arise from the increase-ing tendency of servicemen to become home owners as soon as they are able. Wefirst drew attention to this problem in 1972.     The natural desire of the service-man to gain a foothold in the property market is difficult to reconcile with thedemands of Service life, with its frequent changes of location and understandablemanagement preference for servicemen to live near their place of duty. Theresult has been an increase in family separation and larger numbers of vacantmarried quarters.    This is unsatisfactory for both the individual and theServices: it reduces efficiency, and produces welfare and morale problems.Report of the Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, 1972, Cmnd. 4954, April 197?,(paragraph 79).44CONFIDENTIAL
COMFitscN&apos;t&apos;lAL101. Against this background, we were pleased to note the announcementlast year by the then Secretary of State for Defence   that the Governmentintends to introduce, as soon as the financial situation permits, animproved assisted house purchase scheme for the Army and EAF, modelled onthe arrangements already applying in the Royal Navy.    This would providea six months advance of pay, within certain limits, at age 30 or over, toall personnel (married or single) who remain committed to the armed forces.We understand the arrangements would also include provisions to make iteasier for home owners in the armed forces to move house with their fami-lies when they are posted.    We believe that these proposals would go someway towards easing the difficulties to which we have referred, by makingit easier for the younger serviceman or servicewoman to accept, in theinterests of the Service, a delay in entering the property market. Theywould also improve the prospects of keeping families together in the turbu-lent environment of Service life.   We hope that the measures proposed willbe implemented as soon as possible.Hansard, Volume 990, No 230, S August 1980, Columns 479-480.CONFIDENTIAL
CHAPTER 5COSTS AND CONCLUSIONS102. We estimate that the costs of our recommendations in the yearbeginning 1 April I.98I are as follows:Military salary (all Services)   millionOfficers 47-6Officers promoted from the ranks 6.2Servicemen and servicewomen 160.1Young entrants and apprentices 4.1Reserve forces   5-4223.3Additional pay and allowances inthe nature of pay (all Services) 4.9Total cost of increases in pay 228.2Charges (all Services)   millionIncreased yields: Food 12.0Accommodation 19-2 31-2Net cost of recommendations 197-0103.       The total cost of the increases in pay arising from our recommenda-tions represents an increase of 10.3 per cent over the estimated pay billfor 1981-82 at current rates.   The net cost of our recommendations, takingaccount of increases in food and accommodation charges, represents anincrease of 9-4 per cent.   We are conscious that our recommendations willproduce, for some ranks, a relatively small net increase.    This is partly aconsequence of the fact that changes in the levels of both remunerationand charges take effect from a common date (1 April) and charges arededucted before pay is received.    It is also partly because our recommenda-tions reflect a significant increase this year in the adjustment we havemade, when comparing remuneration, for the relative benefits associatedwith armed forces pensions provisions (essentially early pensionabilityand inflation-proofing).    Nonetheless, we consider that our recommendationsare consistent with the overriding principle of the military salary thatboth the income received and the costs borne by the serviceman should be--broadly on a par with those that apply at equivalent levels in civilian life.Based on the manpower strengths of the armed forces in I98I-82 as forecastby the Ministry of Defence for budgetary purposes.   To the extent thatstrengths differ in practice the costs of implementing the recommendationswill also differ. Totals may not- equal the sum of the components as figureshave been rounded.46CONFIDENTIAL
104. We shall need to return to the question of pensions and have alsoidentified several other major issues that we intend to look at further -the provision of retention incentives; the effects of the Royal Navy&apos;s&apos;all of one company&apos; principle; the treatment of women under the X factor;the differences in the conditions of service of married and single personneland, as part &quot;of a continuing review, certain items of additional pay.105. We make our recommendations this year in a difficult period forthe economy as a whole, and against the background of restricted provisionfor paybill increases within the cash limit system that applies to publicexpenditure.   However, we continue to regard it as our prime function toexercise independent judgment, and we are satisfied that the levels ofmilitary salary and charges that we have recommended in this report areappropriate for implementation now, in the light of all the evidence wehave received and of the approach to our task that we have developed overthe years.OFFICE OF MANPOWER ECONOMICS15 April I98ICONFIDENTIAL
C O N F \ 0 E N XIAIAPPENDIX 1REVIEW BODY ON ARMED FORCES PAYEVALUATION OF SUPERANNUATION BENEFITSReport by the Government Actuary1. INTRODUCTION1.1 In its Ninth Report, 1980 (Cmnd 7899), the Review Body on Armed ForcesPay indicated that it had asked the Government Actuary to undertake aspecific evaluation of Services&apos; pensions arrangements and to compare itwith an evaluation of general pensions practice.    For 1980 and earlier yearsthe adjustment made by the Review Body in respect of the value of pensionbenefits was based on the adjustments used in the context of negotiated payin the Civil Service.    This report, which summarises the information alreadyprovided to the Review Body, therefore represents the first detailedcomparison of the value of the superannuation benefits available to membersof the armed forces with that of their comparators elsewhere.   The reportquantifies this difference in superannuation benefits but it is for theReview Body to decide to what extent armed forces pay should be adjusted totake into account differences in superannuation benefits.    I shall be provid-ing separate advice relating to medical and dental officers in the armedforces.1.2 Members of the armed forces are pensionable under a Scheme operated bymeans of Prerogative Instruments.   The Scheme, is non-contributory andbasically provides a maximum pension on retirement at age 55 of aboutone-half of final pay, together with a lump sum of three years&apos; pensionand a widow&apos;s pension of one-half the man&apos;s pension.    Pensions increases,similar to those under the Pensions (Increase) Acts, protect the benefitsagainst price inflation after award.   The main provisions of the Scheme aregiven in some detail in Annex 1.Cii&apos;S i  &quot;! uH&apos;li&apos;i I SAL
CONFIDENTIAL2.     DATA AVAILABLE2.1   The calculations have been based on information supplied by theMinistry of Defence (MOD) and the Office of Manpower Economics (OME).MOD have supplied details of members of the armed forces:   numbera by-age, rank and salary together with details of those leaving the forces.From this information typical career patterns can be constructed,separately for officers and other ranks, for new entrants to the armedforces allowing for their chances of promotion and for the chances oftheir Service career ceasing because of retirement, death or withdrawal(with or without a deferred pension).2.2   Details have been supplied by OME of the pension schemes for thosecomparators that the Review Body uses for the purposes of pay comparisonsfor members of the armed forces.   As well as summarising the main benefitsand the employee contribution rates of each scheme, information was providedon the provisions and practice in relation to increases of pensions afteraward.   The information for each scheme was provided in one of the followingforms:(i)   a copy of the scheme rule book or explanatory booklet forthe scheme&apos;s members;(ii)   a brief questionnaire summarising the main provisions ofthe scheme;(iii)   a summary of the main provisions of the scheme as recordedby a firm of management consultants in their survey ofemployee benefits.The information provided, although not fully comprehensive, was adequate forthe purpose. An analysis of the superannuation arrangements of the compara-tor schemes is given in Annex 2.2.3   Details have also been provided by OME of the weighting factor whichthe Review Body wished to be applied to each comparator scheme when derivingthe weighted average value of all comparator pension schemes.    In all,information on some 550 comparator pension schemes was provided separatelyfor officers, senior NCOs (sergeants or equivalents and higher ranks) andlower ranks.2.
CONFIDENTIAL3.     TILE NATURE OF THE COMPARISON3.1   To compare the benefits of different superannuation schemes a valuehas to be put on those benefits.    Such comparison can only be on the basisof the expected value of superannuation benefits to an average schememember.    An appropriate way to measure these benefits is to express the valueof benefits oyer a whole career as the &quot;normal&quot; contribution rate (expressedas a level percentage of pay);    this is the rate that, if paid into a fundand accumulated throughout the career of the average member, would justsuffice to provide his benefits if the assumptions made as to interest,inflation, mortality, pay scales etc. were exactly realised.   This is theapproach adopted, for example, in connection with the adjustment for differencesin superannuation benefits for Civil Service pay research.3-2   However, one special problem is encountered when setting the ArmedForces Pension Scheme against those of the comparators, which is not met whenmaking the corresponding comparison for the Civil Service pension scheme.Most comparator schemes provide pension on retirement at ages in the regionof 60 or 65.    Thus a full career in the comparator employment would cover thewhole span of an individual&apos;s working life.    As the same is true of the CivilService, it is meaningful to make a direct comparison between the Civil Servicepension scheme and that of a comparator - both schemes are designed for thesame basic type of career and it is only the details which differ.The comparison asks the question &quot;what would be the difference in value tothe civil servant if, during his Civil Service career, he was subject to therules of the comparator scheme rather than those of the Civil Service scheme?&quot;.3.3   A direct comparison of this sort does not appear appropriate in the caseof the armed forces because, unlike the comparator schemes, the Armed ForcesScheme is designed to provide benefits at an early age (in many cases topeople in their early ^lOs, or even their late 30s) after a career which coversonly part of the working lifetime of the individual.    The scheme is not,however, designed to make it unnecessary for the forces pensioner-to engagein subsequent gainful occupation.    An alternative approach to allow for thefact that the average career in the armed forces is much shorter than theaverage career in comparator employment, might be to compare the superannua-tion benefits accruing during a career in the armed forces with those accruingover the same period in comparator employment.    The disadvantage of this-approach though lies in its unrealistic treatment of comparators; mostcomparator pension schemes are not designed with significant retirement at3.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthese relatively young ages in mind.    As it is essential to compare likewith like, this approach was not adopted.    Instead, it was consideredappropriate to take into account what happens after the period equivalentto a career in the armed forces:    for the comparator, the superannuationbenefits accruing over the remainder of a full career in comparator employ-ment are therefore taken into account;    and for the member of the armedforces, account is taken of the superannuation benefits that may accrueduring any civilian employment entered into after retiring from the forces.Thus the comparison involves considering the benefits accruing over the wholespan of working life.3.4   The approach adopted therefore considers the value of superannuationbenefits accruing over the whole of working life afld the comparison made isbetween:(i)    the value of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme benefits accruingduring a career in the armed forces together with (in the caseof those retiring from the forces with an immediate pensionother than an invaliding pension) the value of superannuationbenefits accruing during any subsequent civilian employment; and(ii)    the value of the benefits accruing during a whole career subjectto comparator scheme superannuation benefits including thatscheme&apos;s age of retirement.3.5   When considering the. value of superannuation benefits accruing duringcivilian employment for retired members of the armed forces (as in (i) ofparagraph 3-4), it is assumed that the typical civilian employment and itssuperannuation benefits will be identical to the benefits provided by thecomparator schemes.    It should be noted that only those who retire from thearmed forces with an immediate pension are considered when assessing thevalue of superannuation benefits during any subsequent civilian employment;these are the members who, but for the special requirements of the armedforces, might have remained in the armed forces for the rest of their workinglives.    Because these retired members of the forces are actually in receiptof pension, there is room for uncertainty as to whether or not they willenter civilian employment;    the extent to which these retired members of theforces will take up civilian employment and any allowance for the fact&quot;thatthose who do might be earning less than they were while in the forces areconsidered i.n paragraph 9.9 below.    On the other hand thoso who withdraw
from the forces without an immediate pension (whether or not they haverights to a deferred pension) will usually have no other means of supportand will therefore be obliged to seek civilian employment.   Their position,once they have left the forces, can therefore be assumed to be identicalto that of a similar person leaving comparator employment without animmediate pension.    For this reason, in a comparison exercise such asthis no allowance need be made for any subsequent civilian employment forthose who leave the armed forces without an immediate pension so long asno allowance is made for subsequent employment for those comparators whowithdraw from their employment;    this is the approach adopted in the calcula-tions.3.6 The difference between (i) and (ii) in paragraph 3-4 can be consideredto be the difference between the superannuation benefits for members of thearmed forces and those for comparators.    Although the approach adoptedconsiders the whole of working life, it is necessary to relate the differencein superannuation benefits to the career in the armed forces.    The differencebetween (i) and (ii) is therefore expressed as a level percentage of payduring the career in the armed forces.      &apos;  3.7 All the comparators are male.    Accordingly the superannuation benefitsto male, members of the armed forces and comparator schemes have beenevaluated throughout.4.     BASIS OF CALCULATIONS4.1   The actuarial assumptions to be adopted for valuing the superannuationbenefits as described in Section 3 must cover a long period of time. Theresults of the calculations will be applied when determining the pay ofpresent members of the armed forces who will be retiring at all times up to35 or more years from now and who may draw pensions for a good deal longer.It is essential therefore to look not just at the immediate future but alsofar ahead and for this purpose the experience of the recent past taken byitself cannot be regarded as a reliable guide.
CONFIDBNTiAL4.2 Of particular importance in the calculations are the assurrvptionsregarding the yield on investments and the rates of increase in pricesand earnings.    I have assumed that, over the long term, the yields oninvestments (including capital appreciation as well as interest) will onaverage exceed increases in the general level of earnings by 1 per centper annum and increases in prices by 2-g- per cent per annum. (Separateallowance was made for career increases in earnings with increasing ageand promotion).    I have also assumed that the rate of increase in pricesv/i 11 average 7 per cent per annum.    Taken together, these assumptionsimply that the yield on investments will be about 9&quot;J Per cent per annumand that the general level of earnings will increase by about 8^ per centper annum.    They a.lso imply an increase in real earnings of about 1-j percent per annum.4.3 The assumptions described in the previous paragraph are those I wouldconsider appropriate at the present time.    I have therefore based mycalculations in this report on these assumptions. Howeverin the Report of the Inquiry into the Value cf Pensions chaired bySir Bernard Scott (the Scott Report, Crnnd 8147) various alternative economicassumptions were considered and two sets of assumptions thought to besuitable upper and lower limits to the range of &quot;reasonable&quot; assumptionswere suggested.    In Section 6 I indicate hov; the various calculations wouldbe affected if the Scott Report upper and lower limits to the range of&quot;reasonable&quot; assumptions were adopted, instead of the basis described in thissection.4.4 The rest of the basis for the calculations (with the exception of pensionsincreases which are discussed in paragraphs 4.6 to 4.10 below) is essentiallyan attempt to define an average career and an average life after retirement.Assumptions about entry ages, rates of mortality and withdrawal from service(on invaliding grounds or otherwise), career salary progression (as distinctfrom general increases in the level of earnings), age at retirement and propor-tions married etc. have been based on the experience of members of the armedforces as shown by the MOD data.    Detailed information about mortality afterretirement from the armed forces is not so readily available but suitableassumptions consistent with the limited data available have been made.Average entry ages to the armed forces of 22 (officers) and 19 (other ranks)havebeen assumed;    other assumptions are set out for specimen ages in Annex 3-6.
4.5 Retirement from the armed forces with an immediate pension (exceptwhere retirement is on invaliding grounds) can occur from age 37 onwardsfor officers and from age 40 onwards for other ranks;    the average agesare about 46-g (officers) and about 43j (other ranks).   These thereforeare the assumed average ages of retirement when considering careers in thearmed forces and are also the assumed average starting&apos; ages when consideringthose members of the forces retiring with an immediate pension who embarkon a second career in civilian life (as discussed in paragraphs 3.4 and 3.5above).    For comparators the average age at retirement depends on the minimumretiring age of the comparator scheme.   For most comparators the minimumretiring age is 65 and an average age at retirement of 655 has been assumed.For comparators with a minimum retiring age of 60 the assumed average ageat retirement is 6lJ (or 62-j for public service schemes).   There are a fewcomparators, such as policemen or firemen, with a lower minimum retiring age.The weighted average retirement age assumed for all comparators is about 65.4.6 The information provided by OME on comparator pension schemes includeddetails of the provisions and past practice of the scheme in regard toincreases in pensions in payment.   The assumptions to be made for the futureare affected by the Social Security Pensions Act which came into force on1 April 1978.    The majority of comparator schemes have been contracted outof the upper tier of the State pension scheme;    for such schemes full priceprotection for the guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) forming part of the schemebenefits will be provided by the State scheme.    I have therefore assumed thatthe schemes themselves will not provide any increase on the GMP.4.7 Recent years have been years of very high inflation, sometimes accom-panied by poor investment performance.   The increases in pension that havebeen given therefore reflect the achievements of comparator schemes at atime of great difficulty and it would perhaps be reasonable to expect ahigher degree of price protection in easier times.    The new State scheme,which provides cost of living increases on the GMP part of occupationalpensions, will have an important effect on the position, but in a lesGstraightforward way.   Employers may feel that the need for pensions increaseshas diminished, since the State scheme is providing some protection.    On theother hand, they might wish to provide as much by way of increases from theirown resources as they did before;    this would imply a higher increase&quot;-thanbefore on the pension in excess of the GMP.7.
CONFIDENTIAL4.8   Taking all these considerations into account, the following assumptionswere made as regards the pension in excess of the GMP (and for the wholepension in schemes that are not contracted-out):(i)    where the rules of a scheme provide for increases linked tocost of living, either through the Pensions (Increase) Actsor in some other way,  such increases will continue to begiven;(ii)    where fixed-rate increases (usually 3 per cent a year) areprovided increases at that rate will continue;(iii)   where increases are discretionary only, the scheme willcontinue to give increases that represent the same propor-tion of full cost of living protection as in the recentpast, subject to a limit of 95 per cent;(iv)    where both fixed and discretionary increases are provided,the scheme will in future provide the fixed-rate increaseplus discretionary increases that represent the same propor-tion of the excess of increases in the cost of living overthe fixed-rate as has applied in the recent past, subjectto a limit of 95 per cent of the increase in the cost of living.4 9    If these assumptions are realised, then comparator schemes will continueto provide a significant degree of protection against increases in the costof living.    With price increases of 7 per cent a year, as have been assumed,protection against 52 per cent of price increases would be given on pensionsin excess of the GMP for the officers&apos;  comparators;    and against 67 per centof price increases for the other ranks&apos; comparators.4.10 For members of the armed forces it has been assumed that full protectionagainst price increases on the pension in excess of the GMP will continue tobe provided, and that increases on the GMP will be provided by the Statescheme and not by the Armed Forces Pension Scheme.4.11 I consider the above assumptions, taken together, to be appropriate forthe assessment of benefits currently accruing to scheme members*8.
5. RESULTS5.1   The benefits payable under the. Armed Forces Pension Scheme are summarisedin Annex 1.    On the basis used, the value of these benefits to an officer is3^.1 per cent of salary;    and to a serviceman, 19-8 per cent of salary.The large difference between these two figures is largely accounted for bythe much higher level of withdrawals (including withdrawals with rights todeferred pensions) assumed for servicemen, as is shown in Annex 3; forservicemen, 87 per cent of new entrants (at the average entry age of 19) areassumed to withdraw from service (with or without rights to a deferred pension)before being entitled to an immediate pension whereas for officers the corres-ponding figure is kz per cent.   Following on from this, 50 per cent of officernew entrants are assumed to remain in service until they are eligible for animmediate pension (not including pensions payable on invaliding grounds)whereas only 8 per cent of servicemen are assumed to do so.5-2   The value of the benefits of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme is notice-ably higher than that of most other public service pension schemes.   This isfor two main reasons.    First, the amount of pension earned for each year ofreckonable service - the accrual rate -&apos;tends to be higher than for most otherpublic service pension schemes;    for example, an officer might be entitled toan immediate pension of roughly one-third of final pay after about 20 years&apos;reckonable service whereas in most other public service pension schemesreckonable service of about 27 years would be needed before being entitled toa one-third pension.    But secondly, and much more importantly, immediatepensions (not counting those payable on invaliding grounds) can be payablefrom relatively young ages - as young as 37 in the case of officers - whichis much younger than for most pension schemes.5.3   It might be argued that, even though the Armed Forces Pension Schemeallows for pensions to be paid from younger ages than most other pensionschemes, it would be wrong to consider all these pensions as superannuationbenefits in the normally accepted sense;    and that instead they should beconsidered, in part, as compensation for early termination of career andfor any liability to recall at times of national emergency.   If allowanceis made in the calculations only for that part of (non-invaliding) pensionspayable after age 60 (60 being the age at which deferred pensions first comeinto payment under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme), then the value of thebenefits is reduced from 3^.1 per cent of salary to 23-8 per cent (forofficers);    and from 19-8 per cent of salary to 15*3 P *&quot; cent (for other ranks).9.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL &quot;Alternatively, if allowance is made in the calculations only for that partof (non-invaliding) pensions payable after age 55 (55 being the age atwhich pensions increases are actually put into payment and the age by whicha maximum pension can be earned under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme),then the value of the benefits is 28.7 per cent of salary (for officers)and 16.8 per cent of salary (for other ranks)..   The figures   shown in thetables below are on the two extreme approaches of (i) allowing fully for allbenefits payable from the Armed Forces Pension Scheme and (ii) excludingpension (other than invaliding pension) payable before age 60.   The ReviewBody may well decide that one or other of these approaches is the correctone, but if it decides that the right approach is somewhere between thesetwo extreme approaches - for example it might decide to exclude pension(other than invaliding pension) payable before age 55 - then the appropriatefigure will be between the extreme figures shown in the tables in laterparagraphs.5.4   As is explained in Annex 1 the resettlement grant, payable to those whohave served for a stated minimum period in the armed forces and who withdrawwithout an immediate pension, is outside the scope of the Armed Forces PensionScheme.    For this reason, none of the figures quoted in this report (exceptthose quoted in this paragraph) allows for the resettlement grant. Neverthe-less, it is a benefit which can be valued in the same way as pension benefitsand it is estimated that its value is about 0.2 per cent of salary for officersand about 0.5 per cent of salary for other ranks.5 5   The value of the benefit&apos;s of each comparator scheme was calculated.The method used wa.s the same as that adopted in connection with the adjustmentfor differences in superannuation benefits for Civil Service pay research in1979^ and 1980(&apos;2&apos;&gt;.    This method was explained in Appendix 8 to my 1979 report(on Civil Service pay research) and entails carrying out full calculations fora limited set of model schemes and then interpolating between those results toallow for the particular benefits available under each comparator scheme. Theresults were then averaged allowing for the appropriate weighting factor foreach comparator scheme (as mentioned in paragraph 2.3).    In the case of otherranks there were separate comparators for senior NCOs and for the lower ranks(as mentioned in paragraph 2.3 and discussed further in paragraphs ^.18 and 5.19).(1) The 1979 Review of the Adjustment for Differences in SuperannuationBenefits, Report by the Government Actuary.(2) The I98O Review of the Adjustment for Differences in SuperannuationBenefits, Report by the Government Actuary.10
In deriving an overall figure for other ranks, the relative weights assignedto the senior NCO comparators and to the lower rank comparators were basedon the total salaries of the members of the forces of the corresponding rank.5.6   An adjustment needs to be made for those comparator employments whichare not contracted out of the upper tier of the State pension scheme.Employees of such comparator employments effectively pay higher NationalInsurance contributions in return for higher benefits from the State pensionscheme.    Although this falls &apos;outside the compara.tor pension scheme, it isright to consider the extra State pension contributions and benefits of suchcomparators compared with members of the armed forces and other comparatorsthat are contracted-out.    For those comparator schemes that are not contracted-out ,. the -value of the extra State pension contributions that the employeeeffectively pays (i.e. the employee share of the contracting-out rebate,currently 2-g- per cent of earnings between the lower and upper earnings &apos;limitsfor National Insurance contribution liability) is deducted from the value ofthe extra State pension to which he will become entitled (i.e. approximatelythe value of the GMP payable from a contracted-out scheme).   An adjustmentis made to allow for the fact that National Insurance contributions areeffectively paid out of income net of tax.5.7   As explained in paragraphs 3-4 and 3-5, it is necessary to consider thesuperannuation benefits that would accrue (a) to retired members of the armedforces during any subsequent civilian employment subject to comparator schemebenefits and (b) during a whole career subject to comparator scheme superan-nuation benefits (inhere the career, as regards salary and mortality rates etc.is the same as for a member of the armed forces except that the age of retire-ment is based on the practice of the comparator schemes).    If we considerofficers and their comparators, the comparison being made is between:(i)    the value of the benefits of the.Armed Forces Pension Scheme(which, from paragraphs 5.1 and 5-3, is 34.1 per cent of theirforces salary if all benefits are fully taken into account or23.8 per cent if that part of the pension payable over theperiod to age 60 is left out of account)  lus the value ofsuperannuation benefits accruing during any subsequent civilianemployment (which, on the basis used, is 13.4 per cent of suchcivilian salary); and(ii)    the value of the benefits accruing during a whole career subjectto comparator scheme superannuation benefits (which, on thebasis used, is 13.2 per cent of salary).11.CONFIDENTIAL -
CONFIDENTIALIn making the comparison allowance must also be made-for the average levelof employee contribution.    For officer comparators the level of employeecontribution, averaged over a whole career,    is   3-4 per cent of salary.5.3   For other ranks and their comparators exactly the same kind of compari-son is. made as for officers and their comparators but the figures aresignificantly different.    From paragraphs 5.1 and 5.3, the value of thebenefits of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme is 19.8 per cent of their forcessalary if all benefits are fully taken into account or 15-3 per cent if thatpart of the pension payable over the period to age 60 is left out of account.The value of superannuation benefits accruing during any subsequent civilianemployment for retired members of the forces is, on the basis used, 10.8 percent of such civilian salary;   -while the value of benefits accruing during awhole career subject to comparator scheme superannuation benefits is, on thebasis used, 7.1 per   cent of salary.   As with officers, allowance must bemade in the comparison for the average level of employee contribution;for other ranks&apos;  comparators this, when averaged over a whole career, is3.6 per cent of salary.5.9   As mentioned in paragraph 3-5, not all retired members of the forces whoare drawing a pension will take up civilian employment and those who do mightearn less, or in some cases more, than they were earning when they retiredfrom the forces.    The allowance to be made for these two factors is not anactuarial matter but one for the Review Body to decide.    I have carried outcalculations on two extreme assumptions in this regard:    first that everyretired member of the forces (except those retired on invaliding grounds)will take up civilian employment at the same salary he was receiving when heretired from the forces;    and secondly that no retired member of the forcesenters civilian employment.    It will be seen in the tables below that thefigures are lower in row (b) (which assumes that no retired member of theforces enters civilian employment) than in row (a) (which assumes that allretired members of the forces enter civilian employment).   This could besaid to reflect any pension disadvantage that those leaving the forces mighthave.    If upon leaving the forces they cannot, or do not, find pensionablecivilian employment, they are losing the opportunity to acquire further pensionrights and this pension disadvantage is therefore reflected in the lowerfigures.    The question of interpolating between the two extreme sets of calcula-tions to allow for the proportions considered by &apos;the Review Body to be appro-priate may be left until after the further process described in paragraphs 5.12to 5.14.12.
CONFIDENTIAL5.10   As explained in paragraph 3,6, the difference between the value of thesuperannuation benefits accruing over the two life-time careers (as set outin (i) and (ii) of paragraph 3 4 or 5*7) is expressed as a level percentageof pay during the career in the armed forces.    These differences, whichallow for the level of employee contributions, are summarised in. the followingtable,Table 1:     Excess of the value of the superannuation benefits to membersof the armed forces over those of the comparator schemes(averaged over all schemes).

(See paragraph 5-9)-5.11   It will not be immediately clear how the figures quoted in earlierparagraphs lead to the figures shown in Table .1.

The comparison being made hasbeen described in paragraph 5-.7-    The first step is to express the value ofall items (superannuation benefits and employee contributions) in lump sum,or discounted value, form and for this the following factors which converta contribution of 1 per cent of salary over the period shown into itsdiscounted value as at age 22 (the average entry age of officers to thearmed forces) are needed:CONFIDENTIAL
Age rangeDiscounted value of 1 per centof salary over the period22 to 46-g- (on average) i.e. periodof service in the armed forces1,31046-J to 65 (on average) i.e. periodof subsequent civilian employment71022 to 63 (on average) i.e.wholecareer in comparator employment2,020The value of all the benefits of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme is (fromparagraphs 5-1, 5.3 or 5 7) 34.1 per cent of forces salary.   Thus thediscounted (or lump sum) value of these benefits is 34.1 x  1,310, or  44,671.The value of superannuation benefits accruing during any subsequentcivilian employment is (from paragraph 5*7)   13.4 per cent of such civiliansalary.   However allowance must also be made for the average level ofemployee contribution during this period which is 3-5 per cent of salaryso that the net value of superannuation benefits is 13.4 - 3 5, or 9 9 per cent,of civilian salary.    Its discounted value is therefore 9-9 x  710, or  7,029-The value of superannuation benefits accruing during a whole career subjectto comparator scheme superannuation benefits is (from paragraph 5-7) 13-2 percent of salary from which must be deducted the average level of employeecontribution of 3.4 per cent of salary giving a net value of superannuationbenefits of 9-8 per cent of salary.    Its discounted value is therefore 9-8 x  020, or  19,796.The excess of the value of the benefits of the Armed Forces PensionScheme over those of the comparator schemes is therefore  44,671 +  7,029 - 19,796, or  31,904 in discounted value   form.    Expressed as a percentage ofarmed forces salary this is  31,904 +  1,310, or 24.4 per cent ; roundings inthe calculations account for the difference from the figure of 24.5 per centshown in Table 1.5-12 The differences brought out in Table 1 do not, however, give the appropriatededuction to be made from the comparator scheme pay since the benefits to amember of the armed forces will be calculated on a lower salary than the comparatorsalary on account of the deduction itself.    The process of converting the benefitdifference to a deduction from pay is set out in Table 2.14.

5.13   It should be noted that the figures shown in the first three rows ofTable 2 do not, in general, represent the appropriate percentage contributionrate for the benefits described.   As explained- in paragraphs 3.6 and 5-10, thevalue of the superannuation benefits is expressed as a level percentage ofpay during the career in the armed forces.    Considering the figure of 15-0per cent in row (i) for the net value of superannuation benefits from a wholecareer subject to comparator scheme benefits (for officers), this figure hasbeen derived as follows.From paragraph 5 11t the net value (i.e.after deducting the averagelevel of. employee contribution) of superannuation benefits accruing duringa whole career subject to comparator scheme benefits is 9 8 per cent of salary.Its discounted value is therefore 9.8 x  2,020, or  19,796, which when expressedas a percentage of armed forces salary is  19i796 *    1,310, or 15.1 per cent.The difference from the figure of 13.0 per cent in Table 2 is accounted for byroundings in the figures.The figures in row (iii) of Table 2 allow for the superannuation benefitsaccruing during any subsequent civilian employment for retired members of theforces.   Where there is assumed to be no subsequent civilian employment (asin all the (b) columns), the figures represent the value of the Armed ForcesPension Scheme benefits as given in paragraphs 5 1 and 5 3.   Where retiredmembers of the forces are assumed to enter civilian employment (as in all the(a) columns), the difference between the figure in the (a) column and the figure inthe (b) column represents the value of the superannuation benefits accruing duringthat civilian employment expressed as a percentage of armed forces pay i.e.pOper cent for officers (which may be shown as 5.4 per cent due to roundings) and1.4 per cent for other ranks.5.14   The results derived in Table 2 above are summarised in Table 3 belowwhich shows the necessary deduction from comparator pay, on the samealternative assumptions, to allow for the differences between the armed forcesand comparator superannuation arrangements.16.CONFIDENTIAL

5-16   A simple numerical example (based on purely illustrative assumptions) mayclarify the comments in the previous paragraph:ExampleIf the Review Body decides:(i)   to allow for all the benefits payable from the Armed ForcesPension Scheme;(ii)    to assume that 50 per cent of retired officers will enter civilianemployment; and(iii)   to assume that the average salary in the new employment will be75 per cent of that received at the time of retirement from the forces;then   an interpolation must be made between the figures shown in column (1)of Table 5 giving an answer of:14.3 + (17-6 - 14.3) x 0.50 x 0.75=   15.5 per cent deduction from (officer) comparator pay.Note:    For technical reasons it is not quite correct to interpolate linearlyin the way indicated in the above example but any resulting errorshould not be great.5-17   If the Review Body decides to leave out of account that part of thepension (other than invaliding pension) payable from the Armed Forces PensionScheme over the period before age 551 then the figures in columns (2) and (4)of Table 1 (which exclude pension payable over the period before age 60) wouldbe increased (from paragraph 5&gt;3) by 4.9 percentage points and by 1.5 percentagepoints respectively.    The figures shown in rows (ii) and (iii) of columns (2) and(4) of Table 2 would be increased by the same amounts.   The resulting changes tothe other rows in Table 2 would increase the figures in columns (2) and (4)of Table 3 to the following figures:Column/row        Previous figure        New figure(2)(a) 11.0 14.2(2)(b) 7.1 10.7(4)(a) 10.7 11.9(4)(b) 9-6 10.8Note:     Roundings account for the above figures not reconciling exactly withpreviously quoted figures.18.CONFIDENTIAL
COMFS5.18   Tables 1 to 3 show officers and servicemen separately because thecomparators for these two groups are of differing value and because theircareers are different.    It is possible to construct separate typical careersfor officers and servicemen as few officers are promoted from the ranks.5 19   The evaluation of the superannuation benefits of comparator/ schemes forsenior NCOs shows that they are somewhat more valuables than those for lowerranks (see Annex 2 for an analysis of the schemes), but a separate career cannotbe constructed for each of these two groups because all senior NCOs must normallyhave passed through the lower ranks and a significant proportion of those oflower rank will be promoted to senior rank.    On the basis of a typical careercovering all servicemen, the percentage deductions from comparator pay givenin columns (3) and (4) of Table 3 would be reduced by about three-quarters ofone percentage point if the comparator schemes for-senior NCOs alone were usedinstead of all the other ranks&apos; comparators;    and they would be increased byabout one-half of one percentage point if the comparator schemes for lower ranksalone were used.6.       VARIATIONS IN ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS      &apos; .6.1 The economic assumptions underlying the results summarised in Section 5are described in paragraph 4.2 and the assumptions about pensions increasesdescribed&apos; in paragraphs 4.6 to 4.10.    As mentioned in paragraph 4.3? the ScottReport suggested upper and lower limits to a range of &quot;reasonable&quot; assumptions.This Section considers how the results summarised in Section 5 would be affectedif these upper and lower limits of &quot;reasonable&quot; assumptions were to be adopted.6.2 Paragraph   128 of the Scott Report says:&quot;At the more optimistic end of the range, we have assumed a real rateof return of 3 per cent per annum coupled with an average rate ofinflation rather lower than 7 per cent and with a degree of protectionagainst inflation for the analogue schemes somewhat higher than thatassumed by the Government Actuary in 1980.   At the other end of therange, we have assumed a real rate of return of zero accompanied by adegree of inflation protection for the analogues somewhat lower than theGovernment Actuary assumed.&quot;19.CONFIDENTIAL

O O ns t&quot; i L&gt; i6.3 It is for the Review Body to decide what allowance to make for superan-nuation benefits in the assessment of armed forces pay.   The basis used inthis report, leading to the results in Table 3, relates to a point inter-mediate between the &quot;optimistic&quot; and &quot;pessimistic&quot; ends of the rangesuggested in the Scott Report.    For other points further calculations could,if necessary, be done;    it should be noted though that linear interpolationof the figures shown in Table &apos;4. to allow for alternative economic assumptionscould possibly give misleading results.6.4 The Scott Report also refers to the problems of valuing pensions whichare guaranteed to increase fully in line with the cost of living and discussesan approach that has been developed to allow for this.    The method entailsdiscounting at a lower rate of interest any benefits carrying this kind ofguarantee;    in this case some of the benefits of the Armed Forces PensionScheme (and of those comparator schemes whose benefits are covered by thePensions (Increase) Acts) would need to be valued at a lower rate of interest,than that assumed.   The Scott Report points out though that the method &quot;isstill subject to controversy&quot;.    In view of this and the difficulties of decid-ing on an appropriate reduction in the discounting rate of interest to be used,no attempt has been made to quantify this feature in this way or to produceanother set of alternative figures in this report.-  On the other hand someimplicit allowance has been- made by assuming future rates of pension increasefor comparator schemes (where pensions are not guaranteed to increase fullyin line with the cost of living) which are considered to be on the cautiousside.   These assumptions have been described in paragraph 4.8 and it can boargued that with assumed rates of inflation lower in the long-term futurethan over the past five years or so, comparator schemes might be expectedto grant increases in pensions that represent a higher proportion of theincrease in the cost of living than in the recent past.Government Actuary&apos;s DepartmentLondon9 April 1981CONFIDENTIAL
ANNEX 1The Armed Forces Pension Scheme1. The Scheme is operated by means of Prerogative Instruments which setout the rates of benefit payable and the conditions of award.   The Schemeis non-contributory and members of the scheme are contracted out of theupper tier of the State pension scheme.   The Scheme&apos; is very complicatedbut the main provisions as they affect benefits accruing for current serviceas a member of the armed forces, are set out below.2. Membership and Service.    All members of the regular forces, both male/and female, are members of the Scheme except for officers on short-servicegratuity-earning commissions and a very small number of servicemen servingon special types of engagement.    All service from age 21 (officers) orage 18 (other ranks) reckons for benefit subject normally to a limit of34 years&apos; reckonable service (officers) or 37 years (other ranks).3. Pensionable pay.    Pensionable pay is based on the length of service andthe rank attained rather than on the actual pay received by the individual.Representative pay rates (based on the current appropriate combatant ratefor the rank in the case of officers and of an approximately median currentrate in the case of other ranks) therefore form the basis for calculatingpension entitlement.4. Benefits on retirement other than on grounds of invaliding. Officerswith at least 16 years&apos; reckonable&apos; service and servicemen with at least22 years&apos; reckonable service are entitled to retire with an immediate pension.For officers the pension is 28.5 per cent of representative pay after16 years&apos; reckonable service increasing uniformly until it is 48.5 per centof representative pay after       years&apos; reckonable service.    For servicementhe pension is 31.833 per cent of representative pay after 22 years&apos; reckon-able service increasing uniformly until it is 48.5 Ver cent of representativepay after 37 years&apos; reckonable service.    In the case of officers the level ofpension may be reduced by up to 10 per cent in cases of voluntary retirement.In all cases a lump sum of three times the pension is payable.5. Benefits on retirement on grounds of invaliding.    If reckonable serviceis less than 5 years, the member may be awarded a gratuity and will be boughtback into the State scheme unless a transfer value is paid.    If reckonableservice exceeds 5 years there is an immediate pension plus a lump sum of threeP! Ui. IM f lAL
CONFIDENTIALtimes the pension.   -The level of pension is based on the full career pensionfor that rank i.e. that awarded after &apos;fA years&apos; reckonable. service (officers)or after 37 years (servicemen).   For officers the invaliding pension is30 per cent of the full career pension after 3 years&apos; rockonable serviceincreasing uniformly to 100 per cent after 31 years;    for servicemen theinvaliding pension is 27.5 per cent of the full career pension after 5 years&apos;reckonable service/increasing uniformly to 100 per cent after years.6. Benefits on withdrawal.  If reckonable service is less than 5 years, themember will be bought back into the State scheme unless a transfer value ispaid.    If service exceeds 5 years but the member is ineligible for an immediatepension, a preserved pension is payable from age 60 together with a lump sumof three&apos; times the pension, also payable at age 60.    For officers the preserverpension is 3 per cent of full career pension for each year of reckonableservice;    and for servicemen it is z\ per cent of full career pension .for eachyear of reckonable service.    Alternatively a transfer value may be paid underthe public sector transfer arrangements to the new employer&apos;s pension scheme.7. Benefits on death in service.    A lump sum is payable equal to the greaterof one year&apos;s salary at the representative pay rate (approximately) or thelump sum that would have been payable on retirement on invaliding grounds.8. Family benefits.    A widow&apos;s pension is payable at the rate of one-halfof the husband&apos;s pension, if he dies after retirement, or one-half of thepension he would have received on retirement on invaliding grounds if hedies in service.    A higher rate of pension based on the husband&apos;s pensionor the husband&apos;s pay at the date of his death is payable for the first threemonths of widowhood.    There are additions of one-half of the widow&apos;s pensionin respect of each dependent child (for up to two children).    Widows&apos; pensionscease on remarriage.9. Resettlement Grants. A lump sum grant may be payable to members leavingthe Scheme with a preserved pension provided they have completed at least9 years&apos; reckonable service &quot;(officers) or at least 12 years&apos; reckonableservice (other ranks).    The grant is currently around  3*000 (officers) andaround  2,000 (other ranks).   This grant is outside the scope &apos;of the ArmedForces Pension Scheme although it is covered by the same Prerogative VInstruments.2.CONFIDENTIAL
10. Other provisions of the Scheme permit a higher level of invalidingpension or widow&apos;s pension where the invaliding or death is attributableto service in the forces.    Also available to the member, at no cost tothe Scheme,&apos; is an option to commute part of his pension for a lump sum;a facility to purchase added years of service, at full.cost, will beintroduced shortly.11. Although the Pensions (Increase) Acts do not apply to the ArmedForces Pension Scheme,&apos; pensions increases on similar lines are providedfor by means of the Prerogative Instruments.   Thus pensions under the.Scheme are protected against price* inflation after retirement except thatno increases arc actually put into payment until age 55 (except where it isan invaliding or widow&apos;s pension).3.CONFIDENTIAL

CHAPTER 1.CONFIDENTIALINTRODUCTION AND GENERAL CONSIDERATIONSThe background1. We begin as usual   with a brief review of major developments since our1last report.   Our 1980 recommendations   were designed to bring the pay ofdoctors and dentists in the NHS fully up to date for the first time in fiveyears.   They subsumed the rates set out in our Ninth Report as being fullyup to date at April 1979 (but not implemented then) which the Government wasalready committed to put into effect from April 1980.   Those rates were onaverage 10.7 per cent higher than the levels actually paid from April 1979 We recommended a further average increase of 18.7 per cent to achieve the rateswe judged appropriate at 1 April 1980.   We were pleased that the Governmentdecided to implement our recommendations in full, and appreciate the problemsthey faced in deciding to do so.2. This year&apos;s review differs in an important respect from last year&apos;s, whichmarked the completion of an up-dating exercise begun in 1978.   At the beginning2of that exercise, our Eighth Report   set out the general framework which wouldgovern the achievement of fully up to date rates by April 1980.   As a result,particular regard was paid in the next two reports to the level of doctors&apos;and dentists&apos; earnings relative to those of other people.   This year,we have taken broad account of external remuneration comparisons as one of therange of relevant factors, but we have not given them the degree of emphasisthat we judged to be necessary during the updating process.    It is in the lightof the whole range of relevant factors, including national economic considerations,that we have exercised our judgment.   We return to this and related points inChapter 3.Hospital training grades3-     At their request, we met representatives of the medical and dental professionson 7 October I98O to discuss a number of matters which are central to the Review Body-system.   The meeting included the recognised representation of the hospital trainingReview Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Tenth Report, I98O -Cmnd. 7903, May 1980.Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Eighth Report, 1978Cmnd. 7176, May 1978 (paragraphs 14-17).1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALgrades - who had &apos;withdrawn&apos; from the system during 1979 and 1980 - wereincluded in the discussion.   Elsewhere in this chapter we touch on the mainpoints to emerge, but we wish to record here our pleasure at the decision bythe Hospital Junior Staff Committee, shortly after the October meeting, tosubmit evidence for this year&apos;s review.NIIS restructuringk.     Under the planned restructuring of the NHS, there is to be an amalga-mation of the existing area and district levels of management in Englandinto district health authorities.   Officers are to be appointed fromsummer 198l onwards so that new authorities can come into operationon 1 April 1982.    The full changeover will take a further twelve months. Weunderstand it is likely that the present area health authorities will beretained in Wales, but no final decision has been taken.    In Scotland, it isintended to retain the area health boards and abolish (but not in all areas)the district level of management.5. The main intention is to devolve the functions of the area authoritiesto district level, but a number of matters remain to be resolved.   It is notyet clear, for example, whether responsibility for settling and controllingthe contracts of hospital doctors and dentists will fall at regional ordistrict level (at present, contracts for senior registrars and above arefor the most part dealt with at regional level and the remainder at arealevel).   We understand also that final decisions on the structure of communitdentistry are likely to be delayed beyond those for community medicine and tobe less uniform.   These changes and the associated uncertainties have inevit-ably affected our ability to reach long term conclusions in this Report onvarious aspects of the professions&apos; remuneration.The total remuneration package6. We have always taken the view that, insofar as &apos;outside&apos; comparisonsplay a part in our considerations, we must have regard to the total remuner-ation package.    This comprehends not only direct pay, but pensions and &apos;fringbenefits&apos;.     We have now undertaken an up to date comparison of total remuneration for doctors and dentists and for others at comparable levels elsewhere.Details are given in Chapter 3 and Appendix D.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. A related point arose at our meeting with the professions on 7 October1980.   We were asked whether our emphasis on the total package meant that wetook account of private practice undertaken by doctors and dentists in making ourrecommendations on their NHS remuneration.   We take this opportunity to recordthat we are not directly concerned with the level of private practice earnings.Our major concern is to take account of the level of commitment to the NHS joband to ensure that the workload involved is properly rewarded.General economic considerations8. At our 7 October 1980 meeting with the professions we discussed the extentto which national economic circumstances are relevant to our task.   We take theview that our terms of reference require us to put forward recommendations forremuneration which, in all the circumstances, we believe to be right at thetime.   We do take account of the economic circumstances affecting the nationgenerally, as one of the range of relevant factors we have to consider injudging the appropriate levels of remuneration for the medical and dentalprofessions.   We describe in paragraph J&gt;k the evidence submitted to us by theHealth Departments on the cash limit for the NHS and the element of 6 per centbuilt into it to accommodate pay increases in 1981-82.Agreements between the Health Departments and the professions9. A continuing source of difficulty is the overlap between our role as anindependent Review Body charged with making recommendations for the wholeremuneration structure, and the role of the professions&apos; representatives andthe Health Departments in negotiating changes in contractual terms and conditionsof service.   This separation of function is unusual in other walks of life, wherecommonly the same procedures govern the settlement of both pay and conditions ofservice (often within an overall &apos;package&apos; agreement).   We have drawn attentionto this point on previous occasions, most recently in our 1980 report , and itwas among issues discussed at our October 1980 meeting with the professions.We doubt whether it will ever prove possible to prevent problems entirely;but we are anxious that they should be kept to a minimum.   We therefore set outour views on how the present arrangements can give rise to difficulties and howthey might be improved.Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Tenth Report, 1980 -Cmnd. 7903, May 1980 (paragraphs 11-13).3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL10. In making our recommendations, it is essential that we have regard to thestructure of remuneration for the professions as a whole.   We remain guided inthis by the three principal aims laid down by the 1960 Pilkington Commission:to avoid recurrent disputes between the professions and the Departments; toensure fair levels of remuneration for the professions;   and to safeguard the1interests of the taxpayer .    In considering contractual changes agreed betweenthe Departments and the professions, we have therefore to formulate ourrecommendations with due regard to all the implications of the changes forremuneration.   These include the proper relationship between the reward forthe new or changed item of service and other elements of remuneration for thegroup in question;    the effect on the group&apos;s total remuneration and itsrelationship with the remuneration of other groups (both within and outsidethe medical and dental professions);   and whether the change should attract&apos;new money&apos;  (that is, financial provision additional to that which wouldotherwise have been necessary to meet the paybill costs of our recommendations)or whether its additional costs should be offset against the remuneration ofthe group or the profession as a whole.11. We recognise the right of the professions and the Health Departmentsto reach agreement on changes in terms and conditions, and we do not questionthese agreements lightly.   However, such changes may have significant implicationsfor remuneration.   This is particularly true of changes in basic contractualarrangements, but also applies to changes in the requirements or qualifyingconditions for certain types of payment and to improvements in non-financialconditions of service (such as leave entitlement).12. Cases arise where the professions and the Departments, although agreed onthe desirability of a change, do not agree on its likely cost, on whether thecost should be offset or &apos;new money&apos; provided, or on the way in which offsetting(if agreed) should be achieved,,   These cases tend to present difficulties, andwe are often asked in effect to resolve the disagrements between the parties.In other parts of this report we deal with several examples that have arisen thisyear.Report on the Royal Commission on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration 1957-60,Cmnd. 939, February I96O (paragraphs 402-405).4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL13. The present arrangements can lead to exaggerated expectations on the partof the professions or the Departments.   At the same time, they expose us toaccusations of frustrating the time and effort devoted to negotiation.   For ourpart, we endeavour to treat each case on its merits.   A major factor in decidingwhether or not new money should be made available is whether the proposedchange would give rise to new or additional work or responsibilities for theindividuals concerned.   As we explained in our Tenth Report , obviously minormatters need not concern us.   By minor matters we mean primarily those agreementswhich affect a very small number of people and whose impact on the remunerationstructure or costs is minimal.   As to other matters, we would welcome earlywarning arrangements to ensure that we are advised at an early stage of boththe likely coverage and content of a prospective agreement, and of the parties&apos;views on the matters which we need to take into account, not least on the questionof offsetting.   We should usually be able to consider proposals and toexpress preliminary views as part of the normal review process.    In caseswhich are of both major importance and urgency, we would be prepared to receiveevidence and to give our views outside a normal review.14. We do not contemplate that we should become involved in the negotiations.Rather, the object of an early warning system would be to help reduce thedifficulties that can arise from differences in viewpoint and approach if notexamined early enough.   We understand that the professions and the HealthDepartments also see merit in attempting to devise such an arrangement, andwe have asked the Office of Manpower Economics to discuss with them what mightbe done.Status of agreements reported to us15. Our recommendations, subject to acceptance by the Government, are intendedto be implemented in full from the beginning of the review year (1 April) unlesswe state otherwise.   In their evidence this year, however, the Health Departmentsstated that a situation might arise, especially in the present financial climate,in which they would defer implementation of particular agreements reached previouslywith the professions unless we recommended that any additional costs shouldbe offset.   They referred to the possibility of their making agreements inprinciple with the professions but deferring agreement on the timing of theirimplementation until we had-recommended on treatment of the costs.   This seems tous most unsatisfactory.

Inthis respect, too, we hope that an early approach to us - along the linesdescribed in the preceding paragraphs - would be helpful.6CONFIDENTIAL
CHAPTER 2CONFIDENTIALTHE EVIDENCE16.     We have again considered written and oral evidence from the HealthDepartments on behalf of the Government and from the Review Body EvidenceCommittee of the British Medical Association (the Joint Evidence Committee)and the British Dental Association on behalf of the medical and dental profes-sions .    We have also take note of submissions from the Hospital Consultants&apos;and Specialists&apos; Association, the Hospital Doctors&apos; Association, the GeneralDental Practitioners&apos; Association, the Medical Directors&apos; Association, theFederation of Women Doctors and from individual doctors and dentists.Evidence from the Joint Evidence Committee17-     The Committee (JEC) reported an improvement in morale within theprofessions as a result of our Tenth Report recommendations.    They emphasisedthe importance of keeping remuneratien up to date and asked us to make clear theextent to which our 1981 recommendations took account of national economicconsiderations.    The Committee referred to the Inquiry chaired bySir Bernard Scott into public sector pensions   and argued (as did the BDA)that there should be a compensating increase in remuneration if, as a result ofGovernment action in the light of the Scott report, doctors&apos; and dentists&apos;pension provisions were changed to the detriment of the professions.    The JECalso argued that, overall, the fringe benefits available to the professionswere negligible.    We were invited to agree that time taken should be the predom-inant criterion for fees for clinical members of District Management Teams.The Review Body Evidence Committee of the British Medical Association representsthe Central Committee for Hospital Medical Services, the Hospital Junior StaffCommittee,  the General Medical Services Committee and the Central Committee forCommunity Medicine.    Representation on these committees is open to all doctorsregardless of whether they are members of the BMA.    By agreement with theBritish Dental Association, the Joint Evidence Committee also represents dentistsin the hospital service.    The BDA presents evidence on behalf of general dentalpractitioners and community dentists.&gt;Inquiry into the Value of Pensions. Cmnd. 81V7, February 1981.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlQm     Hospital career grades     Concern was expressed over the level of consul-tants&apos; remuneration relative to that of other groups in the NHS.    The Committeeclaimed that health authorities had been too stringent in granting temporary addit-ional sessions and that they were also cutting back on services for which consultantscould claim fees, such as domiciliary visits and family planning services.It was again suggested that the value of the A+ distinction and meritoriousservice award should equal the maximum of the consultant scale, with a corres-ponding adjustment to the value of other awards.    We were also asked to maintainthe number of awards in its current relationship to total consultant numbers.19. It was put to us that the flat rate salary for senior hospital medicaland dental officers should be equated with a point above the consultant scale minimum.The profession expressed concern at the erosion of pay differentials betweenthe associate specialist and other hospital grades and also questioned the viewexpressed in our Sixth Report that hospital practitioners undertook more respon-sible work than associate specialists.    They suggested that we should restorethe relative value of the extra duty allowance for associate specialists to its levelprior to the Tenth-Report; and should consider the introduction of salaryincrements for part-time medical officers.20. Hospital training grades The JEC submitted evidence to us this year on behalfof the hospital training grades (they did not do so in 1979 or 1980).   They toldus that a decision on whether to do so next year would be taken in the lightof our Eleventh Report.    The training grades asked that their basic salary shouldbe adjusted to bring it to the relative level they considered it would now havereached if we had related salary in 1975  (rather than in 1978) to the first hohours of duty Per week.   They also proposed that weekly hours between ho and 80should be remunerated at 130 per cent of basic pay and hours over 80 at- 200 percent, largely to act as penal rates to deter employing authorities from relyingon excessive hours of duty by the training grades.   We were told that stagingof these changes would be acceptable.   The professions argued that the increasedexpenditure involved in extending the miscellaneous expenses grant (coveringremoval expenses) to hospital doctors and dentists should not be offset againstour recommendations; nor should the increased leave entitlement of 6 weeksthey sought for all junior hospital doctors and dentists.   They urged the&apos;-introduction of special payments to attract doctors to shortage specialties.We heard arguments that the relative job security of junior doctors is decliningand that there are now longer periods of unemployment between appointments.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL21. General medical practitioners     It was suggested that GMPs are experiencingan increase in both stress and workload, and that additional work taken on toimprove general practice or to reduce the burden on the hospital service shouldbe recognised outside the normal pattern of remuneration.   The profession againasked for a relative re-distribution of income towards out of hours remunerationand expressed the view that deputising services constitute a valuable adjunct tothe work of GMPs.   The profession questioned the view that out of hours payments onaverage meet the cost of deputising services.   We were told of discussions withthe Health Departments on a possible extension to the qualifying period for nightvisit fees, and of various changes in the circumstances that attract payment of thesefees.   The JEC asked us to keep fees for contraceptive services outside our recommend-ation   of intended average net remuneration; and to &apos;price&apos; the system of paedi-atric surveillance examinations recommended by the Royal College of General Prac-titioners.   The profession expressed disappointment that in our Tenth Report wehad not recommended a relative increase in GMP trainees&apos; salaries to reflect theirout of hours responsibilities.22. Ophthalmic medical practitioners     The JEC suggested that recruitment ofOMPs is declining and argued that pay relativities with other groups shouldbe improved to provide what the Committee saw as adequate reflection of the quali-fications, skills and experience necessary to practise as an OMP.   They againexpressed disagreement with the number of sight tests we assume as the notionalannual output of a full-time OMP.   The profession confirmed that they would likeus to assume responsibility for setting the whole sight testing fee once a firmbasis for estimating expenses has been established.   In the light of the HealthDepartments&apos; abandonment of a scheme of domiciliary visits because of constraintson public expenditure, we were asked to make clear our support for such a schemeand to recommend a pilot scheme fee appropriate to April 1981.   The professionargued that the cost of a full scheme should not be offset against other remuneration.23. Community medicine     The JEC expressed the view that community physiciansand hospital consultants should receive broadly equivalent total earnings toreflect their equal status.   Recruitment to community medicine was said to bein decline with shortages unlikely to improve as the planned NHS reorganisationtakes place.   We were asked to approve the agreement with the Health Departmentsthat the new District Medical Officers (in England) should be paid the samesalary as the present Area Medical Officers (including the responsibility-relatedcash leads).   We were invited to express the cash leads paid to both Area andRegional Medical Officers   (AMOs and RMOs) as flat rate supplements to the communityPhysician scale; and to restore their relative value to the initial 1973 level9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe profession reported an agreement with the Health Departments that the numberof duties attracting specific payments in connection with communicable diseasecontrol and port health rotas for community health doctors should be extendedfrom Zh to 72 duties per half year, with a scale of payment by bands of 6 duties;we were urged not to accept the Health Departments&apos; view that the scale should betapered for the higher numbers of duties.   The representatives of the communityphysicians sought an end to the arrangement whereby the responsibility-relatedcash leads for AMOs and RMOs are offset against the value of any distinction awardreceived; however, the representatives of the hospital career grades argued thatthe arrangement should end only for RMOs.   The present pay arrangements were saidto impose serious financial penalties on those entering the community medicinespecialty; we were pressed to improve the remuneration of community trainees,and to provide a flat rate supplement to their basic salary for out of hours dutiesin place of the present payments related to particular nights or weekends on duty.A salary scale was proposed for community trainees which would restore the relativereduction we made in 1978 to the relevant hospital juniors&apos; scales, plus an amountbroadly equivalent to that which might be received in analogous circumstances bya hospital junior working in a 1 in 3 rota.   In addition to these improvements,the profession sought an inducement allowance to attract people to the specialty.We were asked to endorse the agreed salary level for the new grade of seniorhouse officer in community medicine and to consider further scale shorteningfor clinical medical officers and senior clinical medical officers.Evidence from the British Dental Association2h.   The BDA said that morale among dentists had improved as a result of ourTenth Report recommendations.   The Association proposed increases to reflectestimated earnings movements to April 1981 and argued (as did the JEC) thatstrict adherence to the provision for pay increases within Government cashlimits would both damage morale and be detrimental to patient care.25.   General dental practitioners     We were told that recruitment remains satis-factory, but that the experimental &apos;salary plus bonus&apos; schemes have had only limitedimpact and were not likely to solve problems in the regional distribution of dentists(which was nevertheless improving gradually).   The BDA favoured an experiment incapitation fees for treatment of children and reported that the   prior approvalrules   had been relaxed.   They acknowledged that in recent years the net incomeof general dental practitioners (GDPs) had substantially exceeded target averagenet income as recommended by us but, said that they would prefer us to take nospecific action in respect of the overpayments; improved forecasting techniqueson the part of the Dental Rates Study Group (DRSG) should ensure return to a10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsituation whereby, year on year, overpayments and under-paymentswould broadly cancel each other out.   However, the Association recognisedthat a correcting mechanism might also have to be considered.   It wasargued that, under such a mechanism, no attempt should be made to recover theoverpayments which occured before 198O-81, and that any corrections shouldbe made only in respect of expenses.    The BDA suggested that theextension of dental charges to 18-20 year olds which took effect from April I98Imight depress demand for dental treatment, at least in the short term.Evidence was produced to show that the recovery in the number of treatmentshas continued and it was stated that selective acceptance by dentists isdeclining.   The profession argued that the pattern of GDPs&apos; career earningsmeant that older dentists could suffer unduly if increases in target averagenet income were unduly depressed.   We were again asked to recommendincreases in the salaries of dental practitioners in health centres in linewith those we recommend for community dentists.26.       Community dentistry     The Association considered that, given theuncertainties surrounding NHS reorganisation, present relative pay levelsshould be maintained for the salary scales of community dentists. Theprofession, as previously,argued that administrative dental officers (ADOs)in Scotland and Wales should receive a supplement in recognition of the additi-onal responsibilities which we were told they undertake compared with ADOs inEngland.    Jointly with the Health Departments, the profession asked us to recommend anappropriate new level for the emergency services fee.Evidence from the Health Departments2 7.      The Health Departments presented evidence on NHS reorganisation and theprovisions of the Health Services Act I98O.    They drew our attention to featuresof the 1981-82 cash limits and argued that, in forming our recommendationsthis year, we should have regard to the relative job security enjoyed by NHSdoctors and dentists.    They accepted that we should not be presented withagreements which limited or pre-empted our role but contended that, in cases wherewe decide that the cost of a new agreement should not be offset againstincreases in overall remuneration, they would have to consider whether imple-mentation should be deferred.    We were told that Government views on thefindings of the Scott Inquiry into the value of public service pensions wouldnot be available for the current review.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALp8.       Hospital doctors and dentists     The Health Departments reported on theeffects of the 1 January 198O contractual changes for  hospital careergrades, and drew attention to various developments concerningthe associate specialist grade since our Tenth Report.    We heard that theyhad not entered into discussions with the profession about changes to theextra duty allowance system and that only limited progress had been madetowards an examination of the work and responsibilities of clinical membersof District Management Teams.    Following discussion with the professions onsuch matters as rota amalgamation, the Departments  concluded that it mightbe difficult to reduce the hours of duty of the hospital training gradeswithin the present career structure.   The Departments reported an agreementextending to hospital doctors and dentists a miscellaneous expenses grantin respect of home removal expenses and asked us to take the cost into accountin our recommendations.    We were also told of changes in terms and conditionsfor the hospital grades and were asked to re-examine the relative level of fees forfamily planning work.29. General medical practitioners     The Health Departments again asked us toinclude fees for contraceptive services within intended average net remuneration, andtold us that the experimental scheme for reimbursement of salaries of relatedancillary staff had been extended.   They provided evidence jointly with theprofession on commercial deputising services and, in supplementary evidenceof their own, suggested that the growth of the services might have implicationsfor our recommendations.   We also received joint evidence on new arrangementsfor the payment of night visit fees when a GMP examines more than one patientat a single location; when a specified treatment in a surgery forming partof the doctor&apos;s residence is provided; and when visits are made at night aspart of the provision of maternity services.30. Ophthalmic medical practitioners The Health Departments repeated their viewthat the remuneration of OMPs is generous in relation to the work done and tothe qualifications and skills required.    They doubted whether workload hadincreased in recent years, reported that a postal survey of practice expenseswas under way and, like the profession, indicated their intention to ask usto take over responsibility in due course for the whole sight-testing fee.They confirmed that the proposed pilot scheme for domiciliary visits by OMPshad been abandoned because Ministers had decided that the extra cost involvedln a permanent scheme could not be justified at present.12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL31. Community medicine   We were asked to continue to make recommendationsthis year for AMOs in England and Wales, and for Chief Administrative MedicalOfficers in Scotland.    In the Health Departments&apos; view, it would not be appropriate(particularly before NHS reorganisation wa8 complete) to revise the 1973 agree-ment whereby the supplements paid to AMOs and Regional Medical Officers (RMOs)are withheld if the individual receives a distinction and meritorious serviceaward of greater value than the supplement.   We were invited to indicateour views on including a flat rate element in recognition of out of hoursduties within the salary scale for community medicine trainees.   We werealso invited to take into account the fact that clinical medical officers andsenior clinical medical officers have a fixed commitment of 37 hours per weekand no regular commitment to give out-of-hours services or to provide continuedcare for patients.   The Departments reported that a training grade in thecommunity health services would be introduced shortly, at senior house officerlevel, and suggested that payment at hospital rates would be appropriate.They recorded the agreement with the profession to extend the number ofemergency rota duties which qualify for allowances from 2k to 72 per half year,but had told the profession that no &apos;new money&apos; could be provided at presentto meet any additional cost arising from this change.32. General dental practitioners and community dentistry     The HealthDepartments reported an increase in the number of GDPs and confirmed that thegeneral recovery in output was continuing, including higher value NHS work.They drew attention to the overpayment of GDPs in net income over recent yearsand suggested that some form of corrective mechanism should be introduced.   We weretold that the very limited number of experimental &apos;salary plus bonus&apos; schemeswould be reviewed in the coming year; and that a Dental Strategy Review Grouphad been established to review dental health policy (including various remuner-ation matters), in particular preventive work and the future of the communitydental service.   The Departments opposed the introduction of Bpecial supple-ments for ADOs in Scotland and Wales.13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 3our GENERAL CONCLUSIONS33.   In this Chapter we describe the general considerations we have taken intoaccount for this year&apos;s review; matters relating to individual branches of theprofessions are dealt with separately in the Chapters which follow.    Appendix Acontains our detailed recommendations on the pay rates we believe to be rightfor doctors and dentists in the NHS as from 1 April 1981.    Special considerationsapply this year in the case of general dental practitioners (Chapter 6).   For theother major groups within our remit, the recommended pay rates are in generalsome 9 per cent higher than the current rates and the increases in the main fallwithin a range of 8.1 to 9.k per cent.J&gt;k.   General economic and financial considerations.   In evidence this year, theHealth Departments emphasised the importance that the Government attaches tothe system of controlling public expenditure through cash limits.   We were toldthat the 1981-82 cash limit for the hospital and community medicine services asa whole contains provision for a 6 per cent increase in pay and an 11 per centincrease in prices; and that the Government expects similar financial disciplinesto be applied to expenditure on the family practitioner services which, as demandled services, are not subject to cash limits.    It was put to us that a relativelyhigh pay increase for doctors and dentists might stimulate similar demands fromthe representatives of other NHS groups.    If pay increases exceeded the amountsavailable within cash limits, resources might have to be switched from elsewherewithin the NHS budget, so jeopardising the present level of service to the publicas well as the planned growth in the volume of NHS resources.35.   For their part, the professions set out levels of increases which in theirview would result if we paid the same regard to external earnings movements as wedid during the 1978-80 updating exercise.    They repeated the view they had expressedat our meeting with them on 7 October 1980 (paragraph 3) that we should make clearin our Report the account which we have taken of general economic considerations.The professions considered that increases restricted to the provision for pay builtinto cash limits would not be regarded as satisfactory.   As we said at the October1980 meeting, we do not believe that the pay of the professions should be exemptedfrom restraint measures provided that those measures apply to the community as awhole and do no lasting damage to the remuneration of the professions.    We haveindicated in paragraph 8 that we have taken account, as we judge appropriate, ofeconomic conditions affecting the nation generally.IkCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL56.   Earnings comparisons     As in all our reviews, we have gathered informationon external earnings movements at levels judged to be comparable to those of NHSdoctors and dentists.    At Appendix B is our usual analysis of the New EarningsSurvey (NES) results, relating to April I98O.    Implementation of our Tenth Reportrecommendations added on average 31-4 per cent to the then current pay rates,but substantially less than that ( l8.7 per cent) to the April 1979 fullyup to date rates indicated in our Ninth Report.    The analysis of the latest NESdata now suggests that the Tenth Report increases over and above the April 1979fully up to date rates exhibited an average &apos;shortfall&apos; of rather less than 6 percent as compared with external earnings movements at comparable levels elsewhereover the year to April I98O.   However there are some qualifications which must beadded.37.   First, we made clear last year&quot;&apos;&quot; that our Tenth Report recommendationsrepresented the actual amounts we judged to be necessary to bring the pay of themedical and dental professions fully up to date at April 1980, and that detailedcomparisons with NES data would have a less direct role to play in our considerations2in the future .    The NES results for April I980 also show that over the period1975-80 as a whole (that is, starting with April 1975 when the pay of the professions,apart from distinction awards, had last been brought fully up to date) the shortfallcompared directly with external movements was rather less than 4 per cent (while ourApril 1975 recommendations left the professions with a gain of 2 per cent comparedwith their relative position at the previous &apos;base line&apos; of April 1972)  . Second,the net income of general dental practitioners   has on average exceeded our targetrecommended figure by some 8 per cent over the five years to April I98O (Chapter 6).The shortfalls for doctors as a whole are less than for the medical and dentalprofessions taken together.    The Health Departments also suggested to us thatan effect of increased unemployment may be to exaggerate the year on year earningsincreases shown by the NES: on the assumption that the impact of unemployment isReview Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Tenth Report, I98O -Cmnd. 7903, May I98O (paragraph 126).ibid (paragraph 39).Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Sixth Report, 1976 -Cmnd. 6473, May 1976 (Appendix A).15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALgreater at lower earnings levels, the effect on the distribution of the NES survey-population will be to increase the levels of earnings shown against the higherpercentile points (quite apart from the effect of normal pay increases).   We notethis hypothesis but at present reliable data are not available on recent changesin the relative incidence of unemployment at different income levels. Finally,we wish to point out that last year we made our recommendations in the knowledgethat the resulting average increase over the 1979 up to date rates was likely tobe a little below the average level of increase elsewhere over the year to April198O as suggested by the indicators and forecasts then available.38.   The comparisons based on NES data remain useful as a longer-term check on theeffect of our recommendations on the relative position of doctors and dentists inrelation to earnings movements at broadly comparable levels elsewhere.   By them-selves they are not conclusive but we have taken note of them in forming ourjudgments.39    In reaching our recommendations we have   also had regard to a numberof indicators and forecasts of earnings movements over the year to April 198l.Again, these form a part - but only a part - of the considerations we take intoaccount.   We have also taken note of falling trends over the last twelve monthsin the level of the retail prices index and (although with some variation) of paysettlements.ho.   Other fact ors.   We have taken into account such information as is availableto us on recruitment, retention and workload in the medical and dental professions.We comment in detail on this information as appropriate in the following chapters.In general, our view is that recruitment to the medical and dental professionsremains healthy in terms of both numbers of applicants and their quality, althoughwe shall look carefully in future reviews at any effects of financial restraintson the intake of students to universities and of reorganisation of medical schools.Over the last few years, the evidence suggests that the problem of emigration byBritish-born doctors and dentists has diminished.   The representatives of thehospital career grades and of general medical practitioners each told us that theworkload of their respective branches of the profession is increasing, but wehave not been presented with convincing evidence of this.   We recognise that trendsm purely numerical measures of workload are not a guide to the quality of service r to demands of particular cases.   However, the available statistical indicatorsof workload in the hospital service suggest a marked fall over the last few yearsm the workload per individual hospital doctor or dentist as measured, for example,bypatients under care, by accident attendances, and by emergency and outpatientattendances. We welcome the continued recovery in the output of general16CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdental practitioners (GDPs) after a period of decline.kl.   It is important that we have reliable evidence on such matters as workload andmanpower.   We last conducted a comprehensive examination of these matters in 1977^&quot;and we propose to conduct a similar exercise as part of our next review, when wehope to have also the results of a survey of the work and responsibilities ofthe training grades (paragraph 78) and of the enquiry into the hours of work ofGDPs (paragraph 127).k2.   The Health Departments suggested that there has been an improvement in therelative job security of doctors and dentists compared with those in other walksof life.   The professions, on the other hand, pointed to the present financialconstraints on the NHS and to greater difficulties that the hospital training gradeswere experiencing in moving between posts.   The representatives of the hospitalcareer grades stressed the fact that a hospital doctor does not on average attainconsultant status before age 37, after a long period of gaining the appropriateexperience and qualifications, and in competitive conditions.kj&gt;.   We comment further on the job security of junior hospital grades in paragraph 84.Clearly there are uncertainties in the early part of any doctor&apos;s or dentist&apos;scareer, and job security varies widely in the private sector as a whole.   On balancehowever, we believe it is still true that entry to medical or dental schoolvirtually ensures a life-time career, and that this contrasts strongly with thesituation at present facing many of those at comparable levels elsewhere. Moreover,we note that persistent vacancies remain in certain hospital specialties and incommunity medicine, and that there are still insufficient doctors and dentists incertain areas.   Although it is extremely difficult to quantify relative job security,we have taken account of the broad picture in reaching our recommendations.hh.   Pensions and other benefits     As foreshadowed in our Tenth Report   we haveundertaken this year a more detailed examination of the value of the pensionsand other benefits available to doctors and dentists and to those at comparablelevels elsewhere, in order to assess the relative worth of the &apos;total remunerationPackage  .c2eW^dy, n Doctors&apos; ^ Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Seventh Report, 1977 -wnnd. 6800 (Appendix C). r     &apos; &quot; P- cit. (paragraph 18).17CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALJj.5.   We last carried out a specific examination of the relative value of pensionsfor doctors and dentists in 1975^, when we compared the arrangements for consultants,GMPs and GDPs with those for other groups in the public services, and found nosignificant differences between the retirement benefits.   Although we were notable to make direct comparisons with the private sector, we came to the generalconclusion that compared with other professional groups, doctors and dentists didnot suffer any significant disadvantage in the superannuation element of theirtotal remuneration.   This year, we have asked the Government Actuary to carry outa comparative evaluation of the pension schemes for doctors and dentists withschemes that are typically found at similar income levels outside the NHS. Weasked him to conduct this evaluation on the basis of his own preferred &apos;economic&apos;assumptions concerning such matters as the likely long term rate of increase inprices and earnings, and the real rate of return on investments.    We also asked him toillustrate the effects of basing evaluations on assumptions at the extremes of the2ranges that the Scott Inquiry into the Value of Pensions   regarded as reasonable.The Government Actuary&apos;s report is at Appendix D.^6.   The Government Actuary&apos;s main findings are that the value of the pensionscheme for doctors and dentists (expressed as a percentage - net of employees&apos;contributions - of career earnings) is noticeably greater than the value of schemeswhich apply at comparable levels and are typically provided in outside organisationsto all permanent employees or to all salaried staff.   Only the very best outsideschemes (under which comparatively few senior employees, mostly at the earningslevels of the more highly paid doctors and dentists, enjoy special arrangements,often on a non-contributory basis) are relatively more valuable than the schemefor doctors and dentists.    Public sector schemes generally provide benefits ofmuch the same value as the NHS scheme.    The Government Actuary concludes that forGDPs the NHS scheme net of employee contributions is worth about 12 per cent oftheir career remuneration; for GMPs it is worth about 14 per cent.   For hospitaland community doctors and dentists the value depends upon the level of remunerationat retirement -for hospital consultants in receipt of a c distinction and meritoriousservice award at the end of their career the value is about 16-j per cent. Fortypical private sector schemes, the values would be of the order of 6-j per centless than this (again net of employee contributions).    When the evaluationsReview Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Fifth Report, 1975 -Cmnd. 6032 - April 1975 (Appendix D).Report on the Inquiry into the Value of Pensions (Chairman - Sir Bernard Scott) -Cmnd. 8147, February 1981.18CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALare made at the extreme ends of the ranges of economic assumptions set out inthe Scott report, the relative advantage to the hospital consultant with a C awardover the typical external schemes ranges from 5-17 per cent.    The GovernmentActuary&apos;s calculations include his assessment of the value of increases topensions in payment, including those received by retired doctors and dentistsunder the inflation-proofing arrangements, but take no specific account of theadditional value that might be placed on the NHS scheme because of the veryguarantee of full inflation-proofing which it provides (in contrast to schemeswhere provision for pensions increases is mainly, or even entirely discretionary).The Government Actuary&apos;s report suggests that&apos;the guarantee as Such might increasethe relative value of the NHS pension by a further 0.7 per cent of career remuneration.1+7.   Our information on fringe benefits outside the NHS at income levels similarto doctors and dentists has been taken from published surveys.    We have not takendirect account of benefits, such as provision of a car where essential for workpurposes, which are also available to doctors and dentists.   We have alsodisregarded a variety of benefits which, because they are not widely availableor are of low intrinsic value, are not likely to add significantly to averageremuneration outside the NHS.   However, some benefits - including, for example,subsidised lunches of greater value than those available in the NHS - are significant.The most important benefit in this category is undoubtedly the private use ofcompany cars not essential for work purposes.   For this review, we have soughtto estimate the value of a provided car by comparing the expenditure on privatemotoring at similar income levels to doctors and dentists with the expenditurethat individuals will incur on company cars (such as charges for petrol and oil forprivate use).   After adjustment for pensionability and tax, we estimate that theaverage value of all significant fringe benefits at comparable levels in theoutside world is equivalent to some 7-8 per cent of the annual income of anestablished doctor or dentist.48.   We have been very conscious of the difficulty of valuing benefitsnot received in the form of cash and of the fact that the valuationsof pensions and of other benefits involve different considerations.   In bothcases the studies of relative values .have inevitably been based upon a numberof simplifying assumptions, and we recognise that the balance of advantage ordisadvantage is not necessarily static from year to year.   We believe that fullinflation-proofing of pensions is a particularly valuable benefit in currenteconomic circumstances, and we are inclined to the view that the relative value f the pensions arrangements for doctors and dentists is somewhat greater than19CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALe have allowed for in the past.   On the basis of the approach and assumptionspreferred by the Government Actuary in respect of pensions, it is clear that thevalue of the NHS pension   scheme to doctors and dentists at least compensates fullyfor the value of pensions and other benefits, taken together, at equivalent levelselsewhere.   Use of some of the more stringent assumptions within the range indicatedin the Scott Report would produce a shift in the overall balance of advantagetowards doctors and dentists.   The pensions evaluation on this occasion has, however,been carried out in advance of any developments which may flow from the Government&apos;sconsideration of the Scott Report; accordingly, we have based our judgments for thisreview on the results of applying the Government Actuary&apos;s preferred assumptions.We may need to review the pensions findings in our next report in the light ofdevelopments.20CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 4HOSPITAL DOCTORS AND DENTISTSManpower and recruitment49. There were some 35,400 hospital doctors in England and Wales&quot;*&quot; at 30 September1980 - a net increase of over 900 on the 1979 total (one per cent down on theaverage annual increase over the last decade).   Overseas born doctors now accountfor a marginally smaller percentage of all doctors (32 per cent).   The number ofmedical consultants in England and Wales increased net by 2 per cent (much thesame as the 1979 increase); senior registrars, registrars and senior house officersby 4.2 per cent, 1.7 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively (against 4.8 per cent,1.6 per cent, and 6.6 per cent in 1979).   Output from the medical schools continuesto rise, and the significant growth in the number of women doctors in the hospitalservice continues ( 5 per cent more in 1980 than in 1979 as against an increaseof 2 per cent for men).   The average age on appointment as a medical consultantremains at y]\ years.   The number of hospital dentists in England and Wales alsorose slightly to some 1240, 40 per cent of whom were consultants.50. As indicated in paragraph 4l, we propose to conduct a thorough study ofmanpower and workload of doctors and dentists during the next review.   We commentlater in this chapter on particular specialties where there are shortages andon numbers in the senior house officer grade.    In general, however, we regardrecruitment to the hospital service as satisfactory.Workload51. The professions suggested to us that current economic and financial constraintshave increased both workload and stress for the hospital career grades. Contri-butory factors were said to be cutbacks by health authorities in the use of locumsand in filling established posts, and amalgamation of the rota duties of trainingWhere figures given in this and succeeding chapters relate to England and Walesonly, up to date figures for Scotland are not yet available.   The total of35,400 hospital doctors in England and Wales excludes hospital practitioners anddoctors appointed to part-time appointments under paragraph 94 of the Terms andConditions of Service of Hospital, Medical and Dental Staff.   Appendix C providesa summary of the numbers of doctors and dentists in the NHS in 1979 and I98O.21CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALgrades.   These arguments, however, were not supported by the quantitativeinformation available.   We recognise that the current financial climatemay have had some impact on the resources and facilities available to thecareer grades   but we have no evidence at present to persuade us that,overall, workload has increased to an extent that would justify adjustmentsto pay.52 Over the period 1973-1979 there was a modest increase in the totalnumber of outpatient attendances, accident and emergency attendances,discharges and deaths, and of individual patients treated by the hospitalservice as a whole.   At the same time, the numbers of hospital doctors anddentists have increased, leading to a marked decline in individual workload(by 13-18 per cant) as measured by these broad indicators (which&apos;arenot a guide to either the quality of service provided or the demands ofparticular cases).   We have also been told that some health authorities arelimiting the amount of contraceptive services work and domiciliary visitsfor which consultants can claim fees; and that, in order to meet cash limits,hospital doctors are tending to refer patients to their GMP for prescriptions.We do not suggest that such developments are desirable, but they affectworkload.1 January 1980 contractual changes53 We expressed some concern about certain aspects of these changes in ourTenth Report , particularly the control arrangements.   The indications arethat temporary additional sessions are being used sparingly: at September1980, only 169 hospital doctors and dentists had been contracted for suchsessions in England and Wales, mostly in shortage specialties.   We welcomethis, and would like to be kept informed of the numbers of sessions grantedand terminated, and of their duration.54 The two main contractual changes provided for consultants on a maximumpart-time contract to be paid 10/l1ths of whole-time remuneration insteadof 9/l1ths; and for whole-time consultants to undertake private practiceprovided that gross earnings from it do hot exceed 10 per cent of NHSsalary(including any distinction and meritorious service award).   These changesappear to have increased the attractiveness to consultants of maximum part-time and whole-time contracts with a corresponding increase in formal commit-ment to the NHS.    At September 1980 there were 1,101 fewer part-time consultantsthan a year earlier, compared with a reduction of 158 in 1979                -Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Tenth Report, 1980 -Cmnd. 7903, May 1980 (paragraphs 47-53).CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALBy contrast, the numbers of whole-time and maximum part-time consult-ants increased by 355 ann 9^2 respectively.   We also understandthat a higher proportion of consultants may now be opting for a whole-timecontract on first appointment to the grade.55 The basic control over private practice undertaken by whole-timers isthat, if annual income from private practice for two consecutive financialyears exceeds 10 per cent of NHS remuneration, the consultant can be regradedas maximum part-time at the end of the third year unless he or she has takeneffective steps to reduce private practice commitment. Followingsuch regrading, the option to return to whole-time status is not availableuntil the completion of two consecutive years in which private practice earn-ings have not exceeded the 10 per cent limit.   We have no doubt that employingauthorities will, as a matter of course, attempt to ensure that whole-timersfulfill their NHS commitment.   Nevertheless, we remain concerned that the 10per cent limit could be substantially exceeded for up to three years beforethe downgrading provision can be applied.   We intend, therefore, to continueto monitor this situation and we shall look to the Health Departments nextyear for full information on the extent and amount of private practice under-taken by whole-timers.Distinction and meritorious service awards for consultants56 We have again consulted the Chairman of the Central Advisory Committeefor the awards scheme  (Sir Stanley Clayton).   He told us that most of thechanges to the scheme which we had noted in the Tenth Report   had been intro-duced, although there were difficulties in achieving &apos;quotas&apos; in the distri-bution of B and C awards by specialty, given the relatively low number ofawards available for distribution at any one time and the number and size ofspecialties.57 Both the professions and the Health Departments favoured increases in the numberof awards to maintain the current relationship    to total consultant numbers.The profession also asked us to maintain the relative value of the awards.We have explained previously why we do not favour a strict pro&apos; rata relationshipbetween the number of awards and the size of the  consultant body.   This yearwe recommend an overall increase of 100 in the number of awards, bringing thetotal to 5,712.  Our detailed recommendations are at Appendix A.   We haveapplied a somewhat lower level of increase in the values of the awards thanwe have applied to the consultant salary scale._ibid   (paragraph 55).23CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL58 The three main aims of the awards scheme are to reward outstandingindividual distinction; to attract and retain men and women of the highestcalibre in the medical and dental professions; and to provide levels ofearnings comparable with the highest earnings available in other professionsand walks of life.   We believe that recruitment and retention in the hospitalservice are generally satisfactory and consultants continue to occupy a highplace in the general earnings &apos;league&apos;.    It remains important that the first aimin particular continues to be met - rewarding individual distinction wherever thismay be found - notwithstanding the establishment (as from January 1980) ofmeritorious service as a criterion in its own right for receipt of anaward or the introduction of quotas by regions and specialties.    It isalready the case that the scheme carries its own form of stepped earningsprogression, in that a consultant almost always receives an A award only aafter first receiving a C and then a B award.   It would in our view be incom-patible with the main purpose of the scheme if the allocation of awards cameto be regarded as part of career earnings progression or as a form of longservice increment,   We note that there have been discussions within theprofessions about the possibility of establishing a system of seniority pay-ments for consultants.59 In their written evidence, the Joint Evidence Committee postulated a theoretical global sum of money available for the payment of awards, calcu-lated on the assumption that each recipient was a whole-timer receiving thefull value of an award.   It was suggested that there is a notional savingeach year from the global sum because in practice many  award-holders arepart-time  or honorary consultants who receive only a proportion of thefull value of an award.   We find no substance in this argument; there isno question of a &apos;pool&apos;.    It has always been the ease that a substantialproportion of awards-go to part-time and honorary consultants and we ofcourse  take this into account when we cost our recommendations.Fees60 Hospital career grades are eligible for fee payments for domiciliaryconsultations, exceptional consultations, certain types of lectures, andfamily planning work.   Each year we make recommendations for the level of these fees.   This year, the Health Departments proposed that family, planningfees should be calculated largely on the basis of time taken which, we were told, isthe approach adopted for negotiations between the profession and the Departments2kCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALon fees for NHS work outside the terms and conditions of service of doctorsin their main employment.     As we have pointed out on a. number of          1occasions, we do not regard time taken as necessarily the best singlecriterion for judging the appropriate level of pay for particular items ofwork, and we are not at present persuaded that the basis for determiningthese particular fees should be altered.61 Information on consultants&apos; NHS fee income is not collected centrally butwe estimate that it could average around  1,000 a year per doctor: consultants&apos;domiciliary visits alone probably yield nearly  800 a year. Weask the Health Departments to provide in time for the next review firminformation on trends in fthe extent and amounts of such fee income. Wewill then look again at the Departments&apos; proposals for family planning fees,and would welcome evidence from the professions on this or related points.Clinical members of District Management Teams62 Last year, the professions represented strongly to us that the level ofpayment to clinical members of District Management Teams (DMTs) was inadequate.We did not consider that we had been given sufficient evidence toenable us to decide whether a change was required.   We invited the pro-fessions and the Health Departments to undertake a joint examination ofthe nature and level of responsibility involved, and of the demands on thetime of the clinical members compared with that involved in other NHS committeework which consultants and general practitioners typically undertake. Thisexamination did not get under way in time for this review and so we cannotmake any further progress at present.   We hope that the results of theexamination, covering the various matters on which we sought information inthe Tenth Report, will be available in time for the next review.   We askthat this evidence should also indicate the effect of NHS restructuring onthe work of DMTs; our present understanding is that this may remain muchthe same except that the role of the Teams as channels of medical advice tothe health authorities may be strengthened.Expenses and allowances^3   There have been a number of changes in expenses and allowances for&apos;hospital doctors and dentists since our last report.   London Weighting hasbeen increased with effect from  1 July 1979*   but no agreement has yet beenreached for July 1980.     The arrangements for payment of charges by doctorswho are voluntarily resident in hospitals have been revised to reflect more25CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALclosely the average cost to the NHS of providing the accommodation. Newmotoring allowances have been agreed, including the introduction of a lumpsum payment towards the use of a private car (instead of reimbursement whollyon the basis of mileage covered) for consultants who are required to be oncall from home and whose annual mileage falls within specified limits.Doctors who are classified for the first time as regularly using cars arenow entitled to a loan towards the cost of buying a car, at a concessionaryrate of interest; other doctors will also be able to apply for loans at thediscretion of the individual health authority.   In some cases, it will beopen to the health authority to provide an official car.64 The Health Departments calculate the new motoring allowances will costan additional  3 million in their first year.   They suggested that the changes(which, except for the lump sum payment to essential users, parallel those forother health service staff) should be regarded as remedying unjustifiably lowlevels of previous payments.   We have not offset the costs in coming to ourrecommendations, but we have taken account of the new provisions for cars,as part of our general comparison of the total remuneration package(paragraph 47) 65 Agreement has also been reached on a miscellaneous expenses grant payableto meet removal costs incurred in changing posts.   Previously, hospital doctorsand dentists have only been reimbursed for sums actually spent and claimed,whereas other health service staff have been able to claim a flat rate lumpsum irrespective of actual expenditure.   The agreement applies the latterarrangement to hospital doctors and dentists.   The Departments suggested thatthe agreed levels of grant would not only compensate in full for the actualcost of moving house, but would provide  &apos;an additional element&quot;; and that we shouldtherefore offset against remuneration the additional cost arising from the agreement.This view was strongly opposed by the professions (in particular by the represent-atives of the hospital training grades) who had been given to understand thatthe Departments would not implement the agreed change unless our recommendationsoffset the costs.   We are convinced that an offset would not be justified, andthat it would be wrong for the Departments not to implement the agreement onthis account.   It seems to us that the new grant is essentially intended toreimburse expenses and in this respect is not different in principle from theagreement on new mileage allowances, where the Departments accept that the addi-tional cost should not be offset.26CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSenior hospital medical and dental officers66 We explained last year &apos; why the flat rate salary of the senior hospitalmedical and dental officers (both obsolescent grades) should be equated withthe maximum of the associate specialist scale.   We are satisfied that thislevel remains adequate to recognise the responsibilities and seniority ofthe grades and the length of service to the NHS of those in them.Associate Specialists67 The title of those in this grade was formerly medical assistant orassistant dental surgeon.   It was suggested to us that the new title moreaccurately reflects the senior status of the grade, which is now acceptedas a career grade (although appointments to it are made on a personal basis).The option of a maximum part-time contract was introduced for associate specialistsfrom 1 April 1981.   There are some 1,400 in this grade.68 In our Sixth Report   we stated that, on the information then available,the work of the newly-formed hospital practitioner grade seemed likely to bemore responsible than that of either the (now) associate specialists or of thepart-time clinical assistants.   The profession has drawn our attention to thequalifications, expertise and continuing individual responsibility of theassociate specialist, although acknowledging that the work in any individualcase (as with hospital practitioners) very much depends upon particular circum-stances   such as the experience of the individual concerned and the requirementsof the supervising consultant as head of the clinical team.   We have previouslyrequested definitive information on the relative responsibilities and dutiesof the two grades, but the  Health Departments and the JEC have both referred to thegreat difficulty of making reliable generalisations.   Given that our recommendationsfor remuneration must be related in the main to the average range of duties andlevels of responsibility, we are not convinced that a change is called for in therelative levels of pay of either grade.   Associate specialists already have awide pay scale and   to some extent   this caters for variations in experienceand responsibility.69 We asked the Health Departments and the professions in our Tenth Reportto review the arrangements for payment for extra duty allowances.   We alsorecommended  a lower increase in the level of allowances than in the associate1~ ;ibid, (paragraph 59).Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Sixth Report, 1976 -Cmnd. 6473, May 1976 (paragraph 25).Op . c i t.(paragraph 63).CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALspecialist pay scale (while improving the pattern of increments within the scale). TheDepartments have now told us that they have not initiated discussions on changes, bothbecause of potential additional costs (if only as a result of protection arrange-raents) and because it has been agreed that there should be a three-year &apos;moratorium&apos;on major contractual changes for career grades following those introduced from1 January 1980.   The professions urged us to restore the relative value of theallowance and suggested that a higher level of allowance would deter healthauthorities from relying on excessive hours of duty by associate specialists. Theyalso argued that the on-call commitments of many associate specialists, particularlythose in acute specialties, involve a significant amount of call-out.70 We remain concerned about the allowance system.   We recognise that the allowanceis intended to recompense doctors and dentists for giving up free time to whichthey are entitled under their terms and conditions of service.   However, aboutone fifth of all associate specialists receive extra duty allowances and wecalculate that the average payment made is now some  3,000 a year.   There are a numberof associate specialists who earn substantially larger amounts for duties thatmay not require much actual call-out.   Such arrangements hardly seem appropriateto what is now recognised as a career grade.   We note that the three-year &apos;moratorium&apos;did not prevent agreement on the introduction of a maximum part-time contractoption for associate specialists; and protection arrangements area normal part of agreements on significant contractual changes.   We hope nextyear to receive evidence based on discussions between the Health Departments andthe profession on changes to Ahe allowance systtttn -to reflect .the earoerstatus of the associate specialist grade, and that takes account of the*pointsto which we have drawn attention.Hospital practitioners71 We have been asked to reduce the hospital practitioner scale from 7 to 5 points,to match changes made to the consultant scale in 1975-   However, we do not recommendshortening of this scale.   The hospital practitioner grade is open to generalmedical practitioners who wish to work part-time in hospitals; they are limitedto a maximum of 5 sessions a week.   When recommending implementation of the agreedscale shortening for consultants in 1975 , we did so largely to reflect the patternReview Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Fifth Report, 1975 - Cmnd. 6032,April I975 (paragraph 23).28CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALat comparable levels elsewhere.   We took a similar view last year when shorteningthe clinical and senior clinical medical officer scales to 7 points&quot;&apos;&quot;, and the levelof Pay f r these officers is broadly comparable to that of hospital practitioners.The associate specialist scale also comprises 7 points.   We do not accept thatscale shortening can simply be &apos;rolled on&apos; from one grade to another and we seeno justification for it in this case.   Consultants are clearly the most seniorgrade in the hospital service; the work of hospital practitioners is lees responsible,and is more limited in scope as well as being discontinuous.Part-time medical officers (clinical assistants)72 We understand that discussions are continuing within the profession on changesdesigned to recognise the seniority of this grade and to retain the services of existingclinical assistants.   They include consideration of an incremental scale inplace of the present flat-rate sessional payment.   For the present, we recommendthat the existing arrangement should be continued.Hospital junior doctors and dentistsThe basic salary73 The juniors&apos; representatives maintained that the basic salary should beincreased to the relative level which they suggested it would now have reachedif (as the profession had wanted) we had related salary to the first kO hours ofwork in 1975 instead of 1978.     The resulting salary levels for April 198l wouldinvolve on average increases over current levels some 3 per cent higher than theincreases sought in written evidence by the other branches of the professions(about 18.5 per cent in all).7^     We have considered the proposal fully, but do not recommend an adjustment onthis basis.   We explained in our Eighth Report   why we&apos;had not related the basicsalary to kO hours a week before 1978.   We recognise that the juniors felt stronglywhen their 1975 agreement was introduced .that their salary should have been relatedto the first hO hours of work. However,we did not see retrospective adjustments tosalary levels as appropriate when we recommended the change in 1978; nor do we now.1 Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Tenth Report,  1980 - Cmnd. 7903 2May 1980 (paragraph 118).Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Eighth Report, 1978 -May 1978 (paragraph 32).29CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALWe thought it right to use the greater flexibility provided by Government paypolicy in 1978 to recommend other changes in remuneration (for example, relativeincreases in the pay of senior grades);   but we did not make retrospectiveadjustments back to the time when they had first been proposed.   Moreover, wemust again emphasise that comparison with earnings movements as shown by theNew Earnings Survey (the basis of the profession&apos;s own calculations) has,year by year, provided only one factor in our considerations.75. Although we do not accept the specific proposal made by the professions,we have this year applied a modest relative increase at certain points in thehospital training grades&apos; salary structure.   We see this as necessary to achievethe correct relationship with the rest of the pay structure.Remuneration for work over 40 hours76. The current rates of payment for contracted units of medical time (UMTs)beyond the first kO hours of work are based on 30 per cent of salary for actualwork and on-call duty (A supplements) and 10 per cent of salary for stand-byduty (B supplements).   These percentage rates have remained unchanged since 1975.when we judged them appropriate in the light of existing information on juniors&apos;hours of duty.   They were also acceptable under the pay policy provisions thenin force under which the next increase for juniors would have had to be postponedwell beyond the normal review date if the 1975 new contract had increased thetotal pay bill for juniors above the level that would have resulted under theold contract.   We stated at the time that we would keep the new arrangements1under review ; and we have since pointed out on several occasions that, for thispurpose, we need detailed information on the actual work and responsibilities ofthe training grades, including their long hours of duty .77. It is clear that the number of hours worked and the rates of payment for longhours remain major points of concern to juniors.   Many of them feel that thecurrent rates bear no relation to actual levels of work, and provide no incentiveto health authorities to reduce the overall hours demanded of junior:;.iew Body on Doctors* and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Supplement to Fifth Report,1975 - Cmnd. 62V3, September 1975 (paragraph 21).Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Ninth Report,  1979 -Cmnd. 757/+, june 1979 (paragraph 20).30CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Health Departments confirmed that discussions on ways of reducing hours havenot made any real progress.   The professions suggested that we should recommend&apos;penal&apos; rates for hours over kO a week, and proposed unified rates of 130 per centfor between ^+0 and 80 hours and 200 per cent thereafter (although they werewilling to see the increases staged over several years).78.   We share the juniors&apos; deep concern over excessive hours.   We find itdifficult to believe that the long hours can be justified in many cases and itis disappointing to find that the average number of contracted hours for alldoctors and dentists in the training grades (almost 90 a week on the latestavailable evidence) has changed little in recent years, despite the growth inthe number of hospital juniors and indications (quality of service apart) of areduction in individual workload (paragraph 52).    We do not regard the presentpercentage rates of remuneration for hours over kO as necessarily immutable, aswe made clear in our October 1980 discussion with the professions.   We do need,however, a thorough and up to date study of the actual work and responsibilitiesof the training grades as a whole before we can decide whether or what changesin the overall remuneration structure would be appropriate.   To this end, wehave asked the Office of Manpower Economics to conduct a survey with a view tothe results being available in time for our next review.   The Joint EvidenceCommittee and the Health Departments have both expressed their support for thisstudy.79     Other considerations are also relevant.    The penal rates approach advocatedby the profession is only one possible solution, and may not - at least on itsown - be an effective one.    We believe the long hours of duty for juniors to bothe result of a complex set of factors.    These include the desire of the employingauthorities to run the hospital service economically; the requirements ofconsultants to achieve what they consider to be an appropriate level of clinicalcover; and the willingness of a good number of juniors to contract for long hours.In this situation, penal rates might at best have only a marginal effect and couldencourage some juniors to contract for still longer hours.    As always, we wouldneed to have regard to the impact of any changes on pay relationships, in this caseespecially between total earnings of the training grades and those of others inthe hospital career structure and elsewhere.   We estimate that payment for hoursbeyond kO a week has for a number of years been worth 35-40 per cent of basicsalary on average (considerably more for some individuals).    The professions&apos;proposals for rates of 130 and 200 per cent would, on the current pattern ofcontracted hours, increase the average pay of juniors by some 105 per cent31CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnd add over 20 per cent to the pay bill for all NHS doctors and dentists.Effects of this order would be very difficult to justify.80 We would welcome concerted moves on the part of the Health Departmentsand the professions to reduce the number of contracted hours.    The Departmentshave suggested that the way forward lies mainly in changes in the medical careerstructure, including an expansion of the consultant grade and redistribution of someof the out of hours burden onto consultants.    Such a change would take a number ofyears to achieve, although earlier progress might be made in particular specialtiesor areas.    Rota sharing by juniors is another possibility but one which has, weunderstand, shown up a number of difficulties - mainly in relation to the clinicalresponsibility and requirements of consultants.    We doubt whether such difficultiesare insuperable and hope that further progress can be made.81 We suggest that one other approach should be considered.    If we decided indue course that adjustments to the present rates of supplement were called for,we might have greater leeway if we could be more certain that the hours of dutywhich qualify for payment would in practice be reduced.   This could be achieved,for example, by agreement between the Health Departments and the professionsthat additional payment should cease after a certain number of hours of duty(perhaps with provision for time off in lieu to compensate for occasions whenimmediate patient needs had necessitated additional work).    The representativesof the training grades told us that they are not opposed in principle to sucharrangements, but have reservations as to the employing authorities&apos; ability tooperate them.Inducement payments to shortage specialties82 The profession proposed the introduction of arrangements to attract juniorhospital doctors to shortage specialties by appointing them well above the minimumof the relevant salary scale.    It was argued that although the financial gainmight not be great and would be short-lived, it might just tilt the balancefor a sufficient number of doctors who would otherwise marginally favour anotherspecialty.    We want to see an end to the present shortages, but we have reservationsabout the type of arrangements proposed.    We understand that doctors changespecialties relatively rarely and therefore, in making their initial choice,are effectively choosing their future career.     We doubt whether theProfessions&apos; proposals for inducement payments would have a significanteffect on the choices made, particularly as the shortage specialties alreadyProvide a financial incentive in the form of earlier appointment as consultant32CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthan in the more popular specialties.   Our attention was drawn to theperipheral hospital allowances, but these relate to specific posts anddo not, we feel, provide a guide to the likely success of incentive paymentsapplying to whole   specialties.   We believe that more appropriate solutionslie in the planned expansion of training posts in the relevant specialtiesand that shortages can disappear relatively quickly without the introductionof special payments, for example when promotion or other opportunities inmore popular specialties are restricted.   We also point out that very highrates of remuneration for hours beyond hO might make shortage specialtieseven less attractive than at present, to the extent that they requireonly a limited amount of such duties over this level.Leave arrangements83   At the beginning of this review, the representatives of the traininggrades sought our support for their claim for an increase in the leaveentitlement of all junior grades to the level of six weeks currently enjoyed bysenior registrars. We were asked to agree that the resulting increases in cost shouldnot be offset against remuneration.   Later, we were told that (followingnegotiations) the Health Departments were willing to raise the leave allow-ance of house officers from four to five weeks provided that the cost wasoffset, and the professions asked us to consider whether or not the costshould be offset against the remuneration of the training grades as a whole.We have taken account in our recommendations of the additional costs arisingin a full year from  the extra week&apos;s leave.Job security and career prospects 4   It has been put to us that there has been a decline in the job securityof junior hospital doctors and dentists.   We were told that current financialconstraints are restricting promotion prospects and that juniors nowexperience increasing difficulty in finding posts in the series of job moveswhich progression through the training grades involves.   We understand thatthe official unemployment statistics currently show over 600  unemployed personsseeking work as doctors and that the number has increased over the last year orso    Such numbers are, of course, only a small proportion of the total numberof doctors in the training grades alone; but the juniors&apos; representatives suggestedthat the official statistics understate the true position and do not reflect theincreased amount of &apos;transitional&apos; unemployment experienced by juniors between posts.33CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Health Departments suggested that there has been an over-expansion of thesenior house officer grade relative to the number of training and career postsavailable, and that hospital juniors are spending longer periods between jobsin order to secure the better training posts.   We have explained in paragrapht.Ii.nl. we .judge thai,  the overall   job nocuril.,y nnd career prosper l.n of Nil,&quot;,doctors and dentists remain good, especially when compared with current exper-ience at comparable levels in other walks of life.   Nevertheless, we havetoken note of the unease expressed by the representatives of the traininggrades and we shall continue to keep the situation under review.Ophthalmic medical practitioners85.   The profession told us that although they could produce no firm statisticson the recruitment of OMPs, a shortage is indicated by the fact that theNational Ophthalmic Treatments Board is giving approval to short term appoint-ments of ophthalmic opticians to OMP postB, in order to fill shortages incertain medical eye centres.   The profession did not believe that all sighti(.;ling should be conducted by ophthalmic opticians.    We were told that thel.ask of OMPs is not simply to conduct refractions on normal eyes - although itis impossible to remain an experienced and competent OMP without doing a sub-stantial amount of this work - and that OMPs bring special medical knowledgeand expertise to sight testing which are not available to opthalmic opticians.06.   The basic qualifications required to practise as an OMP are a Diploma inOphthalmology with two years&apos; recent relevant experience (although a good numberof OMPs will in fact have higher qualifications).   We gather that these basicqualifications are less stringent than those in effect required of all consultantsand of senior registrars (who, we understand, have to have qualifications similarto those of Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons).   We estimate that thereare some 76O OMPs who are known also to hold other appointments or to be belowretirement age.   Of these, 270 (39 per cent) hold consultant   appointments, while125 are clinical assistants and a further 180 hold other hospital appointments(although those holding consultant appointments conduct some 60 per cent of thoseOMP sessions worked by doctors holding hospital appointments). 7    We have taken these considerations into account in recommending that thenet remuneration element of the sight testing fee should be increased to  3.61.  .   A survey is now under way to help establish a firm basis for the expenseselement of the sight testing fee.   The last thorough examination was in 1965we hope that the survey can be completed quickly.   The profession and the
CONFIDENTIALDepartments confirmed their intention to ask us to take over responsibilityfor the expenses element once it is on a satisfactory basis.   We confirm ourwillingness to do so.89   Last year, we were told that negotiations between the profession andthe Departments over a pilot scheme for domiciliary visits by OMPs were at1a standstill because of disagreement over the level of fee for the scheme .We were informed that both supported in principle the introduction of thescheme and, in the hope of breaking the deadlock, we recommended a fee of 12.00 per visit (plus expenses).   This year we were told by the HealthDepartments that, in view of financial constraints, Ministers had decidedto postpone indefinitely the proposals for a substantive scheme and thatthere was therefore no case for proceeding with the pilot scheme.   It isunfortunate that the possibility of Ministers ruling out a substantive schemeon cost grounds was not made clear to us last year.   We hope it will soonprove possible to revive the proposals, and we shall again be prepared torecommend a fee if the need arises.1Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Tenth Report, 1980Cmnd. 7903, May 1980 (paragraph 70)35CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 5GENERAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSManpower and recruitment90. The number of general medical practitioners (GMPs) increased to anestimated 28,376 in 1980, a rise of more than 2 per cent over 1979. Withinthis total, the number of unrestricted principals increased by over 500(2.1 per cent against 1.5 per cent in 1979), providing the largest annualgrowth since 1971-72.    The increase was divided equally between British-born and overseas-born doctors, although women account for 57 per cent ofthe increase in British-born doctors whereas men made up 75 per cent of theincrease in overseas-born doctors.    There are now 3,100 women doctors(British-born) and 5,200 overseas-born doctors in general practice. Thenumber of GMP trainees increased by 15.2 per cent &apos;to almost 1700.    The numberof principals who provide restricted services or who have limited lists andthe number of salaried assistants both continued to decline.91. In evidence, the profession welcomed the increase    in the numbers ofGMPs     and of trainees but still considered the growth inadequate; their aimis for 50 per cent of the output of medical schools to enter general practice.The profession also pointed out that overseas-born doctors provided asignificant proportion of the increase in the total number of GMPs.   We shallreturn next year to questions of recruitment and manpower in general medicalpractice as part of our larger study of these matters as they affect the medicaland dental professions as a whole (paragraph 41).Wider developments92. We were told of a number of developments in the field of generalpractice.    The profession indicated their growing interest in medical, 1 audit1and GMPs1 willingness to participate in matters which might otherwise fallto the hospital service - for example, the surveillance of prescriptionsand of the effect of drugs. We understand the profession is also consi-dering the part that computers might play in improving the efficiency36CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof general practice.   The profession&apos;s representatives stressed thatvocational training is now mandatory (which we welcome) and that discussionsare in train with the Health Departments about improving post-graduatetraining.   The Joint Evidence Committee also sent us, for information, a copyof the 1979 Report of the New Charter Working Group.   This report discussed anumber of radical changes in the system of remuneration for GMPs, and wewould need to receive information well in advance if any of the major changesindicated in the Report were likely to become the subject of agreement betweenthe profession and the Departments.Workload and stress93-    The profession argued that the workload of GMPs is particularly affectedby changes in the state of the economy, by social problems, and by cutbacks inexpenditure on the NHS and on local authority social services.   We were againtold that the elderly form an increasing proportion of all patients. Unemploymentand other effects of general economic downturn were also said to have an adverseeffect on the health of the nation, the impact of which is felt first at GMPlevel.   We were told that cash limits and other financial constraints had ledhospitals to trim the level of their services with a further shift in theburden of care onto the GMP.    The Health Departments, on the other hand, toldus that they had no reliable evidence of a systematic, general increase inthe workload of GMPs, although they accepted that financial constraints on thehospital service and cutbacks in social services are probably having some effect.94.   We note that while the workload of GMPs may have increased in somerespects, there are also counteracting factors.    There has been a continuedfall in list sizes, a growth in the use of ancillary support staff, and a greateruse of commercial deputising services.   Other developments such as a fall in theamount of National Insurance certification following the Social Security (No. 2)Act I98O (paragraph 113) will also have an effect.    Overall, we are not convinced n the evidence so far presented to us, which has been largely of an unquantifiednature, that    there has been a significant increase in workload; but we shallexamine this matter more specifically next year (paragraph kl).37CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALOut o.l&apos; hours romunorntion95. This year, the profession have again urged a relative shift in remunerationin favour of the various out of hours payments (supplementary practiceallowance, supplementary capitation fees, and night visit fees).   They arguedthat the present distribution provides inadequate recompense for the onerousnature of out of hours work and responsibilities, and that for GMPs itrepresents a level of intrusion into family and social life quite out of keepingwith the experience of the community as a whole.    Last year&apos;&apos;&quot; we recommended arelative increase amounting to 17 per cent in the level of the night visit feeand we do not believe that a further relative increase in the rates of out ofhours remuneration would be justified now.96. There have been several changes in the arrangements for paying nightvisit fees.    It has been agreed that, as before, GMPs will be able to claimfull fees for the first and second patient treated at a single location, butthat only half the fee will now be paid for each of the next three patients,and one tenth of the full fee for each patient seen thereafter.   The nightvisit fee will also be paid in future when, in the patient&apos;s interest, a doctorprovides specified treatment in a surgery forming part of the GMP&apos;s own residence.The Departments and the profession are agreed that the cost of these changes(estimated to be of the order of  50,000) should be offset against the generalincrease for GMPs&apos;  remuneration this year.97-   Agreement has also been reached to introduce a specific fee for nightvisits to patients for whom a GMP provides maternity medical services (providedthe visit is connected with the patient&apos;s pregnancy).    It will be at the samelevel as the standard night visit fee.   The profession and the Departments wereunable to agree whether the cost of the new arrangement (calculated to be 500,000 in 1980-81 terms) should be offset against the existing maternitymedical services fees or (as favoured by the profession) against GMPs&apos; feesand allowances generally.    Little or no new work is involved in the newarrangement and we have taken the view that the increased costs should-,beoffset against maternity medical services fees.Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Tenth Report, 1980 -Cmnd. 7903, May 1980 (paragraph 82).38CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL98. Wo have some general observations on these changes.   Our understandingis that the night visit fee was originally introduced to recognise thedisruption involred for a GMP in making visits to patients&apos; homes at night,particularly during normal sleeping hours.   Over the years, there appears tohave been a change in the rationale.   The fee became payable for specifiedtreatments which needed to be given in a surgery, provided the surgery wasnot part of the GMP&apos;s residence.    Now, it is payable for such treatments evenwhen the surgery is part of the GMP&apos;s home, although the disruption involvedmust clearly be less than it is for visits to patients&apos; homes or to a separatesurgery.   We also understand that GMPs can claim the full night visit fee forvisits made on their behalf by commercial deputising services. Individually,parhaps, none of these developments is particularly radical; but,, takentogether, they seem to us to represent a significant drift away from the basicintention.    In particular the ability to claim in full for visits made by adeputising service seems to us a very far cry indeed from the original purposeof the fee: we invite the Health Departments and the profession to considerbefore our next review whether it would be appropriate to institute a lowerlevel of fee for these circumstances.Commercial deputising services99. We now deal with more general developments in the use of deputisingservices.    In our Tenth Report   we requested further information on the extentof and trends in the use of deputising services.   This year wo have receivedjoint statistical evidence (with a commentary from the Health Departments)and a submission from the Medical Directors Association - the &apos;umbrella&apos;organisation for commercial deputising services - forwarded to us withoutcomment by the British Medical Association.   We are grateful for this response.100. The statistical evidence comprised the results of a survey of all 98Family Practitioner Committees (FPCs) in England and Wales.    It showed anincrease in the number of GMPs with FPC consent to use deputising services,from about 7,500 in 1974 to 9,420 in 1980.   At present, some 40 per cent of allunrestricted principals in England and Wales have such consent (50 percent inibid (paragraph 83) 39CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe ?8 FPCs which have given consents) but there seems to be considerablevariation in the limitations imposed by individual FPCs on the use ofdeputising services.   Claims for night visit fees are the only readilyavailable indicator of actual use of the services; they suggest that deputisingservices undertook kO per cent of all night visits made in the period April toJune 1980.   This may understate the real position because of the restrictedhours in respect of which night visit fees may be claimed.   Moreover, thetotal number of night visit fees claimed has risen from 495iOOO in 197^-75to 605,000 in 1979-80 and in about one sixth of FPCs which have consented totheir use, deputising services make over 80 per cent of all night visits.The Health Departments suggested that, once consent is given, deputisingservices are likely to be used more frequently than the previous pattern ofnight visit claims might indicate.101. The extent to which commercial deputising services are used has clearlyincreased.    However,the profession suggested to us that the geographicalspread of the services might slow down in future now that they have beenestablished in most areas where they can be commercially viable.    The MedicalDirectors Association confirmed that the costs of operating a commercialdeputising service in rural areas are usually prohibitive.    In general, theprofession saw no cause for concern at the growth in the use of these services.The code of practice issued by Health Departments in 1978 requires that theservices employ suitably experienced doctors who should keep the GMP informedof all visits made and consult him in appropriate cases.   FPCs consultprofessional advisory committees about the appropriate use of deputisingservices in their localities, and the governing code of practice requiresthat deputising doctors should not work longer than is consistent with theirperforming satisfactorily both the deputising job and any other medicalcommitments.102. The Medical Directors Association argued that deputising services providea good standard of care, and implied that we might encourage their use bysetting relatively high levels of out of hours remuneration for GMPs. TheAssocation indicated that the extent of their use may vary from four tofifteen visits a month per 1,000 patients, but pointed out that some GMPs(particularly those who work in health centres) use the services simply asan &apos;answering service&apos;.koCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL103. For the most part, the Health Departments supported the profession&apos;sviews on the quality of service and benefit to the GMP provided by deputisingservices.   They said that the deputising service will almost always make avisit to a patient&apos;s home when requested and that GMPs might not be willingto practise in some places (especially inner city areas) unless permitted touse the services.    It was argued that the growth of commercial deputisingservices could be viewed in part as a logical extension of the long acceptedview that doctors in general practice must have some arrangement to allow foradequate off-duty time and absences from the practice.    (Traditionally, this&apos;cover&apos; had been provided by partners, or by a rota system among neighbouringdoctors.)    The Health Departments also went on to suggest, however, that theuse of deputising services could give rise to &apos;double payment&apos; to GMPs: theresults of the survey of FPCs suggest that GMPs who use deputising servicesare providing less personal service (and are themselves therefore doing lesswork) than before,  although our recommendations for average net remuneration haveassumed no fall in personal service; at the same time, through the expenseselement of their fees and allowances,   GMPs as a whole are on average reimbursed forthe cost of employing deputising services.10k. We suggest that the recent substantial growth in the use of commercialservices marks a significant change in the nature of general practice in alarge part of the country.    We have been somewhat reassured by the commentsmade by the profession, the Departments and the Medical Directors Associationon the safeguards over the operations of commercial deputising services andthe quality of service provided.   We also accept that GMPs must have appropriateperiods of rest and recreation,  and we have always recognised this in makingour recommendations.    Nevertheless, we have reservations.    Although we recognisethe usefulness of commercial deputising services to single-handed and very smallgroup practices in out of hours periods, we were surprised to learn of the highproportion of total night visits made by deputising services in certain FPCareas.    Patients are entitled to expect personal care from their GMP and thedeputising services are organisations that do not form part of the NHS. Theremust be occasions when the unfamiliarity of the deputising doctor with theparticular needs and history of the patient   results in a significantly lowerlevel of service to the patient.    As to the implications for remuneration,the Health Departments&apos; arguments concerning &apos;double-counting&apos; may have someklCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALforce, particularly if the use of deputising services is considered inisolation.   We make no adjustments on this account to intended average netremuneration this year, but we shall return to the point in our next reviewwhen we hope to form a rounded judgment on the workload of GMPs. Meanwhile,it would at least appear that the growth in deputising services has acted asone counterbalancing factor to any increased workload in other areas of GMPs&apos;work.   We ask the Health Departments to supply us next year with updatedinformation on the number of GMPs with consent to make use of deputisingservices, the extent of their use, and variations between FPCs.Contraceptive service fee105. Last year^&quot; we explained that we have so far calculated the appropriatelevel of contraceptive service fees separately from that of intended averagenet remuneration which comprehends the great majority of fees and allowances(although in the past the levels of both have tended to march in step). Thisyear, the Health Departments have renewed their request that we should includecontraceptive service fees in our assessment of intended average net remuneration.The profession maintained that this would be objectionable to those doctors whoare unwilling or reluctant to provide contraceptive services on religious orconscientious grounds.   They also argued that family planning clinics are nowcutting back on the provision of contraceptive services, so that increaseddemand for the service is falling upon GMPs; if contraceptive service feeswere brought within the ambit of average net remuneration, restrictions wouldbe placed on the income which GMPs might earn from providing the service at atime when the associated workload was increasing.106. We first adopted the separate arrangements in 197^ when NHS fees forcontraceptive services were introduced.   We were not then certain how manydoctors would provide the service or what amount of work would be involved.It is now clear, however, that over 95 per cent of all GMPs provide the services.Furthermore, it does not follow that to incorporate the fees within intendedaverage net remuneration would depress GMPs1 income from this source when demandReview Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Tenth Report, 1980 -Cmnd. 7903, May 1980 (paragraphs 86-88).CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfor the service was rising.   Average net remuneration would be increased bythe amount which we calculate GMPs earn on average from the fees - some  66jin 1980-81 terms - and since the fees are paid on an item of service basis,the actual income of individual GMPs would rise insofar as they providedthese services to a greater extent.   We should in any case monitor the futuretrend of this part of GMPs&apos; workload and take it into account in judgingthe appropriate level of average net remuneration.107. If contraceptive fees were brought within intended net remunerationthis year, GMPs would be neither better nor worse off financially than atpresent except in two very minor respects.   First, to the extent that externalpay comparisons play a part in our considerations, the higher level of averagenet remuneration would be compared with pay movements at slightly higherearnings levels outside the NHS which might be different from the movementsat relatively lower levels of earnings.   Second, contraceptive service feeshave been regarded as providing remuneration only, unlike most fees withinaverage net remuneration which also comprehend an expenses element. Ifregarded in the same light as other fees, future increases in contraceptive servicepayments might differ somewhat from those that would have taken place if thefees had continued to represent net income alone.   These are, however, verymarginal considerations in the context of overall remuneration.108. The inclusion of these fees within intended average net remunerationwould not in our view compromise those with religious or conscientious objectionsto the provision of contraceptive services.    Then, as now, the individual GMPwould be free to decide whether or not to provide the services which wouldcontinue to be remunerated entirely on an items  of service basis.109. In our Ninth Report&quot;&apos;&apos; we recommended that the existing arrangements shouldcontinue until the remuneration of GMPs had.been brought fully up to date.That was achieved with the implementation of our Tenth Report recommendations.In the light of the considerations we have mentioned, we do not believe thatcontraceptive service fees should continue to be excluded from intendedReview Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Ninth Report, 1970 -Cmnd. 7574, June 1979 (paragraph 66).43CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALaverage net remuneration.   Our recommendations at Appendix A reflect thisdecision.   This entails a once-for-all relative increase in the level ofintended average net remuneration, but we emphasise that, in practice, theactual total net income of GMPs will not be affected.   The relative increasein the intended figure is the result of incorporating the average amount ofnet income which we calculate GMPs would have earned this year throughcontraceptive services under the previous arrangements (and which they willcontinue to earn under the new arrangements).   The recommended change willhave no effect, either way, on the total paybill.Paediatric surveillance110. The profession asked us to price a sequence of examinations which undertheir proposals might form part of a comprehensive system of paediatric healthsurveillance by GMPs.   We were interested to learn of these proposals but wedo not consider that sufficient progress has yet been made in agreeing withthe Health Departments the nature and operation of any eventual scheme toenable us to make recommendations.   We should like to be kept informed ofdevelopments and would be willing to consider recommending levels of paymentfor this work once firmer plans have been agreed.GMP trainees111. We find no reason at present to alter the supplement of 15 per centof salary in recognition of the out of hours responsibilities of trainees ingeneral practice.   We shall review this arrangement when we have the results ofthe survey we propose to conduct this year into the work and responsibilitiesof the training grades in general (paragraph 78).Related ancillary staff112. We are pleased the Health Departments and the profession have agreed thatthe experimental scheme for the partial reimbursement of salaries of relatedancillary staff should continue for at least another year.    It has also beenagreed that the scope of the scheme should be extended to cover dependentCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrelatives who undertake nursing duties in a practice.   We note that, underthis agreement, both the extension of the scheme to nurses and the reimbursementof employees&apos; National Insurance contributions in respect of dependentrelatives are to be achieved without additional cost to public expenditure. TheHealth Services Act 1980 requires the Secretary of State to make specificprovision in regulations for payments to relatives, and it is desirable thatwe should receive early notification of developments.National Insurance certificates113. Following the introduction of the Social Security (No. 2) Act I98O, GMPsare in effect no longer required to issue sickness certificates to cover periodsof incapacity lasting for three days or less.   As we submit this report, thereis considerable uncertainty over the future of the Government&apos;s plan for astatutory employers sick pay scheme to cover the first eight weeks of incapacity.At this stage we simply note that, if such a scheme were introduced, it mightwell further reduce the amount of sickness certification required from GMPsunder the NHS.Practice expenses114. As usual, the profession and the Health Departments have submitted evidenceconcerning the provision for average expenses which they consider we should makefor 1981-82.   We have also noted from the best evidence currently available thatthe provision made by us each year from 1977-78 to 1980-81 has been below theaverage level actually incurred by GMPs.   From the information as usual providedto us by the Technical Sub-Committee (TSC), we estimate that the total under-provision for the period as a whole amounted to some  1,400 per GMP.   However, about 950 of this is probably attributable to recent changes in the data collectionmethods adopted by the TSC which have revealed higher levels of expenditure inrecent years than could have been estimated at the time.   We do of course takeaccount of such changes in deciding the appropriate provision for each&apos;year asand when they are notified to us; our provision for 1981-82 accordingly takesfull account of the levels of expenditure which the latest data shows is likelyto be incurred.45CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL115. Our general aim is to ensure that there is no persistent tendency toover- or under-payment, taking one year with another.   In the light of allrelevant considerations, we calculate that the average expenses provisionnecessary for 1981-82 is  8,500 per unrestricted principal.   Our recommendationsin Appendix A make provision for this amount to be reimbursed on average throughgross fees and allowances.   In calculating the 1981-82 provision, we have takenaccount of the  18 deduction from expenses agreed between tho profession andthe Health Departments to accommodate the additional costs arising this yearfrom the related ancillary support staff scheme (paragraph 112) and of agreedchanges in the list of items available to be prescribed by dispensing doctors.Average ni&apos;b remuneration116. We have explained in Chapter 3 our general approach to the remunerationof the medical and dental professions at 1 April 1981.   The fees and allowancesrecommended in Appendix A are designed to increase the intended average netremuneration for GMPs, after allowing for practice expenses, to  18,480 a year,on the assumption of no change in the general level of workload or responsibility.We have explained (paragraph 109) that part of the increase is the result ofincorporating contraceptive service fees into the calculation, and marks nochange in the total level of net income likely to be earned by GMPs or in thetotal paybill for GMPs.   We estimate that GMPs will in addition receive anaverage net income of some  480 from hospital work and other official services.Payments on account117. We referred last year&apos;&apos;&quot; to the delay that can occur in translating ourrecommendations into &apos;money in the pocket&apos;  for the individual CMP.   We receivedfurther information from the Health Departments this year about an improvement,now put to the profession, in the arrangements for making &apos;payments on account&apos;before revised levels of fees and allowances can be implemented.

CHAPTER 6CONFIDENTIALGENERAL DENTAL PRACTITIONERS118. A most important issue in this review arises from the trends in the actuallevel of net income of general dental practitioners (GDPs) in recent yearscompared with the levels of target average net income (TANI) recommended by us.We deal with this matter in paragraphs 132-148.   However, we turn first to anumber of other matters of relevance to general dental practice.Manpower and recruitment119. The total number of practitioners in the general dental service in GreatBritain rose by 2.3 per cent to some 14,300 in 1980, maintaining the upwardtrend of recent years.   The number applying for and accepting a place in a dentalschool remained very similar in 1980 to the 1979 levels.   Evidence submittedby the British Dental Association (BDA) relating to 1974-79 showed a declinein the percentage of the population in England and Wales living in areas wherethere are 5,500 or more persons to each dentist-     However, marked discrep-ancies remain in the regional distribution of dentists anc* we hope that stepswill be taken to improve this situation.   We note that only three experimental&apos;salary plus bonus&apos; schemes were mounted in England (although eight suchschemes have been established in Scotland) and that the future of the schemesis to be reviewed by the Health Departments and the profession.General developments120. We note from the evidence submitted by the British Dental Association(BDA) that adult dental health continues to improve.   We understand that theimprovement stems in part at least from better dental techniques, greateremphasis on preventive dentistry, and fluoridation of drinking water andtoothpastes.   The Health Departments and the BDA have established a joint workinggroup to study the feasibility of experiments in remuneration based on capitationfees for providing a primary dental care service for children.   The report ofthis working group is being considered by the Dental Strategy Review Group, whichwas established last year to review the development of dental health policywith particular emphasis on prevention and the community dental service. Thereports of both the working group and the review group may have significant47CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL^plications for the remuneration of dentists and we ask to be kept informed ofdevelopments in both areas.   We hope to take the report of the Nuffield Inquiryinto Dental Education into account next year as part of our study of medical anddental manpower as a whole (paragraph 41).Salaried health centre dentists1121. As last year , we remain in favour of the link (which we established in1979) between increases in the pay of these dentists and that of GDPs, rather thanother salaried dentists.   The Health Departments informed us that at March 1980there were 46 salaried health centre dentists (of whom   only 19 were full-time),a somewhat lower estimate than has been provided in previous years.Emergency sessional fee122. This year, we were asked by both the BDA and the Departments to recommend theappropriate level of this fee.   At the end of 1979  a substantive scheme wasintroduced for the provision of emergency dental services (at premises controlledby area health authorities) at weekends and on public holidays.   The initial feeof  22.50 for a three hour session was agreed between the Departments and theprofession, who further agreed that it should be raised to  30 from 1 April 1980,broadly to reflect (we were told) the increase in TANI which we recommended in ourTenth Report.   We understand that, at the end of August 1980, 19 health authoritieshad set up schemes (some on a trial basis), of which one had been discontinued aftera trial period due to lack of patient demand; by the sane date, a total of 260 sessionshad been provided with 1843 patients attending (an average of 7.1 patients persession).   Approximately 95 per cent of the patients received some form of treatment,although in some cases this only involved the issue of a prescription.123. Both the profession and the Departments suggested that the present level ofthe fee had been sufficiently attractive to dentists over the past year.   We under-stand that the initial fee of  22.50 had no particular rationale, and bore nodirect relationship to any other fee or sessional payment.   We calculate that thePresent fee of  30 is some  3 more than dentists (GDPs and salaried dentists) would n average earn in net income in I98O-8I terms from 3 hours work under normal condi-tions, although we recognise that provision of an emergency session involves a disrup-tion to leisure time and the provision of treatment in unfamiliar surgeries.

CONFIDENTIALApril 1980 increase to  30 was proportionately greater than the increase inI&apos;ANI recommended in our Tenth Report over the actual level of TANI recommendedin our Ninth Report (and hence even larger in proportion to the increase inTANI which we recommended in 1980 above the indicated fully up to date valueat April 1979).   Taking these considerations into account, we recommend thatthe emergency services sessional fee should now be increased to  32.50.Career earnings pattern of CiDPs124. The profession has drawn our attention to the well-established pattern ofa relative decline in the income of GDPs with age. It was suggested that, con-sequently, the effects on older GDPs could be particularly harsh if dental paywas depressed below its appropriate level for a number of years. Reference wasmade to the fact that, by contrast, most salaried dentists can look forward bohigher earnings as they grow older because of their incremental pay scales. Weremain concerned to ensure that GDPs&apos; pay is kept at its proper level, but wodo not think that we need take special action because of the relative declinein earnings with age.   This pattern is well-known and we suggest that thosedeciding to enter general practice are able to take it into account.   GDPs arefaced with the cost of establishing and equipping a practice generally in theearly part of their career, while older dentisits already benefit from thesystem of seniority payments for GDPs.Capital expenditure125. In our Tenth Report   we invited the profession and the Health Departmentsto undertake a joint study into various aspects of capital expenditure under-taken by dentisits.   We understand that this study is now under way and we sh.-il Iconsider its results when they are submitted to us in due course.Output and workload12b.   The number of completed courses of dental treatment, including occasionaltreatments such as emergencies, for 1979 was J1.0 million (against 30.8million in 1978).    The latest information for 1980 points to 32.6 millioncourses of treatment.   The increase in 1980 reflects, among other factors,a decline in &apos;selective acceptance&apos; by GDPs of treatments under the NHS.&apos;ibid (paragraph 107),49CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrespect to higher value NHS work, we understand that the growth in thenumbers of crowns has continued and that, taking 1980 as a whole, there mayhave been an increase in the provision of dentures (although not sufficient toto restore the position prior to 1978).   The profession suggested that theincrease in crowns was to be expected, for they are both relatively cheap topatients and more acceptable than dentures.   There has been a substantialdrop in the provision of both metal and plastic dentures over the mediumterm but (largely because of the general improvement in adult dental health)the fall has been greater in plastic dentures (which arc generally used forcomplete replacement of teeth).Hours of work inquiry1,7 We understand that the next inquiry into the hours worked by GDPs is taking placein 1981 to cover the year I98O, and that the design of the survey is virtuallyidentical to that of the last (1977) survey.   We welcome this development.It is important that the inquiry should be conducted at regular intervals if theremuneration of GDPs is to reflect accurately the pattern of hours worked. Theresults of the inquiry will form a useful part of our general study of workloadfor the professions as a whole (paragraph 41).The 1 October 1980 fee scale128. The 1980-81 fee scale incorporated up to date fee item description:; agreedbetween the Departments and the profession.   It also reflected the results of thedetailed inquiry undertaken in I98O by the Dental Rates Study Group (DRSG) into therelative times taken to perform the dental operations covered in the new fee scale.We welcome both these developments.       The previous inquiry into fee relativities-00k place in 1969; we hope that there will not toe such a long delay before thenext inquiry is undertaken.129. The main purpose of the inquiry is to help to ensure that the structure of thefee scale has a neutral influence on the practitioner&apos;s choice of treatment in that,whatever particular treatment is appropriate, the same amount of net income will onaverage be generated per unit of time taken.   The result should be an improvedservice to patients.   We note that the Departments and the profession were satisfiedwith the method adopted for the latest inquiry - a discussion panel of 2k practisingentists - which differed markedly from the large scale postal survey undertaken in50CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL1969.   We were told that the panel approach, among other advantages, avoided thedifficulties of securing an adequate response to a large scale survey and ofinterpreting the replies.    In building the results of the inquiry into the 1980-81fee scale, the DRSG placed a limitation on the size of adjustments in order toavoid undesirably large, sudden changes in the relativities of certain fees; thebalance of the appropriate adjustments will be made over the next year or so.130. The October 1980 fee arrangements also included relaxation in prior approvalrequirements, in particular for provision of crowns, metal dentures and simpleorthodontic treatment.    The fee scale also incorporated new payments for servicessuch as a fee for examination and report in cases of traumatic injury and newfees for emergency recall to the surgery.    In the latter case, the fees for 1980-81were  7 and &amp;lk (depending on the length of journey to the GDP&apos;s surgery); andthey may have an effect on the number of treatments which would otherwise beprovided under the arrangements for emergency treatment sessions in premisesprovided by health authorities (paragraph 122).   We understand that, as foreshadowedin our Tenth Report&quot;*&quot;, fees were increased from 1 April 1980 for certain items oftreatment involving the use of gold, and an overall 3 per cent addition was madeto gross fees (largely to reflect the increased price of silver which is involvedin many courses of treatment).Patients&apos; charges131. In April I98O and in April I98I increases were made in NHS dental charges.Charges for dental treatment were extended to 18-20 year olds from 1 April I98I(with the exception of l8 year olds in full-time education and of those who qualifyfor exemption on the grounds which already apply to those over 21).   The BDA toldus that they regretted the extension of charges which might have an adverse effecton a group which, they said, does not give high priority to dental health. Itwas suggested that the change might depress the demand for dental treatment, atleast in the short term, but there might also be a temporary surge in the numberof treatments in anticipation of the extention.   The profession impressed uponus their view that changes in the level of patients&apos;  charges are a major cause f fluctuations in the volume of treatments provided but felt unable to offer anexplanation for the surge in the number of treatments in the last quarter of1979-80 which resulted in the DRSG&apos;s forecast of output for that year being exceededby some 3 per cent.ibid (paragraph 103).51CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe actual net income of GDPs132. We now turn to what has proved to be a difficult issue.    Each year werecommend target average net income (TANI) for GDPs - that is, the income (netof expenses) which we judge to be appropriate for the average GDP during thereview year.   We do not ourselves recommend adjustments to the individual feesand other payments that make up GDPs&apos; income (although we do so for generalmedical practitioners).   The setting of the fee scale for GDPs is the task of theDental Rates Study Group (DRSG) - a separate body consisting of an independentChairman and an equal number of representatives of the Health Departments and ofthe British Dental Association.   One of the main purposes of the DRSG, as laiddown by the 1960 Royal Commission, is &quot;to determine gross fees for each of theoperations in such fashion that the &apos;target net income1 for the average dentistwould be achieved in the standard number of hours of work&quot;&quot;&apos;&quot;.    In practice, theStudy Group recommends adjustments to the fee scale intended to yield ourrecommended level of TANI plus the Group&apos;s own estimate of average practiceexpenses over the coming year.    (This total sum is sometimes termed &apos;targetaverage gross income&apos;).   The Group submits its recommendations to the Secretaryof State and, if approved, the new fee scale is implemented on 1 October each yearwith a retrospective addition to payments made to dentists since 1 April.133. Forecasts of changes in dentists&apos; output over the review year, and in thelevel of expenses likely to be incurred, are essential to the work of the Study2Group.   In our Eighth Report   we commented on the problems of making such forecastsand on comparisons of actual and intended net income.   Previously, following theprofession&apos;s suggestion in 1974, the DRSG had made adjustments each year to thefee scale to reflect the variances between average actual expenses and the relevantprovision for expenses on a cumulative basis over the preceding years.    In 19771however, the profession was unable to accept the size of adjustment which then appearednecessary.    For our part, we took the view that the particular formula then in usewas inappropriate.    It could produce large variations in net income which might causefinancial difficulties for dentists and create uncertainty about the income that couldRoyal Commission on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, 1957-1960, Report -^ Cmnd. 939, February I96O (paragraph 385).Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Eighth Report ,197^ -Cmnd. 7176, May 1978 (paragraphs 54-64).52CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALbe expected each year.   We were also concerned that the formula was inequitablefor newly practising GDPs and could encourage GDPs to make undesirable economiesin expenditure in order to preserve net income, thereby giving rise to a cumulativedecline in the level of expenses and income.   We recommended that the DRSG shoulddiscontinue the practice of making adjustments each year to correct in full forcumulative under- or over-provision of expenses, and should instead follow theprinciple, which we adopt in respect of GMPs1 expenses, of ensuring that there isno persistent tendency in either direction, taking one year with another .IJik.   It is now clear that the level of the fee scale in recent years has tendedto produce payments of net income substantially in excess of TANI.   Table 1 Betsout our calculation of the differences between TANI and the actual net income ofGDPs since 1974-75.   There has been over-provision for expenses in each year fromthat time to 1978-79 and, on average, output changes also appear to.havebeen under-estimated over the same period.   We estimate that the cumulative over-payment over the period 1975-76 to 1979-80 is likely to amount to about  3,575per dentist or some  47^ million in total; accordingly, the average GDP hasreceived a net income during the period that is more than 8 per cent higher thanthe cumulative TANI we recommended.     We calculate that over-provision forexpenses accounted for some  2,420 of this amount ( 32^ million in total).135.   Table 1 takes account of the final figures for expenses in 1978-79 and theinterim figures on expenses in 1979-80, both of which have become available veryrecently.   These figures were not available at the time we received writtenand oral evidence for this review and they indicate a somewhat lower level ofover-provision in those two years than did the earlier estimates.   The finalInland Revenue figures for expenses in the year 1977-78 and 1978-79 have bothbecome available since our last review (together with output figures for 1979-80).As compared with the estimates available last year, they show substantial increasesin the over-payments for those years (by over  1,100 in respect of expensesfor the two years taken together and by  850 in respect of output variance in1979-80).Op. cit (paragraph 63).54CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL136. The Health Departments share our concern at the size of over-paymentsin recent years.   They have expressed support for a mechanism to ensurethat over-payments and under-payments balance over a period of years: in theirview a reasonable balance can be said to have been maintained over the period1962-63 (when the DRSG was established) to 1976-77 as a whole, but they considerthat the over-payments of more recent years cannot be ignored.    The HealthDepartments have suggested, however, that the low level of increase in expensesin 1977-78 had been impossible to forecast when the provision was made; it nowappears that, to an unprecedented extent, GDPs restrained the level of theirexpenses (despite an inflation rate of around Ik per cent) in order to sustaintheir level of net income in the face of pay policy restraints.   The Study Group&apos;sdifficulties in 1978 had been compounded by the dispute between the partiesin the previous year over the adjustment to be made for expenses.   This hadresulted in the expenses provision for 1977-78 and for 1978-79 being determinedon a single occasion (mid-1978).   The Health Departments also suggested that anyfuture balancing arrangements should not require the DRSG deliberately to under-or over-estimate expenses and output: the Group, although well suited to operatingsophisticated forecasting techniques and to interpreting their results, wouldfind it difficult to adopt such &apos;aiming off; and negotiations within the DRSGover the fee scale were undesirable.   We were also asked not to seek to compensatefor over-payments by setting TANI at a lower level than we would otherwiserecommend, as this might lead to a cumulative decline in the level of expensesand income.   Finally, the Health Departments did not favour the Study Groupmaking supplementary revisions to the fee scale in the course of the year if itappeared that their estimates of expenses or output were proving seriously adrift.137. We also received the views of the British Dental Association (BDA), whoare equally anxious to ensure that the present pattern of over-payment doesnot recur.   They prefer to obtain a broad balance in the future through improvedforecasting methods and have drawn our attention to studies by the DRSG intothe relationship between the level of expenses in the current year and the levelof net income in the previous year; and between the level of output and changesm patient&apos;s charges.    We understand that the Group is also looking at otheraspects of its forecasting.   The BDA have asked us to regard the over-provisionfor expenses in 1977-78 and in 1978-79 as wholly exceptional and unavoidable,and subsequent over-provision as largely attributable to the difficulties facingthe DRSG in estimating expenses for those two years on a single occasion. Theyhave also pointed out that GDPs are independent contractors who have considerablediscretion in the short term allocation of gross fee income between expenses and55CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnet income; and that relatively minor variances between forecast and actualexpenses and output have a magnified effect on net income because TANI makesup less than half of target average gross income.138.   The Association agreed with the Health Departments that the DRSG shouldnot &apos;aim off  in making its estimates, and that we should not adjust TANI inthe light of past over- or under-payment.    They viewed the possibility of abalancing mechanism with some concern and stressed that if any such arrangementwas considered necessary, it should not seek to make adjustments in respect ofyears earlier than 198O-8I, given that the forecasts and estimates made since1977-78 had been agreed by the DRSG as a whole in the light of the best informationavailable, and that over-payments in the years 1976-77 to 1979-80 had occurred ina period when TANI was below its fully up to date level.   The Association suggestedthat forecast and actual output were in reasonable balance, recently as well asin the longer term; and that corrections for any differences between the twowere more likely to be restricted by any future pay policy than were correctionsfor expenses.   Corrections for output variances might be seen as penalising(or compensating) dentists for doing more (or less) work than could be reasonablyexpected at the beginning of the review year.   On these grounds, it was put to usthat any balancing arrangement should be concerned with practice expenses alone;and that it should incorporate safeguards to avoid both large swings in incomelevels from year to year and absolute reductions in fee levels.   The Associationreferred to a balancing arrangement suggested to the DRSG by the Health Departments,which proposed to limit the size of corrections for over- or under-payments to afixed proportion of the increase otherwise due in target average gross income; andagreed with the Health Departments&apos; proposal that expenses variances should onlybe corrected on the basis of final Inland Revenue figures which are not availableuntil three years after the year in which the differences occurred.    If a balancingmechanism were to be introduced, the Association suggested that it should be leftto the DRSG to decide whether adjustments ought to be limited to an agreedproportion of TANI, or whether a limit should be placed on the period in whichcorrections should be made; but that we should specify the basic characteristics f the arrangements, including the type and size of variances to be correctedand when the arrangements should begin to take effect.56CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL139. We also invited the Chairman of the DRSG (Mr S M Duncan) to give evidencethis year and we are grateful to him for doing so.   He has commented on thedifficulties facing the Study Group in making forecasts of expenses and output(not least because of the considerable delay before final figures on actualexpenses become available).   Mr Duncan emphasised that over the last few yearsthe Study Group had made considerable efforts to improve its forecastingtechniques.    He supported the introduction of balancing arrangements andasked us to specify their basic characteristics.140. We acknowledge the difficult task facing the DRSG and the continuingefforts made by the Chairman and the representatives of both the professionand the Departments to achieve greater accuracy.    It would be an advantageif ways could be found of reducing the sensitivity of over- or under-payments,in net terms, to differences between forecasts and actual results, and we invitethe Study Group to examine how this might be achieved.   A possibility in thelonger term might be to move to the direct reimbursement of certain expenses(such as rates and a proportion of salaries of supporting staff) instead ofreimbursing them almost entirely through fees as at present.   We believe, too, thatthere may be a case for increasing the independent element within the StudyGroup.141. We have given a great deal of thought to this matter and have taken carefulnote of the points put to us.    Despite signs of recent improvement in theDRSG&apos;s forecasting of expenses, we have come to the conclusion that we shouldtake positive action now in the interests both of the taxpayer and of preservingthe credibility of the remuneration system for GDPs.    In our Eighth Report, werecommended that the balancing mechanism then in force should be replaced bya system designed to ensure that there is no persistent tendency to under- orover-payment of GDPs taking one year with another.   On present evidence, thatobjective has not been adequately achieved.    We set out in the following paragraphsour recommendations for the introduction of balancing arrangements and ourproposals for the treatment of the over-payments in recent years.57CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALl\ K&gt; I ,-un: i ng    11  it11 1(&apos;;oiiumi I.ikZ. We recommend that the DRSG should now introduce a balancing arrangementwhich meets the following requirements:(i) The arrangement should compensate for over- or under-payments in net income per GDP resulting from differencesbetween actual and forecast expenses and output;(ii) The adjustments made in any one year in respect ofcumulative past imbalances should not exceed a fixed proportionof the increase in target average gross income which wouldotherwise result directly from our recommendations for TANI andthe DRSG&apos;s best estimates of expenses over the coming year.We invite the Study Group to agree what this proportion shouldbe, but suggest that 25 per cent would be a suitable maximum;(iii) The adjustment in respect of any particular year shouldbegin at the earliest opportunity and, subject to (ii) above,should as far as possible be achieved within a period of twoyears; the total adjustment necessary should in any event becompleted not later than three years from the year in which theover-payment or under-payment arose.   Accordingly each year(year 1) the DRSG should consider on the basis of the bestinformation then available how far the actual and intendednet income for the previous year (year 0) are likely to diverge,and make whatever adjustment appears to be prudent at thatstage to secure a correction within the limits of time and moneywe have indicated.   In year 2 a further adjustment should bemade to whatever extent is indicated by the more up to dateinformation that will have become available on the outturn foryear 0.   Finally, any residual adjustment, if material, foryear 0 should be made in year 3 when final figures on expenseswill be to hand;(iv) The balancing arrangement should come into operation thisyear and should be applied by the DRSG to the 1981-82 fee scale,and commence making corrections in respect of both 1979-80 and1980-81 (paragraph Ik?).58CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlkj&gt;. We recognise that both the Health Departments and the BDA would havepreferred arrangements which would begin to make corrections only in year 3,on the basis of the final figures, which only then become available, inrespect of any expenses variance occurring in year 0.   We accept that theestimates and provisional information which are available in year 1 and 2 maydiffer substantially from the final   figures on expenses in year 0. Nonethelesswe are firmly of the opinion that corrective action should begin as soon aspossible, both in the interests of the taxpayer and in order to avoid too largean adjustment building up over a number of years (particularly if the arrange-ments had to cope with successive large variances in the same direction). Wealso have in mind the number of new principals who enter general practice eachyear.   We believe the balancing arrangements should cover variances in bothexpenses and output.   The DRSG&apos;s estimates of output have in themselves producedsignificant variances in recent years; these cannot be regarded as due entirelyto personal effort, and we therefore  hold that corrections should be madeon their account by way of the balancing arrangements.144. We invite the DRSG to report to us the detailed arrangements to be introducthis year before the Study Group recommends the adjustments to be made to thisyear&apos;s fee scale.   We shall keep the working of the balancing arrangements underreview.Recovery of past over-payments14-5. We turn now to the question of taking account in our recommendations thisyear of past over-payments.    It would in our view be inappropriate to seek tocorrect for the over-payments which occurred before 1977-78.   We accept that areasonable balance can be held to have applied up to and including 1976-77  Thefee-scale adjustments for those years took place, moreover, before therecommendation in our Eighth Report on the desirability of a new approach tobalancing of under- or over-payments.146. The over-payments which occurred in 1977-78 and 1978-79 cannot be ignored.The overall variances are substantial (despite the DRSG&apos;s over-estimate of out-put in 1978-79): on the basis of the final Inland Revenue figures now availablewe calculate that the 1977-78 overpayment on average for each GDP was  1,120and in 1978-79 was  632 (14.0 per cent and 7.2 per cent respectively of TANI)- a total of almost  23^ million for GDPs as a whole.   These variances are.significantly greater than were indicated at the time of our last review59CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL(paragraph 135)  We accept, however, that special considerations affected the expensestimates for these years.    In addition, a sizeable number of dentists haveentered general practice since then.   For these reasons, it would not beappropriate to make adjustments for the whole of the variance in the twoyears.   We take the view, moreover, that any corrections in respect of 1977-78and 1978-79 should now be made as quickly as possible without placing apotentially excessive burden on the new balancing arrangements.   We thereforeintend to reflect the adjustment we consider necessary through the operationof TANI by recommending that no change should be made to its current leveluntil 1 October 1981 (paragraph 148).    We estimate that, through thisdeferment of TANI, some  10 million will be recovered of the overpaymentsthat occurred in 1977-78 and 1978-79.l47- Corrections for the combined output and expenses variances in 1979-80and I98O-8I should be achieved in full through the new balancing arrangements.The fee scales for both years were set well after publication of our 1978Eighth Report and were not affected directly by the special circumstances thatapplied to the previous two years.   We recommend that the DRSG should makeadjustments to the I98I-82 fee scale with a view to recovering in full thecombined over-payments of 1979-80 and 1980-81 not later than the end of 1983-84,in addition to any adjustments that may become necessary in respect of 1981-82and 1982-83.Target average net income148. For 1981-82, we recommend that the present level of TANI ( l4,675 a year)should continue in force for the present; with effect from 1 October 1981, werecommend that TANI should be increased to  16,000 a year.60CONFIDENTIAL

The recruitment of career grade community medicine staff has beenthe subject of a report by a Working Group on Recruitment, establishedjointly by the profession and the Health Departments.   It found that theoriginal 197^ establishment (some 7^0 posts) had never been filled andthat, even on the most optimistic assumptions, recruitment seemed likely toremain insufficient to fill this number of posts.   The profession told usof their concern at these findings, particularly in view of their beliefthat the work of community physicians (especially preventive work) is likelyto grow in importance in the future.   They acknowledged that a number offactors had adversely affected recruitment, including the poor &apos;image&apos; ofthe specialty in the eyes of many doctors and a lack of clarity over therole of community physicians; but suggested that remuneration levels alsoplayed a part.   The Departments were also concerned about recruitment andwere of the opinion that the restructured NHS was likely to provide sufficientposts for all current community physicians.150. We share some of the concerns of the profession and the Health Depart-ments over recruitment.   We note, however, that over the year to 30 SeptemberI980, the number of community medicine staff in England and Wales rose to858, while the number of trainees in community medicine increased from 128to ihl and six appointments were made at senior house officer level (paragraph159).   We shall keep watch on the situation in the light of NHS reorganisation,and will include it in our examination next year of manpower in the medicaland dental professions as a whole (paragraph hi).District Medical Officers151. When reorganisation takes effect, the area medical officer (AMO) gradewill be replaced by the district medical officer (DM0). Both the professionand the Health Departments asked us to recommend salaries (including chiefofficer supplements) for DMOs at the same level as those for AMOs. Wewere told that the present functions of the area health authorities willbe devolved to district levels, with little change in the number of officersat regional levelu   There are, however, a number of uncertainties as61CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALto tho work and responsibilities of DMOs, especially whether responsibilityfor settling and administering the contracts of senior hospital staff willrest at district or regional level.    In addition, the management structurein Wales and Scotland has yet to be decided finally.   Until the position isclearer, when we shall examine it again, we consider it appropriate to recommendremuneration for DMOs somewhat lower than that for AMOs.   Our recommendationsat Appendix A reflect this.   We understand that existing AMOs who areappointed as DMOs will, as appropriate, qualify for salary &apos;protection*.Pay relativities of community physicians152.    The argument has again been put to us that, because of theirequivalent status, community physicians should have broadly the same levelof total earnings in hospital consultants.   The fact that the career gradesin community medicine receive no additional payments for out of hours orother special duties was contrasted with the various sources of additionalearnings for hospital consultants, including the possible impact on earningsof the 1 January I98O contractual changes (especially the provision forwhole-timers to undertake a limited amount of private practice); and withthe relative gains made by the hospital training grades from their 1975contract.   We hold, however, to our view in the Tenth Report^&quot;, where weexplained why we regard parity of salary scales between community doctorsand hospital consultants as the appropriate means of recognising theirsimilar status; and why we believe it would be wrong to adjust the NHSremuneration of community physicians in order to reflect the fact thattheir whole-time clinical counterparts now have access to private practiceearnings (whose impact on total earnings has in any case yet to be seen andis likely to vary widely).Chief officer supplements153.

As we  reques Led,   the HealthDepartmental and  the profession have since discussed  the matter.    &apos;I&apos;hey havenot reached agreement.   In their evidence to us, the Departments pointedout  that one of the original   aims, of the award scheme was,  to provide theopportunity for doctors and dentists in the NHS to receive earningscomparable with the highest that can be achieved in other professions;and suggested that, without the present arrangements, certain communityphysicians would become the highest paid persons in the public sectorapart from a few of the nationalised industry chairmen.   The Joint EvidenceCommittee was divided on the matter.   The representatives of the communityphysicians argued that the two types of payments should be kept separatebecause supplements are intended to reward administrative responsibilitieswhereas   the awards  recognise   individual   distinction or merit;  and   that toend  the  present arrangement might help l;o  restore  the  total   pay relationshipbetween community physicians and hospital consultants,   in contrast, therepresentatives of the hospital career grades voiced strong objections inprinciple to administrative doctors receiving more pay than clinicalconsultants and could accept only that the present arrangements should beended with respect to RMOs.155*   In our view it remains illogical that the supplements should be offsetagainst distinction awards.   However, in view of the planned NHS reorganisationand of the uncertainties as to the future work and responsibilities ofcommunity physicians - and hence their appropriate pay levels - we do notrecommend any change in this area for the present.

They ouggnntedthat the resulting flat rate supplement for the community trainees wouldbe worth some 18 per cent of salary.   The second proposal was that thesalary scale for community trainees (which spans the hospital registrar andsenior registrar scales) should be enhanced in order to restore theadjustment   we made in 197  to the salary scales for the hospital traininggrades when equating thorn with the first HO hours of duty per week.

Finally, an inducementallowance to attract newcomers to the specialty was proposed.   It would PPly for a limited number of years (but covering the entire trainingperiod of all those recruited within those years) and would provide forappointment at a number of points above the scale minimum.   For their part,the Health Departments said they would welcome our general views on theproposal for a flat rate supplement to salary, so that they and theprofession could discuss it further.f,&apos;iCONFIDENTIAL

Our understanding is thatl.ho original  agreement provided  for those payrnonl.r,  l.o cover both col.aduties and evening meetings; indeed we endorsed this proposal in our EighthReport     We accordingly ask the Health Departments to bring this point tothe attention of the employing authorities.    We have not enhanced the trainees&apos; salary scale in the way proposed.This scale has always been equivalent to the combined registrar and soniorregistrar scales, in recognition of the fact that the hospital and communitytraining grades require broadly similar qualifications and are recruitedfrom the same &apos;pool&apos;.   We have, therefore, kept the community trainees&apos;scale in lino with our recommended scales for the hospital training grades(paragraph 75).   We explained in paragraph 8? why we do not generally .favour specific payments to attract doctors to particular specialties. Whilerecognising the recruitment difficulties which face community medicine, wesee no sufficient reason at present to depart from our view, particularlyhaving regard to the uncertainties arising from NHS reorganisation and thecontinued rise in the number of community trainees at registrar and seniorregistrar levels.Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Eighth Report,1978 - Cmnd. 7176, May I98O (paragraph 69).CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL159*   The Health Departments and the professions have agreed that there shouldbe appointments at senior house officer level in community medicine, as ameans of familiarising doctors at this level with the work of the specialty.It will be possible to combine such posts with continued work in clinicalmedicine.   We support this arrangement and agree that the salary scale forthe community medicine work should be the same as that paid to senior houseofficers in the hospital service.Emergency duty rota allowances160. We have been advised of an agreement under which the number of rotaduties qualifying specifically for the allowance has been extended from 2kto 72 per half year.   We were asked to recommend the level of payments forthe extended scale of duties.   The Health Departments told us that theywould have to consider deferring implementation of the agreement if ourrecommendations did not provide for any additional cost to be offset. Theyalso urged that there should be some tapering in the value of thepayments towards the top of the scale of duties, on the grounds that theprevious highest level of payment (for 2k or more duties per half year)included recognition of duties in excess of 2k.   The profession opposedtapering.    They pointed out that the allowances are not paid to establishedcommunity physicians who undertake the rota duties but only to those communityhealth staff who provide &apos;cover1. In their view,  this cover wasrequired only because of the large number of vacancies in communitymedicine; relatively high levels of payment for emergency rota duties woulddeter health authorities from using such cover as an alternative to ensuringproper staffing for the specialty.   They also argued we should have regardto the notional &apos;savings&apos; made by the employing authorities from communityphysician posts remaining vacant.161. Our recommendations for the extended scale of duties are in Appendix A.We do not on this occasion recommend that &apos;new money&apos;  should be madeavailable and our general recommendations have taken account of the extracost involved: the new agreement is unlikely to lead to any significant newor additional work for the profession.66CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCommunity health service staff162. The Health Departments have confirmed that there will continue tobe two career grades in the community health services,  &apos;broadly equivalent&apos;to the present clinical medical officer and senior clinical medical officergrades (CMOs and SCMOs).    The training requirements for the two grades arecurrently being reviewed and we understand that a training grade is tobe introduced at a level equivalent to senior house officer in the hospitalstructure.163. The Health Departments suggested we should bear in mind, inrecommending a salary scale for the existing grades of CMO and SCMO, thatthese officers have a fixed commitment for only 37 hours a week withno out of hours duties (other than when individuals contract for emergencyrota duties) or continuing responsibility for patients seen during normalhours of work.    We have considered these points, but see no reason atpresent to change the relative levels of the salary scales on their account.Community dental staff164. We understand that changes in the organisation of community dentistryas a result of NHS restructuring are likely to be delayed beyond those incommunity medicine,   and less uniform.   Many new district authoritiesmay   decide to share the services of the present area dental officers (ADOs)at present, the salaries paid to ADOs are based on population bandingsderived from the Census of Population (whereas the Registrar General&apos;smid-year estimates of population are to be used in the community medicinefield).    In the light of uncertainty about the effects of NHS reorganisationwe have been asked to maintain the existing pay relationships for thecommunity dentistry grades.    We were also told of an agreement which byApril 1984 will make progression from the first to the second incrementalpoint on the dental officers&apos;  scale subject to satisfactory completion ofthe required training.67CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL165. The profession suggested that ADOs in Scotland and Wales (wherethere are no regional health authorities) should receive a pay supplementin recognition of the additional responsibilities they carry over andabove those of ADOs in England.   A parallel was drawn with arrangementsin community medicine for paying such supplements to area medical officersin Scotland and Wales and it was suggested that ADOs in Scotland and Walesare involved closely with policy and planning work conducted by centralGovernment departments.    The Health Departments maintained however thatADOs in Scotland and Wales are no more directly involved in such work thantheir counterparts in England where there are no regional dental officers.We do not consider we should make a firm recommendation on the matter untilthe future organisation of community dentistry has been clarified. Wetherefore request the Departments and the profession to provide us in duecourse with full details of the effect in this area of the forthcomingrestructuring and of the resultant job descriptions for ADO posts (andtheir medical equivalents) in all three countries.68CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 8SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS166. We have described in Chapter 3 our general approach to recommendingthe remuneration of medical and dental professions which we judge to be appropriateat 1 April 198l.   Our main recommendations are as follows:Grade Point on       Recommended basic scalesscale 1 April 198I(excluding earnings fromadditional sources such asClass A/ii supplements) Hospital doctors and dentists -main grades (whole-time salaries)House officers                                                 minimum 5,890maximum 6,650Senior house officers                                   minimum 7,300maximum 8,300Registrars                                                      minimum 8,300maximum 11 &gt;, I 20Senior registrars                                            minimum 9,590maximum 12,240Consultants                                                       minimum 16,900maximum 21,660Community doctors and dentists -selected grades (whole-time salaries)Clinical medical officers                              minimum 8,980maximum 1?, f10Dental officers                                                minimum 8,&apos;,&apos;i0maximum 12,500Recommended net remuneration1 April 1981 General medical practitioners - intendedaverage net remuneration14,675(to increase to  .16,000per annum with effect from1 October I98I).69CONFIDENTIAL18,480(including average intendednet income from contraceptiveservices)General dental practitioners - targetaverage net income
CONFIDENTIAL167.   We estimate that our recommendations would, in a full year add some 121m or 9 per cent to the present level of expenditure on doctors&apos; anddentists&apos; remuneration.   This excludes provision for practice expenses andemployers&apos; superannuation and national insurance contributions. However,because of the deferred implementation date for the new level of targetaverage net income for general dental practitioners (paragraph 148), theeffect in 1981-82 will be to add some  112m or 8.3 per cent to the paybill.For major groups other than general dental practitioners, the increases inremuneration that result from our recommendations in the main range from8.1 per cent to $.k per cent.ROBERT CLARK, ChairmanR H GRAVESONPETER MENZIESP G MOOREANGELA RUMBOLDW K M SLIMMINGSG F THOMASONGRAHAM WILKINSOFFICE OF MANPOWER ECONOMICS15 April 198170CONFIDENTIAL

The analysis showed the effects of the recommendations2in the Ninth Report   that were subsequently implemented, and of the fully upto date levels of remuneration for doctors and dentists also indicated inthat Report, compared with a base date of April 1975 and with April 1978.A similar analysis is provided in the following table, which relates to April1980 and shows the effects of the recommendations put forward in the TenthReport compared with the same base date of April 1975 and with April 1979 The figures for movements in the earnings of comparable income groups arebased on the results of the New Earnings Survey for April 1980.2. For hospital and community doctors and dentists, the analysis is based onsalaries (plus distinction and meritorious service awards as appropriate) butincludes average income from the extra duty allowances, Class A/B salarysupplements and out-of-hours allowances paid as appropriate to hospital juniorstaff, medical assistants and assistant dental surgeons&apos;^ and trainees incommunity medicine.

CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX DREVIEW BODY ON DOCTORS&apos; AND DENTISTS&apos; REMUNERATIONEVALUATION .OF PENSION ARRANGEMENTSReport by the Government Actuary1. INTRODUCTION1.1 In its 1980 Report the Review Body stated that it hoped to base itsrecommendations in its 1981 Report on a more detailed examination of thevalue of the pension arrangements for doctors and dentists as part of afurther comparison between the total remuneration packages available to themedical and dental professions in the NHS and to others at comparable levelselsewhere.    (No full comparison of superannuation arrangements had been madesince 1975J     In this report to the Review Body an evaluation is made of thecurrent pension arrangements of the NHS, primarily as they would apply to threespecimen cases of male entrants to the two professions at the present time,who are assumed to become, eventually, a consultant with a C distinction award,a general medical practitioner and a general dental practitioner. Althoughonly three specific cases are considered, in the evaluation the wide rangein the number of years for which they and their widows might draw a pensionis taken into account and average values calculated.   In the final section ofthis report some remarks will be made about the value of the NHS pensions todoctors and dentists generally.1.2 The middle part of the report consists of a comparable evaluation of thepension arrangements of people employed outside the NHS but who have, likedoctors and dentists, earnings well above the national average, and who reachsenior positions in private industry and commerce, and the public services,particularly the civil service.    In making this evaluation I have made extensiveuse of the information collected in 1980 in my Sixth Survey of OccupationalPension Schemes     and my conclusions arising from the analysis of analogue2superannuation schemes for the 1980 Civil Service Pay Research process.In evaluating the pension arrangements of other schemes as compared with thoseapplicable to the three specimen NHS careers I have concentrated attention oncomparison with the hospital consultant&apos;s career, leaving a more generalcomparison to the final section of the report, which will also deal brieflywith careers in community medicine.1 Occupational Pension Schemes 1979   to be published by HMSO later in 1981  2 The 1980 Review of the Adjustment for Differences in Superannuation Benefits.Report by the Government Actuary.

In each case the doctor or dentist is assumed to beginhis NHS employment on his 25th birthday at the present time and to continueuntil his 65th birthday or earlier death or early retirement.    (It is assumedthat just over half of the retirements will be before age 65.)   All of the threeare assumed to be male and likely to be married.   The differing life spans andretirement ages and possible payment of widows&apos; pensions are dealt with in thenormal actuarial manner by quoting costs based on average rates.   Details ofthese rates are given in Annex 2.   Table 1 below gives the career earningspatterns, and details of the bases of the patterns chosen are given in Annex 3*like all amounts in  s in this report the remuneration shown relates to scalesin force in March 1981.Table 1 The specimen career patterns of annual averageremuneration by age group25-2930-3435-3940-4445-4950-5455-5960-64Hospitalconsultant 9,53712,63216,63719,87019,87021,28223,40023,400Generalmedicalpractitioner 9,50015,80017,00017,30017,60017,40017,00016,600Generaldentalpractitioner 15,00015,50016,00015,20014,30013,50012,00010,500Total careerremuneration 733,140 641,000 560,000Average *earnings         18,300 p.a.         16,000 p.a.     14,000 p.a.* Average whilst a practitioner (ages 30-64)  17,000 p.a.2.3   As the results of the calculations are to be applied to persons retiring inup to forty years time it is necessary not just to look at the immediate futurebut also far ahead.   For this purpose the experience of the immediate past93CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcannot be regarded ns a reliable guide.    In the first place I have assumedthat, over the long-term, the yields on investment (including capitalappreciation as well as interest) will on average exceed increnses in thegeneral level of earnings by 1 per cent per annum, and increases in pricesby 2&quot;g per cent per annum.    (Separate allowance is made for career increasesin earnings with increasing age and responsibility.)    I have ulso aaaumedthat the rate of increase in prices will average 7 per cent per annum.Taken together, these assumptions imply thai  the yield on investments willbe a little below 10 per cent per annum and that there will be an annua]increase in the general level of earnings of about 8J per cent per annum.They also imply on increase in real earnings of about 1-J per cent   year.Assumptions as regards prices are required to allow for the fact that althoughbenefits payable on retirement to the specimen doctors and dentists arclikely to be fairly closely reluted to increases in the general level ofearnings of all employees until that time, yet their pensions are adjustedthereafter only for price increases.   The results of a vuluntion on thisbasis are shown in Table 2 in the form of contribution rates, which are thepercentages of the values of the total career remuneration which are equalin value to the various benefits.   These rates, although sometimes describedas &apos;new-entrant&apos; contribution rates,are derived in such n manner that theyaverage the whole future career of an entrant, and are therefore applicablethroughout that career.    Reference is made in section 4 of this Report tothe effect on these contribution rutes of using different assumptions.Table Evaluation of the main benefits in specimen coses,in the form of the contribution rates required to provide themGeneral GeneralBenefit	Hospital consultant	medicaI practitioner	dental practitioner	%	%	%hump sum on denth in service	0.6	0.6	0.5hump sum on retirement	3-5	3.2	2.9Personal pension	12.9	11.5	10.4Widows&apos; pension	5-4	4.5	4.2Total scheme benefits	22.4	19.8	18.0.Discounted value of career remuneration	 501,000	 476,000	 435,00094CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3.     EVALUATION OF PENSION ARRANGEMENTS OUTSIDE NHS3.1 There is no major employer of doctors or dentists in this countryoutside the NHS, nor indeed are there any directly comparable non-medicaljobs.    I understand that insofar as the Review Body makes comparisonswith the outside world it does so by making comparison with people withcomparable earnings in the private sector and the public services generally.With the Review Body&apos;s agreement I have adopted a similar approach in thaiinstead of attempting to evaluate pension schemes of analogous employmentsI have considered the various types of arrangements which are commonlymade for people who reach positions with a level of remuneration comparableto doctors and dentists and have evaluated these arrangements as if theyapplied to doctors and dentists in the NHS.Private sector schemes3.2 The arrangements for private sector employees have in recent yearsbecome more uniform.   The great majority of salaried employees are membersof contracted-out schemes and most of them are accruing benefits relatedto one sixtieth of the final salary for each year of service, with theoption to commute part of it for a lump sum.    It is in the detail of theapplication of the sixtieths provision and in the death and ill-health benefitsthat there are significant differences between schemes.    However some employershave schemes, usually covering only the higher paid employees, which providefor a much faster rate of accrual.3.3 For schemes which cover employees comparable to doctors and dentists,lump sum death benefits in service usually range between two and fouryears&apos; salary.    Widow&apos;s pension is usually based on a fraction of either120ths or 90ths for each year of service and is calculated on a number ofyears of service v/hich lies between that actually accrued and the fullpotential service up to retirement age.    Information collected for my surveyof occupational pension schemes from over 800 companies representative of allprivate sector employers in the UK suggests that companies often take aconsistent line with the benefits payable by any one scheme in differentcircumstances all being near the bottom, middle or top of these ranges.For the purposes of comparison with doctors and dentists three schemes,called A, B and C, have been taken which typify this range of schemes inwhich the higher paid are found.    It is not possible to say what numbers ofthe relevant comparable employees are covered by each type or which coversthe most.95CONFIDENTIAL

The- first is that pensions from Schemea A, B and Cwould probably not be index linked, and the eecond concerns tranaferabilityon change of employment.97CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3.6   Lacking any evidence on the increases in pensions after award inthose schemes to which the higher paid belong as opposed to the generalityof large schemes,  for the purpose of illustration I have assumed, as I didfor the 1980 Review for the Civil Service Pay Research, that with priceincreases of 7 per cent a year protection against 62 per cent of priceincreases would be given on private sector pensions in excess of the guaranteedminimum pension.    On this basis contributions equivalent to the value of thebenefits are as shown in Table 4.    The contributions for the NHS hospitalconsultant are repeated for convenience.Table 4     Evaluation of the main benefits in private sector schemes,in the form of the contribution rates required to provide themBenefit	Scheme A	Scheme B	Scheme C	NHS	%	%	%	iLump sum on death in service	1.0	1.6	1.9	0.6Lump sum on retirement	3-4	3.5	3.6	3-5Personal pension	10.5	10.8	10.6	12.9Widows&apos; pension	5-2	5.7	5.5	5.4Total scheme benefits	20.1	21.6	21.6	22.4Changes of employment3-7   Most male doctors and dentists spend the whole of their careers in the NHS,but the higher-paid employees in industry and commerce rarely stay with thesame employer from age 25 to retirement.   Even if the doctor leaves the NHSand takes up other employment in the UK a transfer payment is likely to bemade, or at least a preserved pension which is protected against inflation is given:this is not likely to be so for comparable employees in the private sector.For the purposes of illustration I have assumed that in the non-NHS careersbeing compared there are changes of employment at ages 25, 30 and 45, and thaton the first occasion no pension rights are preserved but on the other twooccasions the accrued pension is preserved and increased at 3 per cent perannum, or a little more in order to be sufficient to meet the statutoryrequirements for uprating the guaranteed minimum pension.    The effect oflarge parts of the total pension income   being calculated on earningsearly in the career and without full index linking is to reduce the pension98CONFIDENTIAL

The values of the benefits are reduced to the equivalents ofcontributions ofScheme A ......... 13*4%Scheme B ......... 14.4%Conclusion of first stage of the evaluation3.8   The evaluation so far completed suggests that some comparable employeesin the private sector obtain benefits which are in praotioe worth conaiderahlyless than those of a consultant in the NHS and that only the best schemesprovide benefits approaching the value of those available in the NHS - andthese schemes are by no means available to all  those in the private sector withearnings comparable to those of doctors and dentists.   The great variationin the value of the schemes outside the NHS is widened when it is taken intoaccount that the schemes with the highest benefits are also usual].y RODcontributory.   Deducting the contribution rates paid by the employee fromthe contribution rates mentioned above gives effectively the net contributionrate of the employer, and this gives perhaps the best overall comparison ofthe value to the employee of the various schemes.     Rounding to the nearest^ per cent this process goes as follows:Total    Employee&apos;s Employer&apos;svalue     contribution contributionNHS, for hospital consultant ... 6% 16 %Scheme A ............... 13#6 33* 10%Scheme B ............... 14^% %Scheme C ............... 21^# - 21#*Eor Schemes A, U and C it is assumed that the employee has the same salaryprogression as the doctor in the NHS who becomes a hospital consultantwith a C award, i.e. the employees are exactly comparable.3-9   The results above may be put in another way.   The pension benefits in theNHS are worth  16.50 for every  116.50 of pay and pensions valued together,whilst in Scheme A employment they are only worth  10 for every  110 of payplus pension.   Therefore to obtain the same total puckage for the NHS personhis pay would have to be 5j per cent less than that of the Scheme A member( 110 being 5j per cent less than  116.50).   Similarly NHS pay would have to be4J per cent higher to give a total package of the name value as that of theScheme C member.   Although these comparisons have been made on the basis of thecareer pattern of a particular specimen hospital consultant a somewhat differentearnings pattern would little affect the relativities of the results for thefour schemes.99CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4.    EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS4.1     As any assessment relating to the very long term future is subject to agood deal of uncertainty, the Review Body is given in this section values onalternative bases which are consistent with the range of assumptions suggestedby the Scott Inquiry and explained in paragraph 128 of their Report. Thetwo extreme sets of assumptions used are shown as (a) and (b) in thefollowing tables:Basis BasisYield on investments to exceed increases:                          (a) (b)in the general level of earnings by ..                        - 1^% + 1^#in prices by ................                                                                        0# &apos;}%Rate of increase in prices..........                                                     7% 6%Pensions increases as a percentage ofthe cost of living increase ........ 7Z%The resulting assumed yields on investment are (a) 7%, (b) and tin- actualpensions increases assumed for Schemes A, B and C are (a) 3.6%, (b) 4.3%.Broadly speaking basis (a) can be said to represent a pessimistic view(as compared with the basis used so far in this report) on the possibilityof positive real returns on investments (where it represents a very stringentassumption indeed) and also a pessimistic view on the ability or willingnessof private sector schemes to protect pensions in payment against inflation;whilst basis (b) is rather more optimistic on both counts than assumed sofar.       It must be emphasised that these are average rates envisaged asapplicable in the very long term.   The effective alternative contributionrates paid by the employers (corresponding to those in the table in paragraph3.8) are shown for the two bases in Table 5, together with the discountedvalues of career remuneration to which they are applicable.   The figuresfor general practitioners should be compared with those in Table 2, butsubtracting from the Table 2 figures the 6 per cent contribution paid by thepractitioners.4.2     If the employee&apos;s own contribution is added back to those shown inTable 5 (giving, for instance 42 per cent and 20 per cent for the consultant)the figures indicate that the cost of benefits as a percentage of the valueof the remuneration varies by a factor of about two over this range ofassumptions.    It is however the relations between the percentage?; La each columnof Table 5 which are more relevant for the present purpose.    Judging by the100CONFIDENTIAL

It always falls below that of Scheme C except at the extreme ofbasis (a), when because of the shortfall in inflation proofing then assumedin the private sector the NHS scheme is of equal value.4.3 The NHS and Civil. Service .scheme.-; are almost identical, an explainedin Section 5 of this report and so it may be useful to point out that themain reason for the lower range of figures quoted by the Scott Inquiry(36 per cent and 17 per cent, in paragraph 131) as compared with 42 per centand 20 per cent here fia that the Civil Service calculations assumed a lesssteep salary progression with age.4.4 In the Scott Inquiry report     Brealey and Hodges suggested that theuncertainty of the inflation proofing in private sector pensions might bereflected by making a valuation at a higher rate of discount (of the orderof one half per cent higher) in addition to the making of a reduction in thevalues for the expected level of inflation proofing.    In the limited timesince the publication of the report it has not been possible to assess properlythe desirability of including this allowance for uncertainty; however,the effect on the Scheme A, B and C contribution rates (as shown in Table 4of this report) of a half per cent extra discounting of the pension benefits(other than the guaranteed minimum pension) would be to reduce the rates byabout 0.7%,i.e. by about one-thirtieth, but I must leave it to the ReviewBody to decide how much weight to put on this factor.1    Paragraph 111 and Appendix 7,  paragraph 13101CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5.      COMPARISON WITH PUBLIC SECTOR SCHEMESCivil Service Scheme5.1 I understand that it has been suggested that the NHS scheme issignificantly less valuable than the non-industrial civil service scheme.As regards the benefits for salaried employments this would appear not to be soin that persons with identical salaries obtain identical benefits in bothschemes (except for certain short-service benefits for the first five yearsof membership) but on the other hand while NHS employees contribute 6 per centof that salary, male civil servants only contribute 1-J per cent. Thisdifference is reversed however if, as found by the Scott Inquiry(paragraph 76), it is accepted that effectively Civil Servants pay fortheir pensions an amount equal to 7*9 per cent of their gross pay (as itwould be if no adjustment were made for the value of their pensions) whilstfor NHS employees the 6 per cent is regarded as their complete contribution.If this is so then when two employees are compared, in the NHS and the CivilService respectively, who have total remuneration packages of equal value, thenthe NHS employee will obtain rather more of the total package in the form ofpension benefits and less in the form of pay in service than the civil servant.In this sense the NHS pension benefits are better than those of the CivilService.   The difference is, however, very small: only a half of one percent more of the total value of the package is in the form of pensionbenefits in the NHS as compared with the Civil Service.Other schemes5.2 Other public service schemes, such as those for teachers and otherlocal government employees also differ little from the NHS scheme. Elsewherein the public sector, for instance in the nationalized industries, there is alittle more variety in the benefits provided and particularly in the contributionscharged, but broadly speaking, because of the high degree of protectionagainst inflation generally provided after award of pensions and thetransferability arrangements whilst in service,the values to comparableemployees in the public sector can be regarded as broadly the 6ame as in the^NHS scheme.102CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSIONS APPLICABLE TO DOCTORS AND DENTISTS GENERALLYEvaluation of pension benefits of hospital and community medical staff6.1 Up to this point consideration has only been given to one specimencareer of a doctor who becomes a consultant in the hospital service andwho at age 53 obtains a C Distinction and Meritorious Service Awardand whose salary is therefore at the rate of  23,400 from then onwards(on March 1981 pay levels).    The discounted value of the pension schemebenefits has been calculated as 22-j per cent of the discounted valueof his career remuneration according to the assumptions made, of which 6per cent is contributed by the employee.   As doctors generally starttheir careers at about the same salary level and differences only occurgradually during their careers, and also the pension benefits are relatedto their final salary, it is the doctors who have the highest final salariesthat have the highest pensions in relation to their total career earnings.For a doctor who expects to reach, say,  33,210 by retirement with anA-award, benefits could be put at 30 per cent rather than 22-jJ- per centand for the doctor who expects to reach only  20,000 by age 55 the figurewould be about 20 per cent.    I understand that the latter might well be anappropriate assumption for a doctor entering a full-time community medicinecareer at the present time, or for a consultant if no supplement or awardis to be included.Evaluation of pension benefits for general practitioners6.2 Because the pensions of general practitioners depend not on theirfinal salary but on an augmented fraction of 1.4 per cent of remunerationwhilst practitioners, there is a close relationship between contributionspaid and benefits received, which produces benefits which are worth 20per cent of the value of the career remuneration for a doctor who becomes apractitioner at age 30 and 18 per cent for a dentist starting practice atage 25 (as shown in Table 2), of which 6 per cent is contributed by thepractitioner.    The exact age at which a doctor becomes a practitioner hassome effect on the 20 per cent figure but the precise remuneration thereafteras a practitioner has little effect.    The doctor&apos;s values are higher thanthose for the dentist because in the doctor&apos;s case the lower pay in theyears whilst in hospital service ranks for contributions whilst thecorresponding benefits are based on remuneration as a practitioner.103CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALComparison with other employed persons6.3 From the figures given in Section 3 of this report it is apparent thatat the present time the value of the benefits to a man joining a pension schemein the private sector at age 25 is exceedingly uncertain, it being highlydependent on his future movement from one employer to another (owing to theloss on movement between jobs and the variety of schemes which might beapplicable to his final appointment) and on the extent that his pensiononce granted will be protected against inflation.   However, in the privatesector if he should die early his dependents would probably receive a higherlump sum benefit and, in the early years, also a higher widow&apos;s pensionthan in the NHS.   The exact conditions under which a doctor might continueto be employed beyond age 60 in the NHS (as many are at present) or retirebefore the normal retirement age of 65 in outside employment (as many senioremployees do at the present time even if not in ill-health) is highly conjecturaland so all the calculations in this report have been made on the assumptionthat the same pattern of retirement would apply to both sectors of employmentin 40 years&apos; time.Evaluation for those now in mid-career6.4 In the case of a male NHS doctor or dentist it is reasonable toassume that when he retires he will have spent all of his career in the NHSand so the question of the proper contribution for pensions for those whoenter employment in middle age hardly arises.   Nevertheless it is perhapsreasonable to compare the pension prospects of doctors in the NHS now atmid-career with men in other professions also at mid-career.   Broadly speakingthe situation is that pensions provision in the private sector has remainedunchanged as regards qualifications for membership since the 1960s or earlierand thus there is nothing in the consideration given above to a current newentrant which would not apply to an entrant in 1960.   For instance*becauseof the accelerated maturity provisions of the Social Security Pensions Act1975,both have a full protected guaranteed minimum pension.    (This is not sofor those now over 50-)104CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL9Evaluation for women6-5   No detailed calculations have been made for women doctors and dentists,largely because of the varied courses taken by their careers, but twoimportant factors are that  1000 a year of pension to a woman costsconsiderably more than the same pension to a man of the same age becauseof her relative longevity, whilst on the other hand neither the NHS nor mostprivate sector schemes provide for automatic pensions for widowers, and theeffects of these two factors when evaluated tend to balance one another.However, it is probably true that the public service pension arrangementsfor indexation of preserved pensions, and the special mode of calculationof general practitioners&apos; pensions are particularly valuable for women doctorswith their high propensity for breaks in employment.6.6   This report is an attempt to make a detailed comparative evaluation ofNHS pension arrangements for doctors and dentists, comparing with arrangementsmade for those with similar earnings from employment in other walks of life.The findings are, in brief, that for general dental practitioners the NHSscheme is worth about 12 per cent of their career remuneration, for generalmedical practitioners it is worth about 14 per cent and for hospital andcommunity medicine doctors it depends on the level of remuneration atretirement, being worth about 16J per cent for hospital consultants with aC-award.    For many private sector schemes the values would be of the orderof 6-J per cent less than this (depending partly on the member&apos;s owncontribution rate) but some senior employees, mostly at the earnings level ofthe more highly paid doctors and dentists, are in special schemes which areworth round about 5 per cent of remuneration more than the NHS scheme.Public sector schemes generally provide benefits of much the same value as theNHS.    These assessments are subject to some uncertainty as regards the basisfor the calculations and for this reason the Review Body is offered in section kabove some information about the effect of different assumptions.SummaryGovernment Actuary&apos;s26 March 1981Department105CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEX 1The National Health Service Superannuation ^S_cJiejne_MjAJjijprovisiong^as^they apply to current service asdoctors and dentists,1. The scheme is operated by means of Regulations made under the NationalHealth Service Act 1946.    All full time and some part time hospital andcommunity medical and dental staff (&quot;officers&quot;) are members of the scheme,as are almost all medical and dental practitioners at least up to the age of65.   The scheme is contracted out of the additional component of the statepension scheme.2. Superannuable remuneration, on which a contribution of 6 per cent ischarged, consists of the officer&apos;s pay including certain allowances, or thepayments made to a practitioner for NHS practitioner services   less a deductionfor practice expenses and the pay approved for any assistant practitioner.(Practitioners in partnership may choose to have their superannuable paydivided between them according to their share of the partnership profits.)The superannuable pay of dental practitioners is limited to  21,000.3. Benefits on retirement at or over 60.   For officers a pension ofone-eightieth of final pay times the length of service on which contributionshave been paid in years and final pay is the superannuable pay in the bestyear of the last three years of service.   For practitioners the superannuablepay is uprated year by year by reference to the reports of the Review Body in orderto take account of the effects of inflation, and pensions are calculated on 1.4per cent of this uprated pay, and increased for any period of up to 10 years&apos;hospital service.     In both cases there is a lump sum of three times theamount of the pension.4. Benefits on ill-health retirement after at least 5 years&apos; service.Immediate benefits calculated as for age retirement but with service enhanced asfollows:(i)    if it is less than 10 years, to double its length;(ii)    if it is 10 years or more, to the better of(a) 20 years(b) actual service plus 6f years.However, enhanced service under (i) or (ii) (a) may not exceed potential serviceto age 65, and under (ii) (b) may not exceed potential service to age 60.106CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5# Benefits on withdrawal.    If service is under 5 years contributionscan be returned less the employee&apos;s share of the contributions equivalentpremium in respect of being contracted out.    If service is over 5 years,a preserved pension and lump sum is calculated as in paragraph 3 above and comesinto payment at   age 60.    In all cases, a transfer value may be paid under thepublic sector transfer arrangements to the new employer&apos;s scheme (whether thatscheme is a public sector scheme or a private sector one).6. Benefits on death in service.    A lump sum of the greater of one year&apos;sremuneration or the lump sum that would have been payable on ill-health retirement(see paragraph k above).7. Widows and children&apos;s benefits.    A widow&apos;s benefit is payable at therate of one-half of the husband&apos;s pension   if he dies after retirement, orone-half of the pension he would have received on ill-health retirement if hedies in service.   A widow&apos;s benefit is at a higher rate for the first threemonths of payment (and this short term pension is also paid in the event ofthe husband&apos;s death in service with less than 5 years&apos; service) and thereare additions of one-half of the widow&apos;s pension in respect of each dependentchild (for up to two children).   Widows&apos; pensions cease on remarriagebefore age 60.8. There are other provisions of the scheme for premature retirement incertain circumstances and injury benefits.   There is also optionally availableto the member, at no cost to the scheme, allocation of pension in favour of aspouse or dependant and purchase at full cost of added years of service.9-        Pensions under the scheme are protected against price inflation afterretirement under the Pensions (Increase) Acts except for the guaranteedminimum pension under the contracting-out arrangements, increases on which arepaid with the state pension.    (For the specimen cases considered in thisreport the guaranteed minimum pension is assumed to accrue at the rate of S,kkper annum, before revaluation, for nearly the whole of the careers.)107CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALANNEX kThe three private sector schemes used for comparison1 ,       Scheme A is a scheme which covers nearly all of the employees,including directors, of a company A (though there are many companieswith schemes almost identical to it).    The main benefit is 8 pensionof l/60th of final salary (which is calculated as the best twelvemonths earnings in the last three years of service) for each ofservice.    On early retirement owing to ill-health the benefit isbased on the accrued service.    Of these pensions up to 3/80th ofpay at retirement for each year of service may be token as a lumpsum and the pension appropriately reduced - if retirement is at age65 the pension is reduced by a ninth of the lump sum.    Thus inpractice the pension and lump sum at age 65 is the same as in theNHS scheme.   There is a lump sum on death in service which unlikethe NHS one does not depend on service but is always equal to two years&apos;earnings.   The widows&apos; pension is calculated as half the pension whichwould have been paid at retirement - before any surrender of pensionfor lump sum, and this is also applicable on death after retirement.The scheme is contracted out.2,        Scheme B covers all the staff employees of company B (again there aremany companies with almost identical schemes).    Both the normal-ageretirement pension and the widows   pension are as in Scheme A, but based,as in the NHS, on earnings in the final twelve months of employment.The ill-health pension is larger than that in Scheme A, being based onthe accrued service and half of the remaining period which would havebeen served if he had not retired before age 65.    (This is a largerbenefit than payable in the NHS scheme).     The lump sum on death inservice is equal to three years earnings and the contributions paid(which amount to 5 per cent of earnings) are returned.   The schemeis contracted out.3 ,       Scheme C covers only the senior executives of company C which are ineffect the 2%% of the   employees with the highest pay.    (Most of thestaff and works employees are covered by other schemes.)  When staffare promoted to the salary level which qualifies Scheme G benefits theyleave the staff scheme and the whole of the service with the companycounts for scheme C.   The benefits are nearer than in Schemes A and Bto the maxima allowed by the Inland Revenue to be paid from an approved110CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpension fund.   Provided that not less than 20 years servicehave been completed at age 65 the pension is two-thirds offinal salary (which is taken as the salary at the previous1 April), less any accrued pension rights from previous employments,and it is in proportion on earlier retirement,   The benefits ondeath in service are a lump sum of four years&apos; salary and a widow&apos;spension of two-thirds of the member&apos;s pension, ie. four-ninthsof his salary.    On ill-health retirement the full pension is paidof two-thirds of the member&apos;s salary in the last twelve monthsof service - this benefit comes partly from a separate disabilityscheme.   The scheme is contracted out.IllCONFIDENTIAL
