CONFIDENTIALs DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 22 COPY NO6 May 1981CABINETSILEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 19fl-82Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Homo Department1. The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QL) haveconsidered the proposals made by Departments for Bills in ne:ct Session&apos;slegislative programme.    This memorandum seeks the agreement of tl eCabinet to the Committee&apos;s recommendations.     My separate memorandum(C(81) 23) gives letails of the Bills listed in Annexes to this memorandum.2. In planning the programme for our first two S  ssions wo took an undulyoptimistic view of the legislative capacity of Parliament and espo&lt; tally ol theHouse of Lords.     We had considerable difficulty in securing our programmein the 1979-80 Session in spite of a long spillover in the autumn of last year.The present Session therefore started late and at least two major Bills willhave to be dealt with in a spillover in the Lords in October, even though wehave dropped four Bills from the programme originally agreed by tin Cabinetfor this Session.     Against that background QL Committee&apos;s aim was topropose a programme for the 1981-82 Session which could be fitted into thetime available with the verv minimum spillover - preferably none at all - inthe autumn of 1982.    We concluded that we must aim for a main programme olabout 20 Bills.    (This figure excludes Finance, Consolidation and ScottishGrand Committee Bills and Bills for inclusion only if they prove suitable forSecond Reading Committee procedure in the Commons.     It also excludescontingent Bills and allows a very limited scope for unforeseen demands. )3. After careful consideration, the Committee decided to recommend 22of the 50 Bills out forward for possible inclusion in the main programme.They are listed in Annex A.     Seven were accepted as essential for enactmentnext Session (in all but one case for financial reasons).    In planning abalanced programme we have taken account of a number of relevantconsiderations.     We have tried to give priority to Bills dropped from theagreed 1980-81 programme or earmarked for 1981-82 when that programmewas being compiled.     We need a reasonable stock of Bills suitable for earlyintroduction in the House of Loids.     We have tried to take account of thetimetable envisaged for the preparation of Bills by Departments, givingpreference to those where policy work is well advanced.     Subject to theae con-siderations, we have aimed to forward our wider economic policies whilegiving some social policy content to the programme.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. Annex B lists five contingent Bills,  conic of which may have to bointroduced.    The uncertainties about the Canada Bill cannot bo resolved untilthe Canadian Supreme Court gives its expected ruling at the end of May.5. Annex C lists eight Bills which we recommend should be included in theprogramme on the undirstanding that they will not proceed unlessLegislation Committee agrees, when they come forward, chat they are primafacie suitable for Second Reading Committee procedure in the Commons.Some modeot but useful measures can bo included on thai basis.6. Wo judged that all the Bills put forward for next Session by theScottish Office should be suitable for Scottish Grand Committee in the House ofCommons.     The main factor governing the number of Bills listed in Annex Dhas therefore been the potential demand on the time of the House ol Lords.The list in Annex D has been agreed be; ween the Lord President of theCouncil, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Lord Advo&lt; ate.7. As I indicated in paragraph 3, we had to reject many of the Bills petforward by Departments.     In some cases colleagues accepted, alter discussionand correspondence, that particular Bills could not find a place next .Session.The Cabinet should know, however, that the Ministers concerned pressed QLCommittee to include the Bills listed in Annex E.     There was a good deal ofsympathy for some of these proposals, but QL Committee were clear thatthere should be no net increase in the number of Bills in the programme anddid not feel able to substitute any of the Bills in Annex E for the 11 e1recommended in Annex A.     The Cabinet should also know that scenecolleagues envisaged the need for major Bills on Competition Policy, LocalGovernment Finance and Trade Union Law.     Jn none of these cases, however,is the policy yet decided and ao concrete proposal., were put forward to us.8. Past experience has revealed a consistent tendency for Departments tounderestimate tho time needed for obtaining policy clearam e,  for convertingsuch outline approval into detailed instructions to Parliamentary Counsel, andfor Counsel to draft the Bill.     Taking account of the holiday season, it isunrealistic to expect that instructions not delivered until the end of July canresult in a major Bill being ready for introduction at the start of the Session.9. Where we have recommended a Bill for inclusion in the programme itis on the basis of the timings given for it in C(81) 23.     It is essential to theproper management of the programme that Departments should adh&lt; re to thesetimetables.     The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Paymaster ..General should be told immediately of any significant variation so thai, he c anconsider the effect on the programme as a whole.     Where the preparation an,Iintroduction of a Bill is seriously delayed for any reason, LegislationCommittee may have to consider whether it should remain in the programme.2CONFIDENTIAL

Note the contingent Bills listed in Annex B and agree that theyshould be brought forward if necessary.c.
