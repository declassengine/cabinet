ANNEX ARHODESIAN negotiations the PRINCIPLES AND THE CONSTITUTION1. At the last attempt to settle the Rhodesian problem onHMS Fearless our negotiators had the advantage that there werein existence in Rhodesia multi-racial electoral rolls and provisions which would eventually lead to majority rule.2.        We have had to start from Mr Smithes 1969 Constitution wherethe rolls are separate; Europeans, Coloured and Asians on one roll,Africans on the other, and progress beyond parity of representationof the two groups is specifically excluded.3. The most important of the five principles involved in a settlement is that of &quot;unimpeded progress to majority rule&quot;.    The problem beinghow to bring the 1969 Constitution into line with this concept.    Mycolleagues will see from the proposals in Annex B that we have followedthree lines of progress to parity of representation and beyond?i. Blocking Parliamentary mechanisms which will preventretrogressive action in respect of African representation inParliament.ii. The regular addition of Africans to Parliament, somedirectly elected and others indirectly elected, with a referendumat parity to see whether the Africans then desire all their Membersof Parliament to be directly elected (see Annex D for a detaileddescription).iii. The creation of a number of multi-racial Parliamentaryseats following parity - six, eight or ten.4. These proposals have involved two big changes in Mr smith position which will have to be included in the legislation which he will need to pass through his Parliament.    He has agreed first to scrap his present income tax regulator for African representation which adds upthe total income tax paid by the Africans and relates it to the total incometax paid by the Europeans, in favour of a regulator which makes theincrease of African seats dependent on the proportion of Africans toEuropeans possessing an individual qualification based on income,property and education.    The income tax regulator was totally indefensibleand is well out of the way.    Secondly he has conceded a readiness to movebeyond parity to the creation of seats on a multi-racial basis which wouldgive the Africans the opportunity to elect a majority of the members of theHouse of Assembly.1
5. He wants a Commission at parity to advise whether or not this isthe best way to proceed and to make recommendations, but unless he can get a two-thirds majority for another proposal, which would involve 1? outof 50 Africans voting for it, then the present proposals set out in Annex Bapply,    Mr Smith has offered six such seats.    I will propose ten but would in the last resort accept eight.    Our difficulty is that on an individual income qualification of  700 (R$l, 200), on which Mr Smithinsists, parity will take a long time; but Mr Wilson at the time ofHMS Fearless held that it was impossible to quantify a period whichdepended on African registration, the pace of industrial advance andthe educational prowess of Africans, and I feel sure we can without too much difficulty take the same line and hold it.    The level of the franchiseis a point I shall continue to press but may have to concede in the finalpackage.THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS (ANNEXES C AND F)6, There is an important, and indeed it could be a crucial, point inrelation to Principle 4, which involves &quot;progress towards ending racial discrimination&quot;.7. Mr Smith has agreed, and this is a great gain, to a Declarationof Rights which is justiciable.8. The main point at issue is this.    The Rhodesians wish specifically to exclude &quot;Education&quot; and &quot;Land&quot; from provisions under which any future legislation which increases discrimination could be challengedin the courts.9. They argue that in Rhodesian conditions where so much isprimitive, separate education systems and land reservations are justified and that to include these two fields would lead to vexatiousaction both for Government and judges.10.        The Solicitor General considered that it would be impossibleto defend these Rhodesian proposals in terms of the Fourth Principleor to defend any version of them which specifically mentioned education and land as fields where additional discrimination might be permitted,11,        I agree, but it ought to be possible to find a form of words in theDeclaration of Rights which would give the courts sufficient guidance whilemeeting Mr Smiths genuine anxieties.    The trouble is that the rhodesian government would probably like to increase discrimination if it could.This therefore is an important matter and will be considered to be soby the minority of Conservatives who must be attracted into the lobbyon a vote.
12.       As regards existing legislation the position is somewhat better.The Rhodesians have agreed to the appointment of an independentcommission which would consider existing legislation with particular reference to education and the Land Tenure Act, and make recommendations to the Rhodesian Government on ways of making progress towards endingracial discrimination.    But the Rhodesian Government would be bound onlyto have &quot;serious regard&quot; to the commission^ findings.    This is therefore a bonus, but it is not binding.LAND TENURE (SEE ANNEX E)13.       A further important point in relation to the Fourth Principleconcerns land.    Any steps in this field which will reduce discrimination,whether by halting evictions under the Land Tenure Act, or by an allocation of additional land to Africans (under the Land Tenure Act,land is divided equally between Africans and Europeans) will be of greatimportance, particularly to some Conservative members, when we cometo defend an agreement.    We must make some progress on these matters before we will be in a position to defend an agreement adequately,THE TEST OF ACCEPTABILITY14.        The machinery for the Test of Acceptability is agreed and satisfactory.DEBT AND FINANCIAL HELP15, I will try and get Mr Smith to accept that the Rhodesians must accept liability subject to the negotiation of agreements to make these payments bearable.16,        There are some other points outstanding of rather less importance on which I hope to pick up some concessions (see Annexes E and F),OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING A SETTLEMENT17.       So far as the constitutional position is concerned we do not need the support or agreement of anyone else in reaching a settlement withMr Smith.    This is a matter for Parliament.    The international position,however, requires that a settlement receives some support.    We can, ofcourse, use the veto in the United Nations to avoid the passage of any resolution reaffirming sanctions.    But unless we can obtain substantialsupport for the settlement we are not likely to find support for the thesisthat the settlement itself has produced a new situation in which the existingSanctions Resolutions would cease to have validity.    A substantial degreeof international support for this thesis will be important since we wouldhave to rely on it in arguing that our abandonment of sanctions is, as amatter of law, consistent with the United Nations Charter.   The strength
in law of our arguments that the threat to the peace and consequently the sanctions Resolutions have lapsed as a result of the new situation, willlargely depend on our being able to show convincingly that the rebellionhas been brought to an end, as enjoined on us by Security CouncilResolutions, consequent upon a settlement consistent with the five principles, particularly as regards unimpeded progress to majority rule, progress towards ending racial discrimination, and acceptabilityto the people of Rhodesia.    It should be borne in mind that we could not prevent the General Assembly from seeking an advisory opinion from theInternational Court of Justice on the legal issues.    The veto might beavailable to defeat a similar proposal for this purpose in the security council though this is a point on which different views are held.Morover, on the basis of the terms of acceptance of the compulsoryjurisdiction of the Court by ourselves and certain other countries,including African countries, the possibility of such other countriesinstituting contentious proceedings against us before the Court cannotbe excluded.    Since for eight years now successive British governments have insisted mat they would settle only on the basis of the Five Principles,it is therefore a matter of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments generalcredibility and honour that a settlement should genuinely be demonstrablyconsistent with the Five Principles.    We would have a good hope ofsecuring support in the United Nations - and even some tacit acquiescence in Africa - for such a settlement.    It is undeniable that under our proposals the Africans will be far better off than they would be ifthey had to go on with the present system.CONCLUSION18.       As things now are, we still need further concessions fromMr Smith as regards the number of Common Roll seats and moreparticularly on land and an acceptable justiciable Declaration of Rights,before we have a completely defensible settlement.THE NEXT MOVE19.        There is a risk in going to see Mr Smith now but I do not think thatthere is more progress to be made by emissaries or by correspondence.I would therefore, subject to the views of my colleagues, prepare to go to salisbury shortly after the Sanctions Order has been put through the House.If we could clear a formula on the Declaration of Rights and could get anincreased allocation of land to the Africans it would be of great advantage if I could have the authority of the Cabinet to initial an agreement on the spot.    It would not be made public until I had reported to Parliament.4 November 1971
secret annex BSECRETPROPOSALS FOR A SETTLEMENTI.   THE TEST OF ACCEPTABILITYThe proposals set out below are conditional upon the BritishGovernment being satisfied that they are acceptable to the peopleOf Rhodesia as a whole.   The British Government will thereforeappoint a Commission to ascertain directly from all sections ofthe population of Rhodesia their views on the acceptability of theproposals and to report thereon to the British Government.   It will consist of a Chairman, Deputy chairman and a number of other members.It is envisaged that, in general, the Chairman and the deputy chairmen will visit the main centres of population and the othermembers will visit councils in the rural areas and traditionalmeeting places in the Tribal Trust Lands.In the period before and during the test of acceptabilitynormal political activities will be permitted, provided they areconducted in a peaceful and democratic manner.   Rcdio and televisiontime will be made available to political parties represented in theHouse of Assembly.The Commission will hear evidence in public or in private asit deems appropriate.   There will be immunity for witnesses heard by the Commission in respect of their evidence and freedom for persons resident in Rhodesia, whatever their political views oraffiliations, to enable them to appear before the Commission.   AllRhodesian Government employees will be permitted to give evidence to the Commission.   Persons in detention or under restriction willbe allowed to express their views to the Commission.   arrangements will be made in London and elsewhere as necessary for Rhodes!anaresident abroad to submit their views, to the Commission.The Rhodesian Government will provide the Commission withsuch assistance as may reasonably be required to enable them tocarry out their functions.
Z 535II. THE constitution the Constitution of Rhodesia will be the Constitutionodopted in Rhodesia in 1969 modified in the following respects.The Rhodesian Government will introduce legislation to moke theneoessory modifications in the Constitution and related electorallegislation with off eat from the date on whioh independence isconferred by the British Parliament.(l)   The House of Assembly. (a)   The existing provisions governing the increaseof African representation in the House and providing that there shall be no further inorease when thenumber of African members equals the number ofEuropean members will be repealed.(b) A new roll of African voters (the African higherroll) will be created with the same qualificationsas those for the roll of European voters   save that...............J    The relevant means and educationalqualifications are set out in Appendix I.(c) -Additional African seats will be created, inaccordance with the following arrangement, with effect from the dissolution of Parliament following the date on which it is established that any such seats are due.  However, the first  l/k-J additional seatswill be created as soon as it is established that theyare due^j?(d) When the number of voters registered on the Africanhigher roll equals &amp;?o of the number of voters thenregistered on the European roll, two additional Africanseats will become due;   when the number of votersregistered on the African higher roll equals 12$ ofthe number of voters then registered on the Europeanroll, a further two tdditional African seats willbecome due;   further additional African seats willbecome due, two at a time, for each such proportionateinorease of 6% in the number of voters registered onthe African higher roll, until 34 additional Africanseats have been created, thus resulting in parity in
secret-the numb or a of African and European members in theHouse of Assembly.   This arrangomant will ensure thatat parity there ore approximately equal numbers of voters on the African higher and European rolls.(e) The first two edditional African seats will be filled by direct election for single-member constitu-encies by the voters registered on the African higherroll and the next two will be filled by indirectelection by electoral colleges on the same basis asthe existing eight African seats filled by indirectelection.   This sequence will be repeated in relationto subsequent additional African seats./J&quot;as a temporary arrangement pending the firstdissolution of Parliament after their creation, oneof the first two seats to be filled by indirecteleotion will be filled by eleotion by the fourelectoral oollegeB in Mashonaland and the other byelection by the four electoral colleges in Matabelelond^(f) Per the purpose of giving effect to the abovearrangement the Registrar-General of Voters willreview the number of voters registered on the Africanhigher roll and the European roll at not more than six monthly intervals, and whenever additional Africanseats have become due he will issue a certificate tothat effect to the President and the President will then be required to make an order providing for thecreation of those seats as described above.(g) The qualifications for the existing roll of african voters (the african lower roll) will be replaced by qualifications equivalent to those for the &apos;B&apos; rollunder the 19ol Constitution, subject to the financialqualifications being increased twice by 10 per cent.The relevant means and educational qualifications are set out in Appendix II.(h) Witiiin one year after the holding of the generaleleotion at which parity is attained a referendum willbe hold among all enrolled African voters to determine whether or not the seats filled by indirect eleotionshould be abolished and replaced by an equal numberof seats filled by direct eleotion.
Tho new seats would all be African higher Roll seats unless the Legislature has before the referendumprovided for up to one quartox- or the new seats tobe African lower roll seats.   Tho Legislature could also provide that a specific number of the extra seatsshould bo rural, as opposed to urban, constituencies.Laws providing for any of the matters mentionedin this paragraph, including the procedural arrangementsfor the holding of. the referendum, would not hove to be passed in accordance with the requirements for amending the Constitution;   the only special requirement wouldbe that in the House of Assembly they must be approvedby a majority of all the African members.If the majority of voters at the referendum isin favour of the abolition of the indirectly electedseats, on election to give effect to the change willbe held within one year thereafter.   It will be possiblefor on election to be held for this purpose withoutthe dissolution of Parliament.   If this course is adopted the indirectly elected African members and the Africanhigher roll members and also, if the number of Africanlower roll seats is to be increased, the African lowerroll members, will vacate their soats on the dateappointed for the nomination of candidates in theelection and Parliament will be prorogued from thatdate until the completion of the election.  (i)   Not later than six months after the holding ofthat election or, if the result of the referendum isthat the seats filled by indirect election are retained,after the completion of the referendum, an independentcommission will be appointed to ascertain whether thecreation of common roll seats in accordance with theconstitutional provisions described in sub-paragraph(j) below is acceptable to the people of Rhodesia and,if this is not so acceptable, whether any alternative arrangements would command general support.   Thecommission will consist of a Chairman who holds or has held high judicial office, and equal numbers ofEuropean and African members appointed by the government after consultation with all parties represented in the
House- of Assembly. . Tho commission will be required toreport to the Legislature within one year of itsappointment.   A law to give effect to any recommendationof tho commission would have to bo passed in accordancewith the requirements for the amendment of the Constitution.^(j)   Tho Constitution will provide that, with effect from the dissolution of Parliament following /&quot;the date by whiah the commission is required to report/thecompletion of the referendum and, if appropriate, theelection referred to in sub-paragraph (h) abovoj?,x common roll seats in the House of Assembly will be created.   The common roll seats will be filled by direct election by the voters on a roll consistingof all the voters for the time being registered onthe European roll and the African higher roll,/&quot;Elections to these seats will be conducted onthe basis that..............J?(2)   The SenateThe Senate will continue to be constituted as at present.As a consequence of the establishment (see paragraph (3) below)of a new Declaration of Rights enforceable by the courts the senate Legal Committee will be abolished.(3)   The Declaration of rights the existing Declaration of Rights will be replaced by anew Declaration affording protection tc the fundamental rightsand freedoms of the individual and conferring a right of access to the High Court for tho purpose of obtaining redress on anyperson who alleges that its provisions have been contravened inrelation to him.   A draft of tho proposed Declaration is set outin Appendix III.(4)   Amendment of the Constitution/&quot;l.   Until the first two African higher roll seats have been created and filled no amendment of the specially entrenchedprovisions of the Constitution will bo allowed / The HhodesianGovernment have given an assurance to the British Government thatthey will not introduce or support in the Rhcdesian Parliament any amendment of the specially entrenched provisions of the Constitutionuntil the first two Afrloon higher roll seats have been created andfilled .J7 , -

The existing provision to the effect that a bill toincrease the number of members of the House of Assembly withoutaltering the proportion of African members to the total number ofmembers shall net on that acoount be regarded as amending a specially entrenched provision will be repealed.4.   The new provisions of the Constitution to give effect tothe proposals in paragraph II (l) above will all be specially entrenched.   The provisions of the Electoral Act proscribing the qualifications and disqualifications for registration of voterson the European roll and both African rolls and the provision forvariation of the means qualifications in consequence of changesin prices will bo subject to the same requirements / and  .assurance^ as regards amendment as tho specially entrenchedprovisions of the Constitution,   Section 26 of the Electoral Act,which provides for the gradual increase of the means and educationalqualifications for the existing African roll so that, when parityis reached, they are the same as those for the European roll,will be repealed.5.   The new Declaration of Rights, including provision forits enforcement by the High Court, will be specially entrenched.Ill,     REVIEW of EXISTING LEGISLATIONAn independent oommission will be sot up to examine thoproblem of racial discrimination.   It will be required to considerexisting legislation and to moke recommendations to the RhoaesianUovernment on ways of mating progress towards ending racial dis-orimination.   There shall bo included in tho functions of the
5EGKETZ 5357.commission a special duty to scrutinise the educational system and the provisions of the Land Tenure Act and to consider thepossible creation of an independent and permanent Land Board to preside over the long-term resolutions of the problems involved.The terms of reference of the commission are set out in Appendix IVand its composition will be agreed with the British Government,The commission will be established as soon as possible after the test of acceptability has been completed.   Its findings will bepublished.The Rhode si an Government have given an assurance that theywould have serious regard to the findings of the commission andwould commend to Parliament such changes in existing legislation,including insofar as is neoessary the Constitution, as theydeemed appropriate within the spirit of that assurance.TV.   REVIEW OF CASES OF DETAINEES AND RESTRICTEESSince the settlement will have created a new situation therewill be a new special review of the cases of all detainees andrestrictees to see whether, in the light of changed circumstances,they can be released or tho restrictions can be removed withoutprejudice to the maintenance of public safety and public order.This review will be carried out by the existing tribunal, ofwhich the Chairman is a Judge of the Rhodesian High Court, assoon as possible after the test of acceptability has been completed.The recommendations of tho tribunal will be binding on the detainingor restricting authority.   For the purposes of this special reviewan observer appointed by the British Government in agreement-withthe Rhodesian Government will be ontitlod to be present.V.   DEVELOPMENT programme the two Governments attach the greatest importance to theexpansion of the eoonomy of Rhodesia and, in particular, tostimulating economic growth in tho Tribal Trust Lands.   Therewill therefore be a development programme to increase significantlyeducational and job opportunities for Africans in order to enablethem to ploy a growing part in the country&apos;s future development,and early discussions between the two Governments will be held to agree on this programme and the best means of implementing it.
The British Government will provide up to  ......per year for a period of ton years for tho purposes of capital &quot;expeniituroand primary development agreed with the Rhodesian Governmentto bo matched by sums provided by the Rhodesian Government.for this development programmeJ.   This will bo in addition tothe annual expenditure currently planned by the Rhodesian Government,   &amp; housingfor African educaticuyana for development projects in tho TribalTrust Lands and African Purchase Areas,   Part of this development programme will be devoted to the establishment of new irrigationtschemes, intensive cultivation projeots and industrial projects inthe Tribal Trust Lands and African Purchase Areas,   As regardseducation, tho moneys will be used to improve and expand facilitiesfor Africans in agriculture, technical and vocational training,teacher training and training in administration and for othereducational purposes in the field of primary, secondary and higher education.The parallel development of the two elements in this programme&apos; will thus help to ensure that new job opportunities for Africanswill become available as the economy expands and additionaleducational facilities are provided for them,VI.   OTHER MATTERS(l)   As vacancies occur in tho Rhodesian Public Service they willbo filled according to the criteria of merit and suitability,regardless of race, so that as African candidates become availablethey will compete on equal terms with candidates of other racessc far as appointments or promotions arc concerned,(2)   Rhodesion citizens who have left Rhcdosia for any reasonwill be allowed to return freely and without being subjected toany restrictions by reason of their past activities, but withoutamnesty in respect of any criminal offonoe.(3)   The Rhodosion Government wish to revoko the state of emergencyat the earliest opportunity.   With due regard to their responsi-bility to maintain law and order the Bhodesian Government thereforeintend to take the necessary steps to end the state of emergencyafter sanctions against Rhodesia have boon lifted.
SECRETZ 5359.VII. GRANT OF INDEPENDENCEAs soon as the British Government are satisfied that thelegislation referred to in paragraph II above has been enactedand steps taken to give effect tc the proposals in paragraph IIIend IV above they will introduce legislation to confer independence on Rhodesia as a republic and will commend this legislation to theBritish Parliament.   They will also terminate their economic andether sanctions when this legislation takes effect.   Both Govem-ments will take steps to settle outstanding financial and other issues and to regularise relations between the two countries.Nothing in the foregoing proposals shall be regarded as implying any change in the current attitude of either side tothe present status of Rhodesia or of the 1969 Constitution.27th October, 1971.

ANNEX DSYNOPSIS OF CHANGES IN PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION,THE FRANCHISE AND THE BLOCKING MECHANISM FOLLOWING ASETTLEMENTEstimatedTimingPresentPresent   1,      (a)   House of Assembly consists of 66 representativesof whom 50 are directly elected by Europeans, 8 directly elected by Africans and 8 indirectly elected by Africans.(b) Franchise qualifications for voters on theEuropean Roll (totalling 86,000) are based on income,ownership of property or education.    There are similarcriteria, though at a lower level, for voters on the african Roll (totalling 8,000).    The 8 indirectly electedAfricans are chosen by electoral colleges consisting of chiefs, headmen and elected councillors.(c) Amendment of specially entrenched clauses in theConstitution requires a two-thirds majority in both theHouse of Assembly and the Senate.1972        Immediately following Settlement2.      (a)    A Higher African Roll (HAR) is established withthe same qualifications as the European Roll.    As soon asthe number of Africans registered on the HAR reaches 6%(on present figures, 5,000) of the total number of votersregistered on the European Roll, two extra African seatsare created, to be filled, without waiting for a GeneralElection, through direct election by voters on the HAR.We have asked that if the number of HAR Africans has risenso as to warrant two further African seats - to be filled by indirect election, see para 3(a) - they too should be filled without waiting for a general election.(b)    A Lower African Roll (LAR) is established tosupersede the existing African Roll.    The franchisequalifications will be reduced and could result in atotal voting strength of about 30,000.    The number of/representativesSECUET
Estimatedfining1975Say 2010-2020representatives elected &quot;by the LA.R will, however,remain 8, at least until parity is reached - see para U(b).(c) The &quot;blocking mechanism in respect of proposed amendments to specially entrenched constitutional clausesis strengthened.    The existing requirement (see para 1(c)above) remains but in addition a simple majority of each-racial group in the House of Assembly voting separatelyis required.   However, until the first two HAR seats(see para 2(a)) are filled - perhaps until 197*4- - thereis to be a moratorium on any changes in specially entrenched clauses.At the[^firsV Jggjferjy-^JS^^ j A^A9JIglnJ.3.      (a) If by this time the number of registered MARvoters has risen to 12^ (on present figures, 10,000) ormore, further African scats will be created on thefollowing basis.    The registration of HAR voterstotalling 6y&apos; of the European Roll will already have produced two seats filled through election by the HAR(para 2(a)).    The registration of a further 6% createstwo further seats to be filled&apos;by indirect electionne xt 6\produces 2 more directly(para 1(b));    the elected seats;    and so on.    Thus, for example, when.theHAR voters total      : of the European Roll, there will be directly elected and 6 indirectly elected African seatsover and above the present level (para 1(a)).When the numbers of HAR and European Roll Voters reachParity1+.      (a) At the General Election held at this stage, theseats in the House of Assembly would be as follows:-European
European Roll50HARLAR8Indirectly electedAfrican2k*Total African50Total seats 100* ie present 8 plus 16(b) A referendum is then held amongst all Africans registeredon the two African Rolls, to decide whether the 2U incirectly-elected African seats should be retained or abolished.    If thedecision is for retention, they continue as before.    If the resultfavours abolition, the House of Assembly may decide that up to one-quarter (ie six) of them should become LAR seats, the remaindergoing to the HAR.    Either way, an election to give effect to thechange will be held within a year of the referendum.(c) Parity having been reached in the House of Assembly, the referendum having been held and any change resulting from it havingbeen effected,  the blocking mechanism (see para 2(c)) is modified by the abandonment of the racial majority requirement and revertsto the basis of two-thirds of the House of Assembly and the senate (para 1(c)).(d) A Commission composed of equal numbers of Africans and europeans, with a present or former judge as Chairman, thenascertains whether the provision in the Constitution for thecreation of a specified number of Common Roll seats (see para 10)is acceptable to the people of Rhodesia, and, if it is not,whether any alternative arrangements would find support.    Anyproposal not to create the Common Roll seats would require amend-ment of a specially entrenched clause by a two-thirds majority ineach House.    Without such amendment the Common Roll seats would be created, to be elected by European and African Higher Roll Votersvoting in a single national constituency./At the
At the succeeding General Election5.     The seats in the House of Assembly would &quot;be as follows:European Roll 50African Rolls  (HARand LAR) 50Common Roll 10 (our requirement)Total       110Subsequently6.     As the number of Africans qualifying for the HAR, and thus the Common Roll, continues to grow, tho Common Roll seats willbe increasingly likely to be won by Africans, thus producing an african majority in the House of Assembly, and hence majority ruleNOTES1.     The Senate remains unchanged throughout.2.     The figures for the numbers of seats, etc, are based on thepresent European population.    This, of course, may changebut the principles remain valid.Points so sidelined are still subject to confirmation or agreement.. A. AAV
ANNEX EOTHER GENERAL POINTS STILL OUTSTANDINGA.      ISSUES OP IMPORTANCE1.     Transfer of LandWe have asked for the immediate allocation of some additional land for African use as a gesture that will show the direction inwhich the Rhodesians are now moving.   We had hoped that an offer would have been made during the last visit but the Rhodesianofficials said that any transfer of land should await the findings of the independent Commission which is to review existing legis-lation including the Land Tenure Act.    At the final meeting, MrSmith hinted that he might at some stage - not necessarily inthe context of a settlement - be able to make available a smallpiece of extra land for African settlement.    Since we shall faceconsiderable criticism for allowing the Rhodesians to retain the highly discriminatory Land Tenure Act (which was passed after&quot;Fearless&quot;) the surrender of some land for African use would bean important earnest of intention - taken in conjunction withthe review of the Land Tenure Act - to reduce discrimination ina matter of great significance to African opinion.    It would beof great help presentationally and with the Test of Acceptability.2.     Eviction of AfricansThe Rhodesians have recently announced their intention toresettle Africans living on Mission-owned property in theEuropean area.    The Rhodesians have said that they woxfld be willing to defer such action until after any Test of Acceptability,but this is inadequate.    The Rhodesians&apos; intentions are now wellknown, and to avoid criticism we need an undertaking that nofurther action on evictions will be taken until the Commissionon discrimination has reported and its report has been considered.We have asked for such an assurance but have not yet received a clear answer.3.     MoratoriumThe blocking mechanism is most vulnerable during the early/stages
stages.     We have therefore proposed that there should he a moratorium on any amendment to the specially entrenched provisionsof the Constitution until after the first two additional Africanseats (which will &quot;be filled by direct election) have been created and filled.     The Rhodesians agreed to consider this request.k*     Method of election for Common Roll. SeatsIt has been agreed that there should be a single nationalconstituency for all these seats.     But the Rhodesians favour anelectoral system which, does net incorporate proportional represen-tation, arguing that this is too complicated.      If we cannot obtain agreement to proportional representation, we should try to securethe system of multiple voting most likely equitably to reflect the growing voting strength of the Africans.B.      SECONDARY ISSUES1.     LAND - African rights in the European area(i) Under the Land Tenure Act, African professional men such, asdoctors, lawyers, etc. are unable to occupy premises in theEuropean area (which includes city centres) without a permit.      TheRhodesians have agreed to look into our request that no permitshould be required for Africans carrying on specified professionsand for the location of offices of recognised organisations, egTrade Unions.     This would be a useful presentational gain and could help in the Test of Acceptability.(ii) Similarly, provision in the Land Tenure Act to allowEuropean owners or occupiers of land to provide residential accommodation for Africans employed by them in specific fields,eg domestic servants, would be a useful presentational andsubstantive gain.      The Rhodesians have, however, argued thatthis is a matter which should be left for the Review Commission,2.      The TangwenaWe have asked the Rhodesians to consider attributing theland from which the Tangwena tribe have been evicted to the Africanarea but we have had no final answer on this.     This point could conveniently be taken at the same time as the surrender of landfor African use. ^ 2 - ^    Independent
3.     Independent Commission at ParityThe passage in the Draft Proposals for a Settlement relatingto the proposel for a Commission at parity to ascertain whetherthe majority of the people of Rhodesia as a whole might wish tohave some alternative arrangement to the Common Roll seats, isstill in square &quot;brackets (see Para Il(l)i) of Annex A).     Inorder to be implemented, the recommendations of the commission would have to be adopted by the two-thirds majority of the Houseof Assembly then required for important constitutional amendments.Thus, the Commission does not in itself weaken the agreedConstitutional arrangements.     The Rhodesians are anxious toinclude it for presentational reasons.     Although any such provision is likely to be regarded by critics as a device to enablethe Europeans to bring about a situation in which there will be noadvance beyond parity, and has therefore a presentational disadvan-tage from our point of view, the removal cf the idea of a commission is not an issue on which we can reasonably insist,h.     Early creation of some additional African seatsIt is important that the new arrangements for the House of assembly should be seen to lead to early additional representation for the Africans.     We have therefore asked that the creation cfthe first four additional African seats should take place as soonas they were earned, rather than at the first General Election.The Rhodesians hove said that, because of the difficulty ofreorganising the Electoral Colleges, they would prefer to confineany such&apos; arrangement to the tv/o directly-elected seats.     We hai/eproposed arrangements to get round the Rhodesian difficulties but no agreement was reached on this point.rj.    Electoral Registration forms the existing form is unnecessarily complicated and has been criticised as a means of inhibiting the registration of Africanvoters.     Although the Rhodesians have agreed to simplify the form/for- 3 -
for the Lower African Roll, they have refused to do so for theHigher African Roll.     Although it is this Roll which is the moreimportant since the numbers registered on it determine the rate of african political advance, we may have to accept the Rhodesian-argument that Africans qualified for the Higher Roll should beable to complete any application form.6.     Advancement of Africans in the Public service the Rhodesians have said they are not prepared to make anyfurther provision in the proposals for a settlement for the advancement of Africans in the Public Service, such as a CadetTraining Scheme for African administrators.     They have, however,suggested that this might be a matter for discussion between theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and Mr Smith.7.     Commutation of Death SentencesThe Rhodesians have indicated that they would probably commuteoutstanding death, sentences but they have not so far been preparedto include this issue in the proposals for a settlement.     It wasagreed that this is a matter best left for discussion between theSecretary cf State and Mr Smith.8.     Banned British correspondentsThe Rhodesians have said that they are unwilling to lift theirban on three leading British correspondents.     Their views, and theviews of their colleagues, on any settlement are likely to be prejudiced unless the ban is lifted.     This is a matter which.I might be reoolved during a personal meeting between the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and Mr Smith.- k -
ANNEX PASPECTS OP THE DECLARATION OP RIGHTS ON WHICH NO AGREEMENT has yet BEEN reached a.      The following are the points in the Brief prepared for thelatest visit &quot;by our Emissaries, which the Solicitor-Generalconsidered to be of major importance.    (Points on which agree-ment was reached during the visit are not included).Discrimination (Paragraph 11)*1.     The most important difficulty ahout the Rhodesian draftproposal for the text of the Declaration of Rights is the section on Discrimination.    The Solicitor-General considers that it wouldbe impossible to defend it in terms of the Fourth Principle or todefend any version of it which specifically mentioned education and land as fields where additional diserimination will be permitted.    (This latter objection applies to our compromise proposal (an ex D of GEN 1+3 (71)6) which was endorsed, in theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s message of 8 October to MrSmith reproduced at Appendix A).    Thus the exclusion from thescope of the paragraph of laws relating to the acquisition or useof land or other immovable property (paragraph 11(3)(g)) oreducation (paragraph 13(3)) is not acceptable.    Nor is the more general provision in paragraph 11(3)(h) for the exclusion ofother legislation that satisfies certain tests.    This provisioncorresponds broadly to Section 67 (k) of the 1961 Constitutionbut without the important proviso preventing the enactment oflegislation which would result in greater discrimination withrespect to the matter in question than that previously existing./2.    The1*A11 references refer to the Rhodesian draft text of theDeclaration of Rights which is at Annex C.SECKET
2.     The emissaries should again make it clear that we see verygreat difficulty in accepting a provision that gives less protection against future discriminatory legislation than Section 67 (h) ofthe 1961 Constitution and would much prefer to retain that provision, including the proviso to it.     This is &quot;because looking at the proposals as a whole it will in any case be very hard todefend a settlement that retains the Land Tenure Act in terms ofthe Fourth Principle.3.     However, if the Rhodesians are unfailing to accept this, andrefer to the compromise we have already put forward, the emissariescould indicate that we might conceivably be prepared to consider aprovision on these lines provided that the express references init to education and the acquisition and use of land, which do not seem to be legally essential since these subjects fall within thescope of h(c), could be omitted.    (They should also propose thatthe references to disabilities, privileges, etc, in our sab-paragraph (2) should be in the singular).U.     The emissaries should also make it clear that we seeserious objection to provision for a ministerial certificate(paragraph 11(6) of the Rhodesian draft) and could not accept the insertion of a provision of this kind in our compromise proposal.Wo such provision appears in Section 67 of the I96I Constitution.The emissaries could, if necessary, discuss the possibility of varying the wording of our sub-paragraph (h) so as to place on the complainant the onus of satisfying the Court that the provisioncomplained of is not reasonably justifi&quot;hie, subject to any suchchange being referred to London for agreement.Preventive Detention (Paragraphs 2(h) and (5)5.     The emissaries should continue to press strongly for provisionrequiring it to be shown, within Ih days of the commencement of the detention, to the satisfaction of a magistrate, rather than the responsible Minister, that reasonable grounds exist for orderingthe detention.     Failing acceptance of this, they should againask for the reduction of the period within which the case must bereferred to the tribunal from three months to one month.      Theyshould also continue to ask that the maximum period between- 2 - /subsequent
subsequent reviews by the tribunal should be six months ratherthan twelve, though this is less important.Freedom of Expression (Paragraph 9)6.     The emissaries should tell the Rhodesians that we cannot accept the unrestricted power to regulate telephony, telegraphy,posts, wireless broadcasting, television and newspapers andother publications that would be given by their paragraph(2)(a)(ii)D.     They should press the Rhodesians strongly toagree to delete the reference to newspapers or other publicationsand to insert the words &quot;the technical administration or technical operation of&quot; after &quot;regulating&quot;.     If the Rhodesiansagree to the deletion but not to the suggested insertion, theemissaries might explore with them the possibility, as analternative to it, of adding provision to make it clear thatsub-paragraph D does not permit censorship of material comnunicat-ed by the means referred to.     The emissaries should argue thatthe other sub-paragraphs permit the control for certain specifiedpurposes of matter that may be legitimately communicated and thepowers in question are all that should be required.Review of cases of detainees when there is a State of Emergency&quot;(Paragraph 12^2))    * &apos;  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;  &apos;7,      The emissaries should continue to press fox&apos; the period between the first and each subsequent review by the tribunal tobe not more than six months rather than twelve.The Enforcement Section (Section 8 k)8.     The Rhodesians have inserted as sub-section (9) a provisiondesigned to set a time limit, running from the date the law inquestion comes into force, on the right to challenge the validity oi a law on the grounds of inconsistency with theDeclaration,      There is no known precedent for such a provision.The Rhodesian desire to achieve certainty as to their law isunderstandable, but this is not a sufficient justification fordenying to individuals who may be affected by the application ofa particular provision after the relevant time limit has expired/theSEC KEY
the opportunity to challenge its validity, even if otherindividuals have previously had such an opportunity and have not used it or have failed in their attempt.      The Rhodesian provisiondoes not allow adequately for the different circumstances and mannerin which a provision of law may he applied to different individuals.Nor does it allow for the possibility that, as the conditions ofRhodesian society change, the attitude of the courts to theinterpretation of the Declaration in relation to other legislativeprovisions may also gradually change.     The emissaries should saythat the most that we could consider is a provision directing thecourts, where the validity of a provision is challenged forinconsistency with the Declaration, to take into account in reaching a decision the length of time the provision has been in force andthe kind of factors referred to in the Rhodesian paragraph (b).B.     Summary of Points which were classified by the Solicitor--general as of lesser importance, on which there^is still.....disagreement;Compensation for unlawful deprivation of liberty (Paragraph 2(10))9.     The proviso to this sub-paragraph that anyone acting reasonablyand in good faith will not be liable to compensate any person hehas unlawfully arrested or detained is new as compared with the 196.1Constitution and we know of no precedent for it in other constitutionsWe therefore wish it to be deleted.Discrimination - Disciplined Forces (Paragraph ll(3)(e))10.   Although we could accept the exclusion from the scope ofparagraph 11 of laws relating to the defence forces, the Rhodesiandraft goes further than this by excluding the Police Force and the prison Service andvallowing other disciplined bodies to be excluded.We have asked that these categories be dropped, since any doubts about the reliability of Africans in the higher ranks of the police force and Prison Services can be dealt with by administrative means.Right to personal liberty (Paragraph 2(1)(h))11.    The Rhodesians have included a new exception, &quot;the control ofvagrancy&quot; to the right to personal liberty.      This seems unnecessary. /since
since the remainder of the provision would permit a vagrant to be deprived of his liberty for the purposes cf his care, treatment,rehabilitation or the protection of the community.Protection from arbitrary search or entry (Paragraph 6(1))12.    The Rhodesian wording which follows the 1961 Constitutiongives slightly less protection against arbitrary entry and searchthan is usually found in such a provision.Ministerial Certificates13.   Paragraphs 6(3), 8(5), 9(3) and 10(h) provide that if the complainant can show that what has been done to him prima facieinfringes the right in question, the Minister must then be given  an opportunity of giving a certificate to the effect that theaction taken falls within a permissible limitation.      If a certificateis given, the onus is then on the complainant to satisfy the courtthat it should not accept what is stated in the certificatewithout proof to its satisfaction.      The Rhodesian draft followsclosely the 1961 Constitution but the normal provisions found inother Constitutions would be preferable.Protection against double jeopardy (Paragraph 7(5))l!w    The wording of the Rhodesian provision against being triedmore than once for the same offence differs from the usual provision on a number of points of detail.     We would prefer the usual vrording.- 5 -
