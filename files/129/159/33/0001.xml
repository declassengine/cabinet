INTRODUCTION BY THE HOME SECRETARY1. On the 31st August 1971, I appointed a Committee of Inquiry underthe chairmanship of Sir Edmund Compton, G.C.B., K.B.E., with His HonourEdgar Fay, Q.C., and Dr. Ronald Gibson, C.B.E., as members, with thefollowing terms of reference:&quot;To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9th August underthe Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922of physical brutality while in the custody of the security forces priorto either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal chargeor their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order &quot;.2. The Committee of Inquiry visited Northern Ireland from 1st Septemberuntil 26th October and have now sent me their report which is published in this Command Paper.3. The Government are grateful for the care and thoroughness with whichthe members of the Committee of Inquiry carried out their difficult task.The Situation in Northern Ireland4. In considering the Committee&apos;s report it is important to have in mind the circumstances in Northern Ireland in which the Northern Ireland Govern-ment decided to exercise their powers under the Civil Authorities (special powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 to arrest, detain or intern personssuspected of having acted or being about to act in a manner prejudicial tothe preservation of the peace or the maintenance of order.5. At the beginning of February this year the I.R.A. began to increasethe ferocity of their well-established campaign of violence. A marked increasein intensity occurred in July, and has been maintained up to the present time.This campaign of murder and intimidation has included gun attacks on military and police patrols, explosive attacks on offices and buildings,together with indiscriminate bombing of occupied buildings in the cities,killing and injuring members of the general public. More recently there hasbeen a concerted attack on individual police officers, police premises andthe homes of police officers. Since August 1969 104 civilians, 12 members ofthe R.U.C. and 38 members of the Armed Forces are known to have been killed; and many civilians and members of the Armed Forces have beeninjured, some seriously. There have been over 1,000 incidents involvingexplosives; and the weight of explosives used by the terrorists so far hasbeen calculated at about 11,000 lbs. Up to the morning of 10th November1971, the security forces had uncovered 293 pistols and revolvers, 234 rifles,24 machine guns, 116 shotguns, 123,614 rounds of ammunition, over \\tons of explosives, 1,607 pipe, petrol and nail bombs, 154 grenades, 26 gallonsof acid, and large quantities of fuses, detonators and electric cable. Thesefigures refer only to arms found in Northern Ireland; they do not include,.  for example, the large quantity of arms recently discovered at Amsterdam.
6. The aims of the I.R.A. are to intimidate the population by brutalterrorism and so to prevent any co-operation with the Government, the police and the courts of law; to inhibit normal political activity and constitutional progress; and to cause the public in Great Britain to become so sickened.bythe ceaseless bloodshed and destruction that the Army&apos;s withdrawal will come to be seen as the lesser of two evils. No responsible Government can afford to yield to pressures of this kind.Introduction of Internment7. The preservation of law and order in Northern Ireland is primarilythe responsibility of the Northern Ireland Government. By July and earlyAugust the deterioration in the situation in Northern Ireland had reached thepoint where they felt it necessary, with the agreement of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, to resort to their powers of internment.8. In announcing the decision to introduce internment on the 9th August,1971, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr. Brian Faulkner, said:&quot; If Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper, two things are essential. We must sustain a continuing programme of economic and social development, and we must find the means to create a moreunited society here one in which all men of goodwill, howeverdivergent their legitimate political views, may participate to the full.These things are, and will continue to be, the aims of our policy.&quot;Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and violence. Theoutrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within ourcommunity. These, indeed, are the clear objects of those who carry them out.&quot;Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to the law.Nor have such methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the I.R.A. are now servingordinary prison sentences. But the terrorist campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary lawcannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthlessviciousness.&quot;I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant considerations,including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom last Thursday, toexercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as Minister of Home Affairs&quot;.9. 342 men were arrested on the Monday, 9th August; and the arrests of others under the Special Powers Act have continued. 980 had been arrestedby midday on the 10th November, 1971. In each case very careful considera-tion was given to the question whether an internment order was necessary.In the event 299 had been interned by the 10th November and were being held at Long Kesh internment camp. 104 were being held under detentionorders in Belfast Prison. 508 had been released and 69 were being held pend-ing a decision on the making of detention orders.
10. Wherever possible, the normal processes of law are followed. Since the9th August 1971, over 300 persons have been arrested and charged in theordinary way with offences arising from civil disturbances.11. An advisory committee under Regulation 12 of the Special powers act has been set up under the chairmanship of His Honour Judge Brown to review the cases of all those against whom internment orders are made.The members are Mr. R. W. Berkeley and Mr. P. N. Dalton. The rate of pro-gress of this review is dependent on the time required to work up cases for iuconsideration; but at the 2nd November 99 cases had been reviewed. In 10cases the Advisory Committee had recommended release to the Minister ofHome Affairs of the Northern Ireland Government. All ten of these interneeshave been released and two further releases have been made on the advice ofthe R.U.C.Allegations of Physical Brutality12. A number of allegations were made about the treatment of thosewho were arrested on the 9th August. I though it right that these allegationsshould be investigated by an impartial inquiry; and it was for this reason that I appointed the Committee whose report has now been presented tome.The Committees Findings13. The capacity of the I.R.A. for indicative retaliation needs no emphasis.I therefore asked the Committee to adopt procedures which were designed toprotect the lives of those who had conducted the arrests and interrogations.Nevertheless, every individual who believed that he had grounds of complainthad the opportunity to put his case forward and was assured of a full and impartial hearing. Hardly any did so. The Committee carried out a thorough examination of the evidence, both oral and documentary, put forward bymembers of the security forces. In the great majority of cases they set against it nothing more than unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations whichis all that they had before them. In many cases the Committee themselves have felt unable to carry the matter any further; but in the Government^ view the balance of credibility is clear.14. The allegations which the Committee have examined fall broadly into two classes, those relating to the initial arrests and a small number concernedwith the subsequent process of interrogation. As regards the initial arrests it isclear from the report that there were very few complaints and those therewere had, in the Committee&apos;s view, very little substance. The record of eventsreflects great credit on the security forces, who carried out a difficult and dangerous operation in adverse circumstances with commendable restraint and discipline. The more serious allegations which the Committee were ableto investigate relate to the subsequent interrogation in depth of 11 individuals.Here again the Committee have found no evidence of physical brutality, still less of torture or brain-washing. Their findings about physical ill-treatmentdo, however, raise certain questions about the detailed application of the gen-eral rules governing interrogation.
15. These rules are summarised in the Government^ evidence to theCommittee (paragraph 46) which also points out that:&quot; The precise application of these general rules in particular circum-stances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the partof those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intel-Intelligence is the key to successful operations against terrorists, and the key to intelligence is information regarding their operations, theirdispositions and their plans. When combating a terrorist campaign,time is of the essence; information must be sought while it is stillfresh so that it may be used as quickly as possible to effect the cap-ture of persons, arms and explosives, and thereby save the lives of members! of the security forces and of the civil population &quot;.16. In the present circumstances of Northern Ireland, as described in para-graphs 3-5 of this note, it is imperative to obtain all available intelligencein order to save the lives of civilians and members of the security forces;and it is therefore essential to interrogate suspects who are believed to have important information. The principles applied in the interrogation of sus-pects in Northern Ireland since August this year, and the methods employed(which are necessary not only for reasons of security and control but also toprotect the lives of those being interrogated against the risk of reprisals), arethe same as those which have been employed in all emergencies of thiskind in which Britain has been involved in recent years. The rules now inforce, as summarised in paragraph 46 of the report, were issued in 1965and were revised in 1967 in the light of recommendations made by Mr.Roderick Bowen QC in a report on the procedures for the arrest, interroga-tion and detention of suspected terrorists in Aden (Cmnd 3165).Action by the Government17. The Government reject any suggestion that the methods currentlyauthorised for interrogation contain any element of cruelty or brutality. Thereport of the Committee confirms this view. But it also brings out the diffi-culty of implementing the rules in detail in circumstances in which rigorousand intensive interrogation is vitally and urgently necessary. The Govem-ment have therefore decided that it would be right to make arrangementsfor examining and providing authoritative advice upon the procedures forthe interrogation of persons suspected of involvement in a terrorist campaign,including their custody while subject to interrogation, and the applicationof those procedures.18. The main strain of protecting the population in Northern Ireland fallsupon the Armed Forces and the RUG It is clear from the Committee&apos;sreport, and from personal observation by a large number of responsiblewitnesses from all walks of life, that the security forces have discharged theironerous duties with the utmost restraint despite the provocations of whichthe Press and other public media give us daily evidence. The government do not regard the findings of the Committee as in any way reflecting adverselyon the responsibility and discipline with which the security forces in NorthernIreland are conducting their fight against a vicious and ruthless enemy.Reginald Maudling

Chapter ITERMS OF reference . We were appointed on the 31st August, 1971, by the Secretary of State forthe Home Department with the following terms of reference: &quot;To investigate allegations by those arrested on the 9th August underthe Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 of physical brutality while in the custody of the security forces prior to either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal charge or their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order.&quot;2. In our letter of appointment the Secretary of State said that these terms ofreference included in our Enquiry complaints of physical brutality in respect ofa small number of persons who were interrogated in depth after a detentionorder had been made against them: these persons were made the subject of aremoval order and were lodged for a short period in a place other than thatspecified in the^detention order.3. The Secretary of State also informed us that in order to ensure the personalsafety of members of the security forces against whom allegations might be made,it was necessary that our Enquiry should be undertaken in private and that thereshould be no opportunity for a confrontation between complainants and members of the security forces against whom complaints were made. At the outset the Secretary of State indicated that legal representation would not be appropriate: but on the 3rd September he reviewed this direction, and suggestedthat the essentially private nature of our Enquiry could still be safeguarded if both complainants and those complained against were permitted, if they desiredit, to be accompanied by a legal representative when they appeared before us;such legal representatives would not however be permitted to cross-examinewitnesses or given access as of right to transcripts of evidence.4. In the event, for the reasons we give below, complainants did not avail themselves of these facilities for legal representation. On the other hand, manyof the army and police personnel complained against were so represented when we took evidence from them.
Chapter IICOURSE OF PROCEEDINGS5. We held our first meeting at the Home Office in London on the 31 st August.On the 1st September and subsequently, the Enquiry was located in NorthernIreland and we have been in continuous operation in the Province from the1st September until the 26th October when we moved to London where we heard further evidence and deliberated on the terms of our report.6. On the 9th August, 342 men were arrested and were taken to a RegionalHolding Centre. When we opened our Enquiry, 105 of these had been released and 237 were in detention in H.M. Prison Belfast (commonly known as CrumlinJail) and the Maidstone, the depot ship moored alongside a quay in Belfastdocks.7. At the start of our proceedings, we thought it right to afford to each ofthose arrested on the 9th August, the opportunity to come forward to us, if they wished to substantiate an allegation. We did this by public announcement onthe 2nd September and by individual letters posted that day to each of the men released and delivered to each of the men held in detention. A subsequent letter was sent to each man to inform him that he might be legally represented, thoughour proceedings would continue to be held in private. The Northern IrelandCivil Rights Association let it be known that our enquiry was unacceptable tothem because of our constitution and private procedure. We received relatively few replies to our letters sent to those released. Most of those signified refusalfor the reasons given by the Association. Tn a number of cases however it was clear that the released man made no complaint because he had none. We wroteagain to all released men who replied they did not wish to complain asking ifthey had received any medical treatment as a result of their detention. Noneindicated that he had. One man who had been in Girdwood Park replied:&quot;I did not receive any treatment at all as I did not need any. I was not mistreatedin any way at all. I thought they were very good in conduct according to thecircumstances.&quot; Of the 9 released men who originally indicated a wish to makea formal complaint to us, only 2 pursued their intention. One appeared beforeus. Another, having set out his allegations in writing as requested, was unableto appear before us to give oral evidence as he had left the Province. None ofthe others replied to further letters save one, who wrote withdrawing the complaint because, he said, although he was wrongfully arrested he suffered nophysical brutality.8. As regards those detained, we received a written statement from 115 menheld in Crumlin Jail, to the effect that they had complaints but would not make them to us. At the Maidstone, we received the same answer from 77 detaineeswhen we visited the vessel on the 8th September and saw each detainee in turnand in private. Two Maidstone detainees told us they wished to complain to us,but withdrew later.
9. The upshot is that only one of those arrested on the 9th August has availedhimself of the opportunity to substantiate his complaint by appearing before us.This has not frustrated our Enquiry, since material for our investigation hasbeen made available to us in the form of allegations published in the Press andtransmitted to us from a number of other sources. We have thought it properto use as the starting point for our investigations, such allegations as areidentified with specific persons arrested on the 9th August and relate to their personal experiences. But the fact that complainants have not appearedpersonally before us has limited our ability to reach findings in cases of conflict of evidence, as we explain in paragraphs 21-28 below.10. At the outset of our proceedings we issued a statement in which we asked that any individual or organisation with relevant information to give to theEnquiry should get in touch with us at our Belfast office. On the 17th and 18thSeptember we repeated this request in advertisements published in the NorthernIreland press. On the 16th September our Chairman wrote to the Editors of 9newspapers published in the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom which had reported allegations, asking them if they would assist the Enquiry by turningover to us such specific evidence as they might hold.11. We had no material response to these requests till at a late stage in ourproceedings we received information from the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday times. The material sent to us by the Daily Telegraph on the 14th October hadalready reached us from other sources. As regards the Sunday Times, an article in the 17th October issue of that paper had shown that it held allegations by anumber of men arrested on the 9th August and subsequently, including 11 menarrested on the 9th August and interrogated in depth. The Sunday Times handedover this material to us on the 19th October. Most of these allegations appearedto have been made in August, and a number had previously been transmitted tous from other sources and had already been investigated by us. Any newallegations published in the Sunday Times of the 17th October in respect ofpersons arrested on the 9th August have been covered by our investigation andthe results are included in this Report.12. The total number of complainants whose allegations have been investi-gated and are covered by this Report is 40. The list of the complainants is given at the Appendix. Given the sources available to us, our Enquiry could nothave been comprehensive. But at least the cases we have investigated are sufficient to cover all aspects of the 9th August operation.
NATURE OF EVIDENCENature of Evidence from Complainants13. It follows from this that with two exceptions our evidence of complaintsis hearsay. Apart from press reports it consists of written statements pur-porting to be signed by complainants and in many cases appearing to havebeen obtained and circulated by a body called the Association for LegalJustice. The documents from this body are duplicated in typescript with typedsignatures. It is apparent that many of the newspaper reports were founded on these statements. Thirteen of the documents handed to us by the Sunday times were photocopies of handwritten statements apparently taken down from detainees in prison and signed by them. Most of the statements arewitnessed. From other sources we obtained one similar photocopy and 47transcripts of recorded statements. Despite our inability to obtain verificationof the statements, we have thought it right to assume that the statementscorrectly represent what the respective complainants have to say.Nature of other evidence14. Apart from complainants&apos; statements we have drawn our evidence from three sources: (a) Our personal inspection of the sites where the events took place,(b) Contemporary documentary evidence,(c) Oral evidence from persons in charge of operations, and from armyand police personnel identified as having been supervising local opera-tions and in contact with the complainants when the alleged eventstook place.(a) Sites15. As we indicate when we come to describe the 9th August arrest opera-tion (paragraph 29 below) the arrested persons were temporarily held in threeRegional Holding Centres before being released or moved into detention inMaidstone Depot Ship or Crumlin Jail. We visited each of the three Centres,at Ballykinler, Magilligan, and Girdwood Park, and reconstructed the pro-ceedings at each place with the army and police personnel who had been incharge of those proceedings on the 9th-11th August. Similarly we visited theMaidstone and Crumlin Jail and reconstructed the proceedings in those placesup to the point of lodgement in detention there.(b) Contemporary documentary evidence16. This includes the following:-Operational OrdersResults Reports by Brigade Commanders and officers in charge of regional Holding Centres.
Arrest files for each person admitted to Regional Holding Centres(including photographs of each person taken on admission).Doctors&apos; reports on persons admitted to or treated at RegionalHolding Centres.Doctors&apos; reports on persons admitted to detention.Doctors&apos; notes of examination at the interrogation centre.(c) Oral evidence17. We have sought to test each case where we have received specificallegations by taking written statements and oral evidence from army, police and prison officers identified as having supervised the operation or as havingbeen in contact with the complainant between arrest and lodgement in detention. We also in certain cases heard oral evidence from the medical officers involved.18. In the course of taking this evidence during 17 hearing days, we heard95 army witnesses, 26 police witnesses, 11 prison officers, 5 regimental medical officers, 2 medical staff officers, 2 civilian doctors and 2 specialists, one froma military and one from a civilian hospital. We received written evidencetaken by our secretaries from one police officer and 10 prison officers. we heard evidence from one complainant in person, and received written evidencedirect from another. In accordance with the modification in our proceduremade by the Home Secretary on the 3rd September, legal representation ofthe witnesses before us was permitted. Mr. John Creaney, Mr. R. Macartneyand Mr. Peter Smith, all of the Northern Ireland Bar, appeared before us onbehalf of army and police personnel and were of great assistance to the Enquiry.Definition of &quot;Brutality&quot;19. We have confined our investigation to that part of a complaint thatrelates to physical treatment.20. Our terms of reference require us to investigate allegations of physicalbrutality. We have not, however, thought it right to start with our owndefinition of brutality and confine ourselves to allegations that satisfied ourdefinition. For we have to recognise that our starting point can only be the allegation of ill-treatment which is brutality in the mind of the complainant.Therefore we have sought to reach our conclusion by describing the eventsthat occurred so far as our enquiries have enabled us to ascertain them: then we offer our opinion on the extent, if any, to which the allegation of ill-treatment is substantiated; if we think it is, we proceed to say whether we have foundin it any element of brutality as we understand the term. We take the oppor-tunity to develop our definition of brutality in connection with the first set of detailed allegations on which we report, connected with the process ofinterrogation in depth (see paragraph 105) and regard that definition asapplicable to any other instances of ill-treatment in allegations dealt withsubsequently in this Report.Effect on findings of fact of complainants&apos; refusal to appear21. The refusal of complainants to appear before us and give us their evidence has limited to some extent our ability to reach conclusions about the validity of their allegations.
22. We emphasise that in our view, our ability to reach conclusions has notbeen impaired by the fact that we heard evidence in private. It has been openboth to complainants and to those complained against to be legallyrepresented. No complainant availed himself of this facility, though we wereassisted by the legal representatives of army and police witnesses. Nor havewe felt the need for powers to compel the attendance of witnesses and pro-duction of documents, as far as the army and police evidence is concerned.23. The limitation we have experienced is that the absence of the com-plainants as witnesses has left us with an unbalanced body of evidence. Thereis no problem when the evidence, oral or documentary, from security sourcesconfirms the allegation. Usually, however, the evidence from security sourcesis, to a greater or lesser extent, in conflict with the allegation. In this situation,as a tribunal conducting a private enquiry, we would have sought to resolvethe conflict by separately examining both complainant and respondent, inorder to test the account each gave of the events that took place, and to forma view of the comparative credibility of the witnesses in the course of examiningthem.24. We have indeed been able to test the army and police witnesses by soexamining them and to form a view of their credibility, with or without thecorroboration of documentary or other independent evidence. But we havenot been able to compare their credibility with that of the complainants: and itwould offend against the principles of justice if we were to reach conclusions which assumed that the credibility of witnesses we have examined was superior to the credibility of those we have not seen. To this extent, therefore, thereare allegations on which our conclusions may do less than justice to the casemade to us by the army and police witnesses in that their account of events hasbeen thoroughly tested in our hearings yet we have been able to do little morethan report the evidence they have given to us.25. In three classes of cases however we have been able to go further thanmerely reporting a conflict of evidence and have been able to a greater or lesser extent, to form a view upon the facts of the matter in dispute.26. The first category is where internal evidence of inaccuracy is found inthe complainanfs statement itself.27. The second category arises from the existence of contemporary docu-mentary evidence, including photographs of complainants, and the informa-tion we have obtained by our personal visits about the topography, accom-modation and other physical features of the places where the events complained of took place. As will appear, the documentation that is of special value consists of the original medical notes and other records, made at the time, of the physical condition and treatment of individuals between arrest and lodgementin detention.28. The third category consists of the oral evidence that we have obtainedfrom the doctors and medical officers who examined and treated the arrestedpersons at various stages of the operation between reception at a RegionalHolding Centre and lodgement in detention. We have in many cases beenable to use this evidence, combined with the medical notes made by these samedoctors at the time, as confirming or correcting the allegations made by the
arrested persons. The weight of such evidence is derived from the professionalstatus of the doctors, from the fact that they are not persons against whomallegations have been made, and from our assessment, after lengthy oralexamination, of their attitude to the events in question and to the personswhom they were called upon to attend.
THE ARREST OPERATION ON THE 9th AUGUST, 197129. As explained to us, the overriding requirement that governed the planning and execution of this operation was that complete security should be maintainedabout the identity of the persons to be arrested and the date and time when thearrests were to be carried out. We understand that the authorities accepted thatin consequence of this security requirement, the operation would be carried outwith a considerable element of local improvisation and might be attended bysome administrative confusion, but that they considered this to be the lesser evilin relation to the paramount need to maintain security and achieve surprise.30. A factor that added to the element of improvisation in one particular area was the decision, taken late on the 7th August, not to locate the BelfastRegional Holding Centre in Crumlin Jail itself as had been planned up to thatdate but to set up the Holding Centre in the adjacent Girdwood Park TerritorialArmy Centre. We have no doubt that some of the defects in the arrangements atGirdwood, which we notice later in this Report, are to be attributed to this last minute change of plan.31. The operation consisted of five phases as follows: (a) The arrests32. Parties of soldiers effected arrests according to lists prepared by theRoyal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch. Very occasionally RUC officersacted as guides but in all cases the arresting was done by the military. Speed wasthe prime consideration to avoid the chance of hostile crowds gathering even atthat early hour. Each arrester completed a report relating to the person hearrested.33. The arrests took place at 0430, or as near to that time as possible, onMonday, the 9th August. Each soldier making an arrest was instructed to say:- &quot;I am arresting you under the powers conferred by the Civil Authori-ties (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922&quot;and to add, if a person questioned the arrest in any way, no more than: &quot;I am not required to give any further explanation. I warn you thatif you resist arrest you may have committed an offence.&quot;34. As to the manner of arrests, the arresting soldiers were governed by ageneral instruction requiring them never to use more force than the minimum necessary to enable them to carry out their duties. Except in one Brigade area,they had no specific orders about the use of restraints on arrested persons.(b) Transport to Regional Holding Centre35. There were 3 Regional Holding Centres, each under the overall charge ofa senior officer where identification of arrested persons was confirmed and thedecision taken whether they should be detained or released. These were
Magilligan Weekend Training Centre in County Londonderry, BallykinlerWeekend Training Centre in County Down and Girdwood Park TerritorialArmy Centre in Belfast.36. In Belfast the movement of the arrested person was short in time anddistance from the point of arrest to a rendezvous for preliminary identification(often at the vehicle to be used for the next stage of the journey) and thence tothe Regional Holding Centre at Girdwood Park. In the other two regions thedistances were in most cases much greater and the arrested person was usuallytaken from the point of arrest to a rendezvous for preliminary identification(normally at an established point like a barracks) designated a Prisoner Col-lection Point (P.C.P.) and thence to either the Ballykinler or Magilligan RegionalHolding Centre.(c) Processing at the Holding Centres37. All arrested persons were interviewed by R.U.C. Special Branch officersprior to the decision about detention. The processing at Holding Centres lastedfrom early the 9th August to early the 11th August, but arrested persons whom it was decided not to detain were released at any time during that 48 hours.38. At all the Holding Centres a uniform system of records was maintained,including entry and exit registers and a photograph of each arrested person onentry. At Ballykinler and Magilligan a medical officer was in post who carriedout an examination of each arrested person on entry and recorded the resultof the examination. At Girdwood a medical orderly was in attendance and a doctor was within call at 30 minutes&apos; notice. There was no system of medical examination on entry.(d) Transport to places of detention39. Arrested persons who were to be detained (apart from a limited numbermentioned in the next paragraph) were sent by helicopter from Ballykinler andMagilligan to the Maidstone in Belfast harbour, and on foot from Girdwood toCrumlin Jail. Girdwood is immediately adjacent to the Prison, and the arrestedpersons passed into the Prison through a hole, made early on the 9th August, inthe wall that divides the Prison area from Girdwood Park. Also a wing of the prison was used as an annex to the Girdwood Regional Holding Centre.(e) Special Questioning40. A limited number of persons whom it had been decided to detain wereselected for interrogation in depth and on the 11th August were moved for thatpurpose from their Holding Centres to a place other than the place specified inthe detention order before being lodged in detention in Crumlin Jail on the 16thand 17th August. (This special class of arrested persons is covered in section of our Report.)41. The number of persons arrested and handled by the Holding Centres was as follows: Ballykinler      Magilligan    Girdwood ParkArrested and admitted to regional Holding Centre 89 68 185Moved into detention 80 40 117Released 9 28 68
PATTERN OF COMPLAINTS42. The complaints investigated by us related to actions from arrest toarrival at one or other of the Regional Holding Centres, to events at the Centres,and to a place at which interrogation in depth took place. While many of the complaints were of an individual nature, others fell into categories where anumber of complainants alleged that they were collectively subjected to treat-ment of which they complained. Although the individual complaints must bedealt with separately, we have found it convenient to group together the above-mentioned categories for the purpose of our Report. In listing these categorieswe have used names that correspond to descriptions and references commonlyused in complainants&apos; statements and press reports. These names are not to betaken as indicating the precise nature of these events as they appeared oninvestigation. These groups we deal with under the following headings: (a) Interrogation in Depth.(b) The Helicopter Incident (Girdwood Park).(c) The &quot;Obstacle Course&quot; (Girdwood Park).(d) Late Releases on the 10th August (Girdwood Park).(e) Special Exercises (Ballykinler).

Under our terms of reference we are asked to examine allegations inrespect of persons who were questioned in depth after a detention order hadbeen made against them. Like the other complainants with whom we areconcerned, these men were arrested on the 9th August: but whereas the othersthen arrested were either released or placed in detention by the 11th August,these men were on that date removed to another place for a period of intensivequestioning before being lodged by the 17th August in the place specified inthe detention order.44. Complaints of 11 men have been transmitted to us, which includespecific allegations of physical ill-treatment during this period of intensivequestioning. The men are: James AuldJoseph ClarkeMichael Joseph DonnellyKevin HannawayPatrick Joseph McCleanFrancis McGuigan*Sean McKennaGerald McKerrPatrick McNallyPatrick Joseph ShiversBrian TurleyTimetable of Events45. We have ascertained that the timetable of events for all the men inthis category was as follows: 11th August 0630 Arrival from a Regional Holding Centre at aninterrogation centre (hereinafter called &quot;the centre&quot;).11th August 1545 Departure from the centre to Crumlin Jail for service of detention and removal orders, returning to the centre on thesame day by 1900 hours.11th August-1900 to 17th August-1150 (in one case until 1115on 16th August)  Held at the centre.17th August 1150 Departure from the centre to be lodged in detention in Crumlin Jail.* Whilst Mr. McGuigarTs name is included in this list because we understand the Sunday times had sight of a statement from him, we have seen no such statement ourselves. The Sunday times tell us they inadvertently returned the original without taking a copy. For this reasonwe have been unable to investigate any specific allegations, although we have ascertained Mr.McGuigan was at the interrogation centre at the same time as the other men.
Government Policy in Relation to Interrogation46. In the course of our investigation we were requested by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to receive a note on the subject of Government policy in relationto interrogation methods. We were asked also to include this note in our reportfor publication. It runs as follows: &quot;NOTE ON INTERROGATION(1) The general rules governing the custody of detainees and the processes of interrogation have been reviewed from time to time bythe Government Departments and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal security operations in which H.M.G. have been involved since the last war. The techniques of in-terrogation currently in use have also been employed in many previousinternal security situations. The latest instructions on the rules to befollowed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide forthe daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommenda-tions in the Report on the Aden situation by Mr. Roderic Bowen, Q.C.,issued in November, 1966 (Cmnd. 3165).(2) These general rules include the following safeguards: (a) Medical examination and record of weight of subject onadmission and discharge.(b) Subjects to be seen daily by a Medical Officer.(c) The following are prohibited: (i) Violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, crueltreatment and torture.(ii) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliatingand degrading treatment.(d) Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline.(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatmentof persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbancesas laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative tothe Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949)).(3) The precise application of these general rules in particular cir-cumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on thepart of those immediately responsible for the operations in question.Intelligence is the key to successful operations against terrorists; and the key to intelligence is information regarding their operations, their dis-positions, and their plans. When combating a terrorist campaign time is of the essence; information must be sought while it is still fresh sothat it may be used as quickly as possible to effect the capture of persons,arms and explosives and thereby save the lives of members of the security forces and of the civil population.(4) Information can be obtained more rapidly if the person beinginterrogated is subjected to strict discipline and isolation, with a restricteddiet; but violence or humiliating treatment, as explained above, areforbidden. Equally any person undergoing interrogation must be assured of security against either violent treatment by his fellow detainees or
recognition by them; the evidence of I.R.A. vengeance against informersunderlines the importance of this safeguard.&quot;47. The evidence we received from the officials we interviewed about theapplication of the general rules set out in the Government memorandum wereproduce above can be summarised as follows: The objectives mentioned in the memorandum may involve the use of thefollowing methods, the circumstances and duration of whose application mayvary according to the staff and accommodation available at the interrogationcentre and the length of time for which detainees may be left alone or mustbe kept together: (a) Wall Standing48. Requiring detainees to stand with their arms against a wall but not ina position of stress provides security for detainees and guards against physicalviolence during the reception and search period and whenever detainees aretogether outside their own rooms in a holding room awaiting interrogation.It also assists the interrogation process by imposing discipline. Although thesecurity need for this technique could be reduced by an increase of staff suffi-cient to provide for the separate custody of each individual while in transitbetween his own room and the interrogation room, there would be increasedrisks of physical contact between detainees and guards.(b) Hooding49. The hood (a black pillow-slip which the detainee is not required to wearwhile he is being interrogated or while he is alone in his room) reduces to theminimum the possibility that while he is in transit or with other detainees hewill be identified or will be able to identify other persons or the locations towhich he is moved. It thus provides security both for the detainee and for hisguards. It can also, in the case of some detainees, increase their sense of isola-tion and so be helpful to the interrogator thereafter.(c) Noise50. The continuous noise to which detainees may be subjected preventstheir overhearing or being overheard by each other and is thus a furthersecurity measure. By masking extraneous sound and making communicationmore difficult it may enhance the detainee&apos;s sense of isolation.(d) Bread and Water Diet51. A diet of bread and water at six-hourly intervals may form part of the atmosphere of discipline imposed upon detainees while under control for thepurpose of interrogation. The rules about medical inspection are referred toin paragraph 2 of the Note above.52. These methods have been used in support of the interrogation of asmall number of persons arrested in Northern Ireland who were believed to possess information of a kind which it was operationally necessary to obtainas rapidly as possible in the interest of saving lives, while at the same timeproviding the detainees with the necessary security for their own persons andidentities.
Course of Investigation53. It has been our object in this, as in the other areas of our investigation,to test allegations of physical ill-treatment against all evidence, documentaryand oral, that we can get in order as far as we can to establish the facts aboutthe treatment that took place. We have had unrestricted access to all the records made at the time, and taken evidence from the persons who supervisedthe operation.Oral Evidence54. We took oral evidence from persons who supervised the operations atthe centre. From them we received a detailed account of the arrangementsfor conducting the operation, as ordered before the event and as executed inthe event. They also gave us their eyewitness accounts of the treatment andbehaviour of the persons making allegations. In particular we have had thebenefit of evidence from the medical officer who was stationed at the centrethroughout the operation. He was able to substantiate and amplify to us the written records he made at the time of each complainants physical conditionon entering the centre on the 11th August and in leaving it on the 16th or 17thAugust. In addition, he was able to tell us about the conditions of the com-plainants during their stay in the centre, as ascertained by him when he visitedthem daily in the course of the operation. He told us that those in charge ofthe centre had impressed him with their concern to avoid physical injury totheir charges and had given him every support in allowing him to exercise hisprofessional duties. We put on record that both in his actions as recorded andby his evidence given to us, this officer satisfied us as having maintained the standards of the medical profession to which he belongs.Documentary Evidence55. The contemporary documentation which we studied, and which was ofthe first importance in testing the facts, including: id) The entry medical record, written by the doctor when he examined eachdetainee on entry into the centre on the 11th August. The purpose ofthis examination was for the doctor to certify whether the detainee wasfit for interrogation: we have confirmed that before he did so he wasbriefed as to the conditions that the interrogatee would experience. the patient was stripped and examined, his medical history and present state of health ascertained and recorded, with notes of the patienfsweight and the existence or otherwise of cuts, bruises or other bodilydamage.(b) The exit medical record, written by the same doctor, when he examined the detainee on leaving the centre.(c) Colour photographs of the detainee, naked, back view and front view,likewise taken on his leaving the centre.id) The prison medical record of the examination carried out by the prisondoctor after the detainee was lodged in detention in Crumlin Jail.(e) The feeding record. We have examined the contemporary record whichwas kept showing the time at which each detainee was offered drinkand food, if he took it and what he took.
The Allegations56. We deal first with those allegations of physical ill-treatment common toall or most of the complainants and turn thereafter to allegations limited to particular individuals.Common Allegations57. All the interrogatees whose statements we saw complained of one or more of the following matters: (a) HoodingHead hooded in a navy or black coloured bag of tightly woven or hessiancloth at all times other than interrogation interviews.(b) NoiseHeld in a room where there was a continuous noise variously described as loud and deafening like the escaping of compressed air, the roar ofsteam, the whirring of helicopter blades, or a drill. Returned to the roomwith this noise between periods of interrogation.(c) Enforced posture on wallFacing wall, hands high above head on wall: legs spread apart; forcedwith batons to maintain posture; so kept till collapsed, when lifted up again; treatment continued for 2 or 3 days, or up to 4 days.(d) SleepVariously complained that had none for 2 or 3 days or very little.(e) FoodVariously complained that deprived of food for 2 or 3 days, or that dietseverely restricted to occasional administration of dry bread and a cup ofwater until the last day or so. One man (Mr. Shivers) said he had nothing to drink for the first 4-5 days.Common Allegations Evidence of Supervising Staff58. The persons supervising the operation commented as follows: Hooding59. It was confirmed that the detainees were required to be kept fully hoodedexcept when interrogated or in rooms by themselves. This meant, therefore, thathooding was confined to journeys outside the centre or movement within it andto the periods when complainants were held jointly or at the wall (see below).We were told that in fact some complainants kept their hoods on when theycould have removed them if they wished.Noise60. It was confirmed that while the detainees were held together pendinginterrogation or between interrogations, they were subjected to a continuoushissing noise, or electronic &quot;mush&quot;, loud enough to mask extraneous sounds and prevent effective oral communication between detainees. The noise was neutral,i.e. no music or speech sounds were intruded.Posture on the Wall61. It was confirmed that from time to time pending and between interroga-tions, the detainees were made to stand against a wall in a required posture
(facing wall, legs apart, leaning with hands raised up against wall) for anythingbetween 4 and 6 hours, except for periodical lowering of the arms to restorecirculation. It was pointed out that the posture was not the same as the searchposition. This was not a stress posture: that is, the legs were not so wide apart,the arms so stretched up, or the weight of the body put forward to the same extent as in the search position.62. It was confirmed that detainees attempting to rest or sleep by proppingtheir heads against the wall were prevented from doing so. If a detainee collapsedon the floor, he was picked up by the armpits and placed against the wall to resume the approved posture. (In Mr. McClean&apos;s case it was said that he persisted in collapsing from the start and after a short time was not forcibly held up butallowed to lie on the floor.) Although a number of complainants alleged rough-ness and beatings, it was denied that any excessive force was used to keep people in the posture or make them resume it. The staff were instructed, for example, to part legs not by kicking or hacking them but by pushing them outwards with the inner calf of their own legs. No-one was batoned to make him stay against the wall or was otherwise beaten whilst in the position.63. In only one case was it necessary to use any considerable degree of physical constraint. This was the case of Mr. Clarke, with which we deal below.In the other cases (though not, as mentioned, in that of Mr. McClean) we were told that the atmosphere of rigid discipline was largely effective in its purpose,and, therefore, to enforce the posture any substantial degree of physical force was unnecessary and was not used. In the circumstances there had to be bodilycontact between guards and detainees, but the guards had been specially trainedto handle detainees by methods which avoided violence or physical damage.64. We find from our inspection of the records kept at the time of this operation that the men were at the wall for periods totalling as follows: Mr.	Auld	43^ hours	Mr.	Clarke	40	hoursMr.	Donnelly	9	hoursMr.	Hannaway	20	hoursMr.	McClean	29	hoursMr.	McGuigan	14	hoursMr.	McKenna	30	hoursMr.	McKerr	15	hoursMr.	McNally	13	hoursMr.	Shivers	23	hoursMr.	Turley	9	hours65. We were told that the interrogatees were not made to stand at the wallin the required posture throughout. As stated above, the period of standing was-6 hours at a time. At other times they would have been sitting against the wall.The evidence regarding Mr. McClean, as we note in paragraph 62 was that,though at the wall for 29 hours, he was hardly in the required posture at all.Sleep66. It was confirmed that it was the general policy to deprive the men of opportunity to sleep during the early days of the operation.Food and Drink67. The records we examined showed that bread and water was offered at
6-hourly intervals from 1230 on the 11th August until the morning of the 15thAugust, when the diet began to be increased to normal rations. Hot soup wastaken at 2230 on the 13th August by all interrogatees except Mr. McClean who refused it, and we were told that a cereal had been offered earlier that evening.It appears that Mr. Auld accepted food and drink whenever offered betweenthe 11th and 15th August except for two occasions when we understand he wassleeping. Mr. Clarke refused bread on eight occasions. Mr. Donnelly acceptedfood and drink whenever offered. Mr. Hannaway refused bread altogether on occasions, and ate only part of what was offered on 5 other occasions; he didnot always drink all the water offered. Mr. McClean refused both food and drinkon 5 occasions, and refused bread alone on a further 4 occasions. Mr. McGuigandid not drink all the water offered on two occasions, otherwise accepted food and drink when offered. Mr. McKenna refused food and drink on the first occasionit was offered, but took it thereafter, save once when he was sleeping. Mr. McKerraccepted food and drink when offered except for a period of sleep on the 14thAugust. Mr. McNally refused food twice, and took only half what was offeredon two other occasions. Mr. Shivers consistently refused bread, eating only asmall fraction of what was offered on only one occasion; he refused water, ortook very little, on 3 occasions. Mr. Turley accepted food and drink except forone period when he was sleeping.Weight68. The records kept by the doctor for each detainee on entering and leaving the centre all show loss of weight during the time spent there.Particular Allegations69. A number of interrogatees made specific complaints of ill-treatment atthe centre which are not comprised in the matters set out in the preceding paragraph, and with these we now deal.70. James Auld: When he had been placed against the wall in the requiredposture he asked to go to the toilet; he was refused, and his hooded headbanged against the wall for talking. When his back arched a baton was rammedinto it to straighten it.71. Joseph Clarke: When in the required position against the wall, his handskept going numb. If as a result he closed his fist, his hands were beaten againstthe wall till he opened them and replaced them in the required posture. If herested his head against the wall it was banged and shaken. After interrogationhe was beaten until he collapsed. When brought round he was beaten again,and fought back. He then suffered another severe beating. He continued tofight back, and his wrists were handcuffed behind his back. The handcuffswere pulled back as he stood with his head to the wall, causing his wriststo be chafed and cut.72. Michael Joseph Donnelly: If he did not keep his head straight and hisback rigid in the required posture at the wall, he was struck with a fist. on occasions, though not, he says, very often, he was struck in the genitals witha hard object, and on other occasions a similar object was thrust into his anus.73. Kevin Hannaway: If he relaxed from the required posture at the wall hewas kicked, &quot;kneed&quot; and beaten with fists. On another occasion his head was
beaten against the wall. A further allegation appeared in the Irish Press ofthe 18th August, that Mr. Hannaway had a head wound requiring 27 stitches.74. Patrick Joseph McClean: He was assaulted on a number of occasions,in different ways. He was bounced on, and rolled along, the ground, punchedwith fingers in the stomach, kicked in the testicles, his arms were twisted back-wards and his head bumped on the floor and he suffered various other assaultsof varying severity. As to toilet facilities Mr. McClean says: &quot;Toilet, no. Wetwhere we lay. No inclination to excrete. Slept in wet.&quot;75. Sean McKenna: He was beaten on the legs, hands and buttocks to forcehim to maintain the required posture at the wall.76. Gerald McKerr: He was beaten around the kidneys when he collapsedfrom the required posture. He kept falling and was invariably beaten when he did so.77. Brian Turley: He was kicked and beaten in an effort to force him toadopt the required posture on the wall and after interrogation his head wasrammed several times against a door.Particular Allegations Evidence of Supervising Officers78. Mr. Auld&apos;s complaint that he was refused permission to relieve himself was denied. It was not clear to us how a man in the required posture, hoodedand surrounded by a loud noise, was expected to indicate his need. We were told he would have to use gestures. Such gestures might initially be construedmerely as an attempt to move from the required posture. If this were so, hewould be put back in the posture in the manner described, at any rate to start with. We were however told that lavatory facilities were available and wereregularly used under escort by all the interrogatees, with the exception ofMr. McClean. We were told that many interrogatees used these facilities on theoccasion of an interrogation.79. No abnormality in Mr. Auld&apos;s physical condition was detected on examination by the centre medical officer on admission to the centre. on examination when leaving on the 17th August, the medical officer noted an area of paraesthesia (pins and needles) in the right arm. In Crumlin Jail the prison medical officer noted on examination on the 17th August &quot;Pain in leftwrist. Normal appearance. Complains of tenderness and movements slightlyrestricted. Appendix scar.&quot;80. In reply to Mr. Clarke&apos;s complaint about the beating of his numb handswe were told that in a number of instances as a result of maintaining the required posture for a considerable period an interrogatee would find his handsor arms had become numb. In such cases the guards would rub the hands, orswing the arms, of the interrogatee to restore normal feeling. The complaints of beating are denied. We were however told that Mr. Clarke was a strongyoung man who resisted with considerable force attempts to make him adoptand maintain the required posture. It is admitted that in order to restrain himhe was handcuffed. We have seen a contemporary note that the first pair ofhandcuffs were too small for him, and chafed his wrists. A larger pair wasfitted, and Mr. Clarke&apos;s wrists were treated with ointment. Mr. Clarke&apos;s medicalrecords show that on entry into the centre no defects were observed in his
upper or lower limbs. The medical officer at the centre, in the course of hismorning rounds on the 13th August, observed that Mr. Clarke&apos;s ankles wereswollen and bruised. This was at 1130. At a later examination on the same day (1730) he observed an effusion (i.e. swelling due to fluid on the joint) ofthe right knee. He had the knee bandaged and advised that Mr. Clarke be handled properly, and allowed to be seated with his leg straight. On the 15thAugust he noted that the knee and ankle swellings were improving. On leavingon the 17th August Mr. Clarke&apos;s medical record shows him as having aneffusion of the right knee after a fall on it. When examined on the 18th Augustat Crumlin Jail, this condition was confirmed and he was wearing a crepebandage over the knee. He was treated in the prison with an analgesic, andthe bandaging was continued. The photographs taken on departure from thecentre show a crepe bandage from the top of the right knee, over the knee cap,to half way down the shin, and a red mark on the rear of the left arm above theelbow. The notes made at the time by the supervisors at the centre show thatMr. Clarke was aggressive and resisted strongly. They could not tell us how theinjuries were suffered.81. Mr. Donnelly&apos;s complaint of beating was denied. We were told that theguards responsible had been carefully briefed in, and required to practise,procedures that avoided violence or the infliction of injury. No abnormalitywas detected in Mr. Donnelly&apos;s condition on arriving at, or leaving, the centre.No violence towards him had been observed by the supervisors. At CrumlinJail, the prison medical officer recorded that he had examined Mr. Donnellyon the 18th August, and found: &quot;... numbness left thumb full movement.Superficial abrasions dorsum of wrist&quot;. No complaint of injury to the genitalsis recorded. The evidence we heard does not explain the finding of minorinjuries by the prison medical officer.82. Mr. Hannaway&apos;s complaints, and the allegation concerning his headwound, were denied. On admission to the centre the medical officer recordeda graze on the upper lumbar spine. No mention of this appears in the note ofthe medical examination on leaving the centre on the 17th August. On examina-tion at Crumlin Jail the prison medical officer recorded: &quot;Superficial contusionsright shoulder. Eczema of right calf. Black eye left. Betnovate ointment....&quot;The evidence we heard threw no light on the origin of the injuries. The medical officer at the centre and the prison medical officer have confirmed to us thatMr. Hannaway did not have a sutured (i.e. stitched) scalp wound.83. We noted also that the entry medical record contained the entry &quot;? heartattack&quot;. We were told that it was Mr. Hannaway not the medical officer whohad raised the question of heart trouble. The medical officer had contactedMr. Hannaway&apos;s doctor and obtained copies of his medical record. The medical officer told us that this showed Mr. Hannaway had had Reynaud&apos;s diseasesince a child, but that otherwise there was nothing abnormal about his con-dition and no need for treatment. He was satisfied he was fit for interrogation.84. Mr. McClean&apos;s complaint that he was denied toilet facilities is mentionedabove, in connection with the similar complaint of Mr. Auld. In Mr. McClean&apos;scase however we were told by the supervisors that it was not true that oppor-tunity to relieve bowels or urinate was denied him or that it was several days before he was allowed to the toilet for the first time. The lavatory facilities were
there. It was Mr. McClean&apos;s own fault that he did not use them. Due they thought to the general policy Mr. McClean adopted of &quot;going limp&quot;, there had been 3such occasions. Once Mr. McClean had wet himself whilst at the lavatory, andhis overalls had been changed. On another occasion he had urinated on hismattress. A third time (when visited by the doctor and asked for a specimen) hehad urinated on the floor of his cell. The medical officer, in his oral evidence tous, confirmed that the lavatory facilities were satisfactory, available and used byall except Mr. McClean, who in his opinion did not use them on the occasionsmentioned because he chose not to do so.85. In the entry medical record the medical officer recorded, inter alia,&quot; Pepticulcer. Taking Aludrox.- Under Omagh County Hospital&quot;. The only otherabnormality then recorded was a slight expiratory wheeze. Mr. McClean&apos;sphysique was recorded as &quot;flabby&quot;. On examination on departure, the medical officer recorded: &quot;? peptic ulcer&quot; and observed also &quot;Bruising right shoulder and both legs&quot;. The prison medical officer, examining Mr. McClean on arrival atCrumlin Jail, recorded &quot;? Duodenal ulcer. Aludrox. 1 pint milk. Bronchitis.Black eye left. Contusions arms and chest. Prison Hospital&quot;.86. With reference to the entry &quot;peptic ulcer&quot; in his entry medical record, thecentre medical officer said he had later been satisfied that this was not a correctdescription of Mr. McClean&apos;s present condition. No tenderness was elicited on examination of the abdomen, and there appeared to be no symptoms whichcould be attributed to the presence of an active peptic ulcer. The history ofmedication had in fact been irregular, Mr. McClean taking medicine occasionallywhen he suffered from indigestion. Again, after careful observation, the medical officer had concluded Mr. McClean&apos;s action in flopping when placed at the wallwas in no way attributable to any medical condition: although flabby, and tending to obesity, there was nothing medically wrong. This view was confirmed to uslater by the prison medical officer who, although he admitted Mr. McClean tothe prison hospital for observation and treatment on arrival as recorded above,told us that he eventually came to the conclusion that his symptoms were notattributable to a peptic ulcer and that he had not suffered from bronchitis, asinitially suspected. The prison medical officer wrote to us later giving evidence to confirm that Mr. McClean was no longer complaining of abdominal pain andwas well. On leaving the centre, the only bruising seen by the centre medical officer, and recorded by him at the time, had been superficial. The black eye andother bruising noted on admission to the hospital were not present on departure from the centre.87. The centre medical officer in his evidence to us about his daily visits, made it clear he had had a good deal to do with Mr. McClean. On the first day (the11th August), in addition to the entry medical examination, he attended Mr.McClean in the evening and indicated at 2215 that he should be allowed to reston a mattress as long as necessary. (It was thought at that time Mr. McClean&apos;sapparent inability to stand at the wall might be due to unusual tiredness.) Themedical officer also examined Mr. McClean particularly the following day whenthe medical orderly had informed him at 1340 of a rise of one degree in Mr.McClean&apos;s temperature. This the medical officer thought might be due to a mildthroat infection. The pulse had always been normal. On the 15th August at 1100the medical officer, concerned at Mr. McClean&apos;s low fluid intake, ordered a supplementary fluid diet for him that included sweet tea at half-hourly intervals.
In general, the medical officer said Mr. McClean had always behaved verypolitely to him and he had never complained to him at all. Far from fluids beingdenied, they had been pressed upon him.88. Mr. McKenna&apos;s complaint of beating is denied, and we have found noother evidence which throws any light on the fact that the departure medicalrecord shows &quot;a few small bruises, right ankle, left shin&quot;. The entry and departurerecords also show &quot;mild heart trouble. Hernia 3 years ago&quot;. Mr. McKenna had raised the question of previous heart trouble. The medical officer had questionedhim about it but had been satisfied from Mr. McKenna&apos;s account of his history and treatment that there was no need to pursue the question further withMr. McKenna&apos;s doctor. In the departure record a query mark is placed againstthe entry of heart trouble. Nothing abnormal was discovered on examination atCrumlin Jail by the prison medical officer on the 18th August, save a tinglingin the fingers of both hands.89. Mr. McKerr&apos;s allegation that he was beaten round the kidneys is denied,as is his more general allegation of beating. No abnormalities were detected ateither the entry or the departure medical examinations at the centre, nor (apartfrom defective vision clearly of long-standing) by the prison medical officer atCrumlin Jail.90. Mr. Turley&apos;s allegation of beating was denied, and there was no knowledgeof any incident such as he described at the conclusion of interrogation. Hiscondition showed no abnormality on entry medical examination. On departure,the centre medical officer recorded &quot;healing scars right knee and left shin&quot;. Weconfirmed the existence of such injuries from examination of photographs taken on departure. We heard no evidence to account for them. The entry made by the prison medical officer for Mr. Turley on admission to Crumlin Jail reads: &quot;Ecchymosis. Superficial abrasions left hand and right shin. Gave nohistory of cause.&quot;Conclusions91. The timetables of events given in some statements by interrogatees are clearly at variance with the written and oral evidence we have received. Weconsider that such discrepancies are readily explained by confusion as to timeand date which could follow from the hooded isolation in which these men were held.92. As regards the posture on the wall, we find that the action taken to enforcethis posture constituted physical ill-treatment. In Mr. McClean&apos;s case we draw attention to the evidence that he soon avoided the posture by repeated collapsingand to the evidence that the guards let him lie and did not use violence in overcoming his inertia. It therefore appears that any ill-treatment suffered byMr. McClean under this head was of comparatively short duration.93. As regards hooding, the general allegations are substantiated, and weconsider that they constituted physical ill-treatment.94. As regards noise, we find that the men were subjected to continuous andmonotonous noise of a volume calculated to isolate them from communication,and this we consider to be a form of physical ill-treatment.
95. As regards deprivation of sleep we consider that this constituted physicalill-treatment.96. As regards deprivation of food and water, we find physical ill-treatment inthe diet of 1 round of bread and 1 pint of water every 6 hours for men who werebeing exhausted by other measures at the same time. But in the light of thecontemporary documentation we find it difficult to give credence to the far more serious allegation by some detainees that they were denied food and water forlong periods, and think it was they who failed to take such food and drink as was offered to them.Particular AllegationsBeatings and other violence97. Eight of the complainants give particulars of being beaten, kneed andkicked in various parts of the body and at various times, but especially inconnection with the force that they say was used to make them maintain orresume the required posture on the wall. We make no findings under this head,for there is a conflict that we cannot resolve between the allegations and thedenials that have been made to us by the supervising staff who controlled theproceedings and saw what took place. While it cannot be regarded as con-clusive, account must be taken of the evidence adduced in support of thesedenials, consisting of (a) the special training given to the guards to handledetainees by methods which avoided violence or physical damage, and the constant supervision exercised over the operation to ensure that these methodswere used in practice and (b) the absence of any record of significant physicaldamage in the medical record made for each of these men, or of any sign of suchdamage in the photographs taken of these men, on exit from the centre on the16th and 17th August-except for the special case of Mr. Clarke dealt with sep-arately.98. We note that there is no evidence at all of a major trauma (again either from medical reports or photographs) that might have been expected to follow from some of the rough treatment complained of by individual detainees (e.g.being struck in the genitals, beating hands against the wall; punched withfingers in the stomach).99. We consider it probable that there could have been &quot;pins and needles&quot;and numbness in the fingers and hands as a result of prolonged pressure againstthe wall; we note here that supervisors must also have been aware of this possibility for active measures were taken to control it from time to time.Similarly, swelling of the ankles could be expected after periods of standingagainst the wall in this unnatural posture.100. In the particular case of Mr. Clarke, it is confirmed that the handling of him was more forcible because of his active resistance. The particular injuryfor which we have evidence is the effusion of his knee which occurred betweenthe two visits made by the doctor at 1130 and 1720 on the 13th August. Wehave not been able to ascertain how this happened but we are satisfied that thetreatment given to it in the centre was correct, that he was kept under medicalsupervision and that this treatment was continued after admission to CrumlinJail. We are not disposed to find that he suffered ill-treatment over and abovethe ill-treatment that he suffered in common with the other complainants.
101. Mr. McClean&apos;s specific allegations of physical assault are denied by those who supervised the llth-17th August operation. Their denial is confirmed by the evidence of the medical officer who visited him regularly during his 6days in the centre. The medical officers exit certificate of the 17th Augustrecords &quot;Bruising right shoulder and both legs&quot; which was not present on hisentry certificate on the 11th August. But the medical officer had emphasised tous that these bruises were superficial and, he thinks, consistent with the handlingrequired to move Mr. McClean who on account of his limp resistance had to becarried about the centre. The further injuries to Mr. McClean mentioned inthe 18th August medical records from Crumlin Jail, &quot;Black eye left. Contusionsarms and chest&quot;, are not, we think, due to action in the centre but must havebeen suffered by Mr. McClean in transit by lorry and helicopter from the centreto Crumlin Jail. Our enquiries have failed to establish when and how thisdamage took place. Mr. McClean himself makes no allegation of ill-treatmentduring his transit and it would therefore appear that the injuries were accidental.102. A similar comment applies in the case of Mr. Hannaway who wasrecorded as having a black eye on arrival at Crumlin Jail. He too made noallegation of ill-treatment in the course of the journey in question.103. Lavatory facilities In respect of the complaints by Mr. Auld and Mr.McClean we draw attention to the evidence that these facilities were not deniedand that Mr. McClean wetted his overalls, his mattress and his cell by his ownchoice.104. It will be noticed that while we are asked to investigate allegations of physical brutality, our conclusions are in terms of physical ill-treatment.105. Where we have concluded that physical ill-treatment took place, we arenot making a finding of brutality on the part of those who handled thesecomplainants. We consider that brutality is an inhuman or savage form ofcruelty, and that cruelty implies a disposition to inflict suffering, coupled withindifference to, or pleasure in, the victim&apos;s pain. We do not think that happenedhere.2. The Helicopter Incident106. The incident took place at the Girdwood Park Regional Holding Centre.The complainants were: Henry BennettThomas Gerard Johnston*       Gerard McErlean^      Desmond 0&apos;HaganGeorge Patrick 0&apos;HaraSeamus 0&apos;Toole or 0&apos;Tuathail107. Although they may have made other complaints dealt with elsewhere,we have here grouped together those parts of their complaints that have acommon basis. The allegations are that they were taken in parties of 5 by military policemen and forced to run over broken glass and rough stones to ahelicopter: that they were menaced by police dogs, kicked into a helicopter andpushed or forced to jump out after 15 seconds or so in it; that in one case whenthe helicopter had taken off a complainant whose hands were bound was
threatened with being thrown out above ground; and that they were forced tocrawl back to the building whence they had come being kicked, struck and calledabusive names. Reports in various versions were published in England in the daily Telegraph on the 17th August and in the Guardian on the 18th August,and in Ireland in the Irish Independent on the 17th and 18th August and theIrish News on the 18th August. In addition in many cases we have before uscopies of statements purporting to be made by the complainants.Sources of Evidence108. We took oral evidence from 11 members of the security forces. these included the senior military police officer who had, sharing responsibility with another officer of equal rank, been in charge during the events complained ofand a number of N.C.O.S who had participated in one or more of the sorties tothe helicopter and back. The documentary evidence examined included the records made by the medical officer on duty at Girdwood of any cases to whichhe attended and the records of the medical examinations given on reception tothe Prison proper to all men who left Girdwood for detention. We saw theground for ourselves.109. We travelled in a Wessex&apos;helicopter and familiarised ourselves with it.The oral evidence110. Our witnesses told us that the movement to and from the helicopter hadtaken place on the 9th August and according to a deliberate plan to stage a&quot;Deception&quot; the object of which was to deceive onlookers into believing thearrestees were being taken away from Girdwood. To this end an R.A.F. Wessexhelicopter flew into Girdwood. The scheme was to take out overtly to it parties of arrestees from the main building, place them momentarily aboard but thensurreptitiously remove them and conceal their return to the building, thehelicopter meanwhile taking off to all appearances with a full load. Thus it was hoped onlookers and Girdwood was overlooked from a number of directions would believe an airlift was taking place. This in turn might help to reduce theattention being paid to Girdwood from outside and obviate the danger of attack on its perimeter or attempted interference within e.g. by sniping.111. &quot;Deceptions&quot; had taken place 5 times, the first 3 with arrestees and thelast two with dummy runs involving members of the security forces only. Onthe &quot;live&quot; runs the procedure had been for the military police to assemble parties of arrestees within the building, escort them at an ordinary pace from thebuilding to the helicopter parked with rotors running about 40 yards away, and place them aboard. The R.A.F. crewman would then close the doors, and after a brief interval open them for the arrestees to get out. This time the men would return in the custody of the military police, but in a much tighter formationdesigned to protect their charges from view. The return involved the arresteesbeing made to adopt a crouching posture and moving as quickly as that postureallowed, back to the building.112. Our witnesses, including the R.A.F. crewman, were unanimous that noarrestee had at any time been in the helicopter when it left the ground nor hadanyone been in the helicopter with them during their short stay inside exceptfor the R.A.F. crewman. No force had been used to push men in or pull menout of the helicopter and no-one had been inside to force them out except for
the crewman. It was contrary to R.A.F. orders to touch passengers, and hehad not touched them. No-one had used their batons or their personal weaponsif they had them, to strike arrestees. The crouching posture on return to thebuilding had been signalled to the arrestees and enforced by bodily pressureonly, i.e. each man had been held by one arm and the escorfs free arm had been used to press him down on the shoulders or small of the back if he tried tostraighten up. But beyond this, no-one had been dragged or forced to crawl.Making arrestees crawl would not have helped to secure deception. It would merely have elongated the concealing escort and prolonged excessively theperiod of return to the building.113. An attempt was made to select only the apparently fit. Witnesses also said the purpose of the exercise had not been explained to the arrestees; indeed,some of the military police themselves had not fully understood at first what had been afoot. Some of the arrestees asked what was happening but the policy was not to brief them lest, if they were released, the security of the exercisewould be compromised. One man had attempted to break away on approaching the helicopter, but had been manhandled without undue roughness back to his place. The escorts had not been allocated specific arrestees and often had adifferent man on the return journey. Two or three had slipped and fallen on thereturn. Witnesses were divided about how the arrestees were shod: most thought they wore socks or plimsolls; one clearly recollected a man wearing shoes: andthe crew member recollected them as all having footwear.114. Witnesses denied there had been anything unusual about the terrain:there had been no glass or other obstacles; apart from a flower bed, the routeafter the tarmac in front of the building was entirely grass. There had been dogsabout at the time of the operation but they had at all times been tied up againstone of the surrounding vehicles. Whilst one or more dogs may have becomeagitated, none was near enough to threaten damage to the arrestees even whenon its lead. The helicopter engine made so much noise it would have beenvirtually impossible for the arrestees to have heard abusive language if it hadbeen used but it had not.Documentary evidence115. None of the complainants was treated by the medical officer at Gird-wood. Of those admitted to Crumlin Jail the prison medical officer recorded onreception two cases of duodenal ulcer for which he prescribed aludrox and 1extra pint of milk daily (Mr. 0&apos;Hara and Mr. 0&apos;Toole) and one case with ahistory of a gastric ulcer, then asymptomatic (Mr. Johnston).Conclusions116. We are satisfied that the allegations relate to this deception operation at Girdwood on the 9th August, in which the complainants were made to take part.117. We draw attention to the evidence contradicting the allegations of men being taken off the ground in the helicopter, threatened with dogs or otherwiseassaulted. In this regard we give special weight to the evidence of the R.A.F.crewman, who has the status of an independent eye-witness in that he was in no way concerned with the custody or control of the arrested men, and was onlyconcerned with the safe operation of the helicopter. In particular, we accept his
denial of the allegation that the complainants were taken off the ground in thehelicopter (an action incidentally which would have defeated the purpose ofthe operation as a deception) and of the allegations that military policemenaccompanied them into the helicopter and pushed them out of it. We alsodiscount allegations of physical action by military policemen in or near thehelicopter being backed by verbal threats and abuse, since we established thatthe rotors of the helicopter were in motion throughout the time the men got in and out of it, and it is a fact that the noise of the Wessex helicopter enginedrowns speech. Having ourselves inspected the site of the helicopter landing inrelation to the entrance to the main building we know that the route to andfrom the helicopter went over 10 yards of tarmac, a flower bed and some 30yards of grass, and do not accept the allegation that the complainants were forced to run over broken glass and rough stones. (There may be some con-fusion here between this incident and the so-called &quot;obstacle course&quot;: see paragraphs 120-136.)118. The movements of the complainants, as substantiated by the evidence ofthe army witnesses, consisted of being made to walk under escort for the 40yards from the building to the helicopter, climb aboard, then after a few seconds(when the helicopter did not leave the ground) get down and move, hastened bytheir escorts and held down in a crouched position, over the 40 yards back tothe building. It does not seem that these movements resulted in any physicaldamage to any of the complainants, apart perhaps from accidental and verysuperficial injury. Nor do we think that the escorts who applied some force tothe complainants in order to move them with haste in the required posture,did it in order to hurt them.119. While, however, we make no finding of brutality, we are disposed to criticise the action taken to force the complainants to take part in this deceptionoperation. The purpose for which they were held at Girdwood was that of identification and questioning to decide whether they should be released orlodged in detention. Their use as actors in the deception operation lay outsidethat purpose, and we think it was a questionable decision so to use them. Theywere not told why they were being made to take part in the act. It is under-standable that they should have been frightened by the unknown and shouldhave thought in the absence of any other reason, that the intention must be tovictimise them by putting them through a meaningless exercise involvingphysical hurt or the threat of it. In fact, as we have said, they seem to have suffered no physical damage: but we think the physical experience they were forced to go through under these circumstances does constitute a measure ofill-treatment.3. The &quot;Obstacle Course&quot;120. These incidents took place at Girdwood Park Regional Holding Centre.The complainants are: Brendan AndersonMichael Oliver BradyGerard CampbellThomas Joseph ConlonSean DrummMichael Farrell
Eamon KerrGerard McErleanJames MooreJames MullanDesmond 0&apos;HaganSeamus 0&apos;Toole or 0&apos;Tuathail121. Whilst they may have made other complaints dealt with elsewhere in our report, we have here grouped together those parts of their complaints that havea common thread. They alleged variously that they had been made to run overgranite chippings whilst being kicked and shouted at; that they had had to runbarefoot over an obstacle course of tree stumps, sharp stones, broken glass,tacks and garbage strewn in their way: that they had been abused verbally aswell as poked and struck with batons and that one man on complaining of glassin his foot had had a military policeman stamp upon it and that an R.S.M. had tried to stamp on the feet of others. Reports in various versions were published in England in the Guardian on the 18th August, the Daily Mail on the 19thAugust, the Sunday Times on the 22nd August and the Morning Star on the23rd August, and in Ireland in the Irish Independent on the 17th August, theIrish Press on the 18th August, the Irish Times on the 17th, 18th, 20th and 27thAugust, and the Sunday Independent on the 22nd August. In one case (Mr.Moore) a complainant came before us in person and made his allegations. Ina number of others we received typewritten copies of statements.Sources of evidence122. We took oral evidence from one complainant (Mr. Moore) and 19members of the security forces and prison service on duty or in charge at the relevant times. They included the senior infantry officer in charge of internal security at Girdwood, the senior military police officer, his N.C.O.S, the R.U.C.officers on duty at the material times, and members of escort parties. We alsosaw prison officers who had been on duty at material times within the Prisonitself. The documentary evidence we examined included the records made bythe medical officer on duty at Girdwood of any cases he saw, and the records ofthe medical examinations given to all men who had left Girdwood for detention,on reception in the Prison proper. In addition as we have already explained,we visited Girdwood and the Prison walking over the ground concerned.Oral evidence123. Mr. Moore told us he had been taken out of the main building by a sidedoor and entered a barbed wire corridor. He was not clear what time of theday it had been but, since the visibility had not been good, he thought it bestdescribed as twilight. There had been a wire stretched low across the ground inthe corridor and its purpose had been, he imagined, to make prisoners stumble,although he had not done so himself. He had not himself seen the wire, whichhe thought to be very thin; he had only felt it. After passing through the holein the wall of the Prison he had started to go up a grass bank to the footballpitch. Thereupon his escort had told him to go back and follow the perimeterroute. The first part of the route had consisted chiefly of housing bricks looselylaid as part of a hardcore base for a path. He had not had time to pick his way through them since he was being made to run. He got a cut on one foot butdescribed it to us as &quot;slight&quot; and &quot;nothing to talk about&quot;. He had passed over
some grass heaped on the path approximately half way between the hole in the wall and the first corner. He assumed there was glass underneath it because ashe trod on it he had heard a crackling noise like glass or possibly somethingsimilar like broken pottery. He had not seen underneath the grass because hehad had no time to inspect the surface. He had noticed no garbage near the route he followed. There had been no sniping that he noticed. R.U.C. officers had been standing openly on the football pitch and it was improbable theywould have done so if sniping had been going on. He had seen no dogs on the journey.124. The witnesses from the security forces said the arrestees in Girdwoodhad been moved through the hole in the wall to the Prison in two principalbatches. The first batch of 84 men went through in daylight during the morning of the 9th August and the second of 59 during the early and dark hours of the11th August.125. Members of the first batch on the 9th August were, after their document-tation and interview was completed in Girdwood, taken in parties of at most 6out of a side door of the building through the hole in the wall into the Prison,around the perimeter of the football pitch, through an inner gate and thenceto a wing of the Prison where they were in the custody of the R.U.C.126. The parties were escorted by a mixture of military police and infantry and followed by a dog handler with his dog. Each arrestee was accompanied bya military police N.C.O. and each party by a group of infantry 3-4 strong. Thelatter carried batons only and no firearms; the former generally had their personal weapons which were either pistols in holsters or sub-machine gunsslung on their backs. All the soldiers denied using abusive language but theyconfirmed their prisoners either wore stockings or went barefoot. There hadbeen running from the hole in the wall to the right angle turn at the corner ofthe football pitch but parties had not invariably been made to run along all or part of the route and the older men and the infirm were allowed to proceed attheir own pace.127. The route to the hole in the wall over the granite chippings was selectedbecause it had seemed the most direct. But beyond the hole in the wall no routehad been laid out within the prison itself. A number of witnesses were unclearwhy the perimeter route around the football pitch within the walls was chosen:most of them had simply followed the people in front; others guessed it was because it took the parties nearer to the prison walls where they were lessexposed and vulnerable to the danger of sniping. We are satisfied from otherevidence, however, that the perimeter route was in fact improvised and notchosen deliberately. The senior infantry officer in Girdwood had not understoodhis authority to extend beyond the wall and the first parties emerging throughthe hole in the wall had been informally directed to the perimeter route by a prison officer because it was less exposed either to the danger of sniping or tothe gaze of the regular prison inmates who might be unsettled and make adisturbance. The arrestees were without shoes because these had been put intheir property bags on arrival at Girdwood and the N.C.O.S in charge had understood their orders to be that men moved into the Prison should have their property bags with them but unopened. Some of the witnesses had assumedtheir charges had been unshod to lessen the danger of their attempting to escape.
128. Witnesses were unanimous that no-one was forced to run over glass,nails, tin-tacks, struck with batons and rifle butts, stamped upon or made tocrawl. Some arrestees had made abusive or threatening remarks to their escortsbut none had complained. None had been made to run through garbage,although they had passed near a garbage heap. The only timber on the routewas the chippings and twig remains (together with a few boxes) of what appearedto have been timber cutting in the Prison some time before the 9th August.Any logs had been piled up on the verge of the route.129. Dogs had been kept on the leash throughout, had followed at a distance of some yards behind the parties, and had generally cut diagonally across thefootball pitch itself rather than follow identically the route of the parties.130. The 59 men who had gone into the Prison during the early hours of the11th August had all been shod. They had taken the same route as the 9thAugust parties up to the hole in the wall but, thereafter, rather than following the perimeter route around the football pitch, they had taken the most directroute by going up the grass bank and out on to the pitch itself. This time theescorts had consisted of military police, infantry and some R.U.C. Each manhad been accompanied by a policeman and parties had, apart from the infirm,been ordered to run across the football pitch. Y/e think the route was acrossthe pitch and not round the perimeter because it was done in the dark. Theyran because the military police had so interpreted an order that arrestees shouldbe taken into the Prison as quickly as possible because of the sniping. Again,all witnesses denied there had been anyone who had been forced to run overglass, nails, tin-tacks, struck with batons, and rifle butts, stamped upon or madeto crawl. The dogs were withdrawn on this occasion and took, therefore, noescort role at all. Gunfire was going on and rounds had entered the vicinity.Neither on the 9th or the 11th August had an R.S.M. or similar figure been on duty.Documentary evidence131. There was no record of anybody being treated by the medical officerat Girdwood for cut feet and only one of the complainants in this case had been seen by him although some men had been brought back through the hole in the wall for treatment for one ailment or another at their request. (The medical officer at Girdwood treated Mr. Moore on the 10th August but only for a cut in his arm.) The prison medical officer recorded a statement by Mr. Brady thathe had glass in his foot but Mr. Brady himself alleged he had received thisbefore arriving in Girdwood (see paragraph 182 below). None of the othercomplainants detained were recorded by him as having symptoms in any way tobe associated with the alleged events.Inspection132. Our own inspection of the route on the 15th September showed that intwo places it presented difficulty to a barefoot pedestrian. The first was a shortstretch of path near some huts on the Girdwood Park side of the hole in the wall, where the surface was composed of small loose granite chippings. Theother was a stretch between the hole in the wall and the first angle in the Prisonwall where, in preparation for making a cement path, hardcore had been laid.This hardcore was largely composed of bricks and pieces of brick but included a little broken crockery.
Conclusions133. The allegation is that the men concerned were forced to run, unshod,over an &quot;obstacle course&quot;, that is over a route designed with the intention of doing them physical injury.134. We have no doubt that we have identified the &quot;obstacle course&quot; as the route that these parties of unshod men were made to take from Girdwoodthrough the &quot;hole in the wall&quot; into the Prison on the 9th August, particularly where the route traversed the chippings by the huts in Girdwood and took thehardcore path after passing through the hole in the wall. It was a route thatwould cause considerable discomfort to a man required to run over it barefoot:but on the evidence we see no reason to think that this route was chosen, still less prepared, with the intention of causing physical discomfort or injury tothe arrested persons who were made to go over it. The facts seem to be that the intended route went across the football pitch, but the first party as it arrivedthrough the hole in the wall into Prison territory was diverted on to the hardcorepath by a prison officer on grounds of prison discipline, and subsequent partiesfollowed the first. We have gone on to consider what if any measure of illtreatment the men suffered by being made to move hastily over a route adoptedby accident but which happened to have some rough features, especially forunshod men. We do not think that they were made to go unshod in order tohurt them. The removal of shoes from arrested persons in Girdwood was thestandard procedure to reduce the risk of attempted escape or assault. It wasthoughtless on the part of those who directed the movement on the 9th Augustnot to realise that the going was rough in places and that the men concerned might reasonably be allowed some form of footwear, as indeed was done for thebatch of men who were moved on the 11th August. Again we have found no evidence to support the view that the escorts&apos; object in hastening them was to dothem injury, and we are disposed to accept the explanation that hastening action was taken on grounds of security. Moreover, the objective test of whetherill-treatment took place, would be found in any contemporary record of physicalinjury associated with the &quot;obstacle course&quot; and we notice the complete absenceof any such evidence, either in the record of cases treated by the Girdwoodmedical officer or in the medical records of the complainants who moved fromGirdwood into detention and were examined by the prison medical officer.135. Finally we derived considerable assistance from the evidence of Mr.Moore who (as we mention in paragraph 294) impressed us as a truthfulwitness. We think the wire which he encountered was a field telephone wirewhich we had observed crossing the path at the Girdwood side of the hole in the wall and had not been placed there as an obstacle. It is significant that Mr.Moore made no mention of garbage or tacks and that his opinion that therewas glass on the route was derived from &quot;hearing it crackle&quot; under grasscuttings and not from seeing it. Nor did he allege any beating or urging on withbatons. His complaint appeared to be more one of humiliation than of dangerof injury and he made light of the &quot;slight cut&quot; which he said he received on one foot.136. We have not investigated allegations of verbal abuse which lie outsideour terms of reference. As regards their physical treatment, our conclusion isthat the men concerned in this episode may have suffered some measure ofunintended hardship from the rough going. We are unable to reach a finding
on the allegations of assault by batons and stamping on feet, in the absence ofevidence from complainants.4. Late Releases on the 10th August (from Girdwood)137. The men who complained were: Brendan AndersonGerard McErleanJames Moore138. We deal here with the allegations common to all three relating to thecircumstances in which they were released from Girdwood on the night of the10th August. They claimed variously that they had been released at about 2300with a large group of others in the middle of a riot with bullets flying and someof the men had taken shelter for the night in an entry near the prison and atthe nearby Imperial Hotel. Versions of the allegations iu some cases were published in the Irish Independent of the 17th August and the Irish News of the18th August. We heard oral evidence from one of those involved, Mr. Moore.139. We saw 8 witnesses from the security forces. They included the seniormilitary police officer at Girdwood, a number of his N.C.O.S and the CampGuard Commander for that night. With one significant exception, we were unable to rely on any documentary evidence.140. Mr. Moore told us that he and some other men had been taken in a group to the Clifton Park Avenue gate of Girdwood. They had been released and none of them thought they had the option of staying. Conditions outsidewere dangerous. Mr. Moore saw soldiers in the street crouching in fire positions,looking out for snipers. As his white vest was prominent and an easy mark, hehad asked for and was given a khaki shirt to put over it. He got also a pair ofsocks to wear with his shoes. He judged it too dangerous to make for his homewhich was in an area subject to disturbance. He therefore made for a friend&apos;house in a quieter district but even so, narrowly escaped being shot on his way.He told us emphatically that he thought no-one should have been released untilthe following morning when things were quieter.141. The military police officer said that late on the 10th August it had beendecided to bring together in Girdwood Park all the men either already there orin the prison whom it had been decided to release. They were duly assembledand, where their clothing was inadequate, it was supplemented with army items.The men had been conducted to the Clifton Park Avenue exit of Girdwood inbatches between about 2230 and 2300. No-one had been forced to leaveGirdwood and the men had been encouraged to take the advice of the militaryand civilian police before leaving about the state of affairs in their various parts of the city, as well as the best routes in the circumstances to their ownhomes. No general invitation to stay overnight had been issued to anyone who might prefer it since the situation did not seem to merit it. There would havebeen no question of turning people out into a local gun-battle if one hadbeen going on. There had not been: firing could be heard in the area but norounds were entering the vicinity and there was no rioting in the street. Thiswitness understood that, although no general invitation was issued, two men had stayed in Girdwood overnight.
142. We also saw two military police N.C.O.S who had been concerned withthe release of the 50 men and had escorted batches to the gate. They bothcorroborated the officers account of the outside situation at the time of release.The first had offered advice about best routes and appropriate action on meetingarmed patrols. He said that no-one had showed reluctance to leave and it was an absolute fabrication to say that anyone had been forced out or that they hadbeen pushed out into gunfire.143. The second N.C.O. said he, too, had been active in advising the releasedmen. Whilst there was no local danger at Girdwood, a lot of distant firing couldbe heard and some men had been apprehensive about what they might findat home. One man from the first batch on hearing a burst of firing from theOld Park area had run shouting &quot;Don&apos;t shoot, I&apos;m on your side&quot; and hiscompanions had laughed because of his panic when the firing was not endanger-ing them. About half a dozen men had hung around outside the gates for about30 minutes talking amongst themselves. None had come back but there was nodoubt they would have been re-admitted to Girdwood had they wished it. Hewas sure one of the complainants and a companion had stayed overnight inGirdwood. The two had asked on departure whether they could stay. The N.C.O.had said it was not something he could authorise and advised them to approacha more senior rank. Although he had accompanied all further parties to thegate, he had not seen the complainant again and was positive he had not leftthat night. The N.C.O. knew the Imperial Hotel and thought that, if there hadbeen shooting locally as claimed, it would have been a silly place to stay since it would have been a target.144. The Camp Guard Commander told us there had been no threat to thesecurity of Girdwood or the Clifton Park Avenue Gate at the time the men were released. The procedure for opening the gate would have been for the militarypolice escorting the batches to vouch for them. Had there been any question offorcing men to leave he would have expected the gate picquet to have soughtdirections. They had not.145. We saw three R.U.C. officers who had been on duty in Girdwood andthe Prison on the night in question. Two separately told us there had been noshooting in the vicinity for some while before and some while after the men&apos;srelease. The third was less clear and, although he had not experienced difficultyhimself, thought a further colleague we were unable to see had remained behindfor some hours after the material time at Girdwood, waiting for the situationoutside to settle down before he went home.146. The officer who had had the closest contact with, and larger respon-sibility for, the released men said he had no doubt it had been right to releasethem when they were discharged. The only signs of disturbance had been firesvisible in the New Lodge Road district and sounds of gunfire from the Old Parkdistrict, neither areas threatening Girdwood. The group of 18-20 with whichhe had been most closely associated had been glad to be released. He had told them they could stay overnight at Girdwood if they wanted, but none had.They had been entirely free to leave and there had been no question of theauthorities keeping them any longer against their will. One man he knew wellhad wanted, as the officer had recommended, to go away by taxi and the officerhad lent him 25p for the fare. The R.U.C. officer had seen no men stay overnight
at Girdwood. The military police officer to whom we later put this point since it conflicted with his earlier evidence maintained his position saying the releasedmen would have been free to move at will in Girdwood except for the holdingarea in the gymnasium and they would have been indistinguishable from thelarge number of police officers there in plain clothes.147. None of the witnesses was able to say whether any of the men had gone to the Imperial Hotel for the night. Although this did not seem a crucial issue,enquiries were made at the hotel on our behalf. The hotel&apos;s register recordednone of the released men as having stayed on the 10th and 11th August.Conclusions148. There is a conflict of evidence between the complainants and the armyand police witnesses and we can make no finding, beyond drawing attention tothe absence of an entry in the Imperial Hotel Register which for what it isworth goes against the complainants&apos; account, and the evidence, independentlygiven to us by the military police and R.U.C. about (a) the absence of a gun-battle at the gates of Girdwood (b) the fact that the men were not made to leave and that some stayed. In this connection we think it should be noticed that inconnection with the release of Mr. Anderson from Girdwood the previous day(see paragraphs 165-176), we had good evidence that it was not the practice atGirdwood to force released persons to get out of the place.5. Special Exercises at Ballykinler149. In this case we investigated the allegations of: Peter Eugene CollinsDermot GourleyMichael Joseph HarveyRichard RodgersDesmond Smith150. Amongst other allegations made by these men we found that all madesimilar complaints about the exercises they were required to do at BallykinlerCamp. They say that after passing through the reception procedure at Ballykinlerthey were put in a hut and were ordered to sit on the floor. They were thenforced to carry out a series of floor exercises which were physically taxing andof long duration. These exercises included sitting with arms stretched upwardsfor 10-15 minutes, sitting with the arms clasped behind the head, lying on the floor with legs stiffly pressed on the floor and fingers touching the wall, andbending forward in the kneeling position, with the hands clasped behind the back at waist level until the head touched the floor. If anyone refused or failedto carry out an exercise he was kicked, punched or struck with a baton.151. Allegations of this kind were published in an article in the Irish times of the 26th August, reporting an interview with Mr. Rodgers. Other allegationsare contained in written statements by arrestees and particularly in a detailed statement by Mr. Harvey prepared by the Association for Legal Justice and sent to the Home Office.152. We heard evidence from 8 members of the security forces, including the senior R.U.C. officer responsible for reception arrangements at Girdwood and
2 detective sergeants R.U.C., one of whom assisted at reception, and the other of whom interviewed one of the complainants and took him home on the 10thAugust. We heard also the senior officer of the detachment of Royal MilitaryPolice at Ballykinler, two staff sergeants each in charge of a platoon of militarypolice, and two of their N.C.O.S. We visited Ballykinler, and were shown thearea of the camp used for the operations of the 9th, 10th and 11th August bysenior officers of units involved.153. We were told by the senior military witnesses that arrestees had beenput in huts which were empty of all furniture and fittings. The unit preparing the huts had been ordered to clear out furniture and fittings in order to removeall material from which makeshift weapons might be improvised. Each hutmight in use contain up to 30 arrestees, with 3 guards to supervise them. Atfirst the arrestees had to stand. At about 0730, however, the Special Branchofficers at the camp pointed out that, as they passed, they were visible from thewindows of the arrestees&apos; huts. They asked that the arrestees be prevented from seeing and identifying them. The R.U.C. accordingly asked that thearrestees sit down, to keep them below the window sill level of 4 feet 6 inches.By midnight on the 9th/10th August hessian screens were in position around the windows, but we understand that for the greater part of the daylight hoursof the 9th August the men in the huts were required to sit or lie on the floor.154. After a period of sitting on the floor, a number of arrestees complained of discomfort. Some movement was necessary to relieve stiffness and preventcramp. For reasons of security the military authorities were reluctant to permitrandom individual movement. The guards inside the perimeter of the campwere ordered to carry no weapons, either firearms or batons. We understoodthis was intended to prevent not so much the improper use by troops of suchweapons as their seizure by arrestees in an escape attempt. The guards in a hut,three men guarding perhaps thirty, were anxious at all time to preserve their authority over the arrestees, and to maintain control over movement in par-ticular.155. No general orders were given about exercise. The two staff sergeantscommanding the military police platoons, acting independently, told theirsubordinates that, if complaints were made, they should ensure that the arresteeschanged position. They assumed that one position would be periodically changedfor another on a word from one of the guards. The senior N.C.O. in each hut,according to the evidence given by army witnesses at this level, appears inpractice to have decided that from time to time the arrestees in his charge should be told to change their position; sometimes for example to sit with thelegs towards the wall, sometimes with back to wall. It was agreed by thesewitnesses that the arrestees were also instructed to do simple exercises, such asstretching forward in a sitting position to touch toes, or leaning back from asitting position, putting hands behind the neck or on top of the head. The armywitnesses said that there were no complaints about the exercises.156. We heard conflicting evidence about the extent to which arresteesunderstood the purpose of the instructions to change position and to carry outexercises, and about the extent to which compliance with these exercises wasvoluntary. A witness from one of the military police platoons who had been on duty in a hut said that there was no compulsion and that arrestees understood
why the exercises were taking place. One man who refused to do an exercisehad been ignored. A witness from the other military police platoon said thatno-one in his hut had refused, but that in the event of refusal, they would havedone nothing; this witness felt that the arrestees in his hut did not appreciate the purposes of the exercises during the 9th August, but realised the following day that they were helpful. The platoon commanders and senior officers wereuncertain of the extent of compulsion. All witnesses agreed that anyone whowas not able to vary his position readily we were given the example of one man with piles was allowed to adopt whatever position was most comfortable;others who were unable to carry out some of the exercises, for example, becausethey complained of back injury, were not required to do them. With the excep-tion mentioned above, we were given the impression by the army witnessesthat anyone capable of performing the exercises might well have felt that hehad no alternative but to comply with the instructions he was given. One of theplatoon commanders agreed that some of the arrestees, ignorant of the reasonfor the exercises, might have resented them and regarded them as part of a programme of harassment.157. There was no clear indication, in the evidence we heard, of the duration of position-changing and the frequency of exercise. Position-changing must,according to the evidence we heard, have continued for the greater part of the9th August. The night of the 10th August was cold, and the arrestees had nobeds or bedding. In at least one hut in the small hours of the morning there werecomplaints of the cold, and all those in the hut (including those sleeping) weregot up to walk or jog around. They were allowed to lie down again at 0300and to get such sleep as they might until called for breakfast between 0600and 0630.158. Of the five men listed above who complained of these exercises, we found medical evidence that one, Mr. Smith, had back trouble, probablyconnected with a slipped] disc. Mr. Collins was released at 1530 on the 9thAugust with a note from the medical officer to his doctor which did not relateto any injury. Mr. Rodgers, on examination on the 10th August on the Maid-stone, complained of a sore right knee, though no physical abnormality wasdetected. His complaint of pain in the knee was repeated at an examination onthe 17th August. Neither Mr. Harvey nor Mr. Gourley had a medical examina-tion on leaving the Holding Centre.Conclusions159. The evidence we took from the military police in charge of the Ballykinlerhuts, confirms that the exercises took place, that their nature and duration was much as described in the allegations, and that they were done under come degree of compulsion. We have noted the inconsistency in this evidence as tothe degree of compulsion. On balance we have formed the view that while the supervisory staff believed that the compulsion was limited to securing a simul-taneous change of position, the choice of position being left to the arrestedperson, in practice the man in charge kept control by selecting positions andordering all the persons in the hut to take up a given position from time totime. There is conflict of evidence on the action taken in cases of disobedience.The allegation is that those who refused or failed to carry out an exercise wereassaulted. Against this, we record the evidence of the military police that such
assault did not take place, that generally speaking orders were obeyed but thosewho did not comply were ignored. The medical evidence suggested that one ofthe detainees, Mr. Smith, should not have been required to perform exercisesthat imposed an unusual strain on the back. Mr. Rodgers complained of a soreright knee, a condition consistent with performance of some of the exercisesdescribed; there was however no physical sign of this condition, though painin the knee persisted until the 17th August. There were no marks or bruisesconsistent with the complaints of beating.160. We think it is plain that these compulsory exercises must have causedhardship to some at least of those who were made to do them, especially thosein poor physical condition, and we have noticed as a particular hardship thatsome men were woken up to do them in order to secure uniformity of action inthe hut. On the other hand, we do not regard the exercises as &quot;cruel&quot;, if theadjective means that the exercises were thought of and carried out with a viewto hurting or degrading the men who had to do them. We prefer to take theview that the exercises were devised to counteract the cold and the stiffness ofwhich the arrested persons complained, but that it should have been foreseenthat a system of voluntary changes of position at set times was bound to turninto a form of physical drill compulsorily performed without regard to therelative capacity of the performers, and that the routine was thoughtlesslyprolonged after it had served its proper purpose. We think there was lack ofjudgement here, but not cruelty or brutality, and we think the complainantsmay have suffered hardship but we made no findings of deliberate ill-treatment.individual allegationsBrendan Anderson161. Mr. Brendan Anderson complained that he was treated on arrest in belfast in a fashion similar to that complained of by Mr. Elisha Anderson, hisfather. We deal with Mr. Elisha Anderson&apos;s complaint as the next case, and donot here repeat the sources, the evidence or our conclusions on this point. Wehave also seen a copy of a statement by Mr. Anderson which was sent by theAssociation for Legal Justice to a number of Government Departments includingthe Home Office. Mr. Brendan Anderson complained also that he was forcedover the &quot;obstacle course&quot;, and that he was released late on the 10th Augustinto an exchange of fire. We deal with these complaints above under the groupheadings &quot;Obstacle Course&quot; (paragraphs 120-136) and &quot;Late releases on the10th August at Girdwood Park&quot; (paragraphs 137-148).162. Mr. Anderson complained also that in Crumlin Jail during the night ofthe 9th/10th August, he and others in his cell were woken three or four times bypolice and warders. Mr. Anderson was one of the arrestees at Girdwood ParkRegional Holding Centre who were lodged for a period in a wing of the Prisonused as an annex of the Centre (see paragraph 39). There is no doubt from theoral and written evidence we have received from both the prison staff and theR.U.C. that during this period before their formal admission to the Prison onthe 11th August, the arrestees were the responsibility not of the prison staff but of the army and the police. Prison officers were on duty in the prison wingwhen arrestees were lodged in it. The custody of the arrestees was not, however,their responsibility. R.U.C. officers were on duty who dealt with this and allconnected matters. The prison officers acted only as turnkeys. They did not enter cells, or speak to any of the arrestees.
163. We heard evidence on Mr. Anderson&apos;s complaint of disturbance from two police officers. The constable on duty at the material time said he had carried out a two hourly check of the arrestees in cells. In most cases he could do this by looking through the peep-hole in the cell door. In some instances hecould not in this way see all the occupants of a cell, and had to enter it. In allcases, using the switch outside the cell, he had put on the cell light. In no case had he woken, spoken to, or touched an arrestee. A police inspector confirmed that checks were made as described during the night. The frequency had notbeen laid down and might have varied between individual areas of responsibility.We received evidence also that a number of prisoners rang for attention duringthe night, and that there was a fairly frequent noise of movement in most partsof the prison wing.Conclusion164. We think that Mr. Anderson&apos;s statement that he was awakened 3 or 4times during the night is likely to be accurate. But we consider this was not doneintentionally but followed from action properly taken by the police in thecourse of their duties and was not ill-treatment.Elisha Anderson165. Mr. Elisha Anderson who said he was 55 and had a chronic heartcondition complained that when arrested in Belfast at 0430 a sandbag was putover his head and he was dragged out over broken glass cutting his foot. AtGirdwood, although his distressed condition was obvious, he was made toclimb stairs and did not see a doctor for an hour after asking to do so. Whenreleased from Girdwood he had to walk along a glass strewn Antrim Road inbare feet. A report of his allegations was published in the Irish News onthe 18th August.166. We saw 8 members of the security forces including members of the arrest party, the doctor who treated Mr. Anderson at Girdwood and the N.C.O.whose job it had been to look after Mr. Anderson with two other elderly menin Girdwood. The documentary evidence included the record of his receptionat Girdwood and the medical officers notes of the treatment given him. Wehad also before us a copy of a statement signed by Mr. Anderson which hadbeen sent by the Association for Legal Justice to a number of Governmentdepartments including the Home Office.167. The N.C.O. who had been in command of the arrest party told us theparty had had to force the inner front door of Mr. Anderson&apos;s house since,although the street door had been open, knocking had failed to produce aresponse. The inner door had glass panels and some of them had broken whenthe door was forced. Mr. Anderson had not been a reluctant prisoner andthere had been no need to use force to get him out of the house. Unboundand unrestrained, Mr. Anderson had been conducted out of the house with one escort holding his arm and into the aimy vehicle outside the front door.When leaving his house he would have had to cross the floor where lay theglass fragments from the forced door but he had not been hurried across.There had been no attempt to put a sandbag over Mr. Anderson&apos;s head in thehouse or at any other time: one had simply been handed to him so that he could take a limited number of belongings with him. Mr. Anderson had not seemed
a feeble 55: he looked stocky and well-built, and he had made no complaint of breathlessness or heart trouble.168. The junior N.C.O. with the arrest party corroborated his senior&apos;sversion and was able to add some details. First, Mr. Anderson had been bare-foot on leaving the house. Secondly, the party had taken only 3 sandbags intothe house because they expected to and did arrest only 3 men and eachwould have required a sandbag for his property. The warrant officer in chargeof the vehicle had seen the party emerge from the house and did not think theyhad hustled Mr. Anderson out even though they had been told by the warrant officer to hurry up because people were beginning to come out into the streets.Neither during the journey in the vehicle to Paulett Avenue nor in the 4 tonlorry thence to Girdwood did anyone recall Mr. Anderson&apos;s complaining.169. The R.U.C. officer on reception duty at Girdwood produced to us acopy of the entry he had made in his records of Mr. Anderson&apos;s arrival. Hehad come before the officer at 0550 and had been noted as in good condition and making no complaints. Although the officer was unable to recall whether mr. Anderson was barefoot, he felt he would have recollected a foot injury hadthere been one. Mr. Anderson had not seemed at all distressed.170. We saw the medical officer who had treated Mr. Anderson at Girdwood.The doctor&apos;s notes recorded that Mr. Anderson had complained of dizzinessand shortness of breath and that he had a history of cardiac irregularity andbeen treated with digoxin and tranquillizers. Examination confirmed thecardiac irregularity. The doctor issued appropriate pills to calm him down andnoted that Mr. Anderson should receive no strenuous exercise and that heshould be released if possible. (There were no records of when Mr. Andersonhad first asked for and then received medical attention and none of our witnesseswere able to assist us on this question.)171. The doctor was able to add in his oral evidence to us that, despiteMr. Anderson&apos;s condition, he thought it reasonable that the soldiers should nothave noticed it. He had observed him and noticed that his shortness of breathhad not prevented him from walking into the examination or stripping himself to the waist. He had not complained of glass in his feet to the doctor althoughit would have been open for him to have done so.172. The military police N.C.O. who had looked after Mr. Anderson and2 other men in a room on the first floor of Girdwood said Mr. Anderson hadlooked initially fatigued but had said he was all right when asked. (We know,from our inspection of the place, that to get to the first floor Mr. Andersonwould have had to climb two flights of stairs with an intervening wide landing at the turn.) Mr. Anderson had at no time seemed breathless and had talkedhappily, sitting like the other two on chairs that had been provided.173. The N.C.O.&apos;s evidence was that when it was decided to release Mr.Anderson and the other two men, he had taken them downstairs to collecttheir property (and their shoes, if any) and escort them to the Antrim Roadgate. (The decision to release Mr. Anderson was recorded in the R.U.C.reception book as being made at 1045 on the 9th August.) Mr. Anderson wasbarefoot and attempts to find shoes for him were unsuccessful. Mr. Andersonhad walked slowly from Girdwood apparently suffering no discomfort and
exhibiting no signs of foot injury. At the gate (which the N.C.O. estimated hadbeen reached approximately half an hour after the release decision had been communicated to him) Mr. Anderson had told the N.C.O. not to worry abouthim and that he would be all right. Leaving him at the gate standing with another man, the N.C.O. had approached the R.U.C. to provide a patrol carto take Mr. Anderson home because of the special circumstances. He foundMr. Anderson still at the gate when he returned later and had, therefore, made further enquiries of the R.U.C. The N.C.O. this time asked Mr. Andersonwhether he had any complaint and he had said he had not. The N.C.O. had notthereafter seen him again but he knew of no reason why Mr. Anderson couldnot have stayed at the gate if he had wished to. He had told the guard at thegate Mr. Anderson was waiting for transport.174. The officer in command of the guard at the Antrim Road gate said hecould remember Mr. Anderson arriving there for release and the N.C.O.saying he would try to arrange transport. One of the two men with whomMr. Anderson had arrived was escorted back into the camp to use the telephoneto see if he could arrange private transport. The man claimed on returnthat he had been successful and the officer had produced chairs from the guardroom so that the waiting men could sit down. He had not seen them leave. Hesaid that, due to the disturbances then in progress, the Antrim Road wasstrewn with a certain amount of debris at the time, and this might well have included broken glass but there was no such debris on the road^that led about100 yards from the guarded gate into the public road. The officer had spokenwith Mr. Anderson who had not been breathless but rather pleased to be released. There had been no question of ejecting the waiting men and theywould have been allowed to wait for their transport.Conclusion175. We make no finding about Mr. Anderson&apos;s complaint of injury to hisfoot from glass on his arrest, having noticed that he seems to have made no complaint of it on reception into Girdwood or to the medical officer whoexamined him at a later stage in Girdwood.176. Given Mr. Anderson&apos;s age and the doctor&apos;s report on his condition,we think that there was a lack of consideration in the order given to dischargehim from Girdwood, barefoot into a road strewn with debris, in a disturbedarea. We draw attention, however, to the evidence given us about the efforts made to secure transport for Mr. Anderson and the evidence that he was notcompelled to leave but allowed to wait till transport came but decided to walkaway of his own accord. We do not think that anyone at Girdwood took any action with the deliberate object of hurting Mr. Anders on.James Patrick Boyle177. Mr. Boyle complained that after his arrest at Ballymoney, CountyAntrim, on the 9th August at 0430 he was dragged out to a jeep. He asked for adrink of water, and was refused and struck with a baton. His hands were tiedbehind his back so tightly that they swelled.178. Mr. Boyle made a formal complaint to the Enquiry, of which he gavedetails by letter. He was invited to give oral evidence. We heard in answer toour invitation from his mother, who told us he was working in England and
could not attend the Enquiry. We have therefore dealt with his complaint onthe basis of his written evidence.179. In relation to Mr. Boyle&apos;s complaint of his treatment on arrest, we heard oral evidence from 4 members of the security forces, including the captainin charge of the arrest party. After arrest, Mr. Boyle broke away from the arrest party three times, twice in the house and once outside. On the thirdoccasion he was pursued into the house and was found in the kitchen drinkingmilk. The officer in charge of the party was concerned at the possibility thatfirearms might be available. He ordered that Mr. Boyle&apos;s hands be bound. Oneof the party used for this purpose a roll of crepe bandage from their vehicle&apos;first aid kit. He denied the bonds were tight, and told us that Mr. Boyle had gone to sleep at one point on the journey to the prisoner collection point atBallykelly, where he was unbound and made no complaint. We heard evidencealso from another member of the arrest party who had been armed with a baton;he denied that he had struck Mr. Boyle, and said he was standing 5-10 yardsaway when Mr. Boyle broke away from his escorts on the third occasion.180. We noted that on admission to Magilligan camp at 1344 Mr. Boyle is recorded to have made no complaint and at his medical examination at 1354he is recorded as being healthy looking and as having no external injuries.Conclusion181. We do not think that the admitted binding of Mr. Boyle&apos;s hands con-stituted ill-treatment. We are unable to resolve the conflict whether he wasstruck with a baton.Michael Oliver Brady182. Mr. Brady, who was arrested in Belfast, complained he was trailedthrough dirt and barbed wire at the Albert Street collection point shortly after0430; that he got a piece of glass in his foot when taken out of the compound;and that he was forced with his hands bound to mount a lorry via a chair, whichwas kicked away by soldiers as he was about to step on it. En route to GirdwoodPark, a soldier hit his foot and toes with a rifle butt. Mr. Brady also had com-plaints that relate to the &quot;obstacle course&quot; and they are dealt with in paragraphs120-136 above. An account of these allegations appeared in the Irish Times ofthe 20th August.183. We saw 5 witnesses including the officer in charge of the Albert Streetcollection point and the soldier who arrested Mr. Brady. Documentary evidenceincluded the record of Mr. Brady&apos;s reception at Girdwood on the 9th august and his examination at Crumlin Jail on being detained there on the 11th August.184. The officer in charge at Albert Street said he had been the only officerpresent and that the arrestees had been put on arrival in a compound an areafenced off with barbed wire in the collection point. No-one had been beatenin the compound no soldiers were inside it nor had anyone had their handstied. After everyone had been collected and it was time to move the arrestees onto Girdwood, all then had their hands tied in front with 4 by 2 flannelette thestandard army cleaning material for pulling through rifling. After being tied themen were walked to the lorries through the parted rolls of barbed wire. No-one was pushed or dragged to the two lorries where 9 prisoners and 9 soldiers
boarded each. The ground in the compound was smooth but the ground outsidewas not. The prisoners had not been wearing shoes but no-one had beenintentionally walked over glass if there was any nor over barbed wire.Although he had not been able to observe the compound all the time, he had seen all the prisoners board the lorries and no-one had had a chair kickedaway from under him. It had not been necessary to prevent prisoners fromspeaking and, accordingly, he had issued no order to that effect.185. The warrant officer we saw confirmed the officers description of eventsexcept that he did not remember chairs being placed by the lorries. He addedthat the compound was clean and the path to the lorries clear of rubbish andrabble, and no-one could have got glass in his feet. The prisoners had had topass between rolls of barbed wire. The rolls had been separated when necessaryto obtain access. No-one had had to walk over strands of wire.186. We saw two private soldiers, the first had been present at Albert Streetand the second had arrested Mr. Brady and accompanied him to Girdwood.The first said the prisoners had had to walk about 4 yards from the compoundto the lorries where in each case a chair was used to help men board, the samechair being moved from the first to the second lorry when the first was full.No-one had fallen from the chair.187. The arresting soldier said he had found Mr. Brady quite pleasant, quietand no problem at all. When mounting the lorry to Girdwood Mr. Brady hadpreceded the soldier. There was a chair and the procedure was to use the chairas one step and the back of the lorry as the other. Mr. Brady had stumbled onthe chair and half fallen but he had not completely lost his balance or fallen tothe ground. Had he fallen, the soldier would have caught him. In the lorry,Mr. Brady sat on the floor with his back against the side. The soldier had stoodby Mr. Brady during the journey. No-one had assaulted the prisoner or hit hisfeet, nor had the soldier himself done so.188. The R.U.C. officer who noted down Mr. Brady&apos;s particulars on his arrival at 0645 at Girdwood produced to us the entry he had made. Thisrecorded Mr. Brady&apos;s appearance as normal and that he had made no com-plaint. The officer said he would have noted anything obviously wrong with Mr.Brady, as he had done in the case of other entries he had made that were produced to us.189. There was no record of Mr. Brady receiving medical attention at Gird-wood. An R.U.C. officer told us he had received a complaint from Mr. Bradyjust after lunch on the 10th August, when Mr. Brady was in the wing of theJail used as an annex of the Holding Centre, that he had glass in his foot but,apart from noticing a smear of blood on the top of the foot, the officer did notinspect it. He passed on Mr. Brady&apos;s request for attention to a prison officer.On Mr. Brady&apos;s reception into Crumlin Jail proper on the 11th August the prison medical officer noted: &quot;States he has glass in foot dressing. Nil abnormal palpable. Nowound to be seen.&quot;Conclusion190. Mr. Brady&apos;s statement of his experience at Albert Street seems broadlyconsistent with the army witnesses&apos; account of events there: he passed through
barbed wire, and was in difficulties when he mounted the lorry via a chair:but he seems to have come to no harm by doing so if we may judge by theevidence of his condition when he was admitted to Girdwood. We make nofinding on his allegation about being hit on foot and toes with a rifle butt,except to notice the evidence that damage was neither noticed nor complained of when he reached Girdwood. We also make no finding as regards the allegationof glass in his foot, noticing the evidence of the prison medical officer that whenhe complained of this he was examined and nothing was found.Edward Eamon Campbell191. Mr. Campbell alleged that after arrest in Belfast on the 9th August hewas struck with batons on the head and threatened by the escort in a lorrymoving from the Henry Taggart Hall to Girdwood. At Girdwood after interro-gation all his bodily hair was shaved off on the false grounds that he had&quot;venereal scabies&quot;. His allegations were referred to in the Irish Press of the14th August, the Belfast Telegraph of the 17th August and in Private Eye ofthe 10th September.192. We examined 6 members of the security forces including his arresterand all the medical staff who had dealt with him at Girdwood. We receivedexpert evidence from a consultant dermatologist. Documentary evidenceincluded the record of Mr. Campbell&apos;s reception and the note made by anR.A.M.C. officer who treated him in Girdwood.193. The N.C.O. who accompanied Mr. Campbell in the lorry to Girdwood,and who had been a member of the party that had arrested him, said that although he could not be sure, there had been up to possibly 15 arrestees in thelorry. With the exception of an elderly man, they had been made to lie face down on the floor and the escort had consisted of 10 soldiers travelling with them inthe back of the lorry. The soldiers sat on benches along the sides of the lorrywith their feet on the top of the men on the floor. The soldiers had had riflesonly, there being no batons on the lorry. Mr. Campbell had been a quietprisoner who had not been struck either getting in or out of the lorry or at anytime during the journey. Although there had been a bit of verbal abuse, no-oneelse had been struck either. Nor had the young man been put on the side of thelorry exposed to a hostile crowd, pulled up by the hair or told to sing &quot;GodSave the Queen&quot;. As regards his crucifix, Mr. Campbell had said as he gotonto the lorry that he had lost it but search failed to find it. On arrival atGirdwood the N.C.O. had noticed Mr. Campbell had a bleeding lip he had not had when first getting on the vehicle.194. The R.U.C. officer who had noted Mr. campbell&apos;s particulars on arrival at Girdwood had recorded the cut lip. We have seen the contemporaryentry made about the injury on Mr. campbell&apos;s arrival at 0535, and also hisphotograph taken at reception, which shows the cut lip. The R.U.C. officersaid Mr. Campbell had made no complaint about his arrest or treatmentduring transport, nor had he volunteered or been asked how he had sustainedhis injury. The officer had not noticed any other injury.195. At Girdwood Mr. Campbell was treated for an itching rash of whichhe had complained. In the Irish Press of the 14th August Mr. Campbell wasrecorded as saying merely that he had been shaved by soldiers but in an article
in Private Eye on the 10th September it was said he had been examined by themedical correspondent of the Irish Times, Dr. David Nowlan. The articlesaid Dr. Nowlan had found Mr. Campbell to be suffering from &quot;mildpityriasis rosea, &apos;a bland symptomless, harmless condition&apos; affecting the left sideof his chest. There is no such condition as &apos;venereal scabies&apos;. The treatment for scabies is never shaving. Scabies never spreads to the face and scalp.&quot;196. We saw the two medical officers who inspected Mr. Campbell at Gird-wood, the R.A.M.C. medical orderly on duty, the military police N.C.O. whoassisted, and a consultant dermatologist. We also corresponded with Dr.Nowlan and a doctor who had seen Mr. Campbell shortly after his release from Girdwood.197. The military police N.C.O. told us that on the morning of the 10thAugust the military police escort in the hall in Girdwood announced that all those who felt unwell could take part in the sick parade then being organised.Some 30 or 40 men stood up and they were moved to one side of the hall and taken one by one to the room where the R.A.M.C. medical orderly was working.198. Mr. Campbell was one of the first to come before the medical orderly.He had complained to the military policeman of a rash on his body and scalp.The orderly told us he had instructed Mr. Campbell to strip to the waist andthen examined him. He found he had a rash on his chest, back, arms and neck.He concluded that Mr. Campbell was suffering from scabies, a condition hehad seen before on his service abroad. The hair was matted, long and greasy.There were nits of lice in it.199. The orderly had then sought advice from his medical officer. We sawthis doctor and he told us he remembered clearly that Mr. Campbell was &quot;avery dirty young man&quot;. There were scratch marks on his arms and under hisarmpits. The head hair was infested with fleas and nits. He confirmed the orderly&apos;s diagnosis, said that Mr. campbell&apos;s head should be shaved, and thescabies treated with successive applications of benzyl benzoate emulsion afterthorough washing. Having confirmed that the orderly knew how to carry outthe treatment, the doctor had left the premises and did not see Mr. Campbellagain. Mr. Campbell was told to think whether he would undergo treatmentthen or wait until his immediate future was more clear, that is until he waseither released or a detention order made. Mr. Campbell in the presence ofthe orderly and the N.C.O. said he preferred to undergo treatment at once.200. There and then the military police N.C.O. started to cut Mr. Campbell&apos;shair with scissors and comb. He had made some progress when a differentmedical officer, the one on 30 minute call at Girdwood Park throughout theoperation and not the orderly&apos;s ordinary superior, appeared on the scenehaving learned about Mr. CampbelPs case. This doctor made case notes, whichwe have seen. He told us Mr. Campbell complained he had an itching rash and indicated his trunk, forearms and scalp. The doctor found a rash on the fore-arms and trunk, with the forearms, wrist and back of the head quite badlyexcoriated as a result of Mr. campbell&apos;s efforts to relieve the irritation. Thelesions, he agreed, were consistent with scabies and with headlice. Neither ofthe doctors nor any of the others who had dealt with Mr. Campbell noticed
any bruising upon him, and the doctors were clear that the marks on the back of the head were scratch marks and not bruising. The second doctorrecollected using the term &quot;venereal scabies&quot; to the military policeman, the term being a correct medical description of the condition.201. He had had to deal with the question of infection because the militarypolice had asked for advice about how to handle all the men in the hall. Hehad reassured them that the danger of infection was slender. He confirmedboth the diagnosis of headlice and scabies, and the treatment.202. After finishing the hair cutting the military police N.C.O. took Mr.Campbell into the showers and there shaved his head with a safety razor andsoap. (Mr. campbell&apos;s chest hair was also removed.) After the shave, the N.C.O.took Mr. Campbell back to the orderly for application of the emulsion. the orderly began the treatment and on reaching the waist, asked Mr. Campbell to lower his trousers. It then became clear that the rash was present in the groinand on the upper part of the thighs. The orderly advised Mr. Campbell that itwould be best if his bodily hair in these regions were removed. Mr. Campbellagreed with this recommendation, returned to the showers and there shavedhimself with the safety razor nicking himself a couple of times as he did so.The emulsion was then applied and Mr. Campbell dressed himself in clothesprovided by the army.203. The two medical officers who saw Mr. Campbell, the second of whommade notes of his findings, received no complaint from Mr. Campbell eitherabout the treatment he had received from the orderly and the N.C.O. or about any injuries he had sustained at the hands of the security forces beforehand.His demeanour seemed the usual one of a patient seeing a doctor and, if any-thing, he seemed pleased that he was being treated for the irritating conditionfrom which he was suffering. The medical orderly and the N.C.O. said that Mr.Campbell at no time complained to them, and that he consented of his ownfree-will to the treatment that was given to him. Because of the crowded con-ditions, other people were able from time to time to observe Mr. CampbelPstreatment or were present when it was taking place either in the room by thehall or in the showers. Neither the doctors, nor the medical orderly, nor theN.C.O. could recollect Mr. Campbell being the butt of unflattering or hostileremarks about his condition. No-one recollected saying he did not want hishair removed because he was a member of a pop group. The next day themedical officer asked if Mr. Campbell had received the second treatment, and found he had been discharged.204. The burden of the Private Eye report on the 10th September was thatthe diagnosis at Girdwood had been wrong and the treatment, therefore, in-correct. This was a very serious allegation and we were, therefore, most concerned to pursue the question.205. We wrote to Dr. Nowlan of the Irish Times. In reply he said he had examined Mr. Campbell at the Central Citizens&apos; Defence Committee (C.C.D.C.)premises in the Falls Road where the case had been brought to his attention bya doctor he thought to be Mr. campbell&apos;s G.P. Dr. Nowlan thought Mr.Campbell had pityriasis rosea over his left chest wall and said this had been confirmed by a letter the doctor he thought to be Mr. CampbelPs G.P. hadreceived later from a consultant dermatologist at the Royal Victoria Hospital. We
subsequently wrote to the doctor mentioned by Dr. Nowlan as the patienfs G.P.He replied saying that he was not the patienfs G.P. but like Dr. Nowlan had seen Mr. Campbell at the request of the C.C.D.C. We also understand that Mr.Campbell was not examined by a consultant dermatologist at the Royal VictoriaHospital, but by a house officer.206. Owing to the conflicting diagnoses in this case one given by twodoctors as a result of the patienfs complaint of an itching rash, the other sometime later by two other doctors at the request of the C.C.D.C.-we decided totake further expert medical advice from a consultant dermatologist. He saidnit infestation would always be clear enough to a doctor and it was unlikelythere could be any doubt about that part of the diagnosis. As to pityriasis roseathe chief point was that the patient was more likely to complain about the rashitself than the irritation since itchiness was not the main feature of this condition,as contrasted with scabies. Further, it was unlikely the rash would be confined to one part of the body, e.g. the upper left anterior chest wall. Characteristicallythe rash of pityriasis rosea started from a small area (the herald patch) and thereafter appeared all over; its incidence was also more common in autumn and spring than other times of the year.207. He concluded from all the data available to him that Mr. Campbell hadbeen suffering not only from pediculosis capitis and scabies as diagnosed atGirdwood but also seborrhoeic dermatitis either coincidentally or developinglater. Close hair-cutting and the application of benzyl benzoate was entirelyjustified as the quickest and safest method of curing the condition.Conclusions208. We are clear that Mr. Campbell suffered no ill-treatment, still lessbrutality. He was not shaved to punish or degrade him. On the contrary, thetreatment was given him for his benefit and in accordance with the prescriptionprofessionally given at the time by not one but two medical officers for a con-dition which they independently diagnosed. We have no doubt, from the con-temporary record and their evidence to us, that there was a satisfactory doctor-patient relationship between the R.A.M.C. doctors and Mr. Campbell. In thesecircumstances it was not strictly necessary for us to enquire into the correctnessof their diagnosis. But since part of the allegation was that the diagnosis of&quot;venereal scabies&quot; was irresponsible and needlessly discreditable to Mr.Campbell, we thought it right to take full evidence on this point, from which itclearly emerges that the diagnosis is supported by responsible medical opinion,both in general terms and in relation to the facts as ascertained at the time andsubsequently confirmed about the symptoms exhibited by Mr. Campbell.Gerard Campbell209. Mr. Campbell complained that on arrest in Belfast his hands had beentied behind his back, that the end of the rope had been constantly pulled hard and that in a Saracen vehicle, to which he had been pushed, the rope had beenput around his neck to choking point. En route to Girdwood through theArdoyne district amidst brick and bottle throwing he was beaten with batonsand held at the back of the lorry as a human shield. His complaint that atGirdwood he was made to run an obstacle course is dealt with in paragraphs120-136 above. A report of these allegations was published in the Irish Times on
the 20th August. We saw two witnesses, the N.C.O. in charge of the arrest party and a private who had been a member both of the party and the escort toMr. Campbell on the way to Girdwood. The documentary evidence included the record of his reception at Girdwood and of his medical examination on admis-sion to the Prison proper.210. The N.C.O. said the arrest party had gone to the vicinity of Mr. Camp-belPs house in an Armoured Personnel Carrier (A.P.C.). With the private(whom we saw) he had entered the house and Mr. Campbell had been arrested.No violence had been used by either the arresters or Mr. Campbell at that stage.The entire party had then left the house to walk to the A.P.C. parked about200 yards down the street and where they were joined by another arrest team.Mr. Campbell had not been bound on the journey to the A.P.C. or whilst in it.However, at the Company rendezvous, where documentation took place,Mr. Campbell&apos;s hands were tied with approximately 3 feet of parachute cord in pursuit of general orders issued by the Company Commander. The hands hadbeen tied at the wrist and no cord had been passed around the neck. Mr. Camp-bell had not been pushed to the A.P.C. nor had the cord been pulled constantlyat that stage since binding had not taken place until later.211. After documentation the N.C.O. said Mr. Campbell had been taken toGirdwood in a lorry. Although he had not been in the lorry, the N.C.O. hadaccompanied it in an escorting A.P.C. and observed the route. The journey hadtaken the small convoy past a group of about 20 people standing on the side ofthe road and throwing stones at the vehicles. It was not what the N.C.O. would call intensive rioting; most of the crowd had consisted of women and adolescents.The vehicles had not gone through the Ardoyne district.212. The private confirmed to us the N.C.O.&apos;s account of the journey to theCompany rendezvous and particularly that Mr. CampbelPs hands had not beenbound at any stage before arrival. The private said he had done the bindingpalm to palm with approximately 2 feet of parachute cord. He had asked mr. Campbell whether the bonds were too tight and, on being told they were,had slackened them off. The soldier said he had accompanied Mr. Campbell toGirdwood in the back of the lorry. The route had not gone through the Ardoynebut in the general direction of the Springfield Road Police Station. The riotingthey passed had been taking place at a road junction in Andersontown. WithMr. Campbell he had gone right up to the cab end of the back of the vehiclesince they had been the first of the party to board. At no time had Mr. Campbellbeen put at the open end of the vehicle in an exposed position. The floor of thelorry was covered with internal security equipment and to expose Mr. Campbellat the back would have meant making him clamber over the equipment, whenusing the equipment itself would have afforded better protection to the peopleinside. Although missiles had been thrown none had entered the vehicle andno-one had been injured. Mr. Campbell had made no complaint about his hands.It would not have been possible to have put the cord around Mr. CampbelPsneck since only about 3 inches remained loose after tying; and nor had the cordbeen pulled. The private denied beating Mr. Campbell with a baton: he had notbeen carrying one himself, although some had been lying on the lorry floor.213. As to documentary evidence, we saw that the R.U.C. officer who hadtakein down Mr. CampbelPs particulars on arrival at Girdwood at 0625 had
made the entry &quot;No complaints. Good condition&quot;. The prison medical officer on examining him on admission to the Prison on the 11th August had notednothing except about a duodenal ulcer. There was no record of Mr. Campbellhaving sought treatment for any injuries whilst at Girdwood.Conclusion214. The allegation of hand-tying is confirmed: but having taken evidenceabout the method and length or cord used, we discount the allegation that the&quot;rope&quot; with which his hands were tied had also been used to pull or choke him.215. We make no finding in the complaint of beating with batons, which isdenied. The account given by the witnesses of conditions in the lorry is by nomeans conclusive, but diminishes the likelihood of the allegation that the complainant was held as a &quot;human shield&quot; against brick and bottle throwers.Liam Cummings or 0&apos;Comain216. Mr. Cummings was arrested at Limavady and taken in an armouredvehicle to a collection point at Ballykelly and thence to Magilligan RegionalHolding Centre. He is said to have complained that on arrest his hands weretied behind his back, and an empty sandbag pulled over his head. In the lorrysoldiers beat him and urinated upon him. A string was tied to his thumb andjerked. He was tapped steadily on the head with batons and the soldiers refusedto remove the hood when he was coughing because of the dust inside it. AtBallykelly he was kneed in the groin, and as he straightened up thereafter he wasstruck in the face with a baton, sustaining a deep cut in the mouth. A soldiercalled &quot;Taffy&quot; hit him on the chest with a rifle butt. Reports of these allegationswere published in Ireland in the Irish News and the Irish Press of the 12thAugust, in England in the Times, the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian of the12th August, and in Private Eye of the 10th September. We have also seen notes of an interview of Mr. Cummings by a Sunday Times reporter.217. We saw 7 witnesses, including the officer in command of the arrest party and the medical officer who examined Mr. Cummings on his arrival at Magilli-gan. Documentary evidence included the arrest report, the reception record, andthe doctor&apos;s notes of his examination.218. The arresting officer said Mr. Cummings had accompanied his arrestersout of the houses without resistance but, once outside, he had shrugged off hisescort and swore at them. Because of this &quot;bolshy&quot; behaviour, the officer said he had ordered Mr. Cumming&apos;s hands to be tied behind his back, a sandbag tobe put over his head, and his shoes to be removed during the journey in the armoured vehicle to Ballykelly. He also ordered Mr. Cummings to lie on the floor of the vehicle. These orders had been given because of the officers&apos; concern about Mr. Cumming&apos;s potential for causing trouble in the congested conditionsof the back of an armoured vehicle where there were between 6 and 8 soldiersas well as their prisoner. Had he given trouble to his escort, rather than it beingeasy for them to overwhelm him, he might have succeeded in causing confusion.The bag over the head was to prevent him running away, and the wrist bondsto prevent him from removing the bag. The officer, a junior subaltern, hadreceived no orders to bind or hood men: he did it on his own initiative. Nor had he specific orders about how he should handle arrestees under the special powers Act. Although he had been concerned with effecting arrests before, i\s&apos;had
usually involved no more than snatching a rioter to be handed over immediately to the military police. He had not been responsible for a prolonged period ofcustody before, involving as in this case a long journey through potentially hostileterritory where precautions had to be taken against ambush.219. The private who had found and hooded Mr. Cummings told us he had used the draw cord from a camouflage smock. We saw an example of the cord.It was khaki coloured, flexible fabric cord of approximately \&quot; diameter and2-3 feet long. The hands had been tied wrist over wrist at the rear, just tightlyenough to hold them, and the spare ends had been left free. At no time had themethod of tying been changed or altered in any way and, in particular, nothinghad been tied to Mr. Cumming&apos;s thumb and jerked. The sandbag used had beena new hessian one and the witness demonstrated to us, how it had been used by placing it over his own head. He claimed that, apart from the discomfort of theroughness around the neck, there was no difficulty in breathing through thecoarse weave.220. The private corroborated the officers account of Mr. Cummings&apos;conduct on arrest. He said he had helped Mr. Cummings into the armouredvehicle by putting a hand under the armpit and telling him to be careful becausethe soldiers themsleves were always falling off or slipping on the step. However,Mr. Cummings had slipped and struck his chest and chin on the floor of the vehicle. Thereafter Mr. Cummings had travelled lying prone on the floor. Hehad seen no-one strike Mr. Cummings and an N.C.O. had specifically forbiddenthe use of violence, warning that anyone who resorted to it would be charged.No-one had urinated on Mr. Cummings during the journey and nothing hadbeen poured over him. He had not seen Mr Cummings&apos; clothes wet and the vehicle floor had been dry. Mr Cummings had been removed from the armouredvehicle by his being pulled to the back until it was practicable to tell him to situp and put his legs down over the back ledge. No-one had struck Mr. Cummingswith a rifle but it was true that his requests to have the sandbag removed whenhe had a coughing fit were refused.221. An N.C.O. who said he was known as &quot;Taffy&quot; corroborated the accountsgiven by the officer and soldier except to say he had not actually witnessedMr. Cummings fall in the vehicle since he had been getting in himself at thetime at the front where he normally travelled. During the journey to Ballykellyno-one to his knowledge had struck or interfered with Mr. Cummings althoughit was true the latter had once complained of being uncomfortable on the floorand he had coughed occasionally. The N.C.O. had seen Mr. Cummings dismountand he had not been assaulted then by the N.C.O. or anyone else. He could nothave struck Mr. Cummings with a rifle butt since he had no rifle, only a baton.It was true, however, that Mr. Cummings had stumbled on getting out of the vehicle; but he had been caught and sustained no injury.222. This N.C.O. had accompanied Mr. Cummings from the vehicle into the prisoner collection point at Ballykelly and thence in transport to Magilligan.The hood had been removed within ten minutes of arriving at Ballykelly. TheN.C.O. then noticed Mr. Cummings had a graze on the chin. Mr. Cummingshad made no complaint during the reception and waiting period at Ballykellyor during the later journey and the N.C.O. had not noticed that Mr.Cumrnings&apos; clothes were wet in any way. Nor on arrival at Magilligan didMr.&quot; Cummings complain to the R.U.C. officer on reception duty.
223. There were two men on reception duty at Magilligan: an R.U.C. officer who noted down personal particulars of arrivals and a senior N.C.O. of themilitary police who completed arrest reports brought in by the soldier escorts.We saw both men. The first said he remembered Mr. Cummings because he had,unusually, given his name in both the English and Irish versions. Although theman had had a slight abrasion on the chin, it had been too insignificant for himto note in the injuries column of the record entry that was produced to us.Mr. Cummings had made no complaint: he seemed pretty jovial and unde-pressed. The R.U.C. officer had not noticed any wetness about the clothing andMr. Cummings had not complained when the same officer had seen him before his release on the 10th August. We established, however, that during an inter-view Mr. Cummings had later at Magilligan with police officers he had alleged to them that he had been abused by soldiers, that they had punched him andthat they had put a bag over his head.224. The military police N.C.O. on receiving duty at Magilligan told usMr. Cummings was the only one of all those who arrived to display any sign of injury. The N.C.O. noticed he had a graze on the chin and Mr. Cummings had also mentioned, although the N.C.O. had not seen the injury himself, that hehad a slight cut on the inside of his lip. On asking Mr. Cummings how he hadsustained his injuries, the latter had replied that it had happened when hehad fallen that morning at the back of an army vehicle. We saw the entry madeat the time by this N.C.O. in the arrest form, it read: &quot;He sustained a very slight cut to his lower lip and graze to the chinwhilst in M.O.D. vehicle.&quot;225. We also saw the photograph taken on arrival at Magilligan which showed the graze extending from the lip to the point of the chin. The N.C.O. was clearMr. Cummings had actually said he had fallen.226. The medical officer who had examined arrestees arriving at Magilliganhad made notes of each examination and we saw those made in respect of Mr.Cummings. The doctor explained he had noticed 3 superficial injuries: anabrasion on. the left of the chest, a small laceration on the left of the lower lip,and some bruising on the right kneecap. He would have asked how the injurieshad occurred but he could not recall Mr. Cummings&apos; response beyond that hehad been co-operative, helpful and pleasant. On the notes we saw the doctorhad recorded Mr. Cummings as &quot;uncomplaining&quot;. The doctor thought theinjuries were consistent with coming into contact with a blunt object but did notthink lying on the floor of the armoured vehicle during a partly bumpy ridecould account for them. He had not noticed the injury to the chin or any wetnessabout Mr. Cummings&apos; clothing.Conclusions227. As regards the allegations of beating at arrest and being urinated on, wehave identified and questioned the persons against whom the allegations aremade, and draw attention to their denials and the evidence supporting thedenials. In particular we notice the evidence of other witnesses that nw^vtrMr. Cummings&apos; clothes nor the floor of the armoured vehicle were wet;$i 4lethe contemporary medical record of Mr. Cummings on admission to Magil^gandoes not support his allegation that he sustained a deep cut in the mouth. &quot;
228. On the other hand the allegations of wrist bonds (though not of stringtied to thumb and jerked) and hooding with a sandbag, are confirmed by themilitary evidence. We also have the contemporary record both of the receivingofficers of the military and civilian police and of the medical officer, that, onadmission to Magilligan Holding Centre, Mr. Cummings showed injuriesdescribed by the receiving officers as a graze of the chin and by the medical officer as injuries consisting of an abrasion on the left of the chest, a smalllaceration on the left of the lower lip and some bruising on the right kneecap.Not having been able to interview Mr. Cummings, we have not been able to question him on the statement attributed to him that the injuries on chin and liphad happened when he had fallen at the back of the Army vehicle. Those injuriesare consistent with such an incident, and if they were so caused we have toconsider whether such an accident would not follow from the condition in which mr. Cummings was held during a ride of20-25 minutes duration in the armouredvehicle. What is clear is that this man travelled, hooded and bound, prone on the metal floor of a small vehicle surrounded by 5 seated soldiers. We accept thearresting officers explanation that he ordered Mr. Cummings to be hooded andhis wrists bound not as a punishment but as a military precaution. We consider,however, that the order showed lack of judgment, that as a result of it Mr.Cummings suffered hardship and a measure of ill-treatment from the hoodingand the wrist bonds, and that the injuries which the medical officer who recorded as superficial may well have been caused, in our opinion, by his being moved from arrest to Ballykelly in that condition.Sean Drumm229. Mr. Drumm complained that after his arrest in Belfast his shoes were removed and his hands tied behind his back. At Girdwood Park he was forcedto &quot;run the gauntlet&quot; and was later sent over the &quot;obstacle course&quot; to CrumlinJail. At the Prison he was interrogated. Aged 20, he has a bad stammer and hisinterrogators punched him on the head if he did not answer quickly enough.(His allegations concerning the &quot;obstacle course&quot; are dealt with in paragraphs120-136.) Reports of Mr. Drumm&apos;s complaints appeared in the Irish Inde-pendent of the 17th August, the Irish News of the 18th August and the IrishTimes of the 27th August.230. We heard no evidence from Mr. Drumm but we had before us his statement, a copy of which had been forwarded to us by the Chief Constableof the R.U.C. to whom Mr. Devlin, M.P., had sent it, and another copy whichhad been sent to a number of Government departments by the Association forLegal Justice.231. We heard evidence from a member of the party who arrested Mr.Drumm on the 9th August. He confirmed that Mr. Drumm&apos;s hands had beentied behind his back; this was because he struggled and it was thought likelyhe would attempt to escape if not restrained. We were told also that on arrival at Girdwood Park, in accordance with standard practice, his shoes and sockswere removed.^232. The complaint that Mr. Drumm was forced to &quot;run the gauntlet&quot; hasgi (Ju some difficulty. It appeared to us upon investigation that the onlyoc^sions when such treatment might have been inflicted on Mr. Drumm were either those we have described as the helicopter incident and the &quot;obstacle
course&quot;, or the period of exercise the arrestees were allowed on their first dayof confinement. In his statement Mr. Drumm says: &quot;I was then taken outsidewith about 7 or 8 others. We were forced to run the gauntlet between tworows of military policemen. I was grabbed, kicked, knocked down, jumpedon and trailed into the hall&quot;.233. This does not read like the description of the helicopter incident. Itcannot be a description of the &quot;obstacle course&quot; for Mr. Drumm describesthat experience as occurring at a later stage. We therefore investigated thiscomplaint as an allegation of improper treatment as described by Mr. Drummduring a period of exercise.234. The army witnesses including the senior officer of military police on duty at Girdwood told us that when the work of reception had been completed the arrestees were permitted to exercise. They had gone in crocodile withescorts from the building to walk round the field adjoining it. There was anouter picquet of civilian and military police with at least one dog handlerfrom the Parachute Regiment with his dog. There had been no demonstrations,not even singing. There was therefore no occasion for any physical interven-tion by the guards and none had occurred.235. One junior N.C.O. told us that the majority of arrestees had beenfriendly at this stage, willing to talk and to walk round with their escorts. Hesaid he had given cigarettes to two of them. We were told that the dog or dogs(the number was not clear) were kept well away from the arrestees as well asfrom the escorts walking with them and the outer picquets.236. We heard evidence from two civilian police officers who had been concerned in Mr. Drumm&apos;s interrogation. Mr. Drumm had had altogether 3periods of interrogation, one lasting about one quarter of an hour, the others,about one half of an hour. They agreed that they had noticed that Mr. Drummhad an impediment in his speech. They were emphatic that he had not beenassaulted in any way during his periods ofjnterrogation.Conclusion237. This is another case where in the absence of evidence from the com-plainant we can do no more than report the allegations and the firm denials.Michael Farrell238. Mr. Farrell complained that he was forced over the &quot;obstacle course&quot;between Girdwood Park and the Prison, and that during this episode he was set on by a dog who tore his jacket. (He had been arrested in Belfast.)239. We received part of Mr. Farrell&apos;s statement, headed &quot;Case History ofarrest and detention of Michael Farrell&quot; at a late stage in our investigationswhen it was included in the papers we collected from the Sunday Times on the19th October. Allegations concerning Mr. Farrell had been published in theGuardian of the 11th August, in the Irish Press and Irish Independent both ofthe 18th August and the Irish Press of the 19th August, and in the Sunday times of the 22nd August. There was a further report in the Morning Starof the 23rd August. &amp; $1 240. In his detailed statement Mr. Farrell gave an account of his move igomGirdwood Park to the Prison which clearly identifies the route involved&apos;as
being that which we examined while investigating allegations concerning the&quot;obstacle course&quot;. Mr. FarrelFs narrative includes an incident which does notoccur elsewhere, an actual assault by a police dog set on him by the militarydog handler. Mr. Farrell said that the dog had torn to shreds the back of hiscoat on the left-hand side. A member of our staff has seen in the Sunday Timesoffice a coat which was sent to the paper as being Mr. Farrell&apos;s. It had a tearon the left-hand side of the rear vent. The Sunday Times said that forensictests were carried out on the coat to see if any residue of dog saliva remainedon it; but the coat had been too recently dry-cleaned to enable any result tobe achieved.241. We refer to the evidence in relation to dogs recorded under the heading of the &quot;obstacle course&quot;. It is agreed by the Army witnesses that the dogswhen on a leash and under close control would not only bark but might alsosnap at people who approach their handlers too closely. All the witnesses we heard, dog handlers and escorts alike, denied that there had been any case where a dog had been close enough to an arrestee to enable the dog to succeed in an effort at biting or seizing clothing.Conclusion242. We make no finding, for we cannot resolve the conflict of evidencehere. The torn coat is not supported by any oral evidence to us from Mr. Farrellor anyone else, and all the witnesses we saw, deny that any dog was closeenough to tear it.William Gilmore243. Mr. Gilmore was alleged to have been roughly treated on arrest, in londonderry, and to have been shot in the stomach at close range with a rubberbullet. Reports of the arrest appeared in the Irish Independent of the 18thAugust, and of the shooting in the issue of Private Eye dated the 10th September.244. We heard evidence from five members of the security forces: the officer in charge of the prisoner collection point to which Mr. Gilmore was brought;the medical officer who there examined Mr. Gilmore; the warrant officer whowas in charge of the arrest; a non-commissioned officer who was a member ofthe arrest party; and a private soldier who had a riot gun and who fired a batonround.245. The course of events described to us by these witnesses was as follows:The arrest party consisting of the warrant officer and 9 men with a driver went to the street in Londonderry where Mr. Gilmore lived. On arrival they saw a group of rioters at the other end of the street. They dismounted, and the driverwas told to turn round the vehicle, a 4-tonner. The private soldier with the riotgun was left to guard it. Mr. Gilmore&apos;s house was one of a row of pre-fabricateddwellings set back from the street down an alley way. The warrant officerstationed men at the back and the front of the house and took 4 men with himto effect the arrest. Two men were found in the house, Mr. Gilmore and ayounger man. Both men were arrested. As they left the house the rioters wereSterne 40 yards away. The warrant officer anticipated heavy stone throwing andpbsdibly petrol bombs, with the possibility of sniper fire. He divided his partyintjrr two. He sent off the younger man with a party under the non-commissionedofficer. This party ran from the house. Visibility was poor, but they came under
a volley of bricks and bottles from the approaching rioters. After the first volleyof stones the warrant officer started off with the remainder of the party. He wason one side, Mr. Gilmore in the centre, and another soldier on the other side.The rioters were by now 25 yards away. The warrant officer heard Mr. Gilmoregroan just after they had started, and assumed he had been struck by a stone.246. In the meantime, at the lorry the young private soldier with the riot gunwas watching with some concern for the return of the arrest party. Visibility waspoor, and it was impossible to distinguish detail at more than 25-30 yards. Atthe first approach of the rioters he fired one baton round in their general direction. They drew back a little. Just after he had fired, the first arrest partyreturned to the lorry. He assumed the young man they had with them was the intended arrestee. As they got aboard the rioters approached again. He discernedthree shapes, whom he assumed to be rioters, coming close. He fired a batonround in their direction. They continued to approach and with some consterna-tion he recognised the warrant officer. Mr. Gilmore was groaning and holdinghis left side.247. At Ebrington Barracks in Londonderry, the prisoner collection point,the warrant officer learnt that Mr. Gilmore was in severe pain. He was liftedinto the barracks, and the officer in charge immediately sent for the medical officer. The medical officer had been watching arrivals and as soon as he sawMr. Gilmore being carried in he fetched his bag, and was at hand at once. he found serious bruising on the left part of the abdomen and left hip. He antici-pated the danger of some kind of internal injury, and arranged for Mr. Gilmore&apos;sadmission to Altnagelvin Hospital for X-ray. He understood that he there hadundergone an operation for a ruptured small bowel.248. After seeing Mr. Gilmore to the medical officer, the warrant officerreturned to the arrest party. The private soldier admitted to him that he hadmistaken the warrant officers party for rioters. At the range he fired, the roundmight have struck any member of the party. The warrant officer told us his party was wearing flak jackets, but no web equipment. There were no clearrecognition marks. He confirmed visibility was poor: on turning out of thealleyway, the lorry was not visible at the end of the road. There were no streetlights.Conclusion249. There is a clear conclusion in this case. Mr. Gilmore did indeed sufferill treatment, but certainly not brutality: for the damage was done by accident,the cause being a mistake on the part of the soldier who fired the rubber bullet,without any suggestion that his object was to hit, still less to hurt, the arrestedman.250. The remainder of the evidence shows that no time was lost in gettingMr. Gilmore into medical care.Joseph Hughes251. Mr. Hughes complained that at the time of his arrest in Belfast he waspulled by the hair into the street, batoned and kicked; he was made to run 4*2)0yards in bare feet, then forced to lie face down in a lorry where he was agvinkicked and where a soldier inflicted a stomach wound with his gun barrel. He
refers also, without details, to other assaults, to being forced over the &quot;obstaclecourse&quot;, and to being released late on the 10th August (see paragraphs 120-136and 137-148).252. Reports of these complaints appeared in the Irish Times of the 16thAugust, the Daily Telegraph of the 17th August, and the Irish Independent, theIrish News, the Irish Press and the Irish Times, all of the 18th August. A copyof a statement signed by Mr. Hughes was forwarded to us by the Chief Constableof the R.U.C., to whom Mr. Devlin, M.P. had sent it for investigation; anothercopy was sent by the Association for Legal Justice to the Home Office.253. We heard evidence from 6 members of the security forces. The sergeantin charge of the arrest party told us that at first Mr. Hughes had refused toleave the house. He seized him in a hold that involved grasping the hair andan arm, and took him downstairs. He then handed Mr. Hughes over to a juniorN.C.O., who took him by a similar hold and ran him to a rendezvous 400 yardsdistant at the vehicle of the arrest party.254. The hold used was demonstrated by the N.C.O. on our Chairman, andwe were told that it is a regular hold known as the &quot;Kado&quot; which had beentaught to him for use on such occasions. All those involved denied the allegationthat Mr. Hughes had been kicked or struck with a baton. They all agreed thathe was made to nan and that he was bare-footed. Mr. Hughes was arrested inButler Street and there was need for particular haste to get clear before a hostilecrowd had formed.255. It was agreed that all the prisoners of whom Mr. Hughes was one hadbeen required to lie on the floor of the 4-ton Bedford vehicle in which Mr.Hughes was taken to Girdwood Park. There were 9 prisoners in this vehicleand they had plenty of room to lie down. Blankets were put over them. between  and 10 soldiers were in the lorry sitting on the side benches or with their legsover the lowered tail board. It was denied that Mr. Hughes had been struck witha rifle butt and we were told he could not have been struck with a rifle barrelin the stomach because he had been lying on his front.256. There was no record that Mr. Hughes had received any treatment atGirdwood Park, and no complaint is recorded in the reception records. Mr.Hughes was released late on the 10th August and not moved into detention sothat for him we have no medical record of his condition on entry into detentionat Crumlin Jail.Conclusion257. The complaint of being pulled by the hair into the street, we identifywith the &quot;Kado&quot; grip which the arresting soldier admitted he used. The effectof the grip on the subject can be harsh, but it is a recognised method for the controlled use of force, and the evidence gave us the impression that in this casethe arrester used no more force than was necessary to get the arrested person tomove with the urgency that the situation required.; 258. As to Mr. Hughes&apos; experiences in the lorry, it is clear that he had anuncomfortable journey, but in view of the conflict of evidence we can make nofnMing on the allegation of assault during the journey, beyond noting theabsence of any evidence of complaint of injury or treatment for injury at
Girdwood Park. This is another case where we have regretted that the Girdwoodadmission system has not provided us with medical records of the condition ofarrested persons on their arrival.Thomas Gerald Johnston259. Mr. Johnston complained that he had been made to walk on barbed wire and been put in a compound at Albert Street in the course of being movedafter arrest at his home in Albert Street to Girdwood Park. His complaint was published in the Irish Times on the 20th August.260. Mr. Johnston&apos;s complaint is comparable with that of Michael OliverBrady in paragraphs 182-190 above. When taking evidence about conditions at Albert Street, we had the complaints of both men in mind but there is nothing in this case to add to the evidence already recorded.Conclusion261. The conflict of evidence, which we cannot resolve, is that Mr. Johnstonsays he was made to walk on barbed wire, while the army witnesses say hehad to move between rolls of barbed wire. Either way he seems to have cometo no harm, if we may rely on the evidence that he did not complain of hurton admission to Girdwood Park or ask for medical attention there.Eamon Kerr262. Mr. Kerr, who was arrested in Belfast, complained that at Girdwoodwhile still on the transport awaiting reception cigarettes were stubbed outon the back of his neck, and while on the &quot;obstacle course&quot; he was madeto walk in bare feet on tacks strewn on the ground, and poked and struck withbatons. Reports of the complaint appeared in the Irish Press on the 18thAugust and the Irish Times on the 20th August. (Mr. Kerr&apos;s complaint aboutthe &quot;obstacle course&quot; is considered together with similar complaints at para-graphs 120-136.)263. In relation to the stubbing out allegations only, we took oral evidence from 4 witnesses and saw the documentary evidence recording his receptionat Girdwood and the medical record of his reception into Crumlin Jail onthe 11th August after a detention order had been served upon him.264. We saw two members of the party that had arrested Mr. Kerr, anN.C.O. and a private soldier. The N.C.O. had accompanied Mr. Kerrthroughout this journey to Girdwood from the point of arrest. He said thatafter arrest Mr. Kerr had first been taken to Mulhouse Street and thence inan armoured vehicle with 3 other arrestees to Girdwood. On the journey therehad been himself and 3 other soldiers with the arrestees. The N.C.O.&apos;s positionin the vehicle had been on the left-hand side at the back, and from there hehad had a clear view inside the vehicle at all times. No-one had smoked duringthe journey to Girdwood. It was not true that anyone had assaulted Mr. Ken-in any way, or put a cigarette close to him or stubbed any cigarettes out onhis neck. The N.C.O. spontaneously informed us he had &quot;given him a mouthful&quot;i.e. had abused verbally, but he characterised the stubbing out allegations ^sridiculous and untrue. We were particularly impressed by this witness.265. The private soldier we saw, said he had not accompanied Mr. Kerr in
the vehicle to Girdwood but he had been a member of the arrest party and hehad travelled to Girdwood simultaneously with the vehicle (although not in itbecause it had been full) and arrived at the same time. At Girdwood the wholearrest party had escorted Mr. Kerr and the other arrestees to the building.On the brief walk there from the transport, the soldier had been behind Mr.Kerr. The latter he had not heard to complain or say anything at all. Nobodyhad been smoking in the back of the vehicle when he had got there to join theparty. He knew nothing about cigarettes being stubbed out on the back ofMr. Kerr&apos;s neck nor had he heard any talk of it. Since he had walked behindMr. Kerr to the building he thought he would probably have noticed anythingwrong with Mr. Kerr&apos;s neck if there had been a visible wound.266. The R.U.C. officer who recorded Mr. Kerr&apos;s particulars on reception inGirdwood produced to us a copy of his entry in the reception book about Mr. Kerr. This showed that no complaint by Mr. Kerr had been recorded onhis arrival at 0640. The officer told us he had asked all arrestees who had come before him whether they had a complaint and he would have recordedanything they said.267. As regards the medical evidence, the medical officer on duty at Girdwooddid not see Mr. Kerr and, so far as we have been able to establish, Mr. Kerrwas not treated there. The prison medical officer who examined him onadmission to the prison proper on the 11th August recorded in an entry wehave seen that Mr. Kerr had superficial burns to his neck and that they wereto be dressed. This doctor told us there were two small superficial burns andin all they received several dressings. He recollected Mr. Kerr claiming to him that the burns had been caused by cigarettes held to the neck. Although theburns were small, they were consistent with Mr. Kerr&apos;s claim.Conclusions268. This is a case of conflicting evidence which cannot be reconciled by us.The report of the prison medical officer indicates that on reception in the prison on the 11th August, Mr. Kerr carried two small superficial burns tohis neck, and it was the doctor&apos;s opinion that these were consistent with Mr.Kerr&apos;s claim to him that they had been caused by cigarettes held to the neck.On the other hand, we have the denial of Mr. Kerr&apos;s arrest escort that theydid it to him. Their denial is supported by the evidence that Mr. Kerr onentering Girdwood on the 9th August within minutes of the alleged assaultshowed no sign of having undergone what, if the allegation is true, was a recent and very painful experience, and by the evidence that he made no complaint of it either to the reception officer or to the medical officer. Thepossibility cannot therefore be excluded that the burns took place before mr. Kerr was arrested.269. We regret, therefore, that we are unable to reach a positive conclusion in this case.Thomas LargeyV270. Mr. Largey, aged 53, complained that on arrest in Belfast he wasdigged downstairs by the head and forced to run about half a mile to a lorry.On arrival at Girdwood he was deprived of his shoes and searched. Duringthe search a soldier stamped on &quot;his feet and a later request for treatment of
his feet was ignored. Reports of this complaint were published in the IrishPress and the Irish Times both of the 18th August, and we also received acopy of the statement Mr. Largey made to the Association for Legal Justice.271. We took evidence from 7 members of security forces including theN.C.O. in charge of the arrest party and members of the R.U.C. who dealtwith Mr. Largey at Girdwood. Documentary evidence included a recordmade at the time of his arrival at Girdwood after arrest.272. The N.C.O. in charge of the arrest party told us they had had to forceentry to Mr. Largey&apos;s house after a woman&apos;s voice had said that they wouldnot be let in. In the house they had been met by a woman, understood to beMrs. Largey, who had attempted to obstruct the N.C.O. as he had goneupstairs. Although Mr. Largey himself came peacefully on arrest, Mrs. Largeycontinued to obstruct and abuse the soldiers on the way out of the house.Mr. Largey had come downstairs of his own accord between the N.C.O. andanother soldier: there had been no need to use force nor had he been draggeddown by the hair of his head. Downstairs Mr. Largey had picked up his jacketand outside the party had moved off at some speed down the road with a soldier on either side of Mr. Largey. The total distance to the transport hadbeen, the N.C.O. estimated, between 600 and 700 metres but they had onlyrun from Mr. Largey&apos;s house as far as the Crumlin Road a distance of 200-250metres and Mr. Largey had been shod. The N.C.O. was clear the distancehad been as little as 200-250 metres only and not the half mile Mr. Largeyhad alleged. The latter had not seemed unduly distressed by the run. Like thesoldiers he was out of breath. On arrival at the rendezvous at Woodvale Drive,Mr. Largey had been helped up on to the 4-ton lorry. The junior N.C.O. ofthe arrest party confirmed his senior&apos;s account to us. He added that the onlyforce that had been used was to hand off Mrs. Largey. The soldier was not clear in his evidence to us about what exactly had occurred on leaving thehouse, especially who had been holding on to whom. The distance they hadrun after leaving the house was rather less than half a mile. After running itthey had all been puffing and panting.273. The private who had been a member of the arrest party confirmed tous the account we had already received of the entry to the house and that noforce had been used to get Mr. Largey downstairs. He added that Mrs. Largeyhad shouted a lot and called the soldiers names. One of the reasons why, on leaving the house, the party had run the 200-300 yards through the Ardoynehad been because Mrs. Largey had been shouting. The private accompaniedMr. Largey in the 4-ton lorry to Girdwood, where the man had simply climbedoff the back and had not been kicked out. Once Mr. Largey had got off thelorry, military police had taken over but before he got off Mr. Largey hadremoved his shoes at the behest of the military police. None of the soldiers atthe back of the lorry had used his baton on the prisoners. The witness said he himself had not had a baton and only a couple of the others on the vehicleshad. Whilst he had had a rifle he had not prodded anyone with it.274. We took evidence also from an N.C.O. who had been engaged on,intelligence duties at the rendezvous to which the arrest party had takenMr. Largey. This N.C.O. had also been on the vehicle upon which Mr. Largeyhad travelled to Girdwood. He said that when the vehicle had arrived at
Girdwood they had had a wait of between 15 and 20 minutes because of theother vehicles in front of them. Because of the delay, the three prisoners in the vehicle had been made to stand against it when they got off while they waitedfor the men ahead to be processed through reception. The N.C.O. had seen mr. Largey get off the truck with assistance from someone on the ground.Whilst waiting outside the vehicle the prisoners had been made to turn withtheir faces toward it, with their legs apart, and their hands forward upon the side of the vehicle. In this &quot;spread eagle&quot; position Mr. Largey had beensearched but he had not been struck on the legs with a baton and no-one hadstamped on his feet.275. The R.U.C. officer who had been on reception duty at Girdwoodproduced to us a copy of the entry he had made of Mr. Largey&apos;s personalparticulars on his arrival at 0606. He did not recollect Mr. Largey and hadnoted nothing in his record about Mr. Largey&apos;s condition, although he said he would have done so had there been anything unusual about it. It wouldhave been possible for him to notice anything unusual since Mr. Largey hadto walk from the door to the desk some feet away. Similarly, there was norecord of Mr. Largey having complained in any way, and a note would havebeen taken had he done so. One of the two officers who had been concernedwith interviewing Mr. Largey said he had interviewed him on two separateoccasions with another officer. Mr. Largey had been in his stockinged feet andhad had opportunity to complain if he wished to do so, but he had not. Theofficer was nearly certain he recollected asking Mr. Largey whether he had anycomplaints. If Mr. Largey had asked for medical attention it would have beenobtained since the officer knew that it was available. The officer also said to us that he had accompanied Mr. Largey on the journey through the hole in the wall into Crumlin Jail and noticed nothing unusual about his condition.276. There was no record of Mr. Largey having received any medical treatment at Girdwood or the Prison but with Mr. Largey in mind we took the opportunity of asking the medical officer who had been on call at Girdwoodabout the arrangements for dealing with medical complaints made by men inthe prison wing used as an annex to the Holding Centre before either releaseor detention in the Prison proper. The medical officer confirmed that themilitary police who were in charge of the custody of arrestees at Girdwoodknew that he was standing by and they had shown no inhibitions in approachinghim about medical cases. He would not have refused to attend men held inthe prison wing and the question had arisen on the 10th August when two men who had been taken into the prison wing had sought medical attention.An officer had come through the hole in the wall to ask the medical officer to see the two men and he had arranged that they should be brought back for him to examine them.Conclusion277. This is another case in which we can make no finding because of theunresolved conflict of evidence. As regards the allegation of violence to\Mr. Largey in his house during arrest, we have the account of events by thearresters pointing to conflict not with Mr. Largey but with Mrs. Largey. Asregards the allegation of damage to his foot at Girdwood and disregard of his request to have it treated, we have been unable to trace the incident in the
evidence of events from military and police sources. We notice the absence ofany record of medical treatment, and the absence of evidence that Mr. Largeyasked for treatment.James Moore278. Mr. Moore complained personally to us that soldiers broke into his house at Benares Street, Belfast, between 0400 and 0500 on the 9th August and while he was holding the door against them his left arm was cut in two places, inone deeply. He was arrested and tied by a string with one end round his rightwrist, which was forced up his back, and the other end round his neck. He wastaken to Girdwood where he was made to go on the &quot;obstacle course&quot;. he received no attention for his cut arm, although he sought it on both the 9th andthe 10th August, until late on the 10th August. He was released from Girdwoodat 2300 on the 10th August when it was most dangerous to be on the streets.279. Mr. Moore&apos;s allegations are not elsewhere reported. We have consideredevidence given by Mr. Moore himself, by members of the security forces and byprison officers.280. Mr. Moore told us that he heard a commotion in the street early on the9th August and got up to see what was afoot. Wearing his vest and trousers he went to his front door. There his presence attracted the attention of passingsoldiers. They moved towards him and he slammed the door. The soldiers thenbroke into his house whilst he tried to hold the door against them. His left armwas cut, he believed by a piece of flying glass. When the soldiers broke in theybundled him into the back part of the house and tied a piece of string aroundhis right wrist. His wrist was put up his back and the free end of the string tiedaround his neck. He told us the string around his neck was not so tight as to cause discomfort unless he moved his arm. He was made to run to a nearbystreet where a lorry was waiting. Before mounting the vehicle a soldier put abandage on his cut arm. At this point also the shoes he had put on before leaving the house were removed and put in a bag.281. In dealing with events after his admission to Girdwood Mr. Mooredescribed to us the move from Girdwood Park to the adjoining Prison wingwhich was clearly a description of the &quot;obstacle course&quot; mentioned in othercomplaints. Mr. Moore&apos;s complaints under this head have been stated in para-graphs 120-136 above.282. Mr. Moore said that as soon as he arrived at Girdwood, he had askedfor medical attention. He had lost some blood, and blood was visibly soakingthrough his bandage. He received no attention. He asked again in the prisonwing. The prison officer he approached told him the R.U.C. would deal withall such requests. He said that no R.U.C. officer came round on the 9th Augustfor this purpose. He asked again on the morning of the 10th August and was told to make his request in the afternoon. He did so, and eventually was takento Girdwood Park where he saw a doctor at, he thought, 1630 on the 10thAugust.283. His complaint about ejection from Girdwood Park late on the 10thAugust has been stated in paragraphs 137-148 above.284. Mr. Moore told us that he could not have been arrested as a suspect.
He was a member of the Ulster Defence Regiment (U.D.R.) and had no con-nection with any illegal organisation. He added that he proposed to claimcompensation for the events he had described to us.285. Mr. Moore&apos;s allegations fall into 4 parts: (a) Assault on arrest;(b) Taking part in the &quot;obstacle course&quot; at Girdwood Park;(c) Failure to obtain medical aid for cut arm;(d) Ejection from Girdwood Park into dangerous street conditions.(a) Alleged assault on arrest286. The army witnesses told us that Mr. Moore was not on their list forarrest. An arrest party having failed to make their arrest were going down astreet towards a commotion at the far end. The last man in the squad collidedwith a man and fell to the ground. The soldier who fell told us that this man hadjumped out of a door, knocked him over and kicked him in the stomach as hefell. He was, even so, able to see the man run back into a door, which he slammed.Other members of the squad turned back, hearing the sound of the fall. Theybroke into the house and the same man went for them again. They secured himby tying him with parachute cord fastened to both elbows across his back. Wewere told this is a standard method of tying a prisoner v/ho has to be movedrapidly from one place to another. The military witnesses were emphatic thatthey had not used the method described by Mr. Moore. It was agreed by thesewitnesses that it might have been better not to tie an admittedly wounded arm,but we gathered from the evidence that the severity of the wound was not immediately apparent to them. The witnesses from the arrest party told us thatMr. Moore had not attempted to identify himself at the outset as a member ofthe U.D.R. In the vehicle en route for Girdwood Park, however, Mr. Moorehad told the arresting soldier he was in the U.D.R. and indeed that he wouldtake the soldier to court for arresting him. They did not believe him at the time.287. The evidence of the arresting party was given to us after we had heardMr. Moore. Having heard them we asked Mr. Moore for his comments on theassertion that he had assaulted and kicked the soldier. He strenuously denied that he had done so.(b) &quot;Obstacle course&quot;288. We examine Mr. Moore&apos;s evidence about the &quot;obstacle course&quot; in thesection of our Report that deals with the group of complainants concernedwith this incident (paragraphs 120-136 above).(c) Medical attention289. We refer to the evidence concerning responsibility for arrestees held inthe prison wing which we report in the cases of Mr. Brendan Anderson andMr. Largey (see paragraphs 162 and 276). It appears from the evidence of theR.U.C. that no formal sick parades were held for Girdwood men held in the prison wing on either the 9th or the 10th August, and no routine had beenestablished by which arrestees were to report sick. The R.U.C. officers on dutyhad not thought it necessary to announce that requests for medical attentionwould be entertained and relied on the detainees to say if they needed it. Asregards medical attention at Girdwood itself, we heard from one of the medical
officers on duty at Girdwood Park and from an N.C.O. who was concerned withthe reception of prisoners, that no formal sick parades were held at GirdwoodPark. Both, however, felt that as a medical orderly was continuously present ina room used for medical treatment and as the medical officer (who from his bagwould have been recognised as a doctor) frequently visited the room, no arresteeshould have been in any doubt where he should go if he needed treatment. Wewere told that announcements concerning medical treatment were made togroups of arrestees.290. We heard evidence also from the R.U.C. officer on duty at the receptiondesk, who had noted in the entry record for Mr. Moore: &quot;left arm bandagebleeding&quot;. He told us that he did not know what medical arrangements were inforce at Girdwood Park and had not been told in his preliminary briefing. Itwas not part of his duty to refer injuries to a medical officer although if he had seen a man who was apparently seriously hurt he would certainly have tried toget medical attention for him.291. The medical officer confirmed that he had treated Mr. Moore at aboutthe time alleged, late in the afternoon of the 10th August. In his note he recorded&quot;complains of laceration left fore-arm 36 hours old RX: suture, cabinet tox,penicillin&quot;. The medical officer recalled that the cut was gaping and neededstitching. He had not noted the number of stitches, but agreed that it may well have been four. (The scar and marks on his arm which we examined when we saw Mr. Moore were consistent with the insertion of four stitches.) The medical officer, when we asked why Mr. Moore had not sought treatment if it was clearlyavailable, replied that he thought he was a matter-of-fact and stoical individualwho would have treated it as merely a scratch, and would not have made muchof it perhaps until he looked at it on the morning of the 10th and had realised that the cut was gaping and required stitches.(d) Alleged ejection from Girdwood292. This part of Mr. Moore s complaint is covered by that section of our report where we deal with the allegations made by him and several othersabout the arrangements for men released late on the 10th August from theClifton Park Avenue Gate of Girdwood (see paragraphs 137-148).Conclusions293. As we have said, Mr. Moore appeared before us to substantiate hisallegations. By his own choice he was not legally represented. Our conclusions on his allegations are as follows.294. We formed a favourable impression of Mr. Moore. We do not thinkthat he assaulted the soldier outside his door. No doubt some person did so,but in the prevailing circumstances, and in the dark, a mistake of identificationof the assailant could easily take place. We are disposed to believe that he wastied in the way he recounts and would comment that if it was thought necessaryto tie him it was better to do so this way than to tie his injured and bleedingarm. Altogether we think that Mr. Moore was arrested by mistake; it is clearthat the cut to his arm from broken glass was caused accidentally when the door was broken down in the course of arrest. Mr. Moore underwent a con-siderable degree of hardship. But he was not treated with brutality.
295. As regards the failure to obtain medical aid, it is common ground thatthe gash in his arm was serious and should have had medical attention. Wehave taken account of the evidence of the opportunities he had to ask for medical attention, both at Girdwood Park itself and while in the prison wing.Against that we have Mr. Moore&apos;s evidence, which we believe, that he did askfor medical attention (a) on reception into Girdwood Park on the morning ofthe 9th August, (b) in the prison wing later on the 9th August, (c) on the morning of the 10th August, and did not get it till the afternoon of the 10th August.We find that Mr. Moore suffered hardship, not from intentional ill-treatmentbut through deficiencies in the systems of communications at Girdwood and through avoidable neglect.296. Our conclusions regarding Mr. Moore&apos;s part in the &quot;obstacle course&quot;and release from Girdwood late on the 10th August, are in paragraphs 133-136and 148 above.Felim 0&apos;Hagan297. Mr. 0&apos;Hagan, aged 16, was arrested at Lurgan. His mother, Mrs.0&apos;Hagan, complained that her son, although he made no resistance at thetime of his arrest, was pulled out of the house with his arm twisted up hisback and struck with a baton across the shoulders. The allegations we sawwere in a copy of a statement it was said Mrs. 0&apos;Hagan had made to theAssociation for Legal Justice.298. We saw two witnesses, both members of the arrest party. The first, theprivate who had actually effected the arrest, said that they had had to forceentry by smashing a pane of glass after Mr. 0&apos;Hagan&apos;s mother had refused to open the door. With others, the soldier had gone into a downstairs sitting roomwhere he had seen a youth sitting clothed in a chair. The soldier had been instructed by the N.C.O. in charge of the arrest party to arrest the young man.The soldier thereupon asked the youth to come along with the party but the youth had not replied and had not made any move. The soldier then said hehad put Mr. 0&apos;Hagan in an arm-lock which he demonstrated before us on ourChairman. For reasons that the demonstration made clear, the lock had been successful in making Mr. 0&apos;Hagan leave the sitting position and accompany the arrest party. The young man had been plainly frightened by the proceedings.He had said nothing himself although his mother kept on shouting that thesoldiers had got the wrong man. It had been necessary to maintain the arm-lock outside the house because it appeared that even then Mr. 0&apos;Hagan was reluctant to accompany the soldiers. The soldier told us that both he and allthe other escorts had had batons but he had not used his on Mr. 0&apos;Hagan. the allegation that the young man had been pulled with the arm twisted up hisback was an incorrect description of what had happened.299. The N.C.O. in charge of the arrest party told us that he had had orders to arrest three men in Mr. 0&apos;Hagan&apos;s house. He had had photographs of allthe three and it had been plain on getting into the house that none of them was there. The N.C.O. had then gone out of the house to take direction from hissuperior officer explaining that the only male in the house was Mr. 0&apos;Hagan.The officer ordered that the youth should nonetheless be taken along.300. The N.C.O. said he had repeated the words of arrest to Mr. 0&apos;Hagan
who had made no response and had continued to sit in the armchair. He had heard the soldier ask Mr. 0&apos;Hagan to accompany the troops but Mrs. CVHaganhad told the youth to remain where he was. The N.C.O. was sure that hadMr. 0&apos;Hagan gone when first asked there would have been no trouble but itappeared he was trying to follow his mother&apos;s directions. When the soldierfrom whom we had taken evidence approached Mr. 0&apos;Hagan to take him intocustody the latter had shied backwards and the chair he was sitting in had fallen over. The soldier had then assisted him to stand, simultaneously puttingon the arm-lock. The party had then proceeded out of the house walking,without any special measures being taken to propel Mr. 0&apos;Hagan along eventhough his mother tried to hold him back. No batons had been used at anytime during the arrest and the whole proceedings had been within the N.C.O.&apos;view. There had been no need to use excessive force as Mr. 0&apos;Hagan was obviously frightened and the arm-lock largely a formality.Conclusion301. The allegation of the &quot;arm twisted up his back&quot; is identified as thearm-lock which the arresting soldier said he used. The application of thislock, a controlled use of force, is only painful if resisted. We do not thinkit was used with the object of hurting, but only to the extent, which accordingto the evidence was small, required to make the arrested person comply.302. We cannot resolve the conflict between the allegation of striking with abaton across the shoulders, and the witnesses&apos; assertions that they had not usedbatons at any time during the arrest.George Patrick 0&apos;Hara303. In a statement taken by a solicitor Mr. 0&apos;Hara, who was arrested in belfast, complained that at Girdwood he was taken to a helicopter which had just landed some detainees and he was taken up in it, bound, by two militarypolicemen who threatened to throw him out at tree-top level and, indeed,held him half out of an open door. Despite its rather different nature, we aresatisfied, from the evidence that we have described elsewhere that this casestems from the incident that we described above under the &quot;HelicopterIncident&quot; (see paragraphs 106-119 above).304. The evidence that we outlined there was unanimous in stating that nohelicopter ever took off during the operation with the arrested men aboard or that there were members of the security forces inside the helicopter other thanthe R.A.F. crew member.Conclusion305. No other arrested man made a similar allegation. While we can reachno determination without seeing the complainant, we should be surprised ifthis allegation proved to be well-founded.Richard Rodgers306. Mr. Rodgers complained that after his arrest at Newry at 0430 on the9th August he was punched and struck with batons and gun butts both in a vehicle en route for a collection point at Newry, and later on the way to thehelicopter that was to take him to Ballykinler. He complained also that at
Ballykinler he was forced to perform exercises with which we have dealt above.A report of these complaints appeared in The Times of the 26th August.307. We took oral evidence from two members of the security forces who hadbeen concerned in the arrest and transport of Mr. Rodgers. We examined the record of the medical examination carried out on Mr. Rodgers&apos; admission tothe Ballykinler Holding Centre.308. The army witnesses, a junior N.C.O. and a private soldier, denied usingany force on the complainant. He had not resisted arrest and had in fact beenco-operative. It was not necessary to restrain him in any way, nor to force himto leave his house or enter the army vehicle.309. On admission to Ballykinler, no cuts, bruises or marks were found on medical examination, and Mr. Rodgers signed a statement certifying that he wasin good health and had sustained no injury.Conclusion310. We record the evidence given by the military witnesses that they had not used force on him or needed to do so. This evidence is supported by the record of Mr. Rodgers&apos; medical examination on entry into Ballykinler and his owncertificate given on entry that he had sustained no injury. We doubt whether these allegations can be sustained.Desmond Smith311. Mr. Smith, who was arrested at Bessbrook, County Armagh, complained of his treatment at Ballykinler Camp and commented adversely on his treatmentat Musgrave Park Hospital. Our investigation concentrated on the complaintsrelating to Ballykinler, in particular that on arrival he was pushed out of ahelicopter before it had touched down, when it was six feet from the ground;that after admission he was made to perform hard exercises; that at first he was refused any place or opportunity to relieve himself, and that when eventuallytaken out for this purpose was given insufficient time; that when he could notperform the exercises he was beaten and had water thrown over him; and thatwhen he went into a convulsive fit a military policeman pushed a knife into hismouth with such force that several back teeth were smashed and the blade ofthe knife snapped in two.312. We have dealt above with the complaint about exercises. In relation tothis and the other complaints, we heard evidence from a specialist, the medical officer, and 7 members of the security forces including 1 police officer.313. In relation to the helicopter journey Mr. Smith commented that he andothers had been kept in the draught of turning rotor blades before boarding, andhe complained that on arrival at Ballykinler, he and other arrestees on board had been pushed from the helicopter before it touched the ground.314. We heard evidence from an N.C.O. who was one of the helicopter escortparty. He told us that no-one was deliberately kept in the slipstream of therotors before boarding, though they might have had to wait for a short time forthe signal from the crewman that it was safe to board. He confirmed that in thatperiod the engine and rotors would have been operating in accordance with normal procedure, but denied that the result would cause any hardship. The
escorting N.C.O. also denied that any men had been pushed from the helicopterbefore it touched down and said that he was the first to leave it when it had done so.315. Mr. Smith made a number of complaints about toilet facilities atBallykinler, in particular that to start with all the arrestees were refused permis-sion to relieve themselves, to the point where a number of them urinated on the floor. Then he says a hole was dug outside, but when Mr. Smith asked to use it,he was hustled out by two military policemen, and back again before he had hada chance to relieve himself, so that on his return he wet himself.316. We heard in evidence from the army witnesses that the distance from thehuts to the ablutions hut was 100-150 yards. In the early stages a journey tothis hut involved taking each arrestee there under escort. Later on latrines wereprepared between the huts with pits and buckets, to which arrestees could moreconveniently be taken to urinate. We heard from one witness that anyone whowanted to relieve himself had been allowed to do so, and to take what time he required. Another witness told us of one occasion when arrestees had beenhastened. On the 10th August, the platoon coming on duty at 1200 had to seethe arrestees had a meal, a visit to the ablutions hut and a final interview before1500. The soldiers also had to be fed. As some 90 arrestees were involved, theyhad been required, unless ill or elderly, to run to the ablution hut and back.317. Mr. Smith then complains that he was subjected to an increasing degreeof ill treatment until he had a fainting fit, when he was pulled out of the hut bythe hair and had a bucket of water thrown over him. The military witnesses saythat a bucket of water was tipped over one arrestee, not Mr. Smith, who beganshouting at the top of his voice and who continued to do so after he had beenplaced in a hut by himself to calm down. There is no evidence other than his ownstatement that Mr. Smith received the same treatment. Mr. Smith says he wasunconscious at the time, and is repeating what others told him.318. This episode was followed according to Mr. Smith by his having anattack of epilepsy. He says that according to other onlookers a military police-man pushed a knife into his mouth so hard that it smashed several back teeth,and the blade was snapped in two; it was withdrawn dripping with blood. Hewas then brought round by the doctor, who administered an injection. We have studied a number of contemporaneous medical records, and heard evidence from the medical officer and a specialist who later treated Mr. Smith. There isno doubt that Mr. Smith suffered a convulsive fainting attack. Expert medicalopinion is divided on whether it was an epileptic fit, but the medical officer whowas sent for and saw the closing stages of the episode had no doubt that Mr.Smith was indeed undergoing a grand mal convulsion.319. The medical officer told us that after a quick examination, he thought itbest to protect Mr. Smith from the risk of biting his tongue during the convul-sion. He called for a spoon to hold the tongue down. No-one could find one, and eventually a metal-handled knife was provided from a set of Army utensils. Themedical officer opened Mr. Smith&apos;s mouth, and used the handle of the knife tohold his tongue down, inserting it some 2 cms. between the front teeth. He said it went nowhere near the back teeth. After Mr. Smith had recovered from the fithe gave him an anti-convulsant drug which was taken orally. He had no injectionsavailable. Mr. Smith was then removed to hospital.
320. We have studied the medical reports made thereafter both in hospital and by the civilian medical officer on the Maidstone. None of them record anycomplaint of damage to the back teeth. In view of the history of convulsion, itwould be routine to examine the mouth for tongue-biting or other injury; noinjury is recorded.321. In his statement Mr. Smith goes on to make allegations about thistreatment in hospital and the conditions of his detention. The latter lie outsideour terms of reference and it would not be appropriate for us to investigate orcomment upon them. We do not consider that his narrative contains furtherallegations of physical ill-treatment.Conclusions322. We do not consider that there is substance in the complaint aboutejection from the helicopter while it was off the ground. Apart from the denialby the escort, and his evidence that he left first, account must be taken of thestandard procedure, independently controlled by the helicopter crewman, bywhich passengers are not permitted to leave the machine before it has landed.We think this complainant, like others, may have been misled into thinking the machine had not landed if he left while the engines were still on and the rotorsturning. The reference to the height of 6 feet in the allegation may be an over-estimate of the distance (about 4 feet) between the cabin floor of a landedhelicopter and the ground.323. On the sanitary arrangements at Ballykinler, we recognise the conflict ofevidence between the complainant and the military and police witnesses. We canonly report the evidence we have received in reply to the allegations, and make no finding other than to say that we had no adverse comment on the sanitaryarrangements at Ballykinler from the medical officer.324. There remains the complaint of maltreatment in connection with what we consider, on balance, to have been an epileptic fit. Here the evidence of themedical officer refutes the allegations, and shows that treatment was promptlyand correctly given.John Dermot White325. Mr. White complained that, after his arrest at Londonderry, he hadbeen kicked and beaten en route for Magilligan Camp; that at the camp heand the other detainees had no food until 1900 on the 9th August, having been arrested at 0430, and when it came it was of poor quality; at the camp he andthe others were kept awake by soldiers who beat on their hut with batons; andthat he was interrogated in three 3-hour sessions, and then was threatenedunless he co-operated.326. Mr. Boyle also complained he was not fed for a long time, and that thefood was of poor quality.327. These complaints were reported in the Irish News of the 12th august and the Evening Standard of the 11th August. The Evening Standard quotedMr. White as saying that on arrest he was taken away wearing only his under-pants, and that he had marks on his leg to substantiate the complaint of beating.
328. In relation to Mr. White&apos;s complaint of ill-treatment on arrest, we heard evidence from 5 members of the arrest party including a captain and a warrant officer. They said that Mr. White did not resist being taken from thehouse, though his brother was prevented from leaving it. Between the house andthe arrest party&apos;s vehicle, Mr. White attempted to dig his heels in to prevent or slow down forward progress. A riot situation was developing and people werethrowing bottles and stones. The troops went as quickly as they could. Mr.White&apos;s resistance was overcome by two soldiers who took one arm each, andlifted him, not quite clear of the ground but so that his feet could not grip wellenough to resist forward progress. We established the identity of one of thesesoldiers, but there was a conflict of evidence as to the identity of the other. the escort party say that, although no violence was used, Mr. White was admittedlypushed into the vehicle, an armoured personnel carrier, and made to go to itsfront. They were unable to account for the superficial injuries from which hewas later found to be suffering.329. The witnesses say that Mr. White was fully dressed but for his jacketwhen first encountered in his house. He was not then nor thereafter only in hisunderpants. We have seen a photograph taken on arrival at Magilligan Camp.It is a half-length picture of Mr. White, and he is clearly wearing a shirt, tie andtrousers. Mr. White first was taken to Ebrington Barracks, Londonderry. Thencewith other arrestees he went by van to Magilligan Camp. One member of the arrest party went to the Camp in a land rover in convoy with the van. He told us that Mr. White was at this stage quite co-operative, and there was no occasion on this journey on which he might have received abrasions or bruises. AtMagilligan Camp he is not recorded as making any complaint, and the medical officer who examined Mr. White found that he had &quot;a few superficial injuries&quot;specifying &quot;abrasions medial aspect left knee; right scapular region; rightelbow&quot;.330. In relation to the supply and quality of food Mr. White&apos;s complaint isjoined with that of Mr. Boyle (see paragraphs 177-181 above). We heard evi-dence from two witnesses, a captain who is quartermaster of the unit on dutyat the camp, and a warrant officer in the Army Catering Corps. They told us that cooks from the infantry unit had started work soon after the unifs arrival,that tea was soon available and a breakfast meal had been served in the morning.We were told that arrestees were not served breakfast. From 1100 a mid-daymeal was served, consisting of meat and vegetable stew from tins, and tea.This, as for soldiers and police, was available to the arrestees. Many came throughlate for lunch, which in practice merged with the evening meal which commencedat 1700. This, also given to the arrestees, consisted of steak and kidney pudding,hamburgers, meat pie and three kinds of pudding. Neither witness couldunderstand the allegation that arrestees had not been fed until 1900. no permanent record was however available to show whether an individual arresteewas offered a meal at a given time.331. We heard evidence from the senior officer at Magilligan Camp andfrom a warrant officer that no noise had been made deliberately to keep menawake. It was agreed that some disturbance might have been caused by men being taken out for questioning. With regard to the use of batons to make noise,we noted the evidence of another arrestee that batons had been rapped on the outside of his hut at 0630 by way of sounding reveille.
332. In relation to the complaint Mr. White made about his interrogation,we heard evidence from the two police officers responsible. They had recordedthe times interrogation began and ended. There were three periods, at thefollowing times: on the 9th August, 0920-1010 and 1500-1550;on the 10th August, 1105-1255.They denied that they had uttered any threats or raised their voices. The onlycomplaint Mr. White made, during his first interrogation, was that he was cold.They gave him a blanket to put around his shoulders.Conclusion333. We think the photograph mentioned above refutes the report that Mr.White was arrested and taken away clad only in underpants. It would appearfrom the evidence of abrasions to his left knee, right chest and right elbow thathe had suffered some rough handling and we think this is likely to have occurredbetween arrest and arrival at Ebrington Barracks. Whether this was accidental,or whether, as Mr. White alleges, deliberate we cannot determine.
MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS334. There is one area in which our investigations have enabled us to identifyand comment on a general feature of the operation, namely the medical arrange-ments. We think that a detailed consideration of the organisation and admini-stration of the necessary medical arrangements should have been included inthe preliminary planning of the arrest operation and that the senior medicalstaff officer (in this case, the Assistant Director of Medical Services) should havebeen brought in at this stage. This would have ensured that, at the appointed hour,medical officers posted to the various stations would have had comprehensiveinstructions as to the nature of their duties and, more important still, these instructions would have embraced all the stations involved so that arrestees,wherever they were, would have been the subject of a considered and con-sistent scheme of medical care and record.335. In the event, the senior medical staff officer (A.D.M.S.) was not in on thepreliminary or the planning stage (and, indeed, was unaware that the operation was taking place till it was in progress). The medical officers concerned weresketchily briefed by non-medical staff officers a few hours before the exercisewas due to take place. Each had to make his own ad hoc arrangements and decide for himself on the time, the nature and extent of his examinations of arresteesand on the machinery necessary in order to deal promptly and adequately withthose reporting sick. Inevitably, therefore, the medical organisation varied fromarea to area and was unco-ordinated. One result of this lack of central directionwas that no consideration seems to have been given to including in the procedurea medical examination of each arrested man on discharge from the RegionalHolding Centre as well as on entry to it.336. Girdwood in particular suffered from this lack of attention to medicalplanning. There were two medical officers, neither of whom appeared to know that the other existed until they met by chance. Moreover, owing to the rescind-ing of a Brigade Administrative Order no medical examination took placeeither on admission or discharge from the camp.337. Those transferred to Crumlin Jail were covered by the prison doctor,who examined all detainees on reception, but this did not include those dis-charged from Girdwood back to their homes, and it does not seem to havebeen understood whether or not the prison doctor was available to give medicalattention to arrested persons while in the wing of the Jail used as the annex tothe Holding Centre.338. We accept that it would have been difficult for the two medical officers at Girdwood, even if they had been informed of each other&apos;s existence, to cope with their duties to the soldiers fighting in the streets, to the civilian popula-tion and at the same time to have examined all the arrested persons, but itshould have been possible for the A.D.M.S. (had he known of the exercise in
time) to have made arrangements for other doctors to cover these &quot;in and out&quot;examinations.339. We particularly regret the rescinding of the instruction for the medical examination of each arrested person on arrival at Girdwood. Its omission atGirdwood has had the result for our Enquiry, that as regards allegations fromarrested persons taken to Girdwood, we are without the systematic medicalrecords that we have for complainants who went into Ballykinler and Magilligan.But the importance of the system lay in the need to ascertain for each arrestedperson whether he was fit for the experience of being questioned and held in detention and to ensure that his condition was known on entry, and medicalattention given if needed. The requirement for such a system was as great, ifnot greater, at Girdwood as at the other Regional Holding Centres.340. Generally, therefore, there appears to have been an insufficient aware-ness of the medical hazards involved in this type of operation. nevertheless we record our commendation of the medical officers concerned for the efficientmanner in which they carried out these unexpected duties.Enquiry Staff341. Mr. R. M. Morris of the Home Office was our Administrative Secretaryfor the whole of our Enquiry. Mr. C. G. Leonard of the Treasury SolicitorsDepartment was our Legal Secretary for the first week, when Mr. J. L. Heritageof the same Department succeeded him.342. They have maintained the highest standards of ability, judgment andgood temper throughout the two months of sustained and concentrated work that they have done for us first in setting up our Belfast Office and establishingour communications; then in organising our casework, briefing us and recording the evidence given to us by 143 witnesses over 17 hearing days, as well as the numerous occasions when they have joined us in our deliberations; and not least in assisting us to prepare this Report. We have exploited them, and theyseem to have enjoyed it. We now express our thanks and our admiration forsuch outstanding service.343. We are no less grateful to the supporting secretariat, consisting at various times of two or more of the following: Sylvia BarclayMargaret BarkChristine BarwickIsabel LewisJune Thomas.They have served for long hours and over weekends as a matter of course, andhave known no limit to their capacity for hard work of the highest class. Wethank them warmly, and we are the more grateful for their unfailing cheerfulness.
summary the arrest and detention operation with which we are concerned, relates to342 men arrested on the 9th August and subsequently released (105 men) ordetained (237 men).The operation was in two parts: (a) Arrest and movements to one of three Regional Holding Centres Ballykinler, Magilligan and Girdwood Park.(b) The process of identification and questioning, leading either to releaseor movement into detention at the Maidstone or Crumlin Jail.We have investigated allegations made by 40 of the men arrested on the 9thAugust. Except in one case, the complainants have not appeared before us tosubstantiate their allegations. One has communicated with us in writing; inother cases we have acted on complainants&apos; statements published by the Pressor otherwise transmitted to us.In the course of our investigation we have had full disclosure of contem-porary documentation by the army and police, and we have made particularuse of the medical records for testing allegations of physical ill-treatment.We have visited the three Regional Holding Centres and the two places of detention, the Maidstone and Crumlin Jail. We have taken oral evidence from95 army, 26 police, and 11 prison personnel, and from 11 doctors.We report on 5 groups of allegations and 20 individual allegations.Our investigations have not led us to conclude that any of the grouped or individual complainants suffered physical brutality as we understand the term.As regards the group allegations: -Group 1 Questioning in Depth (11 names)We consider that the following actions constitute physical ill-treatment;posture on the wall, hooding, noise, deprivation of sleep, diet of bread and water.Group 2 Helicopter Incident, Girdwood (6 names)We criticise the action taken to force the complainants to take part in thisdeception operation and consider that the physical experience of these menconstitutes a measure of ill-treatment.Group 3 &quot;Obstacle Course&quot; Girdwood (12 names)We conclude that the men concerned may have suffered some measure ofunintended hardship.Group 4 Late Releases on the 10th August, Girdwood (3 names)Given the conflict of evidence we make no findings, but draw attention tothe evidence that men released from Girdwood were not made to leave andthat some stayed.
Group 5 Special Exercises at Ballykinler (5 names)We consider that these compulsory exercises must have caused some hardshipbut do not think the exercises were thought of and carried out with a view tohurting or degrading the men who had to do them.Individual Cases (20 names)We report 2 cases where we consider there was a measure of ill-treatment:one (Mr. Cummings) suffered from hooding and wrist bonds ordered not as apunishment but as a military precaution, the other (Mr. Gilmore) from damage done by accident. We report one case (Mr. Moore) where we think the com-plainant suffered hardship in that he was accidentally cut by broken glass onarrest arid there was avoidable neglect in getting medical attention for him at Girdwood. In the remaining cases, the conflict of evidence has prevented afinding, or we consider that the complaint cannot be sustained.We draw attention to defects in the administrative arrangements regardingmedical cover for the arrest and holding operation generally, and for GirdwoodPark Holding Centre in particular.3rd November, 1971.Edmund ComptonE.
