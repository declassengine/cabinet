THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S government cp(71) 113 COPY NO       6 315 October 1971CABINETDEFENCE BUDGET - ADDITIONAL EXPENDITUREON EQUIPMENT TO RELIEVE UNEMPLOYMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for defence. Following our discussion last week I have been thinking of ways inwhich I could contribute to the relief of unemployment by placing furtherdefence orders, in addition to the acceleration of the Naval construction programme which has already been agreed.    In the following paragraphs I list a number of possible measures.    All of these are desirable from thedefence point of view but in present circumstances, and bearing in mind the pressure on public expenditure, I would not press the case for them on defence grounds.    I believe that a judgment must be made by the Cabinetessentially on employment grounds.2.        There are three measures which would be particularly useful interms of creating additional employment!a.        Nimrod aircraft production of an additional 8 aircraft would create up to 800 extrajobs in the Cheshire factories of Hawker Siddeley and a further200 jobs at Rolls RoyceTs Scottish factories over the next 18 to24 months.    There would also be work for about 1, 000 men in theelectronics industry.    The extra cost would be about  33 millionspread as follows!1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 and later 2.8m  8.2m  12.0 m  10.0 this  would be a particularly valuable means of strengthening theRoyal Air Force (RAF) long range maritime capability, which wehave repeatedly been pressed by the North Atlantic treaty organisation to do.
b. Buccaneer AircraftIf we ordered immediately the last 16 Buccaneers in the RAFprogramme It would prevent a break in the production line andarrest the temporary redundancies at Hawker SIddeley, Brough(near Hull), which would otherwise occur.    These could amountto 500 by 1973 if the order were delayed by 6 months.    Workwouldalso be created for Rolls Royce&apos;s Scottish factories (up to about300 in 1973) and for electronic equipment manufacturers.    Theeffect on the defence budget would be.1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 and later  +0. 3 m   +0. 7 m   4-1. 0 m  -2.0 mc. Army VehiclesWe could bring forward orders to the value of some  5 million forarmoured and other vehicles.    This is equivalent to some 400 jobsand would have a beneficial effect in the West Midland area where unemployment is at present unusually high for that area.    Theeffect on the defence budget would be:1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 and later  42.5 m   42.5 m -   -5.0 m3.        Another way in which I should like to help our defence industries is with further assistance in research and development.    As a result of the marked decline in defence equipment expenditure in recent years it isalready likely that in certain areas there is not enough work of the rightquality to sustain the design teams which are so important for the future.I believe that with some modest extra expenditure in the next two or threeyears for exploratory development in such areas as advanced enginetechnology, electronics and guided weapons we could secure improvements in industryrs ability to meet our longer term defence requirements and intheir general technological and export potential out of proportion to the sums involved.    However, the effect of these measures in employmentterms, although qualitatively important, would not be large in numbers.In present circumstances therefore I do not propose any addition to thedefence budget for this purpose, although I would like the matter to go on being studied by officials.4. I invite my colleagues to consider whether on employment groundsadditional expenditure should be authorised for the projects listed inparagraph 2 above.c ministry of Defence15 October 19712
