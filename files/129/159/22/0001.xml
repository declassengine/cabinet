HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 122 COPY NO    &apos;1 November 1971CABINETSCHOOL. MILKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. The Home and Social Affairs Committee considered on11 October how we should deal with the one Welsh and five scottish education authorities which are continuing to supply free milk to allprimary school children in the 7-12 age group in defiance of theEducation (Milk) Act 1971.    They decided that:-i.       I should keep in close touch with the Secretary of Statefor Wales;ii.       we should try unofficial persuasion, with the intentionof exempting from penalties all authorities which change their policies to conform with the Act within a reasonable time;  and.       if persuasion failed the matter should be referred again to Ministers.2. Under the Scottish audit provisions, which differ from those for england and Wales, the appointed auditor may report at any time on expenditure which appears to him to be irregular, and the responsibilityfor determining the legality or illegality of the expenditure then rests with the Secretary of State.    Illegal expenditure must be disallowed;and those responsible for it must be surcharged, subject however toprovisos which give me a certain amount of discretion.    A surchargedoes not in Scotland, as in England, disqualify for office as a Councillor -nor can it lead to imprisonment if the person surcharged refusespayment, though it can result in forfeiture of Ms property and attachmentof his earnings.3.        I have received Reports from three auditors.    These were communicated to Midlothian County Council and Dundee Corporation earlyin October, and to Ayr County Council on 26 October.    The Act allowsthem two weeks to submit written comments.    Dundee Corporation will come into line.    Midlothian County Council in spite of unofficialpersuasions have replied that they know that what they are doing is1
illegal, and intend to go on defying the Act:   the Councillors concerned,who were not named in the Report, have been given a further two weeks to comment individually, but there are no signs of any change in theCouncil1 s attitude.    Ayrshire who, like Midlothian, took a stand againstthe Act at an early stage, might follow the same line as Midlothian.4.        As soon as the Midlothian Councillors have replied, and if thereis no change of heart, I should like to tell the Council officially that Ipropose to determine that the expenditure to which the auditor&apos;s Reportrefers was illegal, that certain named Councillors were responsible, andthat they would normally be surcharged;  but that I am prepared toconsider whether the acts in question might be regarded as having takenplace &quot;in such circumstances as to make it fair and equitable that a dis-allowance or surcharge should not be made&quot; if the Council cease tocontravene the law and do not incur further illegal expenditure.    I am advised that if I took this action, and it was challenged in the Court of session by anybody who considered that I should have automatically imposed a surcharge, the challenge might succeed; but I regard the risk of a challenge as minimal and well worth taking.5.        If Midlothian County Council do not cease to contravene the lawsurcharge will have to follow, not only for the small sum ( 165) dealt within the Report, but, on further Reports, for all other expenditure of thesame kind which they may incur.    I see no alternative to this if the law isto be upheld.    If I take the action which I propose I would hope that it wouldchange the minds of the other three authorities who are still defying theAct;  and I should like to write to Midlothian before Ayrshire can commit themselves in writing to a position from which they might find it difficultto retreat.6. I should mention that, when it became clear that some authorities were deciding to ignore the Act I wrote to the Civic Heads of all councils in Scotland which are education authorities pointing out the seriousconstitutional implications of non-compliance by public authorities with an act of Parliament; and the County Councils Association, at a recent meeting which I had with them, emphasised that they regarded complianceas being essential.7. Because the course which I propose would determine to a largeextent the nature of any subsequent action that might be necessary else-where in Great Britain where any other Councillors were persisting inflouting the legislation on school milk, I seek the agreement of the Cabinet.G.C.Scottish office November 19712
