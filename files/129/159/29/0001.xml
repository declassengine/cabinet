SALMON AND FRESHWATER FISHERIES IN SCOTLANDProposals for Action arising from the Hunter ReportINTRODUCTION1.    Scotland is fortunate in the richness of her salmon, sea trout and brown troutfisheries.   The significance of saloon and sea trout to Scotland has long been recognised in legislation, though much less account has been taken of brown troutin legislation and administration.   Brown trout fishings are of variable quality and, even more than salmon, are eapable of substantial development and improvement.An essential preliminary to general improvement, however, is an overhaul of theexisting legislative and administrative structures which date in the main fromthe 1860s.2.    Accordingly, in March 1962 the Government of the day appointed a committee under the chairmanship of the Hon Lord Hunter.   The Committee^ terms of reference were -j:-&quot;To review the law relating to salmon and trout fisheries in Scotland,including the Tweed, and its operation, with special reference to theconstitution, powers and functions of District Boards, and the responsi-bilities of the Secretary of State, and to consider in the light of currentscientific knowledge the extent to which fishing for salmon and trout byany method, whether in inland waters or in the sea, should be regulated, andto recommend such changes in the law as might be thought desirable3.    At the time great concern was being felt in some quarters at the rapid development between 1960 and 1962 of a drift-net fishery for salmon in the seaoff the east coast of Scotland and the Tweed.   The Hunter Committee was therefore asked to consider first the regulation of fishing for salmon and migratory trout,and its First Report (Cmnd 2096), published in July 1963* gave its interim findingson this new fishery.   The Committee*s Second and main Report &quot;Scottish Salmon and
if iUtN IIALTrout Fisheries (Cmnd 2691) was published in August 1965-   The general theme ofthe Report was that there is ample scope for better management of salmon and troutfisheries in order to develop their potential, to improve them in quantity and quality and to ensure that more and better angling facilities are made availableto the general public at reasonable cost.   The Report recommended sweeping ohangesin law and practice and in the system of administration, both locallyand nationally.If.    The main Report was presented (in May 19&amp;5) to the previous administration which, on publication, invited comments from a   considerable number of interestedorganisations.   Observations were submitted both orally and in writing by these and other bodies and there was a debate on the Report in the Scottish GrandCommittee on 18 July 1967.   At the change of Government in June 1970 the previous administration had made no pronouncement of their conclusions on the Report norgiven any indication of the course of action they intended to take.5.     The present Government have considered the Report in the light of the record of the views expressed on it by outside bodies which became available to them onassuming office.   In view of this, and of the long period of uncertainty since theReport was published, the Government have felt it desirable to reach conclusionswithout undertaking a further series of detailed consultations with interested bodies.   The purpose of this White Paper is to announce these conclusions, and tooutline the main features of the action they intend to tas.   Much of the implementation will require fresh legislation and there w: 11 be furtheropportunities for consultation on the Report and the Government&apos;s proposals beforelegislation is introduced.BACKGROUND6.    The annual statistics of catches of salmon and sea trout published by theDepartment of Agriculture and Fisheries for Sootland demonstrate that the stocksof these species are valuable national assets and the fisheries for them of economic2.
and aooial importance.   For the years 1966-70 the annual Scottish dispatch  of salmonand grilse* averaged 483,679 fish (3,771,697 lbs), and in the same period theaverage annual dispatch  of sea trout wa3 215,808 fish (514,399 lbs).   In 1970 theestimated value of these catches was  1,481,000 for aalunn and  151,500 for seatrout.   Salmon and sea trout provide the basis of a long established commercialnetting industry in both rivers and coastal waters: the industry accounts for over80 per cent of the salmon and sea trout catoh and gives direct employment to some,500 men.   Angling for salmon and sea trout, though les ; productive is no less important economically.   Many of Scotland&apos;s rivers are world famous for the quality of the sport they provide; they benefit the economy by attracting visitors,especially during the early spring and autumn, thereby es tending the tourist season.7.    There are no statistics of brown trout oatches and ro organised marketing ofwhat is caught.   However, angling for this most widely dispersed species of freshwater fish provides sport and recreation for thousands of residents and visitorsalike in waters all over Sootland.   It too rtherefore, makss a valuable contributionto the Scottish economy and is one of the basic attraction to visitors to manyof the remoter areas.   Rainbow trout also provide sport ii a number of waters towhich they have been introduced.   Fishing for other freshuater fish - uauallyknown as coarse fish - is practised on a much smaller sea! e than south of the Borderbut latterly has been attracting more interest in some an as.8.    Against this background the Government have no doubt that the theme of theHunter Report should be endorsed: the fisheries are capable of development and steps should be taken both to improve the management of srlmon and trout fisheries and to increase their availability to the general public it reasonable cost.   The*A grilse is a salmon which has spent one winter at sea before returning to freslwater to spawn, and in this paper, except where the context requires otherwise the term salmon will be used to include grilse.
Government do not feel able, however, to adopt all the Committee^ recommendations.The conclusions reached and the changes in the law required to put them into practiceare described in what follows.COMMERCIAL SALMON FISHING9.    Commercial net fisheries are operated all round the coast and in many riversfrom the Tweed on the east coast to the Solway Firth in the southwest.   In thesea outside estuarial limits (defined by statute) with some local exceptions the traditional method of capture is by &quot;fixed engines&quot;, ie nets which are tetheredto the shore.   In rivers above the estuarial limits the traditional, and theonly permitted, method of net fishing is by net and coble (sweep netting).   Inpractice the right to net salmon is usually exercised only in the. lower reaches ofrivers and there are many rivers in which no netting takes place.   As a rule thenet and coble fisheries contribute signifioantly more to the commercial dispatch  thanthe coastal fixed engines though the proportions vary from year to year.10.    The Hunter Committee concluded that the need to secure more positive management of Scottish salmon stocks could be achieved only if salmon were left free to returnto their native rivers and if a means could be devised of regulating the escapementof fish from netting, less haphazard than the weekly close time.   This requiredthat all fishing for salmon in the sea or on the coast outside rivers should be prohibited and that the commercial oatoh should be taken in rivers by means whichallowed the ascending fish to be counted so that the commercial catch could be regulated directly and enough fish allowed to escape for anglers and for spawning.The Committee recommended, therefore that (i) there should be no resumption ofdrift-net fishing for salmon at sea, (ii) coastal netting should be ended, and(iii) within estuaries and rivers commercial catching should be undertaken at asingle point preferably by traps or, where traps were impracticable, by concentratednet fisheries associated with counting devioes.   These commercial fisheries wouldbe operated by consortia of netting interests.   The Committee envisaged that trap4.
ilL.I  operations would be self-supporting, the capital costs being met from savings inrunning costs, mainly in the cost of labour.   The Committee did not regard ascrucial a number of practical objections to trap fisheries put before them butcontemplated that the change over to the new system would be a gradual processspread over perhaps twenty years,during which two experimental schemes should becarried out; one of these would be a commercial scheme essentially to demonstrate feasibility of traps in Scottish conditions, and the other would be a researchscheme to ascertain more clearly the relationship between escepement and smoltproduction and thus to establish more firmly a basis for the optimum regulationof trap fisheries.11,,   The Government accept that there is great merit in the Hunter Committee&apos;8objective of improved management and more efficient exploitation of salmon stocks.Investigations into the technical and financial implications of building traps,however, suggest that the difficulties are rather more formidable than the Committeeoontemplated.   If the traps are so constructed as to withstand and operate in allthe conditions likely to be experienced in Scottish rivers, they will be inordinatelyexpensive, whereas if they are of lighter construction and designed to open inspate conditions, it is not certain that they would be able to catch or even countthe whole run of salmon in the river, which would be one of their main objectives.They would be economically viable only in rivers where enough netting takes place at present to make the savings in operating expenses effected by the trapscommensurate with the oost of servioing the capital cost of the traps.   Many riversin which there is little or no netting would be ruled out on this ground alone.Firm estimates of the oost of effective traps could not be made without detailedengineering surveys of possible sites.   However, on the basis of suoh investigationsas have been possible, it appears that unless new methods of diverting salmon atsubstantially lower cost can be devised, traps oould not be installed with economicj   success exoept possibly in a few of the main salmon rivers.
12.    There are, therefore, formidable problems of finance and practicability in the &apos;compulsory introduction of trap fisheries, and though the experimental schemesproposed by the Hunter Committee might show how some of these could be overcome, itseemy unlikely that trap fisheries oould be viable propositions on a great manyrivers: and even   if    economic operation were possible,it could be achieved only by a substantial reduction in the employment provided.   Moreover, the arrangements -under which the relevant proprietors and tenants of net fisheries would participate in a trap fishery might present some complex problems to achieve an equitable result.13.    Nor does the Committee8a suggestion that concentrated.net fisheries shouldbe established in rivers whore trap fisheries could not be worked offer a practicable alternative in the foreseeable future,   A concentrated net fishery wouldnot promote the objective of good management unless there were means of countingwith reasonable accuracy the salmon which escaped capture in the fishery; at presenthowever, an effective counter involves erecting across the river a fence with an arrow orifice, and if it were to be capable of operation in all conditions, such afence might be almost as expensive as a trap.   Moreover, since not all rivers lendthemselves to sweep netting, a concentrated net fishery would not be an appropriatesubstitute for existing netting methods, eg by fixed engine in the sea.14.    The considerations set out in the preceding paragraphs suggest that trapfisheries could not at present form the basis of a new system of commercial fishingand that at best their introduction would have to be partial and selective.   this in itself would greatly diminish their effectiveness in improving the management of scottish salmon fisheries.   Moreover, the comments made- on the Report showed thatthe organisations directly involved maintained for the most part their practicalobjections to the operation of traps in Scottish conditions*   In these circumstances-the Government do not consider it right to provide for the wholesale introductionof the trap system; nor do they believe that the possible advantages in those riverswhere traps might work justify the compulsory introduction of trap fisheries.6.
Furthermore, in the absence of a counting device capable of giving a reasonablyaccurate count of ascending fish without tho necessity of erecting a fenoe orbarrage, there is no justification at present for the compulsory introductionof concentrated net fisheries.   The Government do    not, therefore, intend to makeeither trap fisheries or concentrated net fisheries compulsory in the foreseeable future, nor to bring to an end compulsorily the traditional method of commercialfishing by fixed engines outside estuarial limits.15.  5he Government consider , however, that the present legal obstacles to theestablishment of trap fisheries or to the introduction of new techniques shouldbe removed to enable developments to take place where this is desired by those concerned.   It is proposed, therefore, to make trap fishing a legal method ofcatching Balmon and to enable it to be introduced on any river where the proprietorsconcerned are all agreed; the introduction of a trap and the arrangements for regulating the catch would be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.Hie present law does not prevent the introduction of concentrated net fisherieswhere all the proprietors concerned agree to such a course.   It would appearimpracticable to concentrate all netting literally at a single point without lossof efficiency because the effectiveness of netting depends on the river conditions at the site and, as these are highly variable, some flexibility in the choice ofsite to suit the conditions would be needed to maintain catches.   The essential feature of a concentrated net fishery would appear rather to be the operationalmerger of the interests exercising their rights of netting than the physicalconcentration of netting operations; and this ,in conjunction with a reliablecounter when one becomes available (could improve the management of salmon fisheries in the way which the Hunter Committee contemplated.   Neither trap fisheries norconcentrated net fisheries would achieve their full contribution to improvedmanagement without the cessation of all other netting in the river conoerned andin the sea off the neighbouring coast; but this could of course be secured as part
of the agreement among the proprietors concerned under which the trap or concen-trated net fishery is established.16.   The inability to introduce over a wide area new methods of fishing which wouldprovide their own direct means of measuring the escapement makes it necessary toconsider whether the present method of control by the weekly close time can fceimproved.   The Government agree   with the Hunter Committee^ view that this is ahaphazard and unscientific way of regulating the escapement from net fisheries.Its effect in practice depends, as the Committee pointed out, on a combination of factors including the weather and behaviour of the fish, and also on the intensity of netting operations which in turn may depend on economic conditions and technicaldevelopments such as the materials used in netting.   The weekly close time fornetting was increased from 36 hours to 42 hours by the Salmon and freshwater fisheries (Protection)(Scotland) Act 1951 in the belief that this was needed toprotect the stocks.   A statutory review carried out in 1558 found little direct evidence bearing on the problem and the arguments for and against a further changeevenly balanced.   The close time has remained at 42 hours since and the HunterCommittee recommended no change.17*  At present, however, the weekly close time can be changed only by legislation.It appears to the Government that a more flexible means of regulating the nettingcatch is highly desirable, especially at a time when the salmon stock is subjectto new stresses, for example UDl^and overseas exploitation.   Equally important istiie fact that new materials such as monofilament netting, c/an greatly increase theefficiency of operation; ^desirable though this may berit/oan in turn greatly increasethe intensity of netting.   The Government therefore propose   to adopt &quot;tiie HunterCommittee&apos;3 recommendation for the licensing of all commercial net fisheries bothcoastal and river.   Licences will be granted only to proprietors of rights atnetting stations which can be shown to have been fished or genuinely let in certainqualifying periods and will include conditions governing such matters as the type,
number, size and material of the nets to he used and the site of operation.   Thislicensing control should improve the regulation of net fishing but it could stillbe necessary to have a more flexible way of altering the weekly close time than isnow available.   The Government therefore propose   to take power by means of statutory Order to alter the weekly close time for nets either generally or for particular rivers.Drift-net fishing for salmon at sea18.  As already mentioned, the Hunter Committee was asked on appointment in March1962 to give priority to the question of regulating salmon fisheries in view ofthe widespread concern caused by the rapid development between i960 and 1962 ofadrift-net fishery for salmon off the coast of Scotland,   Ln September 1962 atemporary ban on this fishery was introduced pending examin vtion of the question.In its first report (July 1963) the Committee concluded that drift-net fishing hadserious disadvantages an a means of catching 3almon, that it introduced an unacceptable risk of overfishing and that an unregulated drift-net fishery could notbe recommended; but after careful examination of a variety of methods of regulatingsuch a fishery the Committee also concluded that no method or combination of methodsof regulation could be recommended as likely to offer a successful means of control.Ms view that a resumption of drift-net fishing could not be recommended was confirmed in the Committee&apos;s second report after it had examined representations made following the publication of the First Report.19*  She temporary ban on drift-net fishing was extended in February 1965 and on three subsequent occasions by the previous Administration, and was last extended inFebruary 1971 in order to keep the position open until decisions could be taken onthe Hunter Report as a whole.   It is now due to expire on 15 February 1973*20.  !Ehe Committee&apos;s final conclusion on the drift-net fishery was reached in the context of the proposition that improved management of salmon stocks depends onallowing the salmon to return to their native rivers before oatching them and
therefore on the prohibition of all salmon fishing in the sea outside esturiallimits.   The Committee indeed recommended that the traditional methods of catchingsalmon in the sea by fixed engines should be run down and eventually replaced bynew methods of fishing in rivers by traps or concentrated net fisheries; but itenvisaged that the introduction of these new methods would be a gradual processextending over perhaps twenty years.   As explained in paragraph 14, the government do not feel that it is practicable in the foreseeable future to introduce bycompulsion the new methods of river fishing proposed by the Committee, but they dointend to introduce licensing to control the operation of fixed engines in thesea.   At the same time, the Government acoept the Committee&apos;s recommendation thatthe ban on drift-net fishing off the coast of Scotland and the Tweed should bemade permanent and steps will be taken to implement this.21.    The Government are conscious that this decision will be disappointing to thoseScottish fishermen who wish to engage in drift-net fishing for salmon, but arereinforced in their decision to ban drift-netting by the following considerations:(a) the drift-net fishery off Sootland grew very qu:.okly between 1960and 1962, when the catch was estimated at 115*000 salmon, because itwas prosecuted almost entirely by boats temporarily switched fromother types of sea fishing.   The fishery would be oapable of furtherrapid expansion unless controlled, particularly when more isdiscovered about the migration routes by which salmon return toour shores;(b) the fishery has been in abeyance sinoe 1962 and Soots fishermenparticipated in it only in 1961 and 1962.   Returns from it did not,therefore, play a major part in their remuneration over a period and, because it was short lived, they did not become dependent onthis source of income.   The Government are not aware of any evidence to show that the introduction of the ban in 1962 oaused hardship,nor do they believe that its continuance would do so.   The sea
fishermen concerned have other fisheries to pursue for which capital,and in some cases other forms of assistance have long been available from public funds.(c) The sustained development of a new drift-net f:.shery for salmon wouldbe at the expense of traditional, shore-based, commercial catching of salmonand/or the stocks.   The commercial salmon fishermen, unlike thesea fishermen, are not equipped to catch other species and do not enjoy any financial support from public funds.(d) Since the ban was imposed in 1962 restrictions on drift-net and certain other types of fishing for salmon have been introduced on both sides ofthe North Atlantic on the recommendation of the responsible InternationalFisheries Commissions.   These developments reflect the concern felt in several salmon producing countries about the potential threat to Atlanticsalmon stocks by unregulated fisheries on the high seas.   In the NorthEast Atlantic the restrictions in force include a close season for salmonfishing outside national fishery limits, closed areas and the prohibitionof certain methods of fishingj and at its meeting in May 1971 &quot;the NorthEast Atlantic Fisheries Commission recommended an additional closed area*around the British Isles for all types of salmon fishing in order to forestall the possible development of a new fishery immediately outsidethe British 12 mile limit.    Continuing the ban on uncontrolled drift-netfishing is in keeping with these developments.(e) It is accepted that no satisfactory means of regulating the drift-netfishery could be devised to allow it to operate to a limited and con-trolled extent.    Though a purely arbitrary limitation on catch or effortcould no doubt be imposed it would not be possible, in conditions offthe Scottish coast, to enforce it at reasonable cost.22.   Understandably enough, Scottish fishermen have found difficulty in appreciatingwhy drift-net fishing for salmon should be permitted off the coast of England andWales yet banned in Scottish waters.   There is good reason for this difference in
practice.   The drift-net fishing off the Scottish coast in I96I and 1962 was a new development which threatened to grow rapidly into a considerable exploitation of stocks over and above the traditional Scottish method of fishing on the coast j ie by&quot;fixed engines&quot; such as bag nets and stake nets.   With a few exceptions &quot;fixedengine&quot; fishing is forbidden in England and Wales where drift-netting is the traditional method of fishing for salmon in the sea, practically all of it takingplace inside territorial waters in exercise of a public right of fishing.   In eachcase, therefore, there is no interference with the normal, traditiona method.Moreover, until recently, the scale of fishing in the waters off England and wales has been   very much smaller than that in the Scottish waters to which the prohibitionapplies.     Though the drift-net fishery off the north-east coast of England hascertainly expanded in recent years, the catch in 1970 (the latest year for which figures are available) was still well below that taken off Scotland in 1962.   In thenorthern part of the ITorthumbrian River Authority the fishery is controlled under asystem whereby only a limited number of licences is issued, and consideration is being given by the Authority to the imposition of a limit on the number of licences to beissued for drift-netting off the southern part of the area.TROUT FISHB1G - PROTECTION AED ACCESS23.   The Hunter Report recognised the increasing importance of angling in Scotland,both as a sport and recreation for local people and as a tourist attraction.Angling is sometimes said to be the largest participator-sport in the country,though there is an almost total lack of national statistics about it.   Troutfishing is particularly popular in Scotland.   It is a pastime enjoyed by many people from all walks of life.   As there is no public right of fishing in scottish rivers there is only a limited number of waters where trout anglersin general can legitimately fish; and there is a great need to make more watersavailable for the Scottish public and for visitors.24. Indeed, there is no public right to fish for either salmon or trout in Scotland,with the exception of trout in tidal waters., The right to fish for salmon (including
saa trout) is a private right which, as a separate heritable estate, can be and oftenis, owned separately from the adjoining land: the right to fish for brown troutbelongs to the riparian owner (though the salmon and sea trout right carries with itthe right to fish for brown trout also, so that in salmon waters the brown troutrights are shared).   Participation in angling, therefore, depends on the willingness of the owner of the fishing rights to allow it.   It is a statutory offence, undersection 1 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries (Protection) (Scotland) Act 1951to fish for or take salmon or sea trout without legal right 6r without writtenpermission from the person having that right.   On the other hand, unauthorised fishingfor brown trout;is not a statutory offence but is merely an infringement of oivilrights.   The only action open to a riparian proprietor against unauthorised troutfishing is the cumbersome and relatively ineffective one of applying to the courts for . interdict against individual anglers.   This is seldomresorted to, and there is a commonly-held, though mistaken, belief in Scotland thatbrown trout angling is open to all.25.    The Hunter Committee saw that there was a need to develop and improve the quality of brown trout fishings, but it also recognised that owners of fishing rights had no incentive to make improvements because they had no means of protecting the fishingsagainst unauthorised angling.   The Committee therefore recommended that &quot;as thenecessary basis for improving quality and quantity, fishing for brown trout withoutthe appropriate permission......should be made a statutory offence&quot;.   A similarrecommendation had been made in 1950 by the Maconochie Committee (Cmnd 7917) but thiswas not implemented in the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries (Protection) (Scotland) Act1951.  The Government consider this to be a necessary basis for improvement oftrout fishing.   The problem is to find some means of according protection to troutwaters which would not result in their being closed off to the angling public andwhich would encourage owners to make more waters generally available at reasonableoost to the angler.26.   The Hunter Committoe1s proposals to overcome this problem included compiling a
register of ownership of all fishings, salmon and trout, over a period enabling *.Scottish Anglers&apos; Trust to register in its name - and consequently to administer - anyfishings not registered by their owners; and empowering the new local administrativebodies, Area Boards, to apply to the Secretary of State for Access Orders to bemade in certain circumstances requiring Specified under-fished waters to be openedcompulsorily to the public under specified conditions.   These provisions, in effect,ttere seen as the price to be paid by the proprietors for the benefits of statutoryprotection.27,   While the Government accept some of the Hunter proposals they have decided upona different approach.   They accept the need for an effective means of protectingfishings if these are to be developed and improved but they do not consider thatthe ingredient of compulsion, which is essential to the Committee^ proposals,together with the complex and demanding machinery of universal registration, a]peals,public inquiries and firders, would be justified.   Not only would the system proposedmake quite unacceptable inroads into the right of individuals to contract freelywith their own property, but it would introduce a prospect of endless dissensionand dispute into what should be the most peaceful of recreations.   Initialregistration of all fishings would itself involve a considerable bureaucraticoperation, and the difficulties of reaching equitable judgments on what constitutesunder-fishing of individual waters - an essential feature of the scheme - wouldbe immense.28.    Instead of introducing a system under which protection carried with it the threat of compulsion for those who did not make their waters available, theGovernment prefer to make statutory protection the reward for co-operation by owners.The Government propose, therefore, to initiate statutory protection for brown troutfishings under arrangements which will confer it only on those fishings to whichthe owner is willing to grant public access on a satisfactory basis and, where necessary, to improve the fishings.   Thus, where an owner already provides, orintroduces, satisfactory arrangements for aooess to his trout waters, for example,by operating a permit system with reasonable charges or by leasing the fishing to anIt    \i ,3 Loo
angling club or to an hotel, with suitable provision for members of the public,the fishing will be accorded statutory protection and it would then be an offence to fish for trout in these waters without permission.    The arrangements in eachcase will be vetted by the local Area Board who will have power to grant protection for a period not exceeding ten years, subject to renewal at the end of that period.The Area Board will periodically review the arrangements and will have power toremove entries from the list protected waters where the approved conditions arenot being observed.   Owners who are prepared in principle to make a substantial partof their waters available will be able to seek reservation of a reasonable proportionfor their own use and to have these protected.   These arrangements will also applyto lochs where all the proprietors agree to provide access.29.   The Government believe that the voluntary system outlined here will go far to ease the pressures on angling waters in Scotland today; it will provide the necessaryincentives to owners to give access to their waters where this is not already done,and it will create the necessary conditions for development and improvement.   Thesystem will be flexible in operation, will be based essentially on local knowledgeof the local facilities and the extent of the demand for them, and will enable owners and angling clubs alike to continue to manage and administer their waters andtherefore, as is important, to retain their interest in them.   As arrangements to the satisfaction of Area Boards are made to open up more waters, the general anglingpublic will have the prospect of access to a wider range of fishings and to betterfishings than at present; thereby the contribution which angling can make to the tourist industry will be developed.LOCAL ADMIHSTRATI01T30. In Chapter V of its Report the Hunter Committee outlined the present system oflocal administration of freshwater fisheries in Scotland.   As the Committee pointed
out, the machinery was laid down in Acts which are now more than one hundred years old, namely the Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Acts of 1862 and 1868.   Administrationia by District Salmon Fishery Boards, the members of which are proprietors of salmonfishings (who provide the sole revenue of the Boards).   Boards exist for fewer than half of the Salmon Fishery Districts in Sootland; they have very limited powers inrelation to salmon fishing and no real powers or functions in relation to brown troutand trout fisheries.   The Committee reached the conclusion that, though some Boards peformed, creditably, and the system as a whole might have been the best one for thelast eentury, it had substantial shortcomings at the present time and radical changes were required in order to afford a suitable means of attaining the objectives theywere proposing.   The Committee considered whether the best form of looal freshwaterfishery administration might not be a system of multi-purpose local boards dischargingseveral functions relating to raverB and lochs.   The Committee recorded, however, thatall fishery interests^and also the Association of County Councils in Scotland were strongly opposed to such a concept, and they recommended against suoh a system but pointed out that multi-purpose boards might eventually bee )me desirable.32.   More recently, the Government have accepted in princi )le proposals of the RoyalCommission on Looal G-overnment in Scotland for allocating other aspects of riveradministration, such a3 water supply, sewerage, river purification and floodprevention, to regional authorities in a reorganised structure mre of local government.The effect of these proposals would be to make these autho dties multi-purposeauthorities in relation to rivers and thus to oreate a dif &quot;different situation from theone considered by the Hunter Committee.   The Government have reconsidered the matter in the light of the altered ciroumstances but are of the opinion that a separateadministration is justified for the specialised fisheries functions.   They acceptthe Hunter Committee^ view   that radical changes are required in the present localadministrative structure and agree in broad principle with the recommendation thatDistrict Salmon Fishery Boards should be replaced by Area Boards whioh would (i) have much wider powers than are available to Distriot Boards; (ii) be fewer in number andcover wider areas than the present Boards; (iii) be responsible for both salmon andtrout and also coarse fisheries; and (iv) be constituted on a wider basis.33.    In the Government&apos;s view the areas proposed by the Hunter Committee for the
Area Boards and set out in Appendix B to the Report are broadly acceptable, but they(a) The East of Scotland area (Area k) from the South Esk to the Ugie inclusiveappears to be too large.   It is accordingly proposed to divide this areainto two parts, these being North and.South Esk and Bervie on the one handand Dee, Don, Ythan and Ugie on the other.(b) It would not be wholly satisfactory to divide administration of the Clydebetween two Area Boards, and it is proposed therefore that the Clyde should form a single unit with an Area Board of its own.(c) As a result, the Ayshire Area (Area 11) will consist of the rivers Irvine,Ij Ayr, Doon, Girvan and Stinchar.(d) The Argyllshire Area (Area 10) other than the Lower Clyde will be mergedwith the Inverness-shire Area (Area 6)*  It is recognised that this board will  cover an extensive geographical area but the individual rivers arenot of such significance as some elsewhere.\ The number of Area Boards resulting will be 14$, one more than the number proposed inI the Report.   The re-defined areas are shown in the Appendix.^ 34. In particular, the Area Boards will have functions relating to brown trout fisheriet; and as appropriate, to coarse fishing.   They will represent the fishery interest generallybI nill have management funotions and a considerable number of regulatory powers to complement the powers of the Secretary of State, will control methods of fishing, willlevy fishery rates and issue rod and net licences.   (It is not, however, proposed toI alter the system of valuing fisheries for the fishery rates;   if this function weregiven to Area Boards, as proposed in the Report, there would be unnecessary and undesirable duplication of effort with the work of local assessors.)      the boards will have power to employ staff, including technical officers, wardens(bailiffa) and office staff, and their income will be drawn from fishery rates, from the sale of rod and net licences and, initially, from Exchequer grant.   As successorsto the District Boards, they will assume their responsibilities and will be expeotedto take over the employment of their existing staff.1 35. In addition, the Area Boards will have the important function of dealing with17.propose to make the adjustments listed below.
requests from owners of fishing rights for registration on the list of trout waters to which statutory protection applies.   This will involve thea in assessing the localdemand for angling facilities and jn deciding whether arrangements applying to individual waters are reasonable, having regard to the numbers of anglers permittedand the prices charged.   This function, like others, will call for considerable local knowledges,   As to membership, the Government accept the Committee8s view that Area; Boards should not be confined to owners of salmon fishing rights.   Provision willba made for representation of trout interests and for some independent members, the! constitution of each Board depending on the nature of the fisheries in its area.At this stage, however, the Government do not propose to lay down any rigid pattern,j purther consideration will be given to the composition for each area.36,  The Government consider that the objective should be to make the Area Boardsself-supporting.   Since a major part of the income of the Boards will come fromlicences, the amount and build-up of which cannot be forecast with any certainty,Exchequer grants  will   be made available to the Boards to help them to beoome estab-lishsd.   It is proposed that the total amount cf the grants should be  100,000 in each!  of the first two years of their existence and  75*000 in the third year.SCOTTISH ANGLERS&apos; TRUST37*  The Hunter Committee recommended the formation of a national organisation ofIanglers, which the Committee called the &quot;Scottish Anglers&apos; Trust&quot;.   It was seen as aco-operative of anglers, whose functions would be to administer angling facilities toimprove and adl to thea, and generally to deveop the sport of angling in Soot land.I 38.  The Government oonsider that the concept of a national )rganisation of anglersowning or leasing waters on a wide scale throughout the eouuSry and developing and opening them up to its members has much to commend it.   It is proposed, therefore, toencourage an anglers&apos; body and that it should be formed, developed and run byanglers themselves with a minimum of Government intervention.  As envisaged by the1 Hunter Committee, its main function would be to acquire and make available waters in(41 parts of the country on a wider scale than could be achieved by individual anglingbodies:   it might add to this function in time by operating as the recognised governing
body in Scotland for the sport of angling.    This, however, would he a matter foranglers themselves to decide; it would he easier to achiove this situation if the new body developed out of the various angling organisations whose interests are morethan local.38.   Such a body could obtain fishings for its members in several ways.   First, localangling clubs might wish to affiliate to it and make their waters available to members of the Trust; proprietors might also be ready to hand over the administration and management of their waters to the Trust in order to be relieved of these responsibilities and yet obtain the benefits of protection and orderly fishing of the waters; and, once firmly established, the Trust would no doubt wish to purchase or lease waters on its own account.   Acquisition would, of course, be entirely byagreement.39.   The Government envisage that the subscription for membership of the ScottishAnglers&apos; Trust would be modest, possibly of the order of  1 per year initially.   Thiswould enable tourists as well as home anglers to become members and to enjoy access to Trust waters. Clearly the Trust ought to be self-sup sorting, but as there is no way of knowing at what rate it would build up its member hip - this would depend tosome extent on its early success in securing waters for its- members - some assistancefrom public funds would be likely to be necessary to start it off on a sound basis.The Government would, therefore, be prepared to make grants to the Trust of up to 50,000 in the first full year of its existence and of up to  25,000 in each of thesecond and third years.40.   The Government consider that many aspects of the detailed constitution of a body like the Trust are matters to be settled by anglers and they hope to keeplegislative provision relating to the Trust to a minimum so that the nature and composition of the body would remain flexible and responsive to the wishes of anglers.PISHIMG LICENCES41*   As the Hunter Committee remarked, &quot;Nearly all countries with rod fisheries ofany importance require all anglers to hold a licence .... Scotland is unusual in having no rod licences&quot;.   The Committee recommended the introduction a? a licensingm I ... 111*1 &apos; -:
system through which anglers themselves would provide the revenue needed for the workof developing and improving the fisheries.    Though the recommendation produced manycomments and representations, these were directed mainly to the details rather thanthe principle of a licensing system.   An innovation of this nature can scarcely he expected to he popular, hut no great exception has been taken to the proposal andit appears to he generally recognised that under modern conditions a payment to engage in a sport like angling is reasonable.J&amp;   The Government propose, therefore, to introduce a system of rod licences.   as recommended by the Hunter Committee, the fees paid for licences will be utilised bythe Area Boards and the Scottish Anglers&apos; Trust for the administration and improvesasSof the fishing facilities.   Payment for a rod licence would not in itself conferpermission to fish any particular water: as at present, this would be a matter betweenthe angler and the owner of the fishing rights.^3,   There will be further consultation with the interests concerned before the structure of licences and the fees are determined.   The Government are anxious thatthe licence fees should be kept as reasonable as possible, consistent with providing an adequate income to the new fishery bodies, and that the system should be assimple as possible.   The fee for a trout licence will, cf course, be less than the fee for a salmon licence and the Government have in mind that persons under theage of 16 should be able to obtain licences free of charge.   A major problem in establishing a new system of rod licences is that virtually no information is available about the numbers of anglers generally, the numbers of home Scots andvisitors separately, the numbers who fish for the different categories of fish orthe pattern of their fishing activity - ie the extent to which they fish only in their local areas or travel more widely.    Because of this, it is impossible to predictwith any certainty how many licences, and in which categories and which areas,,are likely to be bought.    In turn, this makes it extremely difficult to assess theincome likely to accrue to Area Boards and the Trust from rod licences.   provision will, therofore, be required to vary the fees and perhaps also the categories of licences in the light of experience.20.
4J,   The Hunter Committee recommended that Area Boards should he allowed to retainall the revenue from the area licences they issue and should remit to a central poolto be administered by the Secretary of State all but a small percentage of the revenue from the sale of national licences.    The central pool was to be used for (a) grants to the Area Boards which did not obtain sufficient revenue from direct sales of area licences to meet essential expenditure, and (b) grants to the Anglers&apos; Trust,ftie Government accept the concept of a central pool and will decide upon thedistribution of the revenue from rod licence fees when the structure of licences and the fees have been determined.45.   As indicated in paragraph 16 of the licensing system will also apply to nettingand other devices for catching fish.   The Government will determine the fees for thewhole range of netting devices after further consultation with the interests concerned,CONCLUSION461.   The proposals outlined in this paper are, in the main based on the recommenda-tions made by the Hunter Committee.   Though it has not been possible to accept someof the recommendations and though others have been modified or varied in the lightof detailed investigation and consultation, the Government regard the Reports ofthe Committee as a helpful and wide-ranging survey of a complex and highly technicalsubject.47*   In the Government&apos;s view, the action now proposed, arising from therecommendat: ons, forms an integrated scheme which will open the way to general improvement of the fisheries and of freshwater fishery administration.   Proprietorsof fishings will benefit from the introduction of statutory protection for browntrout fishings; it is only right that to qualify for this benefit they should give up some of their exclusive rights and accept an obligation to make the fisheriesmore widely available.   Most of all, anglers generally will benefit from theopening up of waters and from the improved administration and management which willbe made possible, largely by the contributions which the anglers themselves willmake through rod licence fees, and by other payments.   Local bodies and localknowledge will play their part in the more up-to-date and more flexible system of
local administration of the fisheries; and anglers will have the opportunity forming a new national body, the Scottish Anglers&apos; Trust, which, without detractingin any way from the functions of existing angling clubs and organisations, would represent anglers and would be able to acquire and hold angling waters in theirname throughout Scotland.DAPS
