DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majestys government cp(71) 108 COPY NO         0O si7 October 1971CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE review memorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS)1. As the Cabinet envisaged at their meeting on 22 July (CM(7l) 40thConclusions, Minute 6), the CPRS has been associated with the furtherinterdepartmental review of public expenditure, following which the chief secretary, Treasury, has made proposals to the Cabinet (CP(7l) 103),2. One of the Governments major objectives is to reduce taxation.Ministers ought not to endanger this objective by agreeing to totals ofpublic expenditure in excess of what the economy will bear.    Given theneed to make some provision for contingencies, especially on entry intothe European Economic Community and for steel investment, it wouldseem unwise for Ministers to agree at this stage to any total public expenditure figures higher than those recommended by the Chief Secretary(Table 6, line 5, CP(71) 103).    Even these involve some risks,    while these are probably justified at this juncture, it should be emphasised thatfor the Survey period as a whole expenditure is already runninguncomfortably near the acceptable ceiling and the forces at work are more likely to lead to pressure for further increases than to reductions.3.        Given the uncertainties, the bid for additional resources fromthe Secretary of State for Defence as put forward in his own paper is too large to be accommodated without corresponding reductions in other programmes.    If they wish to make provision for defence, ministers have three possible courses of action.-i. To trim all or nearly all public expenditure programmes to provide the resources necessary to give defence a higher prioritythan Ministers envisaged when reaching their interim conclusions in June.ii. To re-examine the priorities which Ministers attached in the summer and previously to health, personal social services and education, and shift priorities in the direction of defence.
iii.     To leave untouched the priorites so far attached to health,personal social services and education and find the extra resources for defence from other programmes than these.4. The third course would be very difficult; relatively few of the programmes involved are large spenders and the shift in priorites from them to defence would imply a major change in strategy.    The choicetherefore appears to lie between the first and second courses.5. The choice should be explicitly recognised as one of prioritiesbetween major programmes; and in this context one must not only take account of the CPRS&apos;s analysis of Government priorities in the Review ofGovernment Strategy (CP(7l) 99), but also of the view, expressed inparagraph 22c. iii. of that paper, that financial, manpower and internationalproblems are likely to call for a reappraisal of defence policy and commitments within a few years at most.    If Ivlinisters accept this analysis, it would not be prudent in the interim to add to the defence budget except in so far as this was wholly justified in the short termon regional employment grounds.6. The CPRS therefore recommends that the Cabinet should endorse the Chief Secretaryfc recommendations in CP(7l) 103,Cabinet office October 1971
