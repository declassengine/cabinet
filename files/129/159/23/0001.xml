HE DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government cp(71) 1231 November 1971CABINETSCHOOL MILKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for wales. Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council is the only localauthority in Vfales continuing to supply free milk in defiance of theEducation (Milk) Act 1971,    With the agreement of the Home and social affairs Committee my Office has made informal efforts to persuade theauthority to abandon its illegal action.    These efforts have not succeededjand I do not believe that a more official approach in the form of a letterfrom me would have any more success.    The probable illegalexpenditure at Merthyr is continuing at a rate of about  1,000a month.2. It is desirable that the actions taken by myself and theSecretary of State for Scotland should be broadly in parallel sofar as differing law and practices allow.    In the case of Merthyr,persuasion having failed, the right parallel move would be for meto issue to the District Auditor, at much the same time as the Secretaryof State for Scotland writes to Midlothian County Council, a Direction tohold an Extraordinary Audit.    This is necessary to enable the auditor toexamine the accounts of the Council in advance of the normal audit heldafter the end of the financial year.    The extraordinary audit wouldprobably begin before the middle of November.    The normal sequence of events then would be that, if the auditor found prima facie that all or part of the expenditure is contrary to law, he would notify the Councilaccordingly and afford them an opportunity of being heard before arriving at a decision; that he would be bound by his statutory duties to disallow theexpenditure found by him. to be contrary to law and to surcharge the persons responsible for incurring or authorising it; and that, subject to rights ofappeal to the High Court, the surcharge would disqualify the persons concerned from serving as members of any local authority for five years.3,        There is still a possibility that Merthyr might change its mind inthe course of the audit, and abandon its defiance; and it would be open tothe auditor to suspend action if mis happened before he made a surcharge.The Council could then apply to me for sanction under the proviso to section 228(1) of the Local Government Act 1933 of the expenditure incurred1COPY NO   n 006
up to the point of its ceasing to defy the law. In that way I could bring thematter to a conclusion without surcharge and disqualification; and I would still hope that this course will prevail.4. If Merthyr persists in defiance, the end result, subject to therights of appeal to the High Court which might delay it for some months,would be the disqualification of most members of the authority.    Therump, consisting of the few Independent members of the Council who voted against the crucial resolution and some others who were absent at the time,would be less than the normal quorum of a third required for the trans -action of council business.    Under the Local Government Act 1933 however(Third Schedule, Part V, paragraph 6), where more than one third of themembers have been disqualified at the same time the quorum is determined by reference to the number of member8 remaining qualified,so that in law the rump could carry on the business of local governmentin Merthyr until the reconstitution of a full Council by by-elections.    Butthis would clearly be a situation of great difficulty made the more awkwardby occurring in a part of South Wales where emotions are intensified bythe present high level of unemployment.    However, given the apparentdetermination of the authority to persist in illegal action, I can see no alternative to what I propose.5.        Accordingly I seek the agreement of my colleagues, as the nextstep, to my giving a Direction to the District Auditor to hold an extraordinary Audit.P TWelsh office November 19712
