THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 107 COPY NO y 07 October 1971CABINETDEFENCE BUDGET TARGETSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for defence i am seriously concerned about the Chief Secretaryls recommendation in CP(71) 103 of 27 September that defence bids amounting to  130 million over the period 1972/73 - 1975/76 (Table 1, line 6, of the Annex to cp(71) 103) should be rejected.1972/73-1974/7520     In Cmnd 4521 we set out our defence objectives and agreed defence budget targets for 1971/72-1974/75 -   It is proving increasingly difficult to reconcile the latter with the former.   The programme hashad to be cha,nged to meet urgent operational requirements o   The Navyfaces special problems in forecasting full costs, including support,of new classes of ships.   Finally, the manpower position has turned out better than we could have expected.3.     I have dealt with the first 2 factors by pruning the long-termcostings for the target years to the extent of more than  300 million.These savings have had to be made in the only part of the defence budget that offers any room for manoeuvre in the short-term - thenew equipment and works programmes - and their effect will be to damageseriously the capabilities and operational effectiveness of the forces.4o     As regards manpower, I entered a reservation with the Chancellorlast October that our recruiting efforts might prove the manpowerforecasts implied in our targets wrong.   In fact, the costings for1972/73-1974/75 were  25 million higher for this reason.   Our laterPAR manpower study has shown that, although deficiencies in strengthare still certain, the manpower position may in the event turn outbetter still:   an extra  25 million would then be too little.1
5o      In the circumstances I must press strongly for this  25 million.I &quot;believe that this can &quot;be justified because -a. it would reflect a success where we badly need it;b. it would be marginal in relation to other movements in thepublic expenditure programme;c. I should otherwise have to increase the cuts in the equipment programme since - taking account, in particular, of the manpowerstrains imposed by Northern Ireland - we could not possibly turnaway willing recruits, especially in a period of high unemployment;do     such additional cuts would involve military and industrialpenalties more severe than the sums involved might suggest:    theycould mean the cancellation or deferment of up to 3 more warships and possibly less design work for the guided weapons industry.1975/766.     The Chancellor&apos;s target for 1975/76 was put forward before the costings were completed; it takes no account of the consequences ofcarrying out a more effective defence policy tha,n that of the previous administration.   If it were accepted, the equipment programme, and thecapabilities of the Services, would have to be cut again.   VJe should thus fail to fulfil our declared objective of making good the damageof successive defence reviews.   The Chancellor&apos;s proposal would mean areduction in the proportion of GNP for defence which would be difficultto justify.7.     My figure is  2,670 million, which - though  105 million abovethe Chancellor&apos;s - is  26 million below the programme in 1975/76 as wecosted it.   We must secure room for manoeuvre in that year after thesmall increases in expenditure permitted in the previous years.   the severe pruning I have applied to the latter will affect 1975/76, but against this we must set the cost of repairing the damage in the equipmentfield, and paying for the additional manpower which we must recruitif manning shortfalls are to be kept to manageable proportions.2
Industrial Implications80     Our rate of re-equipment is already slow in relation to themilitary threat.   Vie must also recognise the implications of all this for Industry.   In a number of key areas it is now problematicalwhether there is sufficient work of the right kind to sustain a healthy industrial base.   Without such a base our efforts to improvedefence procurement are bound to fail; and, since the defence relatedindustries generally are technologically advanced and have a highexport potential, they are of great significance for future economic development.   These factors reinforce the case for the acceptance ofmy proposals.RecommendationI, therefore, ask that the recommendation in paragraph 9(3) of cp(71) 103 should not be accepted.c ministry of Defence7 October 19713
