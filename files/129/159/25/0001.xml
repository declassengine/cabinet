THIS DOCUMENT is THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEHKMEKTCP(71) 125 copy&quot; no      622 November 1971CABINETschool MILKMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Education and science .     To my knowledge no local education authority in England is acting in defiance of the Education (Milk) Act, although according to Press reportsthere has been pressure on a number of them to do so.     Durham CountyCouncil, South Shields, Teesside and Wolverhampton County Boroughs, andHaringey and Hounslow outer London boroughs are in this category.2.     A growing number of non-education authorities are taking steps toprovide free milk for children age 7-11 under their &quot;free penny rate&quot; power(section 6 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1963).     Tenof the twelve inner London boroughs (Westminster and Kensington/Chelseabeing the only exceptions) are doing this with the ready co-operation of the inner London Education Authority (ILEA).     The outer London boroughs have asked the Greater London Council (GLC) to provide milk on a similar basisto 7-11s iQ outer London schools.     Outside London a dozen boroughs orurban districts are known to be providing or contemplating the provisionof free milk on this basis.3.     Manchester local education authority (LEA) have begun a pilot schemeto provide mid-rnorning beverages other than milk to 7-11s, free to thosewho get free school meals and at a subsidised price of 1p to others.     Ifthe scheme is adopted in all Manchester primary schools, it will cost theCouncil as much money as would the free school milk scheme had it continued.The Manchester development is being closely watched by Sheffield, who intend to adopt it if it is &quot;successful&quot;.     Hartlepool County Borough is also 
under pressure to adopt a scheme of this nature.     It might well attract theattention of other LEAs, particularly county boroughs who are unable to look to related non-education authorities to spend their &quot;free penny&quot; to providemilk.4.    Our advice is that the developments at paragraphs 2 and 3 a-bove are within the law as it stands at present.     On the first, we are to consider appropriate measures in the Local Government Bill to limit the applicationof an authority&apos;s general power to spend up to the product of a given rateso as to forestall its use in future as a means of acting outside thespirit of the law.     On the second, it would technically be open to me toamend the relevant regulations to require local education authorities to charge an economic price for the beverages, but this requirement would haveto apply to all authorities, and it would therefore restrict the freedom ofthose who are not challenging the Government&apos;s policy.     It would further-more remove a discretion which is normally exercised by authorities for a variety of useful purposes.5.    Before considering any action in relation to authorities in England,I believe it would be wise to await the results of dealing \-tiih those inScotland and Wales who are acting in defiance of the law.     Firm and speedyaction in their case might not only deter those who might be contemplatingsimilar defiance, but also exercise a restraining influence on othersseeking ways of circumventing the law.M t department of Education and Science2 November 19712
