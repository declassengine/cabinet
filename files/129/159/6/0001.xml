DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 106 COPY no. 5 October 1971CABINETC 90 t)PUBLIC PRESENTATION OF GOVERNMENT POLICIESNote by the Prime minister have been taking stock of our performance in presentingGovernment policies over the past fifteen months and have reached thefollowing conclusions.2.     First, the European Economic Community (e.c.) campaign has succeeded in producing a substantial shift in public opinion.    although this campaign has special characteristics and we cannot apply all themachinery and techniques employed in it to other presentational problems,the idea of a periodical &quot;message&quot; or &quot;theme&quot; as a basis for public speecheand the system of answering immediately points made by the opponents ofGovernment policy could be useful in other fields.3.     On some other subjects we have just about held our own inpresentational terms; oa others we have lost out.    This is not goodenough and more thought, preferably at a higher level in Departments,must be given to the presentation of policies.4.     We have not done well over prices, unemployment and Scotland.Until price rises taper off and cease to be news, we will have to put up with criticism on this score.    Out attitude to ailing industry, especiallyin Scotland, has been interpreted as hard-hearted rather than hard-headed.5.     Finally, the public still seem to be uncertain as to which directionthis country is taking.    In particular those who are looking to us for a programme of radical reform seem to require more frequent reassurancethat they are indeed going to get this.6.     If we are to obtain the long term benefits which we are looking forin the field of communication with the public, there is no alternative to continuing our policy of giving the fullest information about our policies and decisions at times of our choosing.    Nonetheless, in the light of theconclusions I have set out, I invite   my colleagues to consider thefollowing remedies:1
a. The presentation of Government decisions should be more positive.    To achieve this the way in which a decision is to be .presented should be considered at the same time as the decisionitself.    Ministers should include in any Cabinet Paper seekingagreement to a particular policy, a paragraph setting out preciselyhow they propose that this policy should be presented publicly.It should be the rule that the Permanent Secretary should exercise the same role in regard to the presentation of important decisions as he does over other aspects of policy.    In particular, care shouldbe taken to avoid weakening the public impact of new decisions bypremature leaks.    Where leaks are inevitable, e.g. if outside bodies have to be consulted before a decision is taken, a statement should be made about the Government&apos;s intentions as soon asconsultation begins.    Otherwise the Government will lose theinitiative.b. Particular decisions should be presented in relation to theGovernment1 s overall strategy, and the paragraph in cabinet papers on presentation should take account of this.    The longterm aims of our policies and the means by which we propose to achieve these should be constantly reiterated.c. More emphasis should be placed on that part of our strategywhich aims to improve not only the standard of living but thequality of life for everyone in this country.    The High Street isimportant; but we should not neglect the high road.d. Ministers should continue to be selective in their radio and TVappearances; we should choose carefully both the programmes inwhich we take part and the subjects on which we are questioned.We should not let interviewers get away with ignorant, irrespons-ible and irrelevant questions; viewers and listeners notice it if wedo and think less of us.    We should have two or three points inmind and ensure that we get these across in any interview.e. The Lord President should circulate from time to time simplemessages or themes which Ministers might include in theirspeeches.    These would replace or supplement the speaking notesnow being circulated weekly.E.H.10 Downing Street5 October 19712
