THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS government cp(71) 101 COPY NO      g I14 September 1971CABINETFINANCIAL POLICY FOR PORTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. The Economic Policy Committee earlier considered, and endorsed,the recommendations made by the Minister for Transport Industries,with my support, on the subject of a financial policy for ports; and agreedthat a draft White Paper should be prepared for consideration by Cabinet.This draft White Paper is attached.2.        The policy set out in the draft White Paper deals with a problem which needs early action.    Ports which are essential to the country*sneeds, though basically viable and with every prospect of paying their way,are finding it hard, if not impossible to renew short-term borrowing, still less to replace it as they should, with longer-term finance.    This is partly a reflection of the marketrs loss of confidence following the Merseycrisis, and partly because of weaknesses in the constitution, management and financial control of the independent trust ports.    We have already started to tackle these weaknesses by launching a programme of action under which the reconstituted National Ports Council will work with the ports to strengthen management and finances.    In the longer-term theintroduction of an equity element should provide a further spur to efficiency,but this cannot be brought about until earnings reach an adequate level.3.        It Is proposed that, subject to a report from the National PortsCouncil on the porfs viability and the measures needed to improve its financial performance, the Government should make loans at a high andsteadily increasing rate of interest for the renewal of debt falling due.An appropriate rate of interest should discourage port authorities fromtoo ready a resort to the Government.    Stricter financial disciplines and improved earnings should encourage the market to resume long-term lendingto ports as confidence improves and subsequently facilitate the replacement of debt by private equity capital.4.        The original proposals put to the Economic Policy Committeeenvisaged that the loans would throughout their lives bear a rate of interestof 2 or 3 percentage points above the going long-term rate.    This proposal has now been modified (as set out in paragraph 11(b) of the draft White Paper)1
so that the initial rate will be some 2 percentage points over the Governmentlending rate but would be increased progressively over the life of the loan(probably by about i a percentage point every two years).    This lowerinitial rate would reduce the likelihood of causing short-term cash problems for the ports concerned or the danger of adverse market reactions for portsgenerally.    The successive increases should bring about a growingincentive for the port authorities to go to the market in pace withincreases in their earnings.5. I would also draw attention to paragraph 2 of the draft which dealswith labour relations and the Dock Labour Scheme.    While I appreciatewhat a thorny subject this is I did not feel it right to put to my colleaguesa draft White Paper which contained no reference to this problem, whichovershadows all others.P w department of the Environment SW114 September 19712
DRAFT WHITS PAPERFINANCIAL POLICY FOR PORTS1 .      For many years the ports of Great Britain have been regardedas a service to be made available without adequate regard to costs,profitability or long-term financial health.    It is surprising thatthe consequent weaknesses were not revealed more clearly long ago.There are already encouraging signs, however, that port authoritiesare taking the opportunity of greater freedom to tackle these problems and are beginning to achieve significantly better results..But there is still much to be done to strengthen management andfinances./2,    Ports have suffered from difficult, and often bad, labour relations.    The casual labour system, and with it the real causes ofbitterness, has now gone and there is stable, indeed permanent,employment for the dock workers.    But old-fashioned attitudes of&quot;we and they&quot; linger on.    The Dock Labour Scheme still survivesdespite the passing of the casual system.    It can be argued thattoday the scheme does^more to inhibit than it does to foster sensibleindustrial relations^/3.      Considerable progress has, however, been ms.de in other directions within the past ten years.    In 1962 the Rochdale Report(1 ) stressed the urgent need for change in almost every sphere of port activity.    The Devlin Reporo (2) paved the way in 1965 forending casual employment and making substantial reductions in thenumbers of port employers.    The Harbours Act, 196lj. established theNational Ports Council and provided the means for achieving orencouraging progress in a number of fields.    Large and costlydevelopments have been carried out; the ports have been substan-tially modernised and equipped with facilities which compare favourably with those in other countries.    Far-reaching improvements have been made in operating methods and in working conditions.Comparisons are often made x^ith practices in other countries,particularly on the Continent of Europe, where certain ports receivesubsidies from central or local government.    This countryfs needs and geogra.phi.cal circumstances are different and the government does not believe that the problems here will be solved by eithersubsidies or the worn-out specific of nationalisation.    TheGovernment expects the ports to put themselves in a position wherethey can provide the services essential to the country&apos;s economic prosperity efficiently,  economically and profitably.    They areexpected, like other businesses, to be self-supporting and competitive.5.     The National Ports Council has a major part to play in the strengthening of management and finances.    As was announced inParliament on 25 May, to enable the Council properly to fulfilthis role, it has itself been reconstituted so as to be whollydissociated from individual ports; it has been invited to formulate,  in collaboration with the ports, a programme of action.This programme has as its principal aim the establishment ofrealistic financial policies and objectives; which must include
a vigorous attack on costs, the development of charging policies,the rationalisation of facilities and. the realisation of assetsno longer required.  (3)6.     The recent crisis on the Mersey has shown that theconstitution of independent trust ports can give rise to weak-nesses in organisation and management.   Not only do their capital structures lack the flexibility of equity financing,but their boards do not represent the providers of capital, who -might be expected to insist on a sound commercial and financialapproach.   Their capital debt consists of fixed interestborrowing which has to be renewed at particular points in time.Substantial short-term borrowing has exposed some ports to theproblem of having to refinance debt in unfavourable market conditions and is in any case inconsistent with the capitalstructure of undertakings whose businesses are based on the useof long-term assets.    The prospect of nationalisation had beena factor in this reliance on short-term borrowing, and hadhelped to restrict earnings, by creating a climate in which someport authorities neither did nor could look far enough ahead.7*     As a long-term objective the Government believes that theintroduction of private equity capital would provide incentives to the development of competitive and commercial attitudes fromwhich everyone would benefit,  and would promote the aim of efficient service and reliability which must be at the heart ofany ports policy.    Indeed, two of the country5s most successfulports, Manchester end Pelixstowe, benefit from equity participa.participator.IThe possibility of equity investment in other port undertakingsis, however, critically dependent on the confidence generated bysustained improvements in financial performance.    This will take time.8.     Meanwhile there is a need for effective transitional arrangements to assist those ports, particularly the independenttrust ports, which, though clearly viable, encounter difficulties over the renewal of their debt.    The Government does not intend to allow refinancing problems to impede a porfs progress towards   Ibetter financial performance.   There is no reason why viableports should not continue to refinance debt as they traditionallyhave done - on the market: but if a basically viable port is unable to do so, loans will be made available by the Governmentfor this purpose.    (It should be understood,, however, that nothing in these proposals implies that the Government isassuming responsibility for, or guaranteeing,  any existing orfuture debt of the ports).9.     Such loans will, hox^ever, be made only to those port authorities who satisfy the National Ports Council that their financial prospects are sound.    Before recommending a loan, theCouncil will carry out a stringent analysis of the position and prospects of the port concerned.    The port authority must also beprepared to comply with conditions the Council consider to benecessary, including the carrying out of agreed financial and management measures.    Once agreement has been reached on suchmes.sures the authority will be required to co-operate with theCouncil in the monitoring of performance.  (I4.)
10,    The terms of such, loans will be designed fco encourage port authorities to continue to borrow on the market where they can (or where they do borrow from the Government to seek alternative sources of finance as soon as possible).    They should also resultin strict financial disciplines which, together with improvedearnings, will encourage the market to resume lending to ports onan appropriate long-term basis.11 .    To this end(a) the loans will normally be long-term ones, for 10 years or more (the periods being subject in all cases to therecommendations of the Council).    The Government will,however, be entitled to repayment on demand should the- portauthority fail to meet the relevant conditions;  and theauthority will be entitled to repay loans at any time either from normal market borrowing or from their own accruinginternal resourcesj(b) the initial rate of interest will be a high one, in the region of 2 percentage points over the Government lendingrate and will be increased progressively over the life ofthe loan.12.     Apart from the direct incentives to improve financial resultsand consequent effects on market confidence, and high andprogressively increasing rate of interest applicable to these loans would encourage the earning of adequate profits to produce asatisfactory return to the investor if they were, in dxie course, aspart of a general reconstruction of the finances of the portauthority concerned, to be replaced by private equity capital.13.    A Bill to empower the Government to make these loans will beIntroduced in the next Session of Parliament.    Should it benecessary to make loans before the Bill is passed, these will bemade from the Contingencies Fund.Footnotes:    (1) Cmnd I82I+.

TEXT OP THE WRITTEN ANSWER GIVEN BY THE MINISTER FOR transport industries ON 2.5 MAY 1971With effect from 15 June Mr Philip Chappell, one of the ManagingDirectors of Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd will become part-time Chairmanof * the National Ports Council in succession to Sir Arthur- Kirby.Mr Jack Jones is being re-appointed as Deputy Chairman.New members of bhe Council will be Mr Plorian 0 P Brann, Mr A G 3 BlarneySir William Lithgow and Mr D E A Pettit.    Existing Members of theCouncil who wi11 continue tc.serve for varying periods are Mr P B BoltonMr L J Reynolds, Mr A W Suddaby and Mr J Morris Gifford, the Council&apos;sDirector-General,    These changes are designed to reinforce theCouncil&apos;s independent advisory role:    no member of the Council willin future be a member of any port authority.In the Government&apos;s view the Council has a major and increasingly important role to play in strengthening the ports industry.    I have invited it to formulate in collaboration with the ports a programmeof action which should include:-a. improvements in management, finance and commercial methods;reform of tariff structures;    co-ordination of costing andaccounting procedures; the setting of realistic financial objectives; the elimination of loss-making activities and the phasing-out of obsolescent facilities;b. management development and training throughout the industry,including careers structure;    a central clearing-house formanagement posts;c. changes in the boards of the major public trust ports;    inthe direction of smaller boards, with more executive members.The Council will of course continue to advise the Government on controlof capital investment and other matters under the Harbours Act,  19^4-,including research and development and adequate access to ports byroad and rail.    I intend to invite them also to offer advice and assistance on methods of securing improvements in the present organisa-tion of cargo-handling.I do not think it necessary at this stage to seek additional statutory powers for the Council.    I prefer instead to rely on the close co-operation and understanding between port authorities and the council which I have every confidence will be forthcoming.
