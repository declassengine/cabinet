DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 115 COPY NO0 i19 October 1971CABINETREVIEW OF GOVERNMENT research and development memorandum by the Lord Privy SealINTRODUCTION1.        At their Meeting on 12 October, 1971, the ministerial committee on Science and Technology (SCT) considered and warmly welcomed the Report by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) on government Research and Development, a copy of which is attached.2. The Cabinet will wish to note the conclusions reached by SCTand above all to consider the presentational issues which are important.FORM OF PUBLICATION3. The SCT concluded that the CPRS Report should not be published as such, either on its own, or as an annex to a brief White Paperendorsing it or specific recommendations in it.    This was partly because such a course would increase pressure for the publication ofother CPRS Reports.   The SCT also rejected the publication of the CPRSReport as a Green Paper.    They agreed that it should be incorporated ina White Paper to be published in one month&apos;s time.    The White paper is now being drafted with the minimum of textual alterations to the CPRSReport.    SCT also agreed that the Report of a Working Group of theCouncil for Scientific Policy on the future of the Research CouncilSystem (the Dainton Report) should be published separately at the sametime as the White Paper.    The Cabinet is invited to note these conclusions.CONSULTATION4. In agreement with the Ministers directly concerned, theSecretary of State for Education and Science has promised the Presidentof the Royal Society and the Research Councils &quot;full consultation on theGovernments proposals for the future organisation of Research andDevelopment when the current review /i. e CPRS review/ is completed&quot;.1
The publication of the Governments findings in a White Paper will represent a decision by the Government to adopt the basic principles ofthe CPRS Report and notably the endorsement of the customer-contractorrelationship and its application to the Research Councils so less than toother areas of the Governments concern with science and technology.This is a decision of principle, which is not susceptible of negotiation withthe scientific community.5.        On the other hand, the extent of its application to the research councils, i. e. the precise amount to be transferred from the science budget to Departmental Votes, admits of further discussion.    It is accepted that about  28 million (some 25 per cent of the ResearchCouncils1 R&amp;D budget) should be transferred.   This should be our aim.But the precise figure needs discussion with the Research Councils and allocation in detail between them.    The exact amount of this figure, andits allocation, when taken with the details of organisation and implement a-tion, affords adequate scope for consultation with the scientific community.I recommend, therefore, that we should be prepared to consult with them on this basis as soon as the White Paper has been published.6.        The review is bound to provoke a certain amount of criticalcomment from the scientific establishment.    This is inevitable; but withcareful handling it might be mitigated.    I believe, therefore, that wemust make a real effort to deal with some of this before the White paper is published.   Accordingly I propose that:-a. The Dainton Report should be given to the President ofthe Royal Society, and the Chairman/Secretaries of the research councils and of the Institution of Professional Civil Servants in strict confidence during the week before the White Paper is published.b. At the same time the Governments intentions, includingthe question of consultation after publication of the White Paper,should be explained to the same group on the same confidentialbasis.    It will be desirable to explain matters toSir Frederick Dainton at a rather earlier stage.recommendations.        I invite the Cabinet -i.      to note that the substance of the CPRS Report will be incorporated into a White Paper to be published within one month, and that the Dainton Report should be publishedsimultaneously.ii.       to agreed that consultations with the scientific communitywill follow the publication of the White Paper and be on the basisset out in paragraphs 4 and 5.J civil  Service Department18 October 1971 2

Government Research and Development(R &amp; D)BY THE CENTRAL POLICY REVIEW STAFFCHAPTER IIntroduction1 One might expect that a review of Government R&amp;D would be greatly concerned with answers to such questions as:(a) Are we doing too much, too little, or about the right amountof R &amp; D ?(b) Is the balance between pure and applied research aboutright ?(c) Should we do more intramural and less extramural R&amp;D,or vice versa ?(d) What R&amp;D are we doing which should not be done ?(e) What R&amp;D should we do which is not being done ?(/) Is there adequate machinery, at the centre, critically to evaluate the overall R&amp;D scene ?2 These questions, and possible answers to them, are not systemati-cally discussed in this report because to try and do so would not help to provide a framework in which the efficiency of Govern-ment R&amp;D can be maximised. The questions either relate toan out-of-date concept of R &amp; D management, or they areunanswerable. The resolution of the dilemma, which is moreapparent than real, is to ensure that the organisation and manage-ment of R &amp; D is logical, flexible, humane and decentralised,the prerequisites of an efficient system. Furthermore, that eachperson in the system has clearly defined responsibilities. Thisreport is, therefore, concerned with the establishment of theprinciples on which such an efficient system must rest and theconsequences of accepting and implementing them.3 Some comments may, however, be made about the six questionsenumerated above, (a) is discussed later; (b) is not a meaningfulquestion because there cannot be a correct &apos; balance&apos; betweenthe resources devoted to pure and applied research. The amountof pure research done at Universities and elsewhere depends onthe talent and money available; but one can make certainassertions about the proportion of pure research permissible or
necessary within an applied research programme. Questions (c),(d) and (e) are automatically answered when a satisfactoryorganisation for the management and prosecution of R &amp; Dexists and it is one of the purposes of this report to recommendone. Question (/) is difficult to answer, because it is doubtfulwhether any central body can or should try critically to evaluate the Governments R &amp; D as a whole. Nevertheless, some focalpoint, i.e. the Chief Scientific Adviser, is necessary at the centre,not only to satisfy the ubiquitous desire for such focal points,but also to co-ordinate trans-departmental and trans-nationalsubjects involving R&amp;D. The phrase&apos; subjects involving R&amp;D&apos;is deliberate and intended to emphasise that applied R&amp;D, withwhich this report is mainly concerned, is not an activity in itsown right; it is part of a wider process, for reasons which are discussed at length in the following pages.TOO MUCH R&amp;D, TOO LITTLE, OR JUST ABOUT RIGHT ?4 In spite of many books and papers, some of a mathematicalnature, no-one, in industry or Government, has found a methodof determining the &apos; right&apos; amount of R &amp; D to do. In fact, mosttruthful research directors and R&amp;D administrators admit that decisions on this matter are an art rather than a science. Never-theless, the person who has to pay for the end-product of appliedR &amp; D is, for obvious reasons, in the best position to decide how much he can afford. Depending on his qualifications, he may need to take the advice of scientists, mathematicians or engineersskilled in the subject under consideration.5 Some people believe that eminent scientists, mathematicians and engineers should have an opportunity to express an overall view on the nation&apos;s R &amp; D to those ultimately in charge. But suchan overall view, whether greatly desired or even ordered, is ofquestionable value. Some comfort or discomfort may, forexample, be gained from comparisons with other countries, see table 1.The countries in this Table almost certainly define R &amp; D indifferent ways; they have widely different populations; and theyare at different stages of industrial development. The readermay, therefore, feel that the figures should be divided by somefactor or factors to take account of these differences; but thequestion is, by what ? If this exercise is not undertaken, if only because it is unclear how to do it, the reader may derive some

Why, on the other hand, does France spend more thanus ? Should this be a matter for satisfaction or discomfort ?Leaving aside this difficult or, perhaps, unanswerable question,one must remember that the R&amp;D effort of a country will haveno effect on that country&apos;s welfare for at least seven years afterthe date of the effort in question; so that no inferences can bemade from the figures in Table 1 until, at the earliest, 1977.Even then the inferences will be of questionable value because itis not, for example, known whether an increase in GNP is in partcaused by an increase in R &amp; D expenditure, or whether thelatter is a consequence of increased prosperity. Writers some-times seem confused about this point.CHAPTER IIApplied R&amp;DPrinciples6  This report is based on the principle that applied R&amp;D, that isR&amp;D with a practical application as its objective, must be doneon a customer-contractor basis. The customer says what hewants; the contractor does it (if he can); and the customer pays.      R.Basic, fundamental or pure research, called basic research in ) R stands for recommendation.
this report, has no analogous customer-contractor basisf),though those engaged in such work may and, sometimes, toooften do become involved in applied R&amp;D. The words customerand contractor are discussed in detail later. Here, some observa-tions about basic and applied R&amp;D are necessary. Much timecan be lost in semantic arguments about the nature of basicresearch, its impact, accidental or otherwise, on applied research,and the difference between them; and the same applies to research and development. It is sometimes said, for example,that development should be done by different people, in adifferent place, and with a different administrative system fromresearch. The reverse is the case, whenever possible. It is alsosometimes said, in justification of basic research, that chanceobservations made during such work, and their subsequent study,may be just as important as those made during applied R&amp;D.While there is some truth in this contention, the country&apos;s needsare not so trivial as to be left to the mercies of a form of scientificroulette, with many more than the conventional 37 numbers onwhich the ball may land.7  The end-product or objective of applied R &amp; D is:(a) A Product, e.g. a tank, an antibiotic, a nuclear reactor, an artificial hand, an instrument for measuring the concentra-tion of nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases, or a drought-resistant variety of wheat;(b) A Process, e.g. for the manufacture of an antibiotic, forconverting natural gas into protein, for purifying uraniumfrom uranium oxide, or for removing nitrogen oxides fromexhaust gases;(c) A Method of Operation, e.g. to prevent collisions in theEnglish Channel, to speed up the delivery of letters, or togive advice, sometimes in the discharge of a stautory obligation.The end-product of basic research is an increase in knowledge.In more sophisticated language, basic research is concerned withthe discovery of rational correlations and principles.8  The Government supports basic research and commissionsapplied R&amp;D. The former is almost exclusively financed by the(2) It is scarcely meaningful or productive to stretch the customer-contractor principle to the extent of claiming that the Department ofEducation and Science (DES) is a customer who says &apos; I want goodscience, basic research and education, and am prepared to pay for it&apos;.
Department of Education and Science (DES) and the latter byall the other Departments which commission R&amp;D. The DESsupports basic research, via the University Grants Committee,at the Universities; and via the Council for Scientific Policy(CSP) and &apos; subordinate&apos; Research Councils, at the research councils&apos; own institutes, units and elsewhere. The five research councils are only &apos; subordinate&apos; to the CSP in respect of theallocation of funds. They are autonomous in respect of their programmes, an unsatisfactory situation&quot; ln&quot;&apos;s6&apos;me cases;&quot;which isthe subject of recommendations in this report. According to theDES (March 1971), 22 per cent of the work of the medical research Council (MRC), 74 per cent of that of the agricultural research Council (ARC) and 73 per cent of the work of theNatural Environment Research Council (NERC) was &apos; applied &apos;,in 1970-71. But this so-called applied work had and has nocustomer to commission and approve it. This is wrong. Howeverdistinguished, intelligent and practical scientists may be, theycannot be so well qualified to decide what the needs of the nationare, and their priorities, as those responsible for ensuring thatthose needs are met. This is why applied R&amp;D must have acustomer, whose role is described immediately below. R. 2The Customer9 The customer (client, user, or their representative) may be direct,for example the Vice-Chief of the Naval Staff who requires a new or improved torpedo; or indirect, in that he represents, some-times in quite an oblique way, the user of the product, process,or method of operation which constitutes the end-product of anapplied R&amp;D programme. An example is road R&amp;D,sponsored by the Department of the Environment (DOE) onbehalf of the motorist (at any rate in part). The customer shouldhave the following responsibilities or accountabilities^):(a) He should decide, with advice or on his own initiative, that R. 3an R &amp; D programme is needed to achieve a specificobjective.NoteUnspecific or unduly general objectives such as &apos; We mustfind out all about the physiology of domestic farm animals &apos;or &apos; We must be able to describe engine knock in preciseO The word accountability is used in its normal sense, i.e. someone who isaccountable is not necessarily an Accounting Officer.
physico-chemical terms&apos; should be treated with caution,however admirable they may seem at first glance. more often than not they imply financial and scientific commit-ments of an open-ended nature. These are rarely justifiablein an applied R&amp;D programme.(b) He should decide how much can be spent on the programme.        R. 4(Reference is made to operating expenditure, not capitalexpenditure on equipment.)Notes(i) The customer will normally need the advice of theChief Scientist (q.v.) and the Controller R&amp;D (q.v.),the latter being, inter alia, a. specialist on programmecosts and the relationship between them and estimatedcompletion dates.(ii) The word &apos; spent&apos; does not imply the physical transfer        R. 5of funds. It is, however, recommended that the amountsspent on different programmes should be formallydebited, with account numbers, to the named, account-able customer.(iii) Operating expenditure should include a depreciation or        R. 6obsolescence charge.(c) He should approve capital expenditure for the development,        R. as opposed to the research, phase of the programme, and for new research buildings.NoteDifficulties are sometimes raised about making a clear-cutdistinction between research and development, and the familiar &apos; continuous R&amp;D spectrum &apos; argument is adducedin support of these alleged difficulties. There are two ways of dealing with this question, whether the problem is a realone or not; first, by recognising that a development programme almost invariably costs at least ten times asmuch as the research component of the same programme;secondly, by accepting that development should very rarelybe started until and unless there is a better than 90 per centchance that the objective of the R&amp;D programme will berealised.(d) He should determine priorities between programmes. RS
The Chief Scientist10 The Chief Scientist is part of the customer organisations for all departmental R &amp; D. He should not be the Chief scientific adviser because he must share, with the customer, responsibilityfor the decisions enumerated in paragraph 9, (a)-[d). Advisersdo not have responsibility for decisions. Depending on theexpertise within the &apos; divisions&apos; of which a Department iscomposed, and their R&amp;D needs, the Chief Scientist may haverepresentatives within them. This implies that a member of theChief Scientist^ organisation may have two bosses, the head ofthe division and the Chief Scientist. There is nothing organisa-tionally abnormal or unsound about such a system; indeed, thereare precedents for it within government at the present time. Asimilar situation arises when customers commission R &amp; D atmultifunctional laboratories (q.v.).11  The Chief Scientist should normally be hierarchically senior to       R. 9the Controller R&amp;D, whose role is described immediatelybelow. There should, however, be no line relationship between       R. 10them. They are engaged in quite different activities.The Controller R&amp;D12 The Controller R&amp;D should be the chief executive of the R-11R&amp;D function, the contractor providing an R &amp; D service forthe customer. He is the head office focal point to which theR&amp;D function is accountable and, as such, is immune toparochial considerations which inevitably affect the Directors of individual research establishments, however objective they may think they are or wish to be. The R&amp;D function consists of the research workers and their supporting staff, their laboratories oranalogous institutions where they work, and a very small head office organisation in which the Controller R &amp; D is located. Thereason why there is only a skeleton head office organisation is because the Controller R&amp;D should draw on his laboratories, R-12often by secondment, for expertise. A scientist soon loses hisskills if he does not use them.13  The Controller R&amp;D, like the customer, may commission work       R. 13at Universities or other extramural organisations when his &apos; in-house &apos; organisation has not got the facilities or expertise needed to implement the customer^ requirements.
14  The Controller R&amp;D should have the following responsibilities       R. 14or accountabilities:(a) to provide his customers with an efficient R&amp;D service.Notes(i) &apos; An efficient R&amp;D service&apos; covers a multitude of factors which will be well known to research administra-tors. They range from authorisation, within certainbudgetary and administrative restraints, of capitalexpenditure on research but not on development equip-ment nor research buildings, to ensuring a proper flow of people into and out of the R&amp;D function. Theaccountability of the Controller R &amp; D for capitalexpenditure on research equipment involves twodepartures from current practice: first, operating and R. 15capital expenditure should not be lumped together as one cost item. Apart from other considerations, thisavoids footnotes explaining &apos; exceptional items&apos; suchas the purchase, in a particular year, of a survey vessel.Secondly, accountability for operating and capitalexpenditure should not be vested in the same individual R. 16except, naturally, at the Permanent Secretary level.Expenditure at the development stage of a project,which is at least ten times as great as at the researchstage and has quite different probability criteria naturally needs the customer^ approval. It is, therefore,not the responsibility of the Controller R &amp; D on hisown.(ii) The Controller R&amp;D faces serious difficulties in ensuring a proper flux of people through the R&amp;Dfunction. This question is of sufficient importance tomerit special discussion, see Chapter IV.The General Research surcharge15 Virtually all applied R&amp;D laboratories, except those exclu-sively concerned with testing or technical service, sooner or later engage, overtly or clandestinely, in research which is not directly concerned with the programmes commissioned by thecustomers: and it is a good thing that they do. It is, however,important that such activities should be recognised as being necessary and that they should be formally quantified. The       R-17
average operating expenditure on them should not amount to        R. 18more than about 10 per cent of that sanctioned by the customersand the expenditure, which is a surcharge on the customers,        R. 19should be wholly at the discretion of the Controller R&amp;D.These activities are called General Research because they donot necessarily consist of applied R&amp;D, nor of pure research.General Research is done for the following reasons:(a) to engage in basic research in a field relevant to the appliedtasks of the laboratory, but which is not being done else-where, e.g. at a University;(b) to test out new, way-out and unprogrammed ideas of thescientists, engineers and mathematicians themselves;(c) to maintain expertise, e.g. to recruit and keep a spectro-scopist who will not join the laboratory unless he can spendpart of his time on his own research;id) to facilitate the transition from academic life to that in anapplied R&amp;D organisation.16 It is important to appreciate that the General Research sur-charge of about 10 per cent is an average figure per Department.Some establishments may be almost wholly engaged in GeneralResearch, for example in molecular biology or superconductivity.Others may do very little but the average expenditure mustnot be more than about 10 per cent of the departmental R&amp;Dbudget and it is the Controller R &amp; D&apos;s responsibility to seethat it is not. There is no reason why the General Research R- 20surcharge should increase a Department^ overall R&amp;Dexpenditure.17 If the General Research surcharge principle were accepted now and if, for the time being, the DES payments were excluded,some  54 million would be spent on work in this category in1971.18 The DES is excluded &apos; for the time being&apos; because until and unless the recommendations in this report are accepted, theDES Research Councils, to whom the DES will pay  109-5 million in 1971-72, do not conform with the customer-contractorconcept. Apart from this, two of these Research Councils, con-cerned with &apos; Science &apos; ( 50 - 9 million) and &apos; Social Science &apos; ( 2-million) are not suitable for inclusion within this concept. Table2 shows how the figure  54 million is arrived at, as 10 per cent of ( 645-5 - 109-5) ^53-6.

The two &apos; conglomerate &apos; Departments, the Depart-ment of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Department of the environment (DOE) will need time to become adjusted to thisproposal. The recommendation that Departments should adopt this uniform terminology is not caused by a passion for tidiness;nor by any wish to indulge in semantic hair-splitting. At present,June 1971, the DTI, for example, has a Chief Scientist, some of whose duties are identical with those of a Controller R&amp;D,and a Chief Scientific Adviser (Energy). The Home Office hasone man called &apos; Director General of Research and ChiefScientist&apos;. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food(MAFF) has a Director General Agricultural Development and advisory Services, who is partly concerned with R&amp;D, and a chief Scientific Adviser (Food). The DOE has a director general of Research who has both Chief Scientist and Controller
R&amp;D responsibilities. The Ministry of Defence has a ControllerEstablishments and Research, with the exact responsibilities ofa Controller R&amp;D. All Departments accept the customer-contractor principle; but it must be hard for the departmentalcustomer and contractor to understand their respective rolesin the Department^ R&amp;D with such a bewildering array ofdesignations. The confusion is confounded when extra- or Inter-departmental relationships are involved.20 The perpetuation of the existing designations could only be caused by an understandable but undesirable reluctance toabandon traditional designations.Multifunctional laboratories and institutes21 Such laboratories and institutes have programmes for whichdifferent customers should be accountable even if the customersare not in the same Department. There is nothing abnormal nor R. 22organisationally unsound in such a situation, though some people have difficulty in accepting or becoming acclimatised toit. One of the duties of the Controller R &amp; D is to integratethe requirements of these separate programme bosses (thecustomers) with the overall administration of the laboratory orinstitute. The acceptance of the concept of the multifunctionallaboratory or institute is important.Dialogues22 No system for the administration and prosecution of appliedR&amp;D will work efficiently and successfully without a continuingdialogue between the customer, the Chief Scientist, the Con-troller R&amp;D and those concerned with the actual prosecution ofthe R &amp; D. In an efficient and successful organisation, all those concerned act and behave as a team in spite of formal account-abilities. Without the accountabilities, however, both efficiency and the probability of success are reduced.CHAPTER iii the Research Councils of the Department of Education and science (DES)Expenditure, Head Office staff and mechanism of financialsupport23 There are five Research Councils, the ARC, the MRC, theNERC, the Science Research Council (SRC), and the SocialScience Research Council (SSRC). Their expenditure, in 1971-72, is given in Table 3, immediately below.
TABLE estimated net Research Council Expenditure (DES),1971-72*  million50-92-218-722-415-3109-5* Excluding the Natural History Museum,  1-7 million ( 0-5 million from the DOE) and Grants for Science (including the Royal Societies) 2-0 million.24 One of the main tasks of the Council for Scientific Policy, alsounder the DES, is to advise the Secretary of State for education and Science about the distribution of funds,  109-5 million in1971-72, between the five Research Councils.C)25  The head office organisations of the CSP and the research councils consist of 1,078 people (4.6.1971) and 116 CouncilMembers (3 vacancies) plus Assessors, together with 128 per-manent committees, boards or groups. The cost of the 1,078whole-time staff will be about  4 million in 1971. A review of       R.23these numbers is needed and, in the first instance, attention should be paid to explaining why they should not be scaled down from 1,078 to 790. This latter figure was arrived at by a fallaciouspro-rating procedure. A preliminary examination of the head office numbers of individual Research Councils suggests thatthose of the MRC and NERC are too high and those of theSSRC much too high. The explanation of the high head officecost of the SSRC, the number of postgraduate awards and research grants given, needs justification. The CSP and the       R. 24Research Councils would be well advised to obtain the co-opera-       R. 25tion of specialists within the* Civil Service Department whenconducting this review, which should include a study of the       R-26need for the 128 permanent committees, boards and groups.Much valuable, specialised manpower is tied up in them.26 No further reference will be made to the SRC nor the SSRC.As the name of the former implies, it is concerned with pure(J) The budget of the SSRC is negotiated separately.ScienceSocial Science .AgriculturalMedical   .Natural Environment
and, to a lesser extent, applied science, which is not synonymouswith research. The SSRC is in its infancy and it would, therefore,be premature to comment on its activities at this stage, apartfrom the reference above to the size of its head office organisa-tion. It should, however, be studied in due course. This leaves       R- 27NERC, the MRC and the ARC which are discussed below.Before that, however, some general observations must be made about the Research Councils. The Council for Scientific Policy,in its role of spokesman for the Research Councils, does not accept that there is an unambiguous difference between pureand applied research. It believes that the adjectives pure and applied imply a division where none should exist and that their use can be harmful. In spite of this view, it is well known thatthere is a clear, logical and easily comprehensible differencebetween pure and applied research, see paragraph 6 on page 3of this report; though it is not in dispute that the results ofpure research may sometimes be of applied or practical value,and that applied research may produce results of &apos; pure&apos; interestand importance. The Government should, therefore, reject the       R- 28view that there is no logical division between pure and applied research, a view which may be intended to protect the research councils from the imaginary ravages of applied R&amp;D users.27 The Research Council Members should have two functions in R.29regard to the applied R&amp;D with which they are concerned:first, to advise the chief executives of the Research Councils&apos;organisations about the quality of their scientists, engineers andmathematicians and of their work; and, secondly, to &apos; protect&apos;their organisations from hypothetical political or administrativepressures of an undesirable nature. A number of executivedepartments, for example, the Home Office, the Ministry ofDefence, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Depart-ment of the Environment have Research Councils or equivalentbodies, which, though constitutionally different from the DESResearch Councils, have or should have analogous functions.The independence of such Council Members is an importantcomponent of the system.28 Reference was made above to the &apos; chief executives of the research Councils&apos; organisations&apos;. In DES Research Councillanguage, they may be the Secretary, the Chairman, the half-timeChairman, or the 3/5th time Chairman. The reader will, doubt-less, have realised that, in the case of the MRC, ARC andNERC, the Secretary&apos;s functions in respect of applied R&amp;D R. 30should be identical with those of the Controller R&amp;D, see
paragraph 12 et seq., pages 6-9 in this report, and it would bein the interests of clarity and, therefore, efficiency if he weredesignated as such. The Secretary of State for Education and science should obtain the approval of the Secretaries of State R.31or Ministers of the appropriate executive departments beforeappointing the chief executives and part-time Chairmen of theMRC, ARC and NERC, apart from consulting the President ofthe Royal Society. In the case of the MRC this implies getting the approval of the Secretary of State of the Department ofHealth and Social Security (DHSS); in the case of the ARC, theAgricultural Ministers; and in the case of NERC, the secretaries of State of the DOE and the DTI.29 Ultimately and logically, all experimental work, whether doneby the MRC on behalf of the DHSS, or, independently of theMRC, by the DHSS, should be the responsibility of the chief executive of the MRC, whose role in this capacity would bethat of the Controller R&amp;D, see paragraphs 12-17, pages 7-9.The same naturally applies to the MAFF &amp; DAFSO withrespect to the ARC. The present division is both illogical and undesirable. It perpetuates meaningless or harmful distinctionsbetween research and development, and panders to scientificsnobbery the &apos; haves &apos; in the Research Councils and the &apos; havenots &apos; in the Departments.30  Each Research Council should have a whole-time Secretary,       R.32Chief Executive or Controller R&amp;D, and a part-time Chairman,to obviate the somewhat ludicrous and, it is believed, inefficientsituation mentioned in the second sentence of paragraph 28.31 A recommendation was made by the Council for Scientific policy that executive departments should be enabled to place contracts with the Research Councils. This is strongly supported and the recommended size of these contracts is given in Table 4; butthe Research Councils should not have the right to reject such R. 33contracts without good reasons agreed with the sponsoringexecutive department. Some observations must, however, bemade: first, the Council for Scientific Policy referred to theexecutive departments requiring scientific support. They do not require scientific support, but applied R &amp; D, to achieve specific,pre-determined objectives. Secondly, the Council for scientific policy recommended the replacement of the CSP by an executive,chartered body, the Board of Research Councils, one of whosefunctions would be to ensure that the requirements of executive(/) Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.
departments were being properly met. This function is unneces-sary except in regard to work quality. Subject to certainreservations discussed later, the executive departments should themselves ensure that they get what they want from the       R- 34Research Councils. If they do not, they can and, doubtless, will       R. 35go elsewhere, with their money, to get their objectives met.32 The recommendations in Table 4 imply a 25 per cent reductionin the DES vote (the Science Budget) for the Research Councils,and, in the first instance, a corresponding increase in the votes of the appropriate Departments. These recommendations explainand amplify the remark, made immediately above, that theexecutive departments should themselves ensure that they getwhat they want from the Research Councils. Nevertheless, therecommendations in the Table are conditional and the conditionsare mentioned immediately below. One is that before the recom-mended changes for the new system of financing the research councils are implemented, in principle on 5.4.1972, the DHSSand the MAFF must have set up Chief Scientist organisations R, 36to enable the customers in these two Departments to carry out their new and onerous responsibilities. At the time of writingthis report, 16.9.1971, the MAFF&apos;s Chief Scientist organisation is inadequate and that of the DHSS is incomplete. That of theDOE is broadly satisfactory and this Department should haveno difficulty with its contracts to NERC.TABLE 4Recommended changes in the system of financing the DES research councils as from 5.4.1972, as if the estimated net 1971-72expenditure, see Table 3, applied.   million R, 3J(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)	To be paid by	To be paid by	To be paid by	DES if	DES under	MAFF, DHSS,Research Council	present system	recommended	DOE or DTI	continues	system	under recommended systemScience	50-9	50-9	0Social Science	2-2	2-2	0Agricultural	18-7	4-2	14-5 (MAFF)Medical	22-4	16-8	5-6 (DHSS)*Natural Environment	15-3	7-7	7-6 (DOE, 4-0;DTI, 3-2;MAFF, 0-4)* Including the Scottish Home and Health Department (SHHD), here and elsewhere, when relevant.
Notes on Table 4(i) Some observations on the derivations of the figuresrelating to the Agricultural, Medical and NaturalEnvironment Research Councils are given in the Appen-dix, which also contains important recommendationsrelating to Table 4.(ii) When discussing the customer-contractor principle in deparments, reference was made to the split betweenthe customer and the Controller R &amp; D in respect ofcapital expenditure. This split would be inappropriateand unmanageable in the case of the Research Councils,which explains why, in Tables 3 and 4, capital and operating expenditure have not been separated.33 A Chief Scientist organisation does not just consist of a ChiefScientist and, for example, some Advisory Council which maywell not be necessary. A Chief Scientist organisation is, as the phrase indicates, an organisation. In the Ministry of Defence,where there is more technical expertise than in several otherDepartments, which might be held to imply a need for a relatively small Chief Scientist organisation, the Chief Scientific Adviser&apos;organisation in fact consists of more than 50 people.34 Departments may object to the concept of a Chief Scientistorganisation because of the ceiling on Civil Service manpower.This objection is not valid because a considerable part of theChief Scientist organisation can and should consist of staff R. 38seconded from research establishments. A member of the atomic energy Authority or the Agricultural Research Council who isseconded to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food doesnot count against the total of non-industrial civil servants.35 A second condition is that if this recommended change in the financing of the Research Councils is implemented, the amount paid to the Research Councils by the Departments in the first year under the new regime should not be less than would havebeen spent if no change had occurred. Furthermore, after this R. 39first year, the Departments should not reduce their payments tothe Research Councils by more than 10 per cent per year for R. 40three years. It is, naturally, a matter for the Departments todecide if they wish to increase their payments to the research councils.36 There is, therefore, a four-year Transition Period. Towards theend of it, the Departments and the Chief Scientific Advisershould review the need for any increase or decrease in the extent       R. 41
to which the MRC, ARC and NERC should be directly financed by the Departments concerned; also whether the 10 per cent rateof reduction in payments, if it has occurred, should be allowedto continue or not.37 Because of the rather small size of the DHSS participation in theMRCs affairs and because of the intimate relationship whichshould exist between the DHSS and the MRC, the Chief medical officer of the DHSS should be a Member of the medical research Council, not only an Assessor to the Council. In R. 42addition, the DHSS should be represented on those Boards and committees of the MRC which are relevant to the DHSS&apos;interests. Apart from other departmental representation, theChief Scientists, DHSS, MAFF, DOE and DTI should, of course,respectively be Members of the MRC, ARC and NERC, the R. 43DOE and the DTI both having a considerable interest in NERCprogrammes.38  The composition and duties of the Council for Scientific Policy       R. 44should be as follows:(a) It should have a part-time independent Chairman, appointedby the Secretary of State for Education and Science with theagreement of the President of the Royal Society;(b) It should, as at present, have an extremely small secretariat,provided by the DES;(c) It should advise the Secretary of State about the distributionof funds between the Research Councils apart from moneyprovided by the Departments or others, with which it willnot be concerned;(d) Its members should consist of an independent Chairman,the five Chief Executives or Controllers R &amp; D of the research Councils, the Chairman of the University GrantsCommittee, but no Assessors.Notes(i) No useful purpose would appear to be served by thePresident of the Royal Society being a Member, firstbecause the President is too important, as ex officio R. 45head of the scientific establishment, to become involvedin departmental decision-making; and, secondly,because it is neither desirable nor possible to distin-guish between the President as a distinguished scientistand the President as President;
(ii) There seems little point in the suggestion of havingeminent scientists, industrialists and civil servants onthe Council if the recommendations in this report are adopted. The majority of the Research Councils&apos; mem-bers are themselves eminent scientists; and industrial-ists or civil servants will, ex hypothesi, have little tocontribute under the proposed new system. the research Councils should and, it is believed, do act r. 46as a team; and in the most unlikely event of, say, threeChief Executives of the Research Councils and theChairman of the CSP ganging up against one or otherremaining Councils, there should be a right of appealto the Secretary of State for Education and Science.39 The Council for Scientific Policy does not accept that the research Councils are concerned with applied R&amp;D but with&apos; strategic and basic science&apos;. Basic research or science seemsto be identical with pure research or science. Strategic sciencerefers to work in a field of general practical interest, but thereis no precise objective specified by a customer, user, or repre-sentative of a customer or user. A comment has been made about this type of R &amp; D, in paragraph 9 (a), Note, on page 5.&apos; Tacticalscience&apos;, which is equated with &apos; scientific knowledge&apos;, is saidto be done by the executive departments but not the research councils, except, in the future, under contract, with the research councils having the right to refuse to accept contracts. given that the very names of the Research Councils, Medical, Agricul-tural, and Natural Environment, obviously imply applications,this philosophy or outlook should be rejected.Research Council Units40 The Research Councils have had the policy of establishing Units,usually but not necessarily at universities and hospitals,centred often on one particularly good scientist; and of closing down the Unit if or when the scientist in question is no longeravailable. The Research Councils should pay particular attentionto the second part of this policy. r. 47&apos; Longer-Term &apos; Research41 Anxiety is sometimes expressed about the will or ability of executive departments and industry to engage in longer-termR&amp;D, which is assumed to refer to an R &amp; D project that is
expected to last more than five years; and it is said there is a natural tendency for it to be displaced or replaced by short-termor ad hoc work. The Universities, the Research Councils andthe General Research surcharge exist to counter this tendencywhen, in an imperfect world, it occurs. Nevertheless, it is the dutyof an applied R&amp;D administrator to ensure that there is a mixof short, medium and longer-term R &amp; D in most of the laboratory-tories under his control, not only because of the intrinsicdesirability of the mix, provided the end objectives are clearlyspecified; but also to gratify the desires of, at any rate, some ofthe scientists, engineers and mathematicians in the establish-ments. But it should be remarked that longer-term research hasno special merit or value, as some people tend to assume. Thereis no positive correlation between the importance of a discoveryand the time it took to make it.The Royal Societies Grant42 At present this is paid by the DES via the Science research council. Considering the status and role of the Royal Societiesin science, engineering and mathematics, both in the UnitedKingdom and elsewhere, it would seem more appropriate fortheir grants to be paid centrally, i.e. by the Cabinet Office andthe Scottish Office, rather than by a particular Department ofState. It is, accordingly, recommended that this change should be R- 48made as from 5.4.1972, although the Royal Society (London) is satisfied with the present arrangement.Contracts from Government Departments, excluding the DES, to the Research Councils43 All contracts from Government Departments to the research councils, or work sponsored by Government Departments and carried out by the Research Councils should, without exception, R. 49be paid for by the Government Department in question. Whenmore than one Government Department is involved, a decision should be taken by the Government Departments, not by the research Councils, as to which Government Department should pay. Little difficulty should be experienced in most cases in deciding which Government Department is the most interested.44 The reader will remember &apos; Multifunctional Laboratories&apos;,paragraph 21 on page 11, which is relevant to this subject.
The Pay of Chairmen and Members of some research councils and other Scientific Advisory Bodies45 It is hard to understand the logic of any system there may be within Government for deciding whether or not independent members of Councils, Boards and Standing Committees shouldbe paid, or give their services free apart from out-of-pocketexpenses, Table 5; and it is strongly recommended that this R. 50subject be examined, or re-examined, by the Civil service department, attention being paid to the duty of the citizen torender public service and to be remunerated with this in mind.The subject is a difficult one because membership of a high-sounding Council, Board, etc. may well be less arduous thanthat of a comparatively obscure Government Committee.TABLE 5The Pay of Chairmen and Members of some Research councils and other Scientific Advisory BodiesIndependentBody Chairman MembersCentral Advisory Council on science   and   Technology,Cabinet Office   ...       0* 0Defence   Scientific   AdvisoryCouncil, MOD . . .  18-90 per day  15-75 per dayHome Office Scientific AdvisoryCouncil    ....       0 0Noise Advisory Council, DOE .  15-75 per day  12-60 per dayAdvisory Council on Research&amp; Development for Fuel and power, DTI      ...       0 0Aeronautical Research Council,DTI..... 15-75 per day       12-60 per dayCouncil for Scientific Policy .  1,500 per year  15-75 per dayMedical Research Council    .        1,000 per year       750 per year* Civil Servant so far.CHAPTER IVScientists, Engineers and Mathematicians in the Civil Serviceand their Movements46 Reference was made in paragraph 14 to the responsibility of theController R &amp; D for ensuring an adequate, systematic and
continuing flow of people out of and into research establish-ments. It is, therefore, of interest to study the present situation.The following table shows the number of senior civil servants in the Administrative Class with degrees in science, engineeringor mathematics (SEM) on 30.4.1971.Grade	Number in grade	Number witii SEM degrees	PercentagePermanent Secretary	28	3	11Deputy Secretary  .	82	13	16Under-Secretary	304	33	11Assistant Secretary	824	72	9Principal	1,086	118	11Assistant Principal	325	40	12The rather low percentage of ex-scientists, mathematicians and engineers among senior civil servants may be due to the almost complete lack of movement from the Scientific Civil Serviceinto the Administrative Class. Only 36 former members of the scientific Civil Service have moved over to the administrative class, and although the majority of these were transferred in comparatively recent years, the annual rate of movement isminimal. The number of transfers to and from the UnitedKingdom Atomic Energy Authority and the Medical research council was equally trivial. While the paucity of technicallyqualified people within the Administrative Class of the CivilService may cause some despondency, the virtually completeimmobility of the Scientific Civil Service is, or shortly willbecome, a major national problem. The immobility of the scientific Civil Service has been eased in recent years by theintroduction of so-called &apos; opportunity posts&apos; in headquartersorganisations; this is all to the good and should be encouraged.It is common knowledge that the vitality and efficiency of alaboratory depends on an adequate flow of scientists, mathema-ticians and engineers through it, apart from that which occursthrough retirement and recruitment; and it is one importantfunction of the research administrator, the Controller R&amp;D,to ensure that this flow takes place. If, as appears to be thecase, he is prevented from discharging this function, someoneelse must take the blame for perpetuating communities of tech-nically qualified fossils. As a start in the rectification of thisorganisational failure, the quality of management at the higherlevels of the Scientific Civil Service should be improved by R.51insisting that no-one should be appointed Director or Deputy
Director of a Laboratory or Institute unless he or she has had aspell of at least one year in the Departments headquarters inLondon, preferably on the administrative side. The acquisitionof administrative experience at a fairly early age is also neces-sary to enable scientists to make their proper contribution in policy-making posts at headquarters.47 Equally, there is no a priori reason why an Under-Secretary orDeputy Secretary should not become the Director of a largeGovernment Laboratory, Institute or Establishment, for a periodof years. The larger the undertaking, the less critical the Direc-tor&apos;s technical training becomes. It is administrative ability thatcounts in such cases. The unpopularity or incredulity with whichthis recommendation will be greeted by the scientific community is appreciated.48 It may be of interest to compare what is said above with theviews of the Fulton Committee about scientists and otherspecialists in the Civil Service. The Committee expressed theview that:(a) the specialist classes (architects, lawyers, doctors, engineers,scientists, accountants, economists, draughtsmen, techniciansand so on) did not get the responsibility, authority and opportunities they ought to have;(b) there should be an open road to the top of the Service forall kinds of talent and an open structure in the top manage-ment posts;(c) suitable specialists at the lower and middle levels of theService should be employed outside their own specialisation;(d) there should be greater mobility between the Civil Serviceand other employment.49 The Committee concluded that:(a) all classes should be abolished and replaced by a singleunified grading structure covering all civil servants fromtop to bottom in the non-industrial part of the Service, the correct grading of each post being determined by job evaluation;(b) specialists should receive more training in management and opportunities for greater responsibility and wider careers,e.g. in policy formulation and financial control;(c) in some of the big technical departments there might bea need for a further senior post; a Chief Scientist, engineeror other specialist.
50  The Civil Service is taking action on these matters along thefollowing lines:(a) Unified grading is to be applied to all posts of Under Sec-retary level and above and the aim is to complete this process in about six months&apos; time. A decision as to whetherunified grading should be extended down to Senior Principallevel is possible by the autumn;(b) The Administrative, Executive and Clerical Classes up toAssistant Secretary level have been amalgamated to formthe Administration Group of the new General Category;the former Economist and Statistician Classes at these levelshave been replaced by occupational groups within theGeneral Category;(c) Negotiations on mergers for the Scientific Classes and theWorks Group Classes to form two further major categoriesfor levels of Principal Scientific Officer (and equivalent) and below are well advanced;(d) Freer movement between specialisations and into general management has already been achieved. Proposals for improved career management of specialists including their development for top posts are being worked out. these include arrangements for identifying, at about Principallevel, professionals who would benefit from experience in administrative and managerial posts. Management training for specialist staff has been introduced and is beingextended.It is recommended that this action be greatly accelerated and R. 53that any problems of pay differentials which may or might, inthe future, arise should not be allowed to impede the process.The best scientists should be encouraged to gain administrativeexperience early in their careers, but satisfactory progress in thismatter will only be achieved if it attracts the full support ofMinisters and top management, including the present generation of senior scientists. It is simply not good enough to offer theopportunity with a take it or leave it attitude, which makes thescientists unwilling to risk his research career without the assur-ance that the acquisition of administrative experience will beregarded as a positive asset in a career leading to senior posts in the scientific field as well as outside it.
CHAPTER VThe so-called &apos;HaIdane Principle&apos;51 This &apos; Principle &apos; is sometimes invoked to justify the independence of applied scientists from those who may benefit from the resultsof their work. Before accepting this concept, it is worth studyingwhat the Haldane committee actually said, particularly sincemore than 50 years have elapsed since it was set up. TheHaldane Committee found that Government would, in general,be better able to formulate policy if more facts, information and research facilities were available to Government decisionmakers. Certain Government Departments, namely the Depart-ments of the Army and Navy, already benefited from such services.52 The Committee recommended that the Departments of theCentral Government should be divided according to the servicesthey rendered to the community as a whole. One such service was the provision of research and information.53  There were three different levels of Government research:(a) research done in administrative Departments;(b) research supervised by administrative Departments; and(c) research done for the use of all Departments.54  Research for general Government use had several functions:(a) to keep Ministers informed;(b) to carry out investigations in response, for example, to questions in the House of Commons (and the need forGovernment answers);(c) to make sure that the Government kept in touch withscientific workers in different parts of the country;(d) to enquire, without (sic) implementing findings; and(e) to carry out enquiries the result of which would be useful to different Departments.55 The Committee could not predict in which direction researchwould progress, but it anticipated that a separate Departmentof intelligence and research would eventually be established withits own Minister.O Report on the Machinery of Government, Com. 9230, 14.12.1918.
56 The concepts of scientific independence used in the HaldaneReport are not relevant to contemporary discussion of Govern-ment research. The Report argued that a Government research department should be administratively independent of other government Departments; but so far as the content of researchprogrammes was concerned, the committee used two distinctconcepts of Government research. First, it argued that CentralGovernment research should serve different Departments and help them in the formulation of policy, as in functions (a)-(e) inparagraph 54. These limited functions of Government researchare not controversial, either in 1918 or now. Secondly, the Reportasserted that Government research should serve the community as a whole; but, in fact, the Report mentions only such&apos; community-serving&apos; research activities as follow directly fromspecific and formulated Government policies. The specificpolicies mentioned in the Report are of great generality and little contemporary use: to promote an increase of materialproduction; to promote the health of the entire community;and to apply science to industry.57 From what is said above it is clear that there is no single&apos; Haldane Principle&apos;; but the following sentence from theHaldane Committee&apos;s Report is sometimes quoted, out ofcontext, to justify &apos; scientific independence&apos;:&apos; It (the recommended structure) places responsibility toParliament in the hands of a Minister who is . . . immune from any suspicion of being biased by administrativeconsiderations against the application of the results of research.&apos;The question of administrative independence is not central tothe customer-contractor principle; but if this sentence implies that the application of the results of research should be theresponsibility of the independent scientific Ministry, it shouldhave been unacceptable in 1918 and must be now. The furtherimplication that the objectives which require applied R &amp; D fortheir achievement should be formulated by this independentMinistry, Department, Council or Committee is, of course,entirely unrealistic. The &apos;Haldane Principle&apos; has, evidently,little or no bearing on the conduct and management of Govern-ment R &amp; D in the 70s.
CHAPTER vi the Dainton ReportThe simplest method of analysing and commenting on theDainton report is to do so by discussing each recommenda-tion. These are contained in the Summary of Conclusions and proposals, Section 57, examined below.(i) &apos; The Research Council structure with its specialist controlof a wide range of highly sophisticated activities appearsessential for the best administration and conduct of this area of Government-sponsored scientific activity in theUnited Kingdom which we consider to be of great import-ance. It has however certain disadvantages arising from alimited ability of adjustment to changing circumstances, andrequires modification (paragraphs 40, 44-46).&apos;Comment: The existence of some disadvantages in the research Council system is accepted; but this does not imply that they should be disbanded. This section doesnot take account of the fact that although the Govern-ment sponsors scientific activity, it should also pay forapplied R&amp;D.(ii) &apos; The network of responsibilities and inter-relationships ofthe Research Councils is however of such a nature that theycould not each be assigned to one uniquely appropriate department. Were each to be administered by an executivedepartment, new and complicated co-ordinating committeestructures would be necessary, which would lead to overallloss of efficiency scientifically, administratively andfinancially (paragraph 34).&apos;Comment: It is not proposed that the work of the research Councils should be assigned to the appro-priate Government Departments; but that the latter should determine and pay for certain applied R&amp;Dprogrammes undertaken, or not at present undertaken,by the Research Councils. Provided the departments in question have satisfactory Chief Scientist organisa-tions, the proposed system will not &apos; lead to overallloss of efficiency scientifically, administratively andfinancially&apos;.O The Future of the Research Council System, Report of CSP working group, 1971.
(iii) &apos; In order to retain the advantages of the Research Councilsystem, while providing for stronger links with the needs and policies of Government Departments and for the possi-bility of adjustments of responsibilities between councils and the transfer of specific activities both into and out oftheir field, we propose the replacement of the Council for scientific Policy by a new chartered body, here referred toas the Board of the Research Councils, responsible to theSecretary of State for Education and Science (para-graph 47).&apos;Comment: The proposed Board of the research councils may provide &apos; stronger links with the needs and policies of Government Departments&apos;, but this isnot the point. Government Departments must haveexecutive links with the Research Councils.(iv) &apos; This Board would consist of a Chairman, the scientificheads of the Research Councils, the President of the royal society, a University Vice-Chancellor, independent mem-bers, members from the most relevant Governmentorganisations and from the UGC and assessors from other government Departments. Under the Secretary of State itwould be responsible for financial allocations to the indi-vidual Councils, and would keep under review their broadpolicies and their range of responsibilities with the powerto make necessary modifications, although each council would be free to make and execute policies within its areaof responsibility (paragraphs 46-51).&apos;Comment: In paragraph 49 of the Report, it is statedthat &apos; the Board . . . would also be able to add to orsubtract from the number of Research Councils . . .&apos;.Later in the same paragraph it is stated that the Board&apos; should not however at any stage so reduce the numberof Research Councils that the virtues of the specialisedCouncil were lost&apos;. These statements might seem to beirreconcilable; but as the Report proposes that theindividual Councils should come under the full execu-tive control of the Board, the contradiction may not be important, because it is evident that, under the new scheme, the Research Councils would lose theirindividuality or autonomy, which is to be deprecated atthe present time.
(v) &apos; The Board would have the overall responsibility of ensuring that the requirements of Executive Departments for scientificsupport from Research Councils were being properly met,on a service or contract basis where appropriate, and by theprovision of independent and authoritative information and advice in other cases (paragraph 51).&apos;Comment: The Research Councils themselves will havethe responsibility of carrying out the requirements of executive departments. There is, therefore, no role forthe Board of the Research Councils in &apos; ensuring thatthe requirements ... were being properly met&apos;.CHAPTER vii the Chief Scientific Adviser59 In June 1971, the Chief Scientific Adviser&apos;s inherited staff con-sisted, including himself, of four physicists, two mathematicians,one engineer and one economist. If this organisation is toexercise any form of oversight of trans-departmental and trans-national science, this distribution of disciplines needs revision.There should be one chemist (preferably a physical chemist) andone life scientist within the Chief Scientific Adviser&apos;s organisa- R. 54tion. This does not imply that the staff should be proportionatelyincreased, though this could be done by secondment.Inter-departmental Co-ordination60 There is a danger that R&amp;D done by one Department may havean impact on that done elsewhere or by another Department, butthat the latter will not know about the work of the former. the avoidance of this danger is a matter for the Chief scientific adviser and implies both a knowledge of the programmes andbudgets of the principal laboratories or institutes supported bythe Departments, and of research projects which will becomeexpensive in the development phase and which may compete with, or have a bearing on, analogous projects in another department. The Advanced Passenger Train and the TrackedHovercraft projects would be a case in point, were it not for thefact that the former got to the development stage much earlier than the latter. It is recommended that such inter-departmental R. 55co-ordination  and  compilation  of  information  should  be
clearly understood to be the responsibility of the Chief scientific adviser, if this is not already the case. The successful compila-tion and co-ordination of such information also involvesknowledge of industrial R&amp;D projects. This task, of the ChiefScientific Adviser, is a major and continuing one whose success-ful prosecution will greatly improve the efficiency of government &amp; D. It is of sufficient importance to warrant a specialdirective, even if it is tacitly agreed already. r. 56Resuscitation of the Central Advisory Council for science and Technology61 Reference has been made elsewhere in this report, see, forexample, page 2, to the feeling many people have thatadvantages accrue from there being some central body whose duty is to exercise &apos; general oversight5 of Government and, even,national R &amp; D. So far as pure or fundamental research isconcerned, this oversight is exercised by the Research Councils,particularly the Science Research Council and the Council for scientific Policy. So far as applied R &amp; D is concerned, theinescapable conclusion from this report is that general oversightwould serve no useful purpose and, indeed, would negate theprinciples adumbrated in the report.62 Reference has, however, been made to the Chief scientific adviser&apos;s co-ordinating role when projects involving R &amp; D inone Department have an impact elsewhere. There is nothing to stop the Chief Scientific Adviser setting up ad hoc committees to deal with such situations or, indeed, others; and it is strongly r, 57recommended that this system be used rather than set up (in this case resuscitate) yet another scientific advisory organisation,unless events in the future make it desirable to reconsider thisquestion.Comment63 The recommendations made in this report cannot be imple-mented overnight. Many of them involve changes in attitude,orientation and procedure which will take time to accept, let alone digest. Their implementation should, therefore, bemonitored and reported on by the Chief Scientific Adviser. r. 58
APPENDIXInterpretation of Table 4DHSS-MRC(i) The interaction between the DHSS and the MRC has, sofar, been inadequate and the changes recommended inTable 4 and elsewhere are intended to rectify this deficiency. At present, although the DHSS has directresponsibilities in the field of public health, it has no share,as of right, in MRC decisions and cannot be certain ofalways being consulted about the MRCs work on nutri-tion, toxicology, vaccines and blood transfusion. The sameapplies, for example, to epidemiology and social medicine;to cancer and radiation; to ageing (on which the MRCspent  9,000 in 1970-71); to cardiovascular disease, renaldisorders and rheumatism; to endocrinology, psychiatryand psychology, neurology (special senses), and occupa-tional health. In the light of these factors a good case couldbe made for transferring to the DHSS and, where relevant,the SHHD about  11 million out of the DES total for theMRC of  22-4 million (1971-72); but in the first instance,the recommended transfer has been reduced from thisvalue to  5-6 million, Table 4, as if the changes were totake place in 1971-72. In 1972-73, the DES total for theMRC and the corresponding transfer to the DHSS will beproportionately greater and this naturally applies to other cases mentioned in this Appendix and in Table 4.MAFF-ARC(ii) The reason why it is recommended that only  14-5 million of the DES total of  18-7 million for the ARC should betransferred to the MAFF is as follows: the ARC willspend about  1-3 millionO) in 1971-72 on its Units. Mostof their work is long-term and some, for example the study of the mechanism of muscular contraction, of questionablerelevance to agriculture. This does not, of course, mean that such work is uninteresting; nor that it should not be(^This and other figures in this section have been rounded off, whichexplains minor discrepancies between them and those in Table 4.
done. Three Institutes, the Animal Breeding research organisation ( 0-6 million), the Institute of AnimalPhysiology ( 1 million), and the Letcombe Laboratory( 0-3 million) should also continue to be financed by theARC. Their programmes come into the category of what is sometimes called &apos; strategic research &quot;, i.e. research in afield of agricultural interest, but without an appliedobjective which is likely to be realised in a specified time,however long. Some observations about this type of research are made in paragraph 9 (a) Note, on page 5. the soil Survey of England and Wales ( 0-2 million) shouldcontinue to be financed by the ARC pending the results ofa study, which it is recommended should be made, of its R. 59relationship with the work of NERC in general, the institute of Geological Sciences and the ExperimentalCartography Unit in particular, and with the Departmentof the Environment. Such a study would, it is hoped, lead,inter alia, to organisational recommendations.(iii) A proportion of the work of the John Innes Institute( 0-2 million) and of Rothamsted Experimental Station( 0-5 million) should continue to be paid for by the ARCbecause these amounts fall in the basic or strategic researchcategory.DOE, DTI, MAFF-NERC(iv) The recommendations affecting the NERC are slighty more complicated than those relating to the MRC andARC, because of the heterogeneity of the subjectsembraced by NERC. But the recommendations are in no sense intrinsically complicated provided attention is paidto the customer-contractor principle and the concept of themultifunctional laboratory or institute.(v) The NERC programme is divided into work related to the earth, the Oceans and Seas, Inland Waters and the countryside. To give an example as to how the NERCfinancial transfers recommended in Table 4 were arrivedat, two items from NERCs Earth programme are mentioned immediately below, with comments:&quot;Mineral Resources: To undertake scientific recon-naissance and assess the potential of mineral deposits.&apos;
Comment: The DTI is the sponsoring Depart-ment for the minerals industry (except sand andgravel). It also has a statutory responsibility forall mineral extraction.&apos; Underground Water: To determine ground-waterconditions and evaluate underground water resources,including underground storage and transport.&apos;Comment: The DOE is the sponsoring Depart-ment for the water industry.The Oceans and Seas provide a different example:&apos;Biological Resources of the Sea: To study trans-mission through food chains to useable resources offish, shellfish and sea mammals; optimum conditions for growth and nutrition.&apos;Comment: This work should be sponsored bythe MAFF and/or DAFS.Inland Waters contains such projects as &apos; Water balanceof catchments &apos;, &apos; River regimes &apos; and &apos; Pollution of inlandwaters&apos;, which should be paid for by the DOE. Excep-tionally, the Institute of Hydrology should be physically r. 60transferred, together with its staff, to the DOE, where itshould be fused with the DOE&apos;s contiguous HydraulicResearch Station. The whole of the Countryside pro-gramme should be financed by the DOE, which explainswhy the Nature Conservancy (excluding basic ecologicalresearch ( 0 - 25 million)) should be paid for by thisDepartment.Tolerances on the recommendations in Table 4(vi) Some flexibility, but not too much, is desirable in the implementation of the financial recommendations inTable 4. This flexibility should take the form of a plus or r, 61minus 15 per cent tolerance on the transfer figures in this table. But it is as well to be quite clear what this does and does not mean. Plus or minus 15 per cent has nothing todo with the standard errors or standard deviations instatistical calculations. The meaning of the phrase is bestillustrated by the following example: suppose that, atpresent, the DES pays an imaginary Research Council 25 million per year and it is recommended that, in
1972-73, the DES should pay this Research Council 5 million per year, the rest,  20 million, being paid by department X. This can be represented as follows:Research Council DESTotal25 5 ^20%)If a tolerance of plus 15% is applied to the DES, thefigures become:Research Council DESTotal25 5-75because 15% of 5=0-75 and 5+0-75=5-75.A tolerance of plus 15 % does not mean:Research Council DESTotal25 8-75 (i.e. 20% + lS0/^35% of 25)It is recommended that the Chief Scientific Adviser should discuss with those concerned the proposals in Table 4together with the tolerances advised above, and make recommendations on their implementation to ministers collectively within three months, it being understood thatthe maximum change in the proposed transfer of  27-7 million will be 4-  4-1 million.(vii) It is hardly necessary to say that undue attention to minutedetail in the interests of exact quantification will prejudice the implementation of the customer-contractor principle.By the same token, an alleged inability to break down afield of work into individual projects which can be separately defined and costed in relation to specific usersis often indicative of imprecise thinking or avoidancetactics.(viii) Reference was made, in paragraph 8, page 4, to the DESestimate of the amount of applied R&amp;D done by theMRC, ARC and NERC. If financial responsibility forthis estimate were transferred to the appropriate Depart-ments,  29-9 million would be transferred from the DESvote to those of the Departments. In the event, the amountrecommended for transfer in this report is  27-7 million.
