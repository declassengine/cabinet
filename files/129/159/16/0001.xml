IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(71) 11619 October 1971COPY NOCABINETSTATUTORY LOCAL. AUTHORITY COMMITTEESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The legislation to reorganise local government in England and wales will be introduced at the beginning of the coming Session.    A point has arisen on which the Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the environment (RE) have been unable to reach agreement, and as it is likelyto be politically controversial we ask the Cabinet for a decision.background. In our White Paper &quot;Local Government in England: government proposals for Reorganisation&quot; (Cmnd 4584) we stressed the importance of sound management in local government, and said that we would re-examinethe present controls affecting the internal organisation of local authoritiesand the way they administered their statutory services, so as to give them the maximum discretion to take their own decisions within national policies.This review has covered, inter alia, the various statutory requirements which oblige local authorities to appoint separate committees for particularfunctions, and deny them the freedom to settle their own internalorganisation in whatever way they themselves find most efficient and economical.3. It has already been agreed that statutory committees should nolonger be required for finance, allotments, health, youth, employment andanimal diseases.    Statutory committees for police and for national parkswill still be needed because they have members appointed from outsidelocal government.    But we are not agreed about the statutory committees for social services and for education.SOCIAL SERVICES committee .        Under the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, whichimplemented the recommendations of the Seebohm Committee and which wesupported in Opposition, local authorities are now required to appointl separate committees for social services.    This new statutory requirement\1
was felt necessary to protect and establish a newly integrated service, butit was acknowledged that once the service had come to be fully established and accepted as a matter of course, the requirement might be reviewed.5. Some members of RE argued that the retention of statutorycommittees for the social services and for education might not only leadto pressure to retain statutory committees for other services, but would very substantially weaken the credibility of our promises about greaterindependence for local authorities.    The local authority associations had strongly opposed the inclusion in the 1970 Act of the additional requirement for a social services committee, and they now regarded our attitude to itsretention as a test of the genuineness of our expressed intention to allowlocal authorities to settle their own internal organisation.    While someof us who took this view would prefer outright abolition of the statutory requirements in 1974 as part of reorganisation, it was argued that even ifthe requirement for a social services committee was carried over into thenew system for the protection of the newly integrated service, a clearterminal date for its expiration should be fixed in the Bill.    A terminaldate of (say) 1981 would leave at least 10 clear years for the service tobecome established whereas an indefinite assurance of future review wouldbe regarded as no better than the similar assurances given by our predecessors.6. Other members of the Committee felt that a commitment to aterminal date, so soon after the requirement had been brought into force by the present Government, would be seen as undermining the basis onwhich the new service was being built, even if the terminal date itself was some way off.    Those local authorities who were still hostile to theSeebohm reforms would feel encouraged to drag their feet.    The morale of the professional staff would be severely damaged and the more abledirectors of social services would not seek re-appointment in the new localauthorities.    Similarly the committees would tend to be weak.    Localauthority social services were working in an unglamorous field, but were responsible for serving the poorest and most vulnerable members of thecommunity.    They had been given important new functions in the care ofchildren who previously would have been committed to approved schools,and we would be relying on them to implement our policies for helping the disabled.    Any action which could be interpreted as a weakening in support for the Seebohm reforms would be heavily criticised as evidence that we did not care about the under--privileged.    In continuing the statutoryrequirement, we could of course still say in general terms - withoutmentioning a specific date - that it would be reviewed whenever the services were well enough established to make it superfluous.    If the Bill were to mention a particular date, it should only be to say that the situation should then be reviewed.2
EDUCATION COMMITTEES7. In contrast, education committees are strong and well-established.It has been argued that the education service should by now be strong enough not to need the protection of a statutory committee.    On the otherhand, the present committees have members drawn from outside localgovernment (teachers and representatives of the churches, who have animportant stake in the system) and it is feared that this breadth of representation might be jeopardised if the statutory requirement were abandoned.    The Association of Education Committees and the NationalUnion of Teachers have already publicly expressed their strong oppositionto any change in the statutory requirement.    While the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science would reluctantly agree to abolish it in the context of a general removal of such requirements, RE accepted that itcould not be abolished so long as social services committees were stillobligatory.    Effectively, therefore, the treatment of educationcommittees in the Bill must follow the decision on social servicescommittees.conclusion. There is a real dilemma here v/hich cannot be avoided.    Onedecision will risk us criticism from the local authority associations for notliving up to our promises to give more freedom to local government; theother will invite the criticisms that we do not care about the poor and the under-privileged and that we are giving a low priority to education.    invite my colleagues to decide whether the forthcoming legislation -a. Should continue for an indefinite period the requirementon local authorities to appoint separate committees for social services and for education; orb. should provide for a defined terminal date without theneed for further legislation;  such a date might be 1981, withthe possibility of an extension by Order for a further limited period of (say) three years.R m home Office18 October 19713
