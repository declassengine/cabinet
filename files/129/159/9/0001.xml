UPPER CLYDE SHIPBUILDERSMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry the Statement in Parliament on 29th July said that if the Governmentwas to support a new shipbuilding enterprise on the Upper Clyde, theremust be satisfactory undertakings by the unions on working practices andwage rates.    However no negotiations have started on this because the shop stewards are demanding assurances that all four UCS yards would bekept in operation.   Mr. McGarvey of the Confederation of shipbuilding and Engineering Unions has been as helpful as possible but has madelittle progress in persuading the workers to drop this demand.2.    Mr. Stenhouse, Chairman of Govan- Shipbuilders Ltd. suggested that a study be made of retaining Scotstoun as well as the Govan and Linthouseyards.   A compromise on these lines - provided it did not prejudice the viability of the enterprise - seems to offer the only possibility of resolving the impasse, and I think Mr. McGarvey will make a real effort to sell this to the workers.    I believe therefore that we ought not finally to exclude the possibility of including Scotstoun.3.     The study now being made of Govan and Linthouse can be extended tocover Scotstoun.    If it showed that its inclusion would prejudice the viability of Govan/Linthouse clearly we should not include it.    But ifwe were satisfied that, despite the possible need for additional capital,a three yard solution could be viable, it would be almost impossible todefend a refusal to Include it.4-.    Mr. Stenhouse sees no feasible proposition for the fourth yardat Clydebank.    There is therefore no question of including that; andin the absence of any firm proposals from private interests the unionscan be given no assurance about continued employment there.Mr. McGarvey is hoping to see the Liquidator and Mr. Gilchrist of GovanShipbuilders at the weekend and I am seeing him again on 12 Octoberwhen it should be clear whether there is any prospect of the shop stewards dropping their demand for preservation of all four yards.5.    Meanwhile we are encountering increasing problems in keeping the yards operating.   We have been obliged to consider five forms ofspecial assistance:-(i)   refund guarantees* on three ships at Clydebank and one at Scotstoun;(ii)   an extra-statutory credit guarantee on one ship at Govan;*A guarantee that if a ship is not completed, progress payments made during construction will be refunded by the Government.
(iii) a refund guarant.ee, and a cost subsidy estimated at  Jm, tothe Brazilian Government on a dredger under construction atGovan;(iv) refund guarantees, and cost subsidies likely to total  2m - Am, to Irish Shipping Ltd. on four ships due to be started at Govan;(v)   an increase of  2m in working capital to the Liquidatormaking a total of  6m.Hie first two have been approved but there are serious problems with theremaining three.6.    The Brazilians and Irish Shipping have refused to modify their demands for guarantees and subsidies.   Subsidies are sought because theships cannot be completed at a cost equal to the balance of theoriginal contract price.y.    Current contracts will keep Clydebank and Scotstoun going withoutany serious increase in redundancies until about Christmas.   But unless we can reach quick agreement with the owners, the Liquidator will haveto stop work on the dredger and be unable to start work on the Irishships.   This will mean over 800 more redundancies at Govan/Lint housewithin two to three weeks, and could well lead to industrial actionwhich would make it impossible to keep any yards going.8.    Giving the necessary guarantees and promises of subsidies will have serious repercussions and create embarrassing precedents.   There eouldbe repercussions on other contracts where the shipowners have agreed topay extra without any subsidy.    It is impossible to estimate the totalcost.   The subsidies alone would probably cost  2-Jm -  4-Jni.    The refundguarantees would involve a contingent liability of the order of  15m - 20m.   None of this is covered by existing statutory powers and a full statement will have to be made to Parliament at the earliest possible opportunity.9.    There is also a problem about working capital.   Before theLiquidator can accept a further loan he needs the approval of UCS&apos; ssecured creditors, - the banks and the SIB.    The banks, who are likely in any event to be repaid in full, have agreed.   The SIB, however, whoare the second secured creditors, have refused consent on the grounds that their financial position is likely to be prejudiced if theLiquidator keeps the yards operating.   Unless the Liquidator receivesfurther working capital he may be unable to pay the wages within two to three weeks.   We may therefore have to provide funds to the Liquidatorin the form of a subordinated loan or an outright grant.10.   Although ES Committee agreed (on 21 September) that further financial guarantees and working capital from the Government might berequired to enable the Liquidator to maintain the work force in beingwhile the future arrangements were being worked out, it is now clearthat what is involved is virtually an open-ended commitment for possiblyno more than a short-term benefit.   If we agreed to all the measures referred to above, almost all the present 7,500 Jobs in the yards shouldbe retained for about two to three months but there would then be a rapid fall unless the future of all four yards had by then been secured.If Govan Shipbuilders goes ahead, some part of the requested subsidieswill be needed anyway if the company is not to start with a legacy ofunprofitable contracts.   However, it would be much easier to justifythis after it has started operating than in the present period of uncertainty, with no assurance that the objective will be achieved./Yl .
II.   On any normal criteria it does not seem possible to justifyaccepting these further onerous financial commitments.    To do so willgive rise to strong parliamentary criticism and the position of myDepartment&apos;s accounting officer could be very difficult.    The onlyjustification would &quot;be the social and industrial repercussions there might otherwise be in Scotland, and the damage (probably fatal) to theprospect of achieving a   declared objective of re-establishing viablemerchant shipbuilding on the Upper Clyde.    These considerations in my view are sufficiently important to justify, despite the objections,accepting these further commitments provided, and only provided, that my next meeting with Mr McGarvey on 12th October has given a real and positive prospect that the unions will start meaningful negotiationswith Govan Shipbuilders Ltd.12.   I seek the agreement of my colleagues to:-(i)   the extension of the remit of Govan Shipbuilders Ltd. toinclude Scotstoun, provided we are satisfied that a three-yard solution could.be viable, and subject to the other conditions we have already laid down;(ii)   the acceptance of the further financial commitments(guarantees, subsidies and working capital) subject to theimportant proviso in paragraph T1.J.
