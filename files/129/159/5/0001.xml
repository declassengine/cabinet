DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(71) 105 COPY NO    631 October 1971CABINETPRESENTATION OF CIVIL SERVICE MANPOWER FIGURESMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal. I undertook at Cabinet on 27 July (CM(7l) 41st Conclusions,Minute 2) to make proposals for a new system of presenting manpowerrequirements.    I am grateful for the co-operation and help which departments have given in formulating the proposals outlined in this paper and its Annexes, which I ask the Cabinet to note.2. I would propose in the future to publish more information aboutthe range of activities of Government staff.    This would give a moremeaningful basis for discussion than the artificial figure of the totalnumber of non-industrial civil servants on which discussion and criticismat present tends to concentrate.    Our new method of presentation will show the variety of functions which the Civil Service discharges.    It will make itclear that only a minority of civil servants are employed on headquarterswork in support of Ministers, many more being engaged on executive workthroughout the country providing services the need for which is generally accepted.    We shall cease to distinguish in presentation between non-industrial and industrial civil servants, many of whom are engagedtogether on common tasks, and thus remove the artificial barrier toreclassification from one category to the other.    An advantage of thenew method of presentation is that those who demand reductions in staff will find it harder to press their criticism without specifying the activities which they are willing to see reduced.3. We shall doubtless be accused of attempting by these changes inmethods of presentation to obscure the fact that we have failed to implement our pledge to reduce the numbers of non-industrial civilservants.    We cannot refuse, for a time at least, to give the numberson the old basis if we are asked for them.    We can, however, justly argue that our intention is to give more information about staffing and to encouragebetter informed criticism.    The changes are in sympathy with the improvements in methods of decision making on public expenditurein that they turn attention to the purposes for which staff are employedinstead of confining debate to crude totals.
4. I propose to introduce the new methods of presentation in three stages: first by arranged written Questions in both Houses early in thenew Session, the answers to which will include an announcement that information about staff numbers will be collected centrally, and published,quarterly in future, instead of monthly as hitherto;  secondly, by a fullexplanation in the proposed Y/hite Paper on the Activities of Governmentwhich we hope to publish before the end of the year; and thirdly bychanging the form of the information about staffing which has been givenin support of the Estimates in the Chief Secretary&apos;s memorandum.    TheChief Secretary has agreed to join me in the necessary approach to theExpenditure Committee to seek their agreement to changing the form ofhis memorandum,5,        Annex A contains the tabulations which would be used in theproposed White Paper and also in substitution for Tables XII and XLTI ofthe Chief Secretary&apos;s memorandum,    Annex 3 contains the tabulationsto be used in the replies to Parliamentary Questions.    These would alsobe the basis for the quarterly figures published in the Monthly Digest of statistics.    The analyses in these Annexes provide a basis on which tointroduce the new form of presentation but leave scope for development and refinement which can be examined further by officials.6. These changes do not diminish the need for the greatest stringencyin the use of manpower, or for the continuation of the search foreconomies by reducing activity.    The existing system of manpowercontrol will continue unchanged, at least until the effect of the new methods of presentation is known.7. I ask my colleagues to note that I pi*opose:1.       to publish information on the lines of Annex B in reply toarranged Questions in both Houses;2.      to join the Chief Secretary in an approach to the expenditure committee about the substitution of tables on the lines of Annex Afor Tables XII and XIII of the Chief Secretary^ memorandum;3.      to include an explanation of these changes in the proposed white Paper on the Activities of Government.I shall be grateful if any comment on these proposals could be sent to mewithin ten days.J civil  Service department October 19712
