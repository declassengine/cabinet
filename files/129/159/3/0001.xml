THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(71) 10327 September 1971za: ins public EXPENDITURE review memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. The Cabinet has decided as a matter of policy(CM(71) 34th Conclusions, Minute 2) to aim for public expenditure totals asfollows:  million at 1971 Survey prices1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-7623,600 23,900 24,250 24,550 24,950(The figures for 1972-73 and 1973-74 are  25 million higher than in cp(71) 68 in order to provide for expenditure on housing improvement grants, envisaged but not quantified In that paper, as part of the measures for relief of unemployment).    Accordingly, I was invited(CM(7l) 40th Conclusions, Minute 6, Conclusion 2) to arrange for an inter-departmental study of the means by which certain outstanding proposals for additional public expenditure might be matched by reductions (Table 1,parts (l) and (2)).2. Officials have been able to identify and agree a large number of reductions in this review which would cover the reserved items (see Table 1,part (1); Table 2, line 10; and Table 3).3. But if the proposals for overseas aid, defence and steel, togetherwith the proposal for a Regional Development Agency which has been madesince the Cabinefs discussions in July, were accepted, the total would exceed the available room (see Table 2, line 12) by:  million at 1971 Survey prices1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-767 96 138 127 2541COPY NO    I)
4. In the Cabinefs previous discussion (CM(71) 40th Conclusions,Minute 6) it was accepted that the overseas aid programme should not be adjusted to conform with each revised forecast of gross national product,but that the review should cover the problem that the aid programme is nowlikely to represent a significantly lower proportion of gross national product in 1972-73 than was previously planned.    If we are to avoid sucha drop,  9 million (at constant 1971 Survey prices) would need to be addedto 1972-73.    For 1975-76, I have already proposed in my July report adding 8 million, which would continue the rising rate of expansion of this programme.5.        For the rest, the Chancellor has already proposed that theadditional bids for defence should be rejected.    If these bids were accepted&apos;,we should have to put together a package of offsetting cuts, including savings in, for example, the road programme, education and social security.    Itwould also be very difficult to accept the proposals for health, etc. whichthe Cabinet reserved (see Table 1, part (l)).    It would be extremelydifficult now to put together a package of cuts of this sort, and I do not recommend that we should try to do so.6. We should also ease our problem to some extent if we were to revert, as soon as price restraint allows, to the charging policies whichwe announced in Cmnd 4515 (see Table 2, line 7 for the loss of prescription charges if these are not raised).    The Cabinet envisaged further discussion on prescription charges this autumn (CM(71) 38th Conclusions, Minute 6).In the circumstances they may wish to resume consideration of the HealthMinisters1 proposals (CP(71) 83), and also to invite the Education ministers to circulate a paper on moving towards the Cmnd 4515 objective of covering the running cost of school meals.7. The measures In paragraphs 4-6 above contain public expenditureexcepting the proposed increase in steel investment, within the Cabinettotals - as shown in Table 6, line 6.    But the great bulk of the steel bidis left outstanding (Table 6, lines 7 and 8).    Normally other programmes would have to be cut in order to accommodate it.    I suggest, however,that we should consider running a risk on this.    The estimate for steelitself has been much reduced in the review (see Table 1, line 8), though the revised figure remains provisional; it could move again perhaps upwards,perhaps downwards.    Subject to similar uncertainty, there is a possibilityof the housing investment programme in the later years of the period beingfairly substantially underspent.    Taking these points together, I mustadvise my colleagues that the most likely outcome is for the totals of public expenditure to be somewhat above the Cabinet totals.    The medium term economic prospect appears marginally, but not significantly, less difficult.This reduces the risk that we shall be taking and In these circumstances itseems difficult to ask my colleagues to consider major policy changes atthis stage in order to be sure of accommodating steel completely.2
Secret;8, But such changes will almost certainly be required if further substantial additions to public expenditure are to be accepted without increasing to an unacceptable level the risk we are already taking.    Evenwithout any additions, if my colleagues agree with this course, we shall need more than ever to take every opportunity that we can make in future to secure savings, and refrain from spending them.    We shall also need to keep the contingency reserve for unforeseen expenditures which are not simply desirable but inescapable.    We shall need to study separately how the programme can be rephased to provide more room for manoeuvre for1973-74.9.        With the essential provisos in the preceding paragraph I would recommend my colleagues -1. to accept the proposals for health, education, legal aid and voluntary social services as identified in their previous discussion - see Table 1, part (1);2.        to limit the additional provision for increased overseas aid to the figures proposed in paragraph 4j3.        to reject the additional proposals for defence?4.        not at this stage to seek further to offset the additional requirements for steel by changes in existing policies;5.        to invite proposals for increased charges as in paragraph 6.M treasury Chambers24 September 19713SEfcRST
