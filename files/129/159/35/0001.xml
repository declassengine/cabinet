\S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS government cp(71) 135 COPY NO15 November 1971CABINETACCELERATION OF INDUSTRIAL expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. On 19 October I was invited, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to arrange for an examination of certain proposalsfor additional defence expenditure together with other possible proposalsfor additional civil expenditure, which might relieve unemployment by taking up under-used industrial capacity.    I now enclose a detailed noteby officials on these questions.CIVIL EXPENDITURE2. The relevant civil programmes consist mainly of capital expenditure by the nationalised industries, with smaller amounts of expenditure ondepartmental activities.    All these proposals are designed to provide workover the next two years, with the emphasis on jobs in the areas ofparticularly high unemployment, without entailing continuing expenditurein subsequent years.    The largest single project is a power station atInce in Cheshire, which would be ordered before the end of this year, oneto two years earlier than would otherwise happen.   If the acceleration isreckoned as two years, the expenditure brought forward into 1972-73 and1973-74 might be about  40 million.   Other capital works which it isproposed to bring forward include transmission work by the electricity boards, pipelines for the nationalised gas industry, capital expenditureof the Coal Board, minor Post Office schemes, rolling stock providingwork for railway workshops, and new ferries for British Railways and theScottish Transport Group.    The total civil expenditure involved, and itsestimated direct employment effects in terms either of new jobs orredundancies averted or short-time working reduced, is as follows -1971-72      1972-73       1973-74 TotalExpenditure  2 m.  57 m.         51 m.         110 m.Employment 12,000        9,3003. These figures include  12 million to be brought forward by london transport for new trains for the Northern Line, which will avert thedanger of closure of a Metropolitan-Cammell factory.    Because of theneed for immediate decisions on the tenders, the Chief Secretary hasalready agreed with the other Ministers concerned that this work should bebrought forward with 75 per cent infrastructure grant.1
4. The figures do not include Government payments required to anumber of the nationalised industries to offset the extra costs to them ofthe acceleration.    Legislative provision will be needed where the sumsare large, but this should not involve any Bills solely for this purpose.The amount payable for acceleration of the power station could be much larger than was originally anticipated, and an acceptable formula must besettled before a decision can be announced.    Negotiations on this are inprogress.    Subject to a satisfactory outcome on this, I support all theproposals affecting civil programmes.DEFENCE expenditure . The additional defence expenditure at issue and the estimateddirect employment effects - which do not, however, allow for a possiblysubstantial reduction in short-time working, are as follows -1972-73      1973-74      1974-75     -fr^T    Total-----     and later  -Expenditure      4.7 m.       11.8 m.  16.0 m.     10.0 m.  42.5 m.Employment      800 1,800       1,6006. About  4. 5 million of this, over the next three years, for runwayrepair vehicles and Bulldog aircraft, would satisfy much the samecriteria as the civil proposals.    But most of the proposed  33 million forNimrod ft would come after 1973-74 and spread up to 1975-76 or later, and half of the proposed  5 million for Army reconnaissancevehicles would be after 1973-74 and the employment would be mostly in areas where in normal times demand for labour is high;  although theimmediate contribution to employment would be useful, I do not think thatthis would justify us in giving these proposals priority over other potentialclaims on public expenditure in the later years.CONCLUSIONS7. I recommend, therefore, that we should -a. approve the proposals to bring forward civil expenditure upto about  110 million in the next two years, on the basis that powers would be taken as needed to pay compensation to the nationalised industries concerned, subject to prior settlement ofan agreed formula for compensation relating to the power station;b. be prepared to consider further proposals which may come forward in the near future if they satisfy the same cr .Seria;c. approve additional defence expenditure of  4. 5 million forrunway repair vehicles and Bulldog aircraft;d. accept that there are strong objections to the further expenditure which would be involved in later years for the Nimrodaircraft and Army reconnaissance vehicles;e. agree to an early announcement of the whole package.A treasury Chambers15 November 1971 2
ANNEXACCELERATION OF INDUSTRIAL expenditure note BY officials on 19 October the Cabinet invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in consultation with other Ministers concerned, to arrange for officials to examine proposals to order 8 additional Nimrod aircraft and to bring forward orders for Army vehicles, together with other possible proposals for additional expenditure in civil programmes which might serve to relieve unemployment by taking up under-usedindustrial capacity.    (CM(71)50th Conclusions, Minute 1, conclusion 2)2.     This examination has been carried out under Treasury chairmanshipand with representatives from Defence, Trade and Industry, EnvironmentPosts and Telecommunications, the Scottish and Welsh Offices,Employment, CPRS and Cabinet Office.3.     Three new programmes intended to generate employment in development and intermediate areas have already been approved:-i.  162 million on infrastructure, of which  59 million is estimated to fall in 1971-72 and  100 million in1972-73;ii.  55 million on house improvement grants, including 9 million in 1971-72 and  25 million in 1972-73;    and.  79 million up to 1975-76 on naval shipbuilding, ofwhich  3 million in 1971-72 and  31 million in 1972-73.The first two of these programmes were drawn up so that the weightof expenditure will fall in 1971-72 and 1972-75, when there will beslack in the economy, with smaller amounts spilling over beyond1972-73.    The naval shipbuilding programme will continue at a significant level up to 1975-76; this decision&apos; took account of thespecial problems of the shipbuilding industry, which is concentrated in development areas.
4.     In this exercise also, on the assumption that unemploymentnationally will remain high at least through 1972, we have set out to identify projects which could be started quickly so as to createemployment or avoid redundancies over the next two years, but which,while creating claims on resources during this period, would thereafternot entail large continuing public expenditure at a time when wecannot assume that there will be much room for manoeuvre in public expenditure as a whole,    However, given the later starting of thisexercise a substantial spill-over beyond 1972-73 is unavoidable.Moreover, although the present remit, unlike the programmes referredto above, is not confined to the development and intermediate areas,we have assumed that expenditure giving rise to employment in those areas should be looked at more favourably even if it continues beyondthe next couple of years.    This approach, incidentally, correspondsquite well with the line taken by a CBI deputation to Ministers, whenthey expressed the view that enough had been done at the present time by way of general reflation, but that there was a short-term need forfurther measures to reduce unemployment and a longer-term need forfurther action in the development areas.5.   &apos; The proposals which have to be considered in relation to thesecriteria are summarised in Annex A and discussed in the following paragraphs.    The additional expenditure involved can be summarisedas follows:-  million1971-72     1972-73     1973-74    After 1973-74Civil programmes 2 57 51 -Defence expenditure - 5 12 266.     As regards the civil programmes, the employment figures givenin connection with individual cases refer as much to redundancies orto a reduction in short-time working as to new jobs which could be created.    In some cases they are little more than guesswork.    Onthis basis the number of jobs involved (which for the reasons given above does not necessarily mean an equivalent reduction in unemployment)is estimated as follows 
1972-73 1973-7412,000 9.300These figures, which do not allow for multiplier effects, imply a cost-per-job of roughly  5*000 a year - a figure in line with thatassumed for the new construction element in the infrastructureprogramme.7.     The employment effects of the defence expenditure are estimated as follows1972-73        1973-74        1974-75800 1,800 1,600Most of this employment would be an addition to the workforce employeda smaller part would mean redundancies averted.   On this basis thefigures, again excluding multiplier effects, imply a cost-per-job ofroughly  10,000 a year.    In addition, it is believed that there wouldbe a consequent reduction in short-time working which might increasethe employment effect by half as much again to give a cost-per-job ofabout  7,000 a year.8.     This report has been prepared with time for only limitedconsultation with the nationalised industries.    Some details maychange.    Some new proposals may come forward in the near future andwe recommend that they should not be ruled out.Nationalised Industries9.     The approach adopted towards the nationalised industries has been to try to identify projects which satisfy their normal commercialinvestment criteria and which, if accelerated, will not require any-special subsidy from.the Government except in respect of the extrainterest and possibly depreciation costs incurred through the earlierphasing of these schemes.    In all cases where this requires the nationalised industries to incur expenditure earlier than would be justifiable on a commercial basis, it will probably be necessary tomake grant payments to them to offset these extra charges.   Where the3
amounts are substantial, it will be appropriate to take specific powers for the payments when opportunity occurs in legislation relating to each of the industries;  the implications of this are discussed further in paragraphs 25 to 27.    These payments will be over and above any financial assistance which may be settled to offset the effects on the nationalised industries of the application to them of the policy of price restraint.A d d i 11on a1 Power St a t i on10.    This is the largest single project and the one in respect of whichthe problem of compensation (possibly involving up to  20 million)  isthe most difficult.   An agreed formula for settling the eventualfigure, though not the figure itself, must be determined before adecision can be announced.    At the date of this report the formula was still under negotiation.    The problem is discussed in Annex B.11.    The CEGB and Reyrolle Parsons, who would stand to get the order for the main electrical plant, worth about  20 million, have been told that the Government is considering the bringing forward of a power station and will announce the decision shortly.   Reyrolle Parsons have said that, unless they can get a power plant order very soon, further-substantial redundancies will have to be declared in the north-east.The CEGB are read&apos; to place an order before the end of 1971? subject toprior assurances to them and the Electricity Council on the compensationissue.    In this period any new power station must be of a conventionalcharacter which in practice means that it would be the oil-fired power station already planned for Ince in Cheshire.    (It could not be a nuclear power station because it will be some months before a decision can be taken on the reactor system to be used).    The total cost of the project would be of the order of  100 million.    The figures ofexpenditure in the next two years, which is not already allowed for inthe public expenditure forecasts,and the employment involved would be:-There is, however, as explained in Annex B, a problem as to how muchof this expenditure should be attributed to the present decision^Expenditure brought forward ( in)Additional employment1972-73153,000   *1973-74275,0004
Fuel Industries:    Other Proposals12.     The Area Electricity Boards in England and Wales and theScottish Electricity Boards could bring forward  13-5 million of expenditure, mainly transmission work,  into 1972-73 and  5.4 millioninto 1973-74.    A significant proportion of this expenditure should help to take up under-utilised industrial capacity in areas of high unemployment.13.     The gas industry could bring forward  3.7 million ofexpenditure into 1972-73 and  5.7 million into 1973-74.    This wouldbe work on pipelines;  buildings etc.    The pipe would be manufactured in Hartlepools whilst the other expenditure would be incurred onprojects all over the country.14.     The Coal Board could bring forward  7 million of capital worksinto 1972-73? about three-quarters sited in assisted areas.Post Office15.     The bulk of the Post Office&apos;s capital expenditure, relates totelecommunications.    They propose to increase their expenditure onminor schemes by  2 million in 1971-72 and  6.9 million in 1972-73;no compensation should be involved.16.     As regards the possibility of a major acceleration of their investment programme in telephone exchanges,  there is a separateissue here as to the scope for matching the supply of telephoneservices with demand, which only partly overlaps with this exercise :on the reduction of unemployment.    The Chairman of the Post office has put in hand a fundamental examination;    meanwhile the DTI (in association with the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications)  isinvestigating manufacturers&apos;  claims to have spare capacity;    theresults should be available shortly and will be reported to the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy by the Minister of posts and Telecommunications in accordance with his remit from the Committee(EPC(7i)  27th Meeting, Minute  1).
Surface Transport Industries17.      The British Railways Board could probably bring forward thebuilding of rolling stock for use on the Southern and Eastern Regionscommuter lines into London.    The cost would amount to  4.7 million in 1972-73.    This would avert about 400 redundancies at the Board&apos;sworkshops at York and generate extra employment of about 300 by mainsubcontractors,  chiefly in the north-west.    The Board are also willingto bring forward orders for new ferries at a total cost of 0.7 million in 1972-73.    Employment for 350 men would be generated,probably on Tyneside.18.      The Scottish Transport Group could also bring forward an order for a new ferry at a total cost of  0.3 million in 1972-73 and 0,2 million in 1973-74.    This expenditure would probably not produce any significant increase in the Group&apos;s previously projectedexpenditure over, the next 24 months but would avoid a shortfall..1.9.     There is no scope for increasing investment in buses since the manufacturers&apos; order books are already full.    The Government recently announced an increase in bus grants, which has had the effect of preventing the cancellation of orders which would otherwise havetaken place.London Transport20.      London Transport recently put to the DOE and GLC a proposalto bring forward an order for new trains to be used to replace oldstock on the Northern Line.    This would avert redundancies of about500 at the Metropolitan-Cammell factory in Birmingham and the cost would be  2.7 million in 1972-73 and  9.2 million in 1973-74.    Itwould also ensure that Metropolitan-Cammell would have the capacity to meet a further, larger, order of new trains for the PiccadillyLine which would otherwise be placed with a French firm.   A decisionon Government assistance for this proposal, could not wait for theconsideration of this paper because of the expiry of the French tenderon .14 November,   With the agreement of the Chief Secretary, therefore,the proposal was approved and the GLC have now confirmed that bothorders will be placed with Metropolitan-Cammell.    The schemes willqualify for 75% infrastructure grant.6  I
Steel21.      Because of the exceptional problems relating to the investment plans of the British Steel Corporation they have not been consulted about the scope for bringing investment forward.    Their rate of investment has already been steeply scaled up and their provisionalestimates currently envisage a continuing level of expenditure ofabout  255 million a year (at March 1971 price levels).    In additionthey have put forward proposals for a major new development but thisis not. so far backed up with an adequate plan or investment appraisal.It is also difficult to assess how much of either their existing or their proposed investment will be commercially viable and how far -even apart from the effects of the policy of price restraint - it wouldhave to rely on subsidisation on grounds of the national interest.All this is the subject of a top level review between the Governmentand the Corporation.    It is virtually impossible, when theCorporation^ plans are in such a state of flux,  to contemplate any major acceleration within the scope of this exercise, but there maybe a little scope for them to speed up existing approved expenditureor to bring forward some minor projects which would not prejudice the outcome of the current review.    In the light of the Government&apos;general policy it would be appropriate to consult the corporation on these possibilities when recommendations are being put forward on investment approval for 1972-73.Other Expenditure22.     A number of minor projects could be brought forward whichsatisfy the general criteria adopted towards the projects discussedabove.    In total the expenditure involved amounts to  2.8 million in 1972-73 and  4.0 million in 1973-74.    Details are included in annex A.    .Investment Grants23.     A proposal has been put forward for an acceleration of residualpayments to industry arising from the former investment grants scheme.This would mean bringing forward into 1971-72 and 1972-73 an estimated  10 million and  15 million respectively of expenditure which would otherwise arise in later years.     This would not provide an additional investment incentive,  but would help company
liquidity.    This proposal is being considered separately but,if it is agreed between Treasury and DTI Ministers,  it could with advantage be announced along with the proposals in this report.Defence24.     Of the following four possible defence projects the first two were before the Cabinet on 19 October and the third and fourthhave been added subsequently.i,      Nimrods.     The Ministry of Defence consider that anadditional 8 Nimrod aircraft for the Royal Air Force wouldprovide a valuable increase of one third in the UK-Abasedmaritime reconnaissance force and would thus help tosatisfy NATO requests for improvements in this field.The new aircraft would cost  33 million of which  22 million would be spent after 1973-74.    It would be necessary tore-establish the production line but there would be some immediate job impact (200 or more jobs by March 1972 atHawker Siddeley&apos;s Chester factory),  and a further impactin 1973 (600 to 800 jobs at the company1s Woodford factorynear Manchester).      Though neither Chester nor Manchesterare areas of high unemployment the former does draw to someextent on the Welsh and Merseyside development areas.There would also be over 200 extra jobs by 1973 at RollsRoyce1s Hillington factory near Glasgow and a further 200or more at various electronics factories mainly in thesouth-east.   All these figures represent extra jobs and allow for the likelihood that in addition the existinglabour force would be used more intensively.    Thus,  therewould be a considerable contribution to employment in thenext two years but there would be a large continuingcommitment thereafter, the cost per job is on the highside and the employment is only partly in areas of high unemployment.    There are some prospects of exports whichwould be enhanced if production were to restart butMinistry of Defence advise that these cannot be ratedhighly.
ii. Army reconnaissance vehicles   Acceleration of purchases of120 tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles would cost an addition 5 million of which half would fall in 1974-75.    It could lead to .100 new jobs in 1972-75 rising to 300 in each of thetwo following years; most of these would be at the Alvisfactory in Coventry and the rest would be in the Coventry and b i nningh am area.iii. Runway repair vehicles   Purchases of tractors and dumptrucks used by the Army for the rapid repair of aircraft runwayscould be accelerated by an additional  1 million expenditure in1972-75o    This might provide work for about 100 men spread amongfactories at Stamford (Allis Chalmers), Basingstoke (Thornycroft)and Camber ley (Clarices).    There would be no overspill ofexpenditure into the later years.^-v*    Bulldog aircraft    150 Bulldog light aircraft could be bought for the RAF as a replacement for the Chipmunk in variousroles.    The cost would be  5*5 million (including about 0,7 million for the aircraft&apos;s American engine) of which about 2 million would fall in 1972-75 and 1973-74.    This order would prevent about 200 redundancies at Scottish Aviations Prestwickfactory in the second half of 1972 and would ensure continuedemployment of this number for a further two years.    98 Bulldogsare already on order for export and are being built now; theMinistry of Defence consider that an RAF order should help to stimulate further exportsLegislation25.   Generally speaking, there are no powers at present to pay compensation to the nationalised industries for the extra costsinvolved.    It will be necessary to inform Parliament of what isproposed (see paragraph 28 below).    In addition where compensation would be substantial, specific legislation will&apos;be needed.    TheElectricity Borrowing Powers Bill, which must be taken this session,could incorporate provisions for the payment of compensation to theCEGB and the Area Boards in England and Wales and the Scottish Boards.9
In the case of the gas industry, powers could be taken in a billfor the re-organisation of the structure of the gas industry whichis planned for this session.    There is no coal legislation in prospect at present, but a Coal Bill may well become necessary in alater session for other reasons.    Given an announcement toParliament the legislative situation need not prevent the work going ahead meanwhile.26e    While the British Railways Board would require financialcompensation this could in part be provided under existing powers.Where this could not be done, as is also the position in the case ofthe Scottish Transport Groupf it would be possible to justify makingpayments out of Votes under the authority of the Appropriation Acton the grounds that this was a once-for-all operation and that theamounts were small.27.    In the case of expenditure by the Ministry of Defence and otherDepartments on their own activities, these questions of compensation and legislation do not arise; it will simply be a matter ofauthorising the additional expenditure.Presentation28.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced, in his speech in the debate on the address, that the Government is looking at the scope for bringing forward more capital expenditure by some of the nationalised industries but he did not anticipate the outcome of this review.    It is recommended that a single announcement should be madeby an appropriate Minister of the decision taken on the package as awhole, supplemented as necessary by further statements aboutparticular aspects by the individual Ministers concerned.    This willnot only give most impact to the presentation of the package as awhole, but will also present in their proper context a number of individual items which might otherwise be difficult to put over.    Itshould be made clear that the package is not ne&apos;cessarily closed andthat it might be extended if other suitable proposals were to come forward in the near future.    If decisions have been taken in time10
on new measures for assistance to the shipbuilding industry, therewould be advantage in announcing these at the same time, so as toplace them firmly in the context of a programme to counter highunemployments over a limited period of years.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS29.   Ministers are inviteda. to decide whether to authorise additional civil expenditureof  110 million (of which    2 million   will fall in 1971-72, 57 million in 1972-73 and  51 million in 1973-74) on the basis that where necessary compensation would be paid to the nationalised industries for the additional cost of bringing forward projects, and that legislative powers would be taken as explained in paragraphs 25 and 26.b. to decide whether to authorise additional defence expenditureof  5 million in 1972-735  12 million in 1973-74,  16 million in 1974-75 and  10 million in later years:c. to note that a separate report is to be considered by the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy on the scope for a major acceleration of investment in telephone exchanges;d. to agree that further consideration should be given to anyother proposals that come forward in the near future whichsatisfy the general criteria adopted in this report;e. to consider the suggestion on the presentation of the package in paragraph 28 above.

ANNEX BADDITIONAL POWER STATIONThe proposed premature power station order is referred, to inparagraphs 10-11 of the main paper.   The value of the project isestimated at about 590 million for the stations, and  10 million forassociated transmission, making a total of some  100 million, whichwould be spread over seven years or soe   It is expected that theturbo-alternator contract (about  20 million) would be placed withReyrolle parsons and the boiler contract with Clarke Chapman? bothoperating in the North East.   There should therefore be a consider-able reduction in redundancies that would otherwise be declared inthat area,.   Apart from the main plant contract there will be civil engineering work on the site itself, substantial contracts forancillary equipment and sub-contracts placed by the main contractors,.2..     The two ma;jor problems arising at present are the determination of the level of compensation,, which must be settled in principlebefore the decision can be announced, and the amount of extrainvestment which the decision can be said to be creating^COMPENSATION3,.     The Electricity Council claim that compensation should ensurethat electricity consumers are not burdened with any more coststhan would have arisen if the decision to order a station now hadnot been taken *   They argue that allowance should also be made forrisks as a commitment to an order now will close options.   On this basis they propose that compensation should cover extra costs ofinterest, depreciation, and wages and other costs arising at thestation through its being commissioned earlier.   We were led by theCEGB to expect earlier that they would agree to offset extra costsby an allowance for the quite considerable extra benefits throughthe earlier operation of the new station, even though these wouldnot arise until 1977 or later and need therefore to be quiteconsiderably discounted.   The industry now argue, however, thatthese benefits are uncertain and should be set against the risks,-       !   &apos; ; . 1   &apos;CONFIDENTIAL
2CONFIDENTIALU..     On this basis the compensation for one year&apos;?, acceleration ofthe project could amount to about  7^-1-0 million.   The lower end ofthe range assumes that compensation covers only extra interest costs;this could be a basis for an agreed formula in accordance with paragraph 9 of the main note (though for this project it might &quot;besoniewhat generous)5,     A further problem is that there is no certainty at this pointof time whether an order placed now would be exactly one yearpremature9   Certainly on the GSG-3&apos;s jglans based on the latest loadforecast (adopted early in 1971) the station is provisionally setdown, to be ordered late in 1972.   On present plans therefore animmediate order would be one year premature.   But the electricity council will be adopting a new load forecast early in 1972-and theiM-SlJASS.: whether or not to start building a station later ^n thatyear would in the normal way be left to be decided in the light ofthat load forecast,,    It seems very likely that the load forecastwill be lower than that adopted early in 1971? and that the decision taken might have been to defer the next power station for the GEG-B&apos;until 1973 - or conceivably even later*   For this reason., theindustry may be able to argue that the order is not one yearpremature but two..   It is proposed that the basis of compensation should be firmly agreed as soon as possible, but that the questionwhether tho order is one or two years premature be lefiJ to beagreed in the light of the Electricity Council&apos;s new load forecastadopted early in 1972,    if it were agreed that the order is to beregarded as two years premature9 then compensation could well be inthe range  15-20 million.EXTRA INVESTMENT6,     The public expenditure forecasts were drawn up on the assumptionthat the CEGB&apos;s investment programme should be cut back - by 75 million over the four years 1972-73 to 1975-6,   This implied thatthe power station order the CEC-B proposed to place late in 1972
CONFIDENTIALwould be deferred*   The justification for this deferment was that,the industry had proposed to increase the &quot;planning margin51 fromused up to 1969 to 20% to allow for increased risks and poorerperformance of plant operating at advanced steam conditionse ;Asthe size of the planning margin was not material to the decision at the time to order no new station in 1971 s the question whetherthe planning margin should be increased was left open for determiner,later and the programme was provisionally cut back compared with theGEG-B* s proposalse7,     The effect on the public expenditure forecasts - which implied that the 1972 station was excluded from the programme altogether -is to add  15 million in 1972-5 and  27 million in 1973-U- to the forecasts considered by Cabinet on 19 Octobere   But the White Paperincluding these forecasts has not yet been published and thedecision to cut back the CEGB*s proposals has not been formallyconveyed to the industry..   It will therefore be difficult to arguepublicly that the Government is adding to public expenditure byre-instating (as well as advancing) investment proposals which ithas not yet announced it was cutting0   The extra investment that canbe claimed publicly may therefore have to be limited to the effecton the new decision compared with the GEGB&apos;s proposals, rather than with the earlier decision to cut their programme   In comparisonwith the CEG-B?s proposalss the effect of bringing forward the power station order is to increase expenditure by about , 11,. ^mi^lJLon ineach of the years 1972-3 and 1973-4i.g. the corresponding additional employment being about 2000 jobs in each year.   But this would necessitate increasing the figure in the White Paper&amp;liijJxJiimainbaj-,  127-13C ONFIDEHT XAL
