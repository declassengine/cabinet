DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S government copy NO     r. ,CABINETCRIMINAL JUSTICE bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. In view of the public and Parliamentary interest in the criminla justice Bill, my colleagues may like to have, for information,a brief statement of its principal contents.    They have been approved by the Homeand Social Affairs Committee.2. The objects of the Bill are i. to provide more effective means ofdealing with major criminals, and ii. to broaden the range of alternative methods of dealing with the smaller fry, who make up the great bulk of thepresent prison population and contribute substantially to the overcrowdingproblem.3. The main proposals are as follows:ReparationA simplification and enlargement of the powers of the courts to orderan offender to pay compensation to the victim.Criminal BankruptcyA limited experiment in applying bankruptcy procedures to majorcriminals.    The primary object would be to determine whether this approach has promise as a means of depriving major criminals ofthe fruits of their crime; reparation would be an important, butsubsidiary, aim.PenaltiesThere is a need to increase some of the maximum penalties forfirearms offences.    Penalties for the most serious offences, suchas use of a firearm to resist arrest, would go up from 14 years tolife.1CP(71) 11920 October 1971
Driving disqualification and crimeThe higher courts are to be given power to disqualify from drivingan offender who has used a vehicle in the commission of crime.Forfeiture of PropertyThe courts are to be given a general power to order, for theprevention of crime, forfeiture of property in the possession of anoffender.    This would replace the existing provisions, which are limited in scope.Suspended SentenceThe requirement that certain short prison sentences should be suspended is to be removed, but the courts are to be required toconsider information about an offender before sending him to prisonfor the first time and (in the case of magistratesT courts) to state their reasons for doing so.    Compulsory supervision by probationofficers is to be made available for the longer suspended sentences.ParoleThere will be some devolution of responsibility, in the less seriouscases, from the Parole Board to the local review committees.Deferred SentenceTo enable the court to await a promised change in an offender^circumstances, there is to be power to postpone sentence for up to six months.Community ServiceAn experimental scheme (initially In four or five areas) to enablethe courts to require offenders to carry out work of service to thecommunity in their spare time.    The scheme would be managed bythe probation service.    Full use would be made of local voluntary service organisations.Day Treatment CentresAnother experiment (two or three centres in the first instance), toprovide intensive supervision and social education for certain types of offender, as a condition of probation.2
HostelsLocal probation committees, in addition to the existing voluntary-bodies, are to be given power to set up and manage hostels and other accommodation for offenders, and for persons on bail who would otherwise be remanded to prison.4.        A Bill with these provisions (and some other minor changes) wouldprovide a useful &quot;package&quot; to meet the objectives outlined above,    Anumber of its proposals are avowedly experimental and carry with them therisk that they may not be successful or, though they prove themselves, maybe difficult to extend more widely.    But I believe that we can justly claim that we have here a hard-headed but constructive policy for improving theadministration of criminal justice.R m home Office20 October 19713
