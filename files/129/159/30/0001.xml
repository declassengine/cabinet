(confidential)SCHOOL MILK:    ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTIONS(Note by officials)At Cabinet on k November - CM (71) 53rd Conclusions, Item 6 -there was a discussion of the problem created by certain localauthorities continuing to supply free school milk to childrenover 7 and the Council members concerned rendering themselvesliable to surcharge.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer was invited,in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, to examineurgently the various suggestions which had been put forward in discussion and to consider to what extent they might contribute to a less unsatisfactory solution of the problem.     This note dealswith the problem, including the three specific suggestions madeat Cabinet.The duties of the Treasurer in local government2,     The Accounting Officer in central government in order toprotect himself must point out in writing to his Minister anyproposal for expenditure which involves the safeguarding of public funds or formal regularity or propriety.     But if the Ministernevertheless decides to proceed and instructs the Accounting officer in writing to implement his decision, the Accounting Officer mustthen carry it out.     In local government however it has been held(A G v De Winton, 1906) that the Treasurer is not merely a servantof the Council, but, in the case of a Borough, as custodian of the borough funds owes a duty and stands in a fiduciary position to theburgesses as a body, and that he cannot plead the orders of theCouncil for an unlawful act.     The same principle applies to otherCouncils in England and Wales.     (In Scotland there is a statutoryescape clause for officials who sign under protest.)      An officerof a Council in England and Wales who carries out the instructions of a Council which involves improper expenditure is potentiallyliable to surcharge.     He would, on the other hand, risk dismissalif he refused to carry out the instructions.     Such dismissalwould however now be unfair dismissal under the Industrial relations act.     The legal framework for penalising officials thereforeexists in local government in England and Wales already.     Thesesanctions have not proved effective in the single case in point,and it would be wrong to stiffen them against officials if theGovernment were not prepared to apply them to Council members._1_(confidential)
(confidential)Surcharges should be borne by the Council and not &quot;by Councillors3.     It was suggested that since the surcharge fell on individualCouncillors it gave them an opportunity for martyrdom, and thatit would be better therefore if the penalty fell on the council as a body and thus on the rate fund.     However, surcharge, althoughit has implications of penalty, is basically recovering for therate fund and thus for the benefit of ratepayers the loss caused.To impose the surcharge on the Council would be requiring therate payers to make good the loss to themselves and would thus bemeaningless.     Moreover, in England and Wales the real deterrentis disqualification.     If encouragements to martyrdom are to beremoved then the sanctions against improper action by Councillorsshould be less dramatic, but this would in turn mean that theywould generally be less effective.Withholding Rate Support Grant (RSG)h.     Illegal expenditure when disallowed does not attract RSGdirectly or indirectly in any form,5.     The present situation is this.     The Education (Milk) Act,1971. removed the obligation on local education authorities tosupply free milk to pupils over 7 and made its continued freesupply by them illegal.     The saving of  9 million (GB) whichthe authorities were thus intended to make will be deducted fromthe total of &quot;relevant expenditure&quot; of all local authorities onwhich RSG is based and the total of RSG for this year and nextwill he reduced accordingly.     Hence the total of RSG for thepresent grant period cannot be affected by additional expenditurelegally incurred on milk.     Within this fixed total in some casesgrant may flow to authorities supplying free milk, at the expense,however, of ratepayers in other areas, and not of the taxpayer.6.     It has &quot;been suggested that in future the supply of free milkshould be accepted provided that it did not attract RSG or enterinto its computation so that the ratepayers had to meet the whole cost of it.     In any future settlement of RSG as the law alreadystands it would be open to the Government in determining thetotal level of &quot;relevant expenditure&quot; and the total of RSG to disregard any amount which might be spent on milk,2(confidential)
(confidential)7.     As regards distribution between authorities, the bulkof RSG (the needs element) is distributed by reference tocertain objective factors such as total population, school population, road mileage, etc. and without regard to the actual expenditure of individual authorities, either in total or on particular services.     Thus marginal extra expenditure does notattract extra needs element,     A small part of RSG, however,(the resources element) is distributed to those authorities whichqualify for it partly by reference to actual expenditure andmarginal extra expenditure then does attract grant, but at theexpense of authorities in other areas.     There is no provision forlegal outlays on particular services to be omitted in calculating the distribution of this element of grant,8,     In order to ensure that the cost of free milk fell entirely on the ratepayers of the area supplying it and was not throughthe grant mechanism transferred on-^to ratepayers in other areas,legislation would be necessary to exclude any expenditure on freemilk from the calculation of resources element,9.     Such a change would, however, be alien to the principles ofthe present RSG system.     This system has the great advantage thatit enables the Government to influence the total of local authority expenditure downwards or upwards without curtailing their freedom to spend legally what they receive in the way they think best.Much was made of these advantages of the present RSG system inthe Green Paper on Local Government Finance, and a fundamental change in the arrangements would expose the Government to charges of inconsistency.     These would be the more severe if legislation were taken at once (to endeavour to cope with the school milkproblem) and before the promised consultations on the reform oflocal government finance, especially as such a change would beseen to be inconsistent with the suggestions for the revision of resources grant floated in Appendix k of the Green Paper,3
(confidential)10.   Moreover, the Governments main purpose in relationto free school milk has &quot;been to reduce public expenditure;and expenditure financed wholly from the rates would stillrepresent a public claim on resources.     To proceed as envisagedabove would not necessarily lead to an increase in public expenditure in total, but it could lead to a distortion in the priorities which the Government wished local authorities tofollow.Conclusion11.   We have not found a satisfactory way of avoiding theproblem of illegal expenditure on milk unless the Education(Milk) Act were to be amended.     If the obligation to chargewere removed, none of the additional expenditure need fall on the taxpayer, but without other legislation, which would bring thedifficulties mentioned in paragraph 9 above, it could not be ensured that in every case all the cost would fall on therate payers in the area concerned.     And there would be thepublic expenditure consequences in the preceding paragraph.k
