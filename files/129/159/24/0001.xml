DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 1241 November 1971PRESCRIPTION charges memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for wales.        At Cabinet on 19 October (CM(71) 50th Conclusions, Minute 1)we were invited to bring forward proposals about prescription charges which might go some way to remedy the deficiency resulting from theabandonment of graduated charges related to the cost of individualprescriptions.2. The present charge is 20p and an increase to 30p would berequired to achieve the saving of  15 million intended from the firstfull year of graduated charges.    The Cabinet decided  in July(CM(71) 38th Conclusions, Minute 6) that such a large increase was notat present acceptable and we assume that the same arguments apply atleast until the end of the period covered by the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) initiative.3, We do however consider that there would be substantialadvantage in establishing now the principle that there should be a flat-rateprescription charge, adjusted annually, which would bear a fixedrelationship to the average cost of a chargeable prescription to theNational Health Service.    This would remove the main objections madeto the graduated charge which were that the person needing the more costly drug would have to pay more and that the chemist would face muchheavier administrative tasks, but would still secure buoyancy in the yield.    The relatively small annual adjustments which would benecessary - probably falling in the range lp - 3p - would causeconsiderably less political and presentational difficulty than much larger increases made at longer intervals and based on no clearrationale.    If in the longer run economic and political considerationspermitted, we could raise the proportion of the average cost of aprescription represented by the charge and thus increase the yield to anamount approximating to our original intention.4. On the basis that the first increase in the charge would take effect from I April 1972 and that the objective should be to maintain the relationship between charge and average cost which was establishedwhen the charge was increased to its present level of 20p on 1 April 1971,the new level of charge required would probably be about 23p, yieldingan extra  4 million per annum.    (Because of the printing required, adecision to adopt this course would need to be announced almost immediately).copy NOCABINET
If our colleagues feel that in view of the initiative taken bythe CBI the increase should be limited to 5 per cent,  thenew charge would have to be 21p,  yielding about Ijj million per annum.    This would not maintain the April 1971relationship and would hardly justify the adverse publicity thatinvariably follows any increase in this charge; it would also be difficultto make a further increase during the course of 1972.    An alternative isto defer the increase until we have passed the year covered by the CBIinitiative and also obtained the new powers described in paragraph 6 below.The disadvantagecf deferring until say September 1972 is that the increase would probably have to be to 25p or more, which could still be out of keeping with whatever attitude is then taken on prices.5. The logic of the principle we are suggesting is likely to commend itself to many people; but any action which will lead to an increase inprescription charges will of course excite some opposition.    We have two proposals for mitigating this.    The first is that any announcement of theproposed new arrangements should indicate the abandonment of theintention to introduce graduated charges related to the cost of individualprescriptions.    Secondly, we proposed to explore with the organisations concerned the possibility of chemists selling in their shops season ticketsvalid for 6 months.    Such an arrangement, if it could be made, would be unlikely to come into effect before 1 June 1972.6.        An increase in prescription charges from next April could be putinto effect through regulations (subject to the negative resolution procedure) made under the existing powers.    Thereafter, it is desirable for the annual adjustments to be made by administrative action, and thiswould require new powers on the lines proposed for the Bill on national health Service charges which has a place in the main Programme for the1971-72 Session.    We ask our colleagues to agree to the introduction ofthis legislation early in the new Session.    The Bill will inevitably giverise to controversy; but it is desirable that it should reach the statute book soon because, without it, we shall not be able to secure the increasedincome which will follow from giving effect to the decision already announced to reduce the age limit for exemption from dental treatmentcharges from 21 to 18, or to make   the other desirable changes referredto in the memorandum.7. We therefore ask our colleagues to agree that;-i. there should be a flat-rate prescription charge relateddirectly to the average cost of a National Health Serviceprescription and subject toaaanal adjustment;ii. the precise timing and amount of the Increase should beleft over to further discussion nearer the time.(This would imply that there wosld be no increade before next summer).2
Li. the National Health Service charging legislation shouldbe introduced early in the forthcoming Session of Parliament;v.       discussions about the sale of 6 monthly season tickets bychemists should be opened as soon as possible;v.       an early announcement should be made of our intentions inrelation to prescription charges indicating that the graduatedcharges originally proposed are not to be proceeded with.Department of Health and Social Security1 November 1971K JG CP T3
