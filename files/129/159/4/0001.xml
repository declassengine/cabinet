BBjggg OF JM^^gNg. strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffI.   ECONOMIC policy the Government has 2 kinds of major objective in economic policy -a. The immediate problems of economic management are to maintainhigh levels of employment, an acceptable degree of price stability and a strong balance of payments.b. To increase the rate of economic growth in the longer term.2.     These 2 kinds of objectives are of course inter-related, but since their achievement requires different sorts of action on different time scales they are best looked at separately.^Ji-SiLo^t^Terq .Ec^omo^fenj^eiaent3.     The Government, when it came into Office, was confronted with a very rapid rate of cost and price inflation and abnormally high and risinglevels of unemployment; profits were low, investment falling, and businessconfidence weak.   The balance of payments was, temporarily in substantialsurplus, but the rate of inflation was eroding our competitive position.4. Unemployment has continued to rise, and while there has been some reduction in the rate of cost inflation, prices have continued to risetoo fast.5.     The July measures have provided a stimulus which should reduce unemployment to less than 3 per cent by the end of 1972, and the agreements with the CBI and the nationalised industries should help to moderate therate of inflation.   However, the management of the economy over the next2 or 3 years poses a number of very difficult issues, both technical andpolitical.Unemployment and the Balance of Payments6.     The Government might set as an objective that by 1974 unemployment should be less than 2-g- per cent compared with the present 3&quot;2 per cent.This will only be achieved if the expansion started by the July measures&apos;is sustained and controlled.   The major threat is the balance of payments.1
The expansion of demand necessary to achieve this unemployment objectivewill generate a very large increase in imports, and will almost certainlyworsen the balance of payments by at least  600-700 million.   Thus, to achieve this unemployment objective at the exchange rate parities which existed at the beginning of August would be almost certainly impossible.7.     The present international monetary situation makes it difficult tosee precisely what action will have to be taken in order to reduce unemployment without an unmanageable balance of payments deficit.   this objective will be easier to achieve if, while exchange rates generally are floating, the exchange rates of the existing e.c. currencies and theJapanese yen float upwards relative to ourselves and the dollar.   In this sense, the present international monetary situation has come at a particularly favourable time.   We must take the maximum advantage of it.Inflation8.     The experience of the past 2 years, not merely in this country butin industrial countries generally shows that rising unemployment, even when taken to the limits of \vhat is politically acceptable, provides no adequate check on excessive price and cost increases.   In so far asincreases in the cost of living are one cause of demands for wage and salary increases the reductions in indirect taxation and the priceagreements with the CBI and the nationalised industries should help to moderate the rate of price increase in 1972.   But the extent of themoderation is uncertain;    it could be upset by the concession of excessivewage claims.   Moreover, it is temporary.   After the summer of 1972 firmswill be under considerable pressure to adjust their prices upwards to take account of the cost increases which they have not passed on in higher prices.   In particular, the increases in prices in some.of the nationalised industries will have to be substantial if they are to earn a satisfactoryrate of return and make an adequate contribution to financing their investment.   At the same time, a fall in unemployment could add to the pressure of demand in the labour market and encourage unions to continueto press large wage claims greatly in excess of the growth productivity.2
.9.     This means that if the Government is to have any chance of bringing the rate of price increase down to say 3 or 4 per cent per annum by 1974*it will need to find some method of reducing the average rate of increaseof earnings to around 6 per cent per annum in the period 1972-74, iehalving the present rate of settlement in the private sector.     It willnot be possible to do this simply by acting on prices:   the price increases are largely the symptom of cost increases -which are in turn generated mainly by excessive increases in wages and salaries.     An effective attack on theprice problem in the medium term should therefore be directed at the causes and not the symptoms of cost inflation.10,   The respite given by the July measures and the ceiling on price increases provides an opportunity for establishing an effective dialoguewith the Trade Unions and employers to devise acceptable methods of bringing the rate of increase in wages and salaries within bounds.     Thiswill be very difficult;   but there is no prospect of controlling inflationunless it is done, and unless it succeeds.11.   Even if the rate of price increase is brought down substantially, alot of people will suffer from rising prices.     It is important to ensurethat the vulnerable groups are protected by adjustments in social security benefits, etc.Timing;12.   If the level of unemployment is to be reduced to below 2-g per cent by 1974 the rate of increase of national product will need to be about4g- per cent per annum between now and the beginning of 1973;   thereafter the rate of increase will need to be slowed down to bring it into line withthe longer-term trend which we can expect - ie around 3 per cent per annum.To do this without generating another stop-go cycle in itself posesdifficult problems for monetary and fiscal policy.13*     1973 will be a critical year.     In addition to the need to control the growth of demand the economy will also be subjected to a number ofother major disturbances:a. It will be the first year of e.c. entry.b. The Value Added Tax will produce a lot of changes in prices,some of which may well be very unpopular.3
Co     Cost and price increases following the raising of the12 month ceiling on price increases will be workingthemselves out.d. The full impact of the new rent legislation will bebeing felt.e. The raising of the school leaving age to 16 will become effective and reduce the size of the potential labour force by something like   \ million school leavers.14.     This means that 1973 may be a year requiring fiscal and monetaryrestraints if the economy is not to get out of hand.     The obvious needfor substantial increases in exports to pay for extra imports and finance the cost of e.c. entry, which will impose large additional claims on national resources, reinforces this view.     It would be more consistent with theGovernment&apos;s strategy to do this by reductions in public expenditure,rather than by increases in taxation.     Possible reductions in expenditurein 1973-74 need to be identified now.Taxation and Government expenditure15.     The Government has introduced a number of sizeable tax reductionsduring its first year in office, and has put forward proposals for majortax reform.     At the same time it has succeeded in bringing the rate of increase of public expenditure down, so that the public sector&apos;s claim on resources is increasing a little less rapidly than national income.     Thus,if public expenditure can be kept down to the rates of increase envisaged in the last public expenditure White Paper, the tax burden need not increasein real terms.     Since inflation tends to generate increasing tax revenuethere may be some scope for some reduction in tax rates consistent withkeeping the real tax burden constant.16.     This is very uncertain.     However, it is clear that any possiblescope for reductions in tax rates would be prejudiced if public expenditure is allowed to increase more rapidly than envisaged in the current PESCSurvey.     The obvious claim of personal social services, education, roads and other programmes will make it.extremely difficult to contain the rateof increase of public expenditure.     Until inflation is under much bettercontrol, public expenditure should be contained by reducing spendingprogrammes, and not by increasing charges to the public.4
SECRETB - Economic Growth in the Long Term17.     To raise the long-term rate of economic growth is one of the majorobjectives which the Government has set itself.     Its approach to achieving this objective is a general one of stimulating the working of the private sector of the economy by the incentives of tax reform, the encouragement of competition including the stimulus of joining the e.c., the refusal to supportuneconomic activities, and reducing Government interference in the workingof the economy.     Most of these things would be regarded by the Government as desirable in themselves, whether or not they contribute to improved economic growth.      Progress towards these aims is examined in the context of the relevant sectoral policies.       The contribution which this approach will make to improve our growth performance in the longer term is very difficult to assess, since it depends on the way in which management and labour respond to new economic conditions, and not on things over which the Government has any direct control.     The change in attitudes required for faster growth will necessarily take some time to achieve, and the results will also take timeto identify and observe.     It would also be unwise to expect any clearlyobservable results to be seen from these measures for the next 2 or 3 years at least,18.     Nevertheless, if faster growth in the longer term is to be attainable,there are a number of things which need to be done now.     Business needs tobe convinced that the Government intends to pursue an expansionary policy,and will not deflate to maintain an over-valued exchange rate.     Unlessconfidence is restored, the incentives to invest and innovate will remainweak.     At the same time, effective action to reduce the rate of wage settlements will be needed if cost inflation is not to prejudice confidence in the expansion.     Thus, the strategy for short-run economic managementdiscussed above is a necessary precondition for improved growth performancein the longer term.C-j--JPhe Pr e s entati onu of^cpnomic Policy Is sue s^19o     There are various questions relating to the way in which economic policy is presented which need to be looked at:a.     The Value Added Tax is likely to have considerable effects on therelative prices of different commodities - some things which now beara lot of tax will be cheaper, others that have hitherto paid nothingwill become dearer.     Public opinion will need to be prepared for this,and it is for consideration whether, once the structure of VAT has beendecided, a campaign to explain it to the public should be mounted onthe lines of the publicity which preceded the introduction of decimal currency.5SECRET
b. All Governments are bound to use monetary policy and budgetarypolicy as instruments of economic stabilisation.     In the past,stabilisation measures have almost invariably been unpopular andmisunderstood.     Governments may not have had very effectivestabilisation policies, but they have almost invariably had an even worse public reception than they deserved.     How to improvethis state of affairs warrants the most serious examination.     It isa major communications problem.c. For most of the past 20 3rears, apart from the temporary stimulusafforded by the 1967 devaluation, the volume of our exports has risen by little more than 3 per cent per annum on average - less than halfthe rate of growth of world trade as a whole.     If we are to achieve a faster rate of economic growth and cope successfully with EECentry we shall probably be needing during the 1970s a rate of increase in exports by volume of 6 per cent or more - ie double what we have done in the past.     This is unlikely to happen without asubstantial change in management attitudes.     How such a change canbe stimulated needs to be re-examined.6
REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review Staff11*A   FOREIGN policy the Situation in 19701.     Britain*s basic foreign policy problem in 1970, as for some years past, was to come to terms with her medium-power status combined with hercontinued dependence on international tre.de.   The keynote of the newGovernmentfs approach to international relations was struck by thePrime Minister in Parliament on 2 July -&quot;the main aim of our foreign policy must be to make a modern andbroadly based assessment of where British interests lie.......our situation calls for policies based on a realistic assessment of our needs and capacity&quot;.2.     Two specific objectives were dominants to secure both a politicalrole and a basis for economic prosperity by negotiating entry to the EECon satisfactory terms; and to ensure national security by sustaining thecohesion of the Atlantic Alliance.   Other important aims were to work fora Berlin settlement as part of the general approach to East-West detentein Europe! to join with others concerned in working out acceptable tradeand monetary relations between the United States and the rest of theindustrial world; to take part with other developed countries inrealistic attempts, through trade and aid policies, to decrease tension between the rich nations and the poor; to avoid disruption of theCommonwealth while seeking a settlement with Rhodesia and contributing to western strength in the Indian Ocean area by maintaining links with south Africa; to maintain a military presence East of Suez based on a,5-Power defence system in Malaysia/Singapore; to negotiate locallyacceptable arrangements for the future of the Gulf States; and to make suitable provision for the future of the Dependent Terrorities.   A more general objective was to work for peace in troubled areas where Britainthough not directly involved was certain to suffer from the continuationor outbreak of war; Vietnam and the Arab/lsrael theatre x-rere activeexamples, while others such as India-Pakistan x^ere latent.   Cyprus and7
Malta, as British military bases, were potential troublespots of specialconcern,,   The military troublespot of greatest immediacy was NorthernIreland, a domestic problem with strong external overtones.Progress to Bate3.     The outstanding success has been the restoration of relations ofconfidence with Prance and the consequent conclusion of satisfactoryterms for e.c. entry.   The European Defence Improvement Programme has onlymodestly contributed to the strength of the Atlantic Alliance; major problems still lie ahead.   A Berlin settlement has been achieved; but theoutlook for European detente remains uncertain, as more dramatically does the future of American economic relations with Europe.   Britain has accepted a date for achieving the 1 per cent of GMP target for aid and has playoda major part in evolving the Generalised Preferences scheme for fosteringthe trade of developing nations; but the gap between rich a poor continuesto widen.   A major success was secured at the Singapore Conference, wherethe South African arms issue was not allowed to disrupt the Commonwealthbut at the same time the general principle of Britain&apos;s freedom of action was vindicated; but the arms issue is not yet dead, and the feasibilityand consequences of a Rhodesian settlement are still unknown.   East of suez, satisfactory 5-power defence arrangements have been made forMalaysia/Singapore; and progress towards an orderly transition in the Gulf,though far from complete, has been smoother than was feared.   Of the dependent Territories, Fiji has been successfully launched intoindependence and there are hopeful signs in parts of the Caribbean5 ofthe more intractable problems, Gibraltar is quiescent, Hong Kong hasbenefited from China&apos;s friendlier mood and better relations have beenestablished between the Fallclands and Argentina,,   De-escalation in Vietnamcontinues, but Britain has not been able to contribute to the process.   TheArab-Israel dispute has remained off, though near, the boil.   A breakdown in Middle Eastern oil supplies to Europe has been narrowly averted; butawareness of the power balance between producers and consumers of oil hasshifted sharply in the producers1 favour.   The situation in Ulster has deteriorated and relations with Soxithern Ireland are under increasingstrain.8
Short-term Problems and Prospects4o     The immediate needs are to complete and ratify our accession to the eec; to carry through our military withdrawal from the Gulf; to establishwhether a Khodesian settlement is feasible and if so to seek ways ofminimising adverse reactions in Commonwealth Africa; to sea whetheragreement can be reached with Malta; to pursue with our allies the search for East-West detente, beginning perhaps with a European SecurityConference; to work for satisfactorily readjusted commercial and monetaryrelations between Europe and Ame rica; and in Northern Ireland to reduce,and if possible eliminate, not only violence but also its underlyingcauses.   More generally, we need to do what we can to help avert conflictsin India-Pakist?,n and the Middle East.   In addition, the uncertain natureof external affairs could at any time face us with new short-term crises;eg over oil supplies, over Cyprus, over United Nations affairs or overthe implementation of our Ea.st of Suez plans.Longer-term Problems and Prospects5o     The major issue is of course the kind of united Europe that is to emerge, and the relationships it is to have to the United States, to japan, to the Communist countries, to Australia and Canada and to the under-developed world.   We shall need to decide what we wish and can hope to achieve in the way of monetary, defence and political integrationin Europe.   We shall have to learn the techniques by which commonEuropean policies consonant with our own interests can be worked out; weshall need to &quot;think European&quot; and to operate within a system of give and take.   Relations with the United States will be of crucial economic andmilitary importance; the past will be no guide in a world where theAnglo-American partnership is ceasing to be the centre of our foreignpolicy and where American attitudes to the rest of the world may bealtering radically.   The extent of Americans military commitment to europe will in particular be very tmcortain.   Our changed relations with europe and America will also interact on our evolving relations with the rest ofthe world.   Whatever progress is made with aid and trade, the poor nations are likely to remain unsatisfied and prone to turbulence.   China will emerge as a nuclear power on an intercontinental scale.   Japan&apos;s economicand military strength will increase, and with it, her potential for troubl9^     ^ ii A tis. fc
Difficult decisions will have to ho taken over the future of our own orEurope&apos;s capacity to wage nuclear war.   Above all, our own nationalattitudes to the external world will change; as always, the Government *sproblem will be to know when to seek to guide these and when to be guided by them.
REVIEW OF GOVFJINMENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffII. B defence the Situation in 1,9701.     The Governments main objectives (as later set out-in the DefenceStatement of October 19?0j Cmnd 4521) were to enable Britain to resume,within her resources, a proper share of responsibility for the preservation of world stability!    and to improve the capabilities of the Armed Forces, ona sound financial basis.     More resources had in particular to be found forincreased support of NATO and for a continued presence East of Suez.     Theposition was complicated by the fact that the costing of the previousGovernmenfs defence programme considerably exceeded the provisional sumpublicly allocated to it in public expenditure plans.Progress to Date2.     The White Papersof October 1970 and February 1971 (Cmnd 4592) showed thatthese objectives were being met by measures which included the establishmentof Five Power defence arrangements involving a continued British militarypresence in Malaysia and Singapore;   the maintenance of naval forces East of suez;   the retention of the Brigade of Gurkhas;    a contribution to theEuropean Defence Improvement Programme involving the retention of EMS Ark Royalan additional armoured car regiment and more Jaguar close support aircraft;and the expansion of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve.     Labour1 saim of holding defence spending at a constant level from 1972-73 was abandoned;but the new defence budget targets announced, though higher than Laboursprovisional figures, fell significantly short of what the Labour programme would have cost.     The percentage of GI-1P devoted to defence is now expectsdto fall from 5-7 per cent in 1970-71 to 5.2 per cent in 1974-75*Short-term problems and Prospects3.     Leaving aside the pressing problems presented by defence tasks inNorthern Ireland, by our future defence relationship with Malta, by the launching of the Five Power defence arrangements in SE Asia and by the nextstages in the European Defence Improvement Programme, the immediate tasksrelate to the defence budget, notably:-11
a. to confim that sufficient reductions ean he nade in the defenceprograoDc up to 1974-75 to keep it to the published financial targets withoutundermining the published defence policy, despite the fact that estimatedcosts (particularly as regards naval hardware) are now higher than wasforeseen last year;   and b. to decide on the lsvcl of defence expenditure thereafter.The 2 tasks are connected in that the achievement of a. will depend in parton postponing certain expenditures until after 1974-75? which will sharpenthe services wish for more money in 1975-76.Longer-term Problems andM Prospects4&quot;     On present plans, Britain will be spending 5*2 per cent of her GNP on defence in 1974-75- ^ shall &quot;thus remain at an economic disadvantage vis-a-visour e.c. partners, who may not even maintain their present lower percentages(under 5 per cent for France, under 4 per cent for Germany and under3 per cent for Italy).     This will raise basic questions of what sort ofmilitary power we with to be and whether the Government is prepared, to contemplate the major revision of defence policy, involving major cuts incommitments or capabilities or both, which would bo necessary if we wore toreduce our percentage to around the e.c. average (say 4 per cent).     If wewere to take France as a model, we should need to remember that her GNP willbe significantly larger than ours;   that she shows no sign of abandoningconscription;    and that the effectiveness of her non-nuclear forces is relatively low.5*     Britain^ defence, like that of the rest of Western Europe, has dependedfor a quarter of a century on the American alliance.     Changes in UnitedStates society and foreign policy are likely over the next decade to reducethe value of that alliance, perhaps drastically.     Europe would then face anunpleasant choice between increased vulnerability and increased defence expenditure.6.     For Britain the problem would not be one of finance alone.     Defencemanpower is at present a manageable problem;   but by the second half of the1970s demographic and sociological changes could have made it so acute that,in the absence of conscription, smaller forces and a consequent major revisionof defence policy might be inescapable.12
7o     The present defence programme assumes that we shall maintain our existingstrategic nuclear capability.     But the Polaris force will probably need tobe replaced in the second half of the 1980s.     If we are to develop a newgeneration of strategic nuclear weapons for the 1980s and beyond, heavy extra expenditure (not at present provided for) near be required in the 1970s.This too could mean a revision of defence policy if the resources had to befound at the expense of other defence requirements.8.     The ways in which we should seek solutions to those problems are likelyto depend on 2 main factors:   on what happens to the external threat to national security, from the Warsaw Pact and/or other quarters;   and on what progress Europe can make towards defence integration.     It is possible to beanything from very optimistic to very pessimistic on either count.
REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffHI A.    industry the Situation in 19701.     The Government faced a situation in which physical intervention by its predecessor had produced a growing atmosphere of paternalism.   Thisconcealed the fact that the long-term structural problem of Britain&apos;sdeclining industries had not been solved and, at growing expense to the taxpayer, protected British industry from facing up to the responsibilitiesimposed by competition.   At the same time, there were growing liquidityproblems caused by wage inflation and a tight monetary policy imposed on a long-term decline in profitability,2.     The Government promised -a. Disengagement from the private sector; the reduction ofbureaucratic control; and prevention of further nationalisation.b. Reduction of the involvement of the state in nationalised industries and the increased   use of private capital.c. A vigorous competition policy, strengthening the machineryagainst monopolies.d. Encouragement of profitable investment, through tax allowancesrather than grants.Progress to date.     In the private sector, progress has been -a.     The Government has fulfilled its specific pledges, by repealingthe Industrial Expansion Act; winding up the Industrial reorganisation corporation, the Prices and Incomes Board, the Land Commission (andbetterment levy), the Consumer Council and several little Neddies;stopping ports nationalisation; and removing restrictions on commercial transport.   These changes represented the lion&apos;s share oflast autumn&apos;s public expenditure reductions (as opposed to increases in charges).   The Bolton Committee Report examines obstacles to theinitiative of small companies.
b.    As regards disengagement more generally, the Government hasrefused help to Mersey Docks   Harbour Board and Clyde Port authority and has allowed Rolls-Royce and Upper Clyde Shipbuilders to go into liquidation.   Its subsequent actions have been constrained by other considerations, particularly unemployment.   It has encountered thedifficulty that there are situations, eg Rolls-Royce, in which theGovernment has no option but to intervene in a threatened collapse.It originally withdrew preferences for International ComputersLimited but has recently indicated,in public, an intention to support this company:   policy towards &quot;growth&quot; industries is in an uneasyno man&apos;s land.4.     In the public sector, the Government&apos;s policy of reducing stateinvolvement in the nationalised industries was always inconsistent withits policy of bearing on price and wage increa.ses in the public sector.The priority given to combating inflation and, in particular, to responding to the CBI initiative on price restraint, has made it impossible to achieve this element of the Government&apos;s policies.5.     Proposals on anti-monopoly legislation have now come forward:   measuresto improve consumer protection are a necessary complement and are being prepared.6.     Capital allowances have been substituted for investment grants.   Thissaves administration for industry and Government.   But investment remainssluggish.   The propensity to invest will depend on expansion of bothdemand and profitability and may also be triggered by our prospectiveentry to e.c..Short-term Problems and Prospects7.     The effects of investment, education and the removal of restrictive practices on productivity will only appear gradually and the Governmentca.not count on their making any substantial difference to the growth of productivity in the short run.   Nor is the Government&apos;3 competitionpolicy likely to have more than a marginal short-term effect on cost and price inflation.15
8.     In the short run the single factor most likely to promote theGovernment&apos;s industrial policies is to create confidence that theGovernment will maintain faster growth of demand.   This will -a. Reduce unemployment, including that in the regions, and thusreduce the pressures on the Government to prevent redundancies indeclining industries.   This is important since entry to Europe islikely to accelerate changes in the structures of British industry,and these should not he resisted.b. Stimulate investment.   Prospective entry to Europe may itselfstimulate an investment boom, starting at any time after this autumn.There is some danger that resources for this may be preempted by aboom in consumption.9.     Other critical factors in the years up to 1975 are -a. A strategy is needed for getting the nationalised industriesback on target, particularly since this could involve substantial price-rises in the period after the CBI price freeze comes to an end in1972, when there will be a danger that price increases in the private sector will be giving a fresh stimulus to inflation.b. The share of profits in national incomes has been falling overseveral years and there is a risk that illiquidity of United Kingdomcompanies may hamper their investment or mako them a prey to takeover.This could be eased by a further relaxation of the corporate taxburden tied to investment, through full free depreciation.c. Energy policy.   We have spread our bets too widely in thedevelopment of nuclear energy and wasted money.   Looking ahead, thedominance of the Middle East in proven oil reserves looks capableof imposing a stranglehold over traditional sources of western european energy supply.   This may be eased for the United Kingdom byexploitation of the Continental Shelf in the short-term and inthe longer term by nuclear energy.   There are high stakes attaching to getting our national energy policy right in this changing situation.d. Experience has shown that disengagement from collapsingcompanies tout court is not always practicable.   The Government mayhave to help to raise a phoenix from the ashes.   A new agency, or a modified existing one, may be needed, which, in addition to any government finance provided in special situations, could mobiliseprivate capital.   Such private capital should be genuine riskcapital raised without Government guarantee.16
Longer-term Problems and Prospects10.   The major objective, of which the urgency is increased by the prospectof increased competition with Europe, is to increase the competitivenessand productivity of British industry.   This depends on i. an improvementin the quantity and quality of investment; ii. a new attitude ofresponsibility and co-operation between labour and management;iii. ameliorating the wages and prices problem so as to remove theneed for stop-go policies; iv.   opportunities for co-operation between british and European industry.11.   The instruments available to the Government in achieving this are -a. Regulation of the level of demand and of the exchange ratepolicies so as to provide confidence of steady growth of output;b. a fiscal policy with provides both incentives and liquidityfor investment;c. an anti-paternalist policy which discourages union and managementfrom believing that &quot;the Government will see us through&quot;;d. education:   improvement of both technical education, includingindustrial training, and education in the working of the economic system;e. harmonisation of company tax and other practices with european countries, so as to minimise obstacles to mergers, eg the obstaclesencountered by Dunlop/Pirelli. Removal of non-tariff barriers willbecome important as tariffs fall.
REVIEW 0? GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffIII B&apos; agriculture the Situation in 1970I.     Average net income per farm in real terms was no higher in 1968-70than it was in the mid-1960s..     The volume of net product increased inthe same period by about 8 per cent.     Deficiency payments varied from theestimates by up to 31 per cent (1966-67)0     The Conservative Party in opposition welcomed the report of the Agricultural EDC (1968) whichestimated that net farm output could be increased by about 22 per cent by1972-73? which, it was estimated, could save about  220 million worth ofimports - without making allowance for loss of exports.     Against this background the main 1970 Manifesto pledges were -a. to increase production;b. to improve farm incomes;c. to save more agricultural imports.Conditions of international trade precluded achievement of these objectiveswithin present support systems without prohibitive Exchequer cost.     It wastherefore proposed to introduce a levy system which would transfer the costof deficiency payments in stages from taxpayer to consumer.    Such asystem would also remove the difficulties caused for the Government by thefluctuations in the amount paid in deficiency payments and would align theUnited Kingdom with the e.c. -Common Agricultural Policy.2,    Subsidiary pledges were to derate any agricultural buildings whichhad become rated;   to continue to encourage horticulture through thehorticulture improvement scheme and the Central Council for agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation;   to recognise that a thriving and expanding forestry industry could save imports and employ land and labour,specially in Scotland;   and to protect the home fishing industry.Progress to date*    The first phase of a levy scheme came into action in July 1971?   its effects initially will be minor (unless there is a major shift in world prices) and will dovetail into tbe Common Agricultural Policy.     In the
mean-time deficiency payments are still &quot;bearing a large part of support,48 per cent in 1971-72;   they were increased for major products inOctober 1970 a^d again at the Price Review of 1971o4o     In response to the general pledge of &quot;Less Government&quot;, reductions inthe state advisory services and other Ministry activities have been made which could reduce Ministry staff by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent by 1974o    Policy far forestry is under review.     The state of the fishing industry depends largely on the final outcome of the e.c. negotiations.The derating pledge was met by the Rating Act (l97l), effective from1 April 1971-Short-term Problems and Prospects5o     Though the evidence is still unclear, there seems to have been nonet increase in farm incomes in real terms in 1970-71*     Volume of netproduction has increased by an estimated 3jt per cent.     The extent of theincrease in food prices, farm income, and production up to 1974-75 dependslargely on the exact nature of the process of transition to the common agricultural Policy:   most estimates that have been made are probablytowards the top of the likely range.Longer-term Problems and Prospects6.     The result of these policies and of United Kingdom adherence to theCommon Agricultural Policy in its present form will be to increase theresources used for food production here.     General farm incomes will increase in real terms, production will increase and prices will increase,though some sectors (eg horticulture and pigs) may face problems.     Thisis an area where Government objectives are clear and their implementationin hand.     Fundamental questions remain, however.     These are:a. The implication of present policies is that agriculture is toremain among the more highly protected industries. ..   There is noexplicit formulation of what the proper level of that protectionshould be, nor of the factors that should be involved in reaching sucha formulation, eg import saving, loss of exports, social consequences of depressed agriculture, amenity, strategic implications, or regionalimplications.     At the same time, adherence to the present common agricultural Policy will make any flexibility in the future moredifficult.b. Further implications of planned increases in production, such asdangers to the amenity value of the countryside, should be investigated.19SECRET
REVIEW OP GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper &quot;by the Central Policy Review StaffIV A. INDUSTRIAL relations the Situation in 19701.     The Government took office against the immediate background of -a. labour&apos;s failure to reform the Trade Unions, the new administration&quot;s own pre-Election pledge to introduce legislation as a matter of priority, and the strong hostility of the TUC toany such legislation;b. the increasing power within the Trade Union movement of leftwing militancy - often operating at shop floor level in defiance of unions&apos; executives;Co     a high and rising level of industrial stoppages, official andunofficial, together with an escalating level of inflationarywage settlements*2o     Underlying these factors were 2 more general problems:a.     a deep-rooted mutual antagonism   between the two sides ofindustry;bo     a labour-management balance of power which had shifteddecisively in the former&apos;s favour over the yearsoProgress to Date3o     The Industrial Relations Act has been passed, aid the draft Code ofIndustrial Relations drawn up.     This is a notable achievement in itself;moreover, despite continuing public TUC hostility to the Act, there were atone stage signs that the trade union movement was beginning to come to terms with the situation in practiceo    Nevertheless, the Act has beenexploited as &quot;divisive&quot; by the Opposition, and extreme militancy hasbecome more rather than less evident than it was 15 months ago (of theactivities of the &quot;Angry Brigade&quot; and the UCS situation)o4o     The Government has shown itself to be firm in resisting exorbitant wage claims in the public sector and the industrial action which has ensued,but there are as yet few signs of private sector toughess in holding out against inflationary claimso20
5&quot;     The strike record has improved if measured by the number of strikes,1,364 in the first 7 months of 1971 as against 2,587 in the same periodlast year, or by the number of workers involved, 774,000 compared with1,093,000.     The number of days lost in strikes has, however, worsenedin the first 7 months of this year, 11.2 million, compared with the sameperiod in 1970, 6.1 million days lost.Short-term Problems and Prospects6.    The most immediate problem facing the Government is how to ensure thatits major initiative in the industrial relations field, the new Act, gainsacceptanceo     The arrangements which the Department of Employment is making to monitor the economic and social effects of the Act should be helpful in this regard if their findings are promptly followed up.     But itmust be recognised that legislation is only a beginning,,     Moreover, theexperience of the past 2 years suggests that legislation exacerbates ratherthan improves the situation, at least in the short-term.     Finally, therewill inevitably be difficulties in &quot;running in&quot; the new machinery, whichare liable to be compounded by union non-co-operation and the reluctance of management to take a firm line.7.     These last 2 factors will also hinder the Government&apos;3 attack on another urgent short-term problem, that of reducing the economic damage caused by strikes and moderating the level of wage increases 0     TheGovernments general economic policies and the Confederation of BritishIndustry&apos;s July initiative may help here insofar as they lead to areduction in the rate of price increases and hence of wage demands;   onthe other hand, the new framework set up by the Industrial Relations Actmay further accentuate the trend towards long drawn out strikes.8.     The third short-term problem the Government faces is how to lower the currently inflamed temperature of debate about industrial affairs.While the Secretary of State for Employment has been notably successful in preserving some degree of rational discussion,   other Government actionshave given an impression of lack of concern over the plight of individualgroups of workers which has led to a more general disillusionment amongthe trade union movement.     If the climate of industrial relations is21
to be significantly improved in the short term, the Government must, asa matter of urgency, take steps to demonstrate, unequivocally, that itis as compassionate towards the unfortunate as it is tough towards theinefficient.Longer-term Problems and prospects .     Among the major long-term problems, perhaps the most significant isthe entrenched &quot;them and us&quot; attitude   on both sides of industry.    TheGovernment will find it difficult to attack this problem, not only because it is based on deeply held beliefs, together with long-established (andjealously defended) structures, but also because a Conservative Governmentis constrained to a significant extent from taking direct actions whichmight remedy the situation.     Nevertheless, policies might be considered to foster greater identification of workers&apos; and managements&apos; aims with each other;   to use the Government&apos;s own position as an employer to &quot;setan example&quot; to others;   to examine other countries&apos; experience with workerparticipation and to decide whether or how they might be relevant in theUnited Kingdom.10.   A second whole complex of long-term problems is posed by the changingstructure of British industry and society in general.     The changing balanceof power between labour and management in the former&apos;s favour;   the growth of affluence in certain sectors combined with a long-term decline in others,both of which trends can be expected to be accentuated by e.c. entry;   newlyperceived opportunities for a better life combined with the frustrationsimposed by a slow secular rate of real economic growth:   all these factorsare imposing greater and greater strains on the fabric- of industrial relations in Britains    Legal and economic sanctions can help redress thelabour-management balance of power, by encouraging the former to be more responsible and the latter to be more firm, but in the longer term it willbe necessary to take action on a broad front to develop a new structure ofindustrial relations which will encourage the individual worker or managerto feel himself part of an enterprise with an agreed goal, rather than asa partisan of one or the other &quot;side&quot; of industry, a concept which should22
become increasingly irrelevant with technological advance.     The role ofGovernment in dealing with the situation is far from clear, and the pace of change will inevitably be slow, but urgent thought needs to be givento ways in which the pattern of Britain&apos;s industrial relations can be adapted to modern realities.11.   The major responsibility for improving industrial relations at the plant floor level must inevitably rest vrlth management.     In presentingpolicies, both short-term and long-term, proper emphasis needs to begiven to this.     Otherwise the Trades Unions will feel they are beingsingled out for attack., when in fact a significant amount of the problem is caused by inefficient management.23
REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review--StaffIV B. MANPOWERThe Initial situation.     The Government came to power against the background of -a. a relatively high but not yet intolerable level of unemployment;b. a much more serious manpower situation in the development areas,including both heavy unemployment and the dependence of many of thosestill employed on declining industries;c. the likelihood that a number of the new Administration^ policies,eg sharper competition and no more State aid for &quot;lame ducks&quot;, xirouldexacerbate the problem in the short run.Progress to Date2.     Unemployment has risen to a post-war peak, with rates in the SpecialDevelopment Areas predictably worse than the national average.   Apart fromgeneral reflationary action, the Government has taken or proposed a numberof specific measures in the manpower field, including increases inGovernment Training Centre facilities and training allowances, special training grants for the over-45s, and the programme for &quot;humanising&quot; labour exchanges and for providing computerised &quot;job banks&quot;.   A number ofinstitutional reviews of the instruments of manpower policy are being undertaken, including an examination of the employment services as partof the 1971 PAR, studies of a possible National Manpower Commission and areappraisal of the work of the Industrial Training Boards.Short-term Problems and Prospects3.     The immediate situation is one of costly wastage of real resources interms of idle manpower, together with increasingly expensive transferexpenditures on unemployment and supplementary benefit and redundancy payments.   The reduction of unemployment to a more tolerable level must bea prime aim of economic policy in general: meanwhile manpower policy shouldtake advantage of this latest phase in the long-term structural shake-outof British industry to ensure that, once the economy starts to grow again24
effective redeployment can also move forward speedily.   This entails,inter alia, making training a real alternative to employment, and one whichis perceived to he such by the unemployed - a state of affairs which doesnot seem to pertain as yet.   For example, the current take-up rate of places at Government Training Centres is still below target levels: this situation represents a waste of both facilities and manpower which could bebeing trained but is not.   Manpower policy should start by ensuring that existing training opportunities are fully used.   It should then go on toconsider how to extend training facilities to cover the maximum possible number of the unemployed.4.     Suoh a policy would be expensive in the short-term.   But it would paylarge dividends.   If there is to be an eventual economic &quot;boom&quot; withoutover-heating in growth sectors, the opportunity to turn as many as possible of today&apos;s redundant into tomorrow1s productively redeployed must be quickly seized,5.     The problems facing national manpower policy arc accentuated byregional variations in employment opportunities.   In order to avoid a repetition of the manpower problems faced in previous expansionaryphases - where acute labour shortages in the growth sectors   (and regions)coexisted with continuing unemployment in the development areas -decisions need to be taken now on the relative desirability of policiesa. to assist migration from areas of high structural unemployment orb. to assist the re-establishment of new growth industries in those areas.The problem with migration is that the short-term solution it providesin the employment/manpower field creates severe long-term difficulties for both the declining and growing regions.   Prima facie, it would appearpreferable to encourage economically viable industries to locate themselvesmore evenly over the country than they are today.6.     The short-term manpower situation is one of current over- supply oflabour, exacerbated by regional differentials, which is likely to befollowed by gradual absorption of today*s unemployed as the economy startsto expand again.   This current period of slack presents a major politicaland economic problem, but also a major opportunity for manpower policies.25
The immediate objective should be to prepare the currently umemployed for subsequent productive jobs, so that when the demand for manpowerbegins to rise, the market can be supplied without excessive increases in labour costs.   A determined and massive retraining programme might also have a significantly beneficial effect on the present industrial climate.Rightly or wrongly, the Government is coming to be regarded as unfeelingwhere workers are concerned.   To be seen to be doing something positivein the manpower field could greatly improve the difficult currentpolitical and economic situation.Longer-term Problems ^and Prospects7.     The changing structure of industry, and the rate at which change canbe expected to increase, pose fundamental problems in the manpower field.If, for example, the prospect, as seems likely, is one of acceleratinglong-term decline of ?abstain kinds of industry which currently employ alarge proportion of the labour force, massive retraining and redeploymentefforts will be necessary.   Moreover, th^ increasing pace of technologicaladvance may tend to create greater unemployment, in growth as well asdeclining industries, than it turned out to do in the 1960s.8.     The longer term prospect, therefore, is for a much more fluid manpox-jersituation, with more changing of jobs entailing more adaptability andwillingness to accept retraining.   Workers, including managerial workers,will have to adjust to new methods of work and accept the end of the&apos;singlejob&quot; career.   If heavy old-style unemployment and/or extensive directionof labour are to be avoided, the adjustment process will probably entailmuch greater emphasis on education to a higher level than hitherto, for afar greater proportion of the population.   e.c. entry will also make it moreand more necessary to invest heavily in education, to ensure that theUnited Kingdom keeps up with its partners in its output of trained manpower,and does not become the Commtinity^ &quot;reserve pool&quot; of unskilled labour.9.     Finally, longer term manpower policy may need to be concerned withthe age structure of the population.   Current projections indicate that the&quot;dependency ratio&quot;, the ratio of children and old people to those ofworking age, will, after a long period of rapid increase, tend to level26
off in the next 30 years.   Thus, while the number of children or retiredpeople per 1,000 people of working age rose from 488 in 1941 to 655 inI969, it is expected to increase to only 677 by I98I and actually to fall to 642 by 2001.   On the other hand, countervailing trends such as moretertiary education, a greater demand for leisure and a trend towardsearlier retirement will almost certainly require the emphasis on stillhigher levels of manpower productivity to be maintained, even in the longer term.27
REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Revie StaffV- THE REGIONSThe Situation in 19701.    The regional problem is a structural one, largely brought about by thedecline of the old basic industries, in particular coal-mining, textiles,shipbuilding and certain types of heavy engineering.2o     The imbalance between the regions had been growing less over the last10 years, though in some areas, Scotland in particular, there has recentlybeen a deterioration.    Since the problem is structural, the process ofnarrowing the gap will be a long-drawn out one, taking 10 or 15 years atleast.     No rapid reduction in the existing imbalance can be expected.Only a period of much more rapid growth in the economy can bring about a significant reduction in \uiemployment, but even then the underlyingstructural problem will remain unsolved.     Unemployment in the development areas will continue to be well above the national average and there willcontinue to be under-utilised, wasted resources in the development areas and intermediate areas.     This cannot be considered a so-tisfactory prospect.3o    The objectives of the Government&apos;s regional policy are to eliminate the imbalance between the regions, particularly in the level of unemployment,with the waste of resources and the human suffering this involves, and to stimulate long-term growth.     The means used to achieve these objectives area combination of stick and carrot, the control of industrial buildingthrough the system of Industrial Development Certificates and various formsof assistance, eg free depreciation allowances, grants and loans forfactory buildings and other purposes, an initial allowance of 40 per centon industrial buildings, the provision of advance factories, traininggrants, removal grants and the Regional Employment Premium (to be withdrawnin September 1974)&quot;Progress to Date4* The Government undertook to stimulate long-term growth by increasingthe basic economic attraction of the areas concerned, to link expendituremore closely to the creation of new jobs, especially in industries with
growth potential;   to concentrate public investment in growth centres;to initiate a thorough-going study of development area policy, as recommended by the Hunt Committee;   to phase out the Regional employment premium;   to maintain financial incentives for investment in the development areas, making greater use of the powers given by the Local Employment Acts,and use these powers where appropriate in the intermediate areas;   to givefairer treatment to the service industries and to commerce;   to give special attention to the needs of the development areas in plans for amassive increase in retraining facilities;   to switch some resources from the present general subsidies towards better training schemes and theinfrastructure needed to make both development and intermediate areasmore attractive to live and invest in;   and to continue to providefinancial assistance to the Northern Ireland Government.5o     The additional expenditure of well over  100 million on infrastructureover the next 3 years is designed at least partly to increase the basiceconomic attractions of the development and intermediate areas.     It will,however, create only a rather modest amount of additional employment.The abolition of investment grants has meant that assistance is more closely linked with job-creation.     There has been little effectiveconcentration of public investment in growth centres.     A thorough-goingstudy of development area policy was undertaken immediately afterJune 1970, resulting in the new policies announced in October 1970 and february 19710    Further policy studies are being carried out by the cprs.     The Regional Employment Premium is to be phased out by september 1974&apos;     Financial incentives to the development areas have notbeen maintained.     The replacement of investment grants by free depreciation plus certain additional incentives has probably meant aslight reduction in the value of financial incentives to manufacturing industry, though service industries are now better placed than before.The re-introduction of tax allowances has, however, had an important effect on the liquidity of profitable firms.     The assistance available under the Local Employment Acts has been extended and greater flexibilityintroduced.    Service industries have been put on the same footing asmanufacturing industries with regard to free depreciation and the phasingout of SET will also mean fairer treatment for service industries.     There
has been no massive increase in -training facilities, nor are there plans in hand for such an increaseo     The abolition of investment grants willeffect large savings in public expenditure and over  100 million of thisis being used to step up spending on infrastructureo     The Northern ireland government is continuing to receive financial assistance.Short-term Problems and Prospects6.     Regional policies have mainly been concerned with directing a.ndattracting manufacturing industry to development areas and has resultedin an imbalance between manufacturing and service industries.   Assistancehas been too indiscriminate both as to the candidates for assistance andthe areas to be assisted.     There has&apos; not been enough concentration ongrowth points.     The role of migration, both inter-regional and intra-regional to growth points, in helping to solve regional developmentproblems has not been given enough emphasis, though the political difficulties involved cannot be ignored.7.     Current policies put the emphasis on attracting investment from outside the development areas rather than encouraging indigenous enterprisoand investment.    This has resulted in a large number of subsidiaries of outside or overseas firms being set up, having little relationship orlinkage with each other.     The emphasis on investment from outside thedevelopment areas has been linked very closely with the misleading concept of attracting or directing &quot;mobile industry&quot;.     The objective shouldrather be to build up a thriving regional economy, capable of self-sustaining growth, based so far as possible on local business interestssetting up a complex of linked industries with good growth prospects.Regional policies have concentrated too much on financial incentives andnot enough on operational aspects and supporting services, eg greatly improved training and re-training facilities, housing of various types,environmental aspects, amenities, accessibility.    Many of these, withthe notable exception of the first, will only produce results in thelong-term, but this is true of all regional policies.8.     Above all, even though there may be a development strategy for theparticular region, there is no administrative agency to implement it.Even the proposed new Regional Development Agency would be very restricted in scope.    Regional Planning Boards and Councils have only advisory powers,
no executive authority.   The execution of regional policies and programmes is split between innumerable local authorities, the regional offices of departments and the Departments in Whitehall itself.   There is at present no means for co-ordinating the activities of these various agencies.9.     In preparation for our joining the e.c. we need to consider initiativeswhich we might take to establish a European regional development policyfinanced by a European fund.10.   The policy changes so far implemented cannot realistically beexpected to have any significant impact by 1974-75, either on the rate atwhich regional imbalances are rectified or on public opinion.Longer-term Problems and Prospects11.     The instruments at the Government&apos;s disposal for the execution of amore effective regional policy in the long-term are inadequate.     If a development strategy for each region is to be drawn up and implemented,involving concentration of public expenditure on selected growth points,a policy concerning both manufacturing and service industries with growthpotential, the provision of infrastructure, training facilities, housing and amenities on a co-ordinated basis, then some regional executive agencymust exist with a budget and with powers to decide priorities and allocateexpenditure.     If it is to be fully effective, it must be able to mobiliseregional resources and create new local initiatives.     There must, in a word, be devolution.12.    Effective devolution to the regional level of the formulation andimplementation of regional development policy could take a variety of forms:a. Regional development banks with powers not only to make loansbut also to finance certain services.b. Regional development authorities with powers to administer themeasures under the Local Employment Acts and to allocate certain parts of infrastructure expenditure within agreed totals.c. Regionally elected bodies forming a third tier in theadministration of local government.
f13*     The case for proposals along these lines, their relative merits,their administrative advantages and disadvantages and their legislativeimplications will need careful study.     Any changes would have to heco-ordinated with the reforms in local government and with the work ofthe Royal Commission on the Constitution.     Thus, even if a programme of devolution were pushed forward with the greatest urgency, it would not he possible to have effective regional bodies in operation before 1974*32
REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT- strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffVI A. housing the Situation in 19701.     It was more and more widely accepted that there was no national&quot;housing problem&quot;, but a situation in which some areas suffered fromacute local problems, while elsewhere supply was more than equal to demand.40 per cent of the dwellings in England and Wales were unfit or in need of substantial repairs and improvement.     In England and Wales, less thanone family in three was paying the economic cost of their housing.Existing policies of subsidising house building had failed to deal withthe local problems, and had led elsewhere to waste of resources anduneconomic pricing of public housing.2.     There had been a falling off, especially in the public sector, fromthe very high levels of house building achieved in 1965-68.   Oner-occupation was increasing but private letting was decreasing,i.     The Government promised, anong other things, to renegotiate thehouoiii; - subsidy system, to increase owner-occupation, to modernise olderhouses, and, implicitly, to reverse the falling trend in building.Progress to Date4*    Firm proposals for reforming the system of housing finance have beenput forward in Cmnd 4728, Fair Deal for Housing.   The money ceiling on local authority mortgage advances has been removed, as have been therestrictions on the sale of council houses to tenants.Problems and. Prospects5.     The first step is to embody in legislation the proposals of cmnd 4728.     It is not yet clear what will be the impact of these reformson the housing situation as a whole, in either the short or the longer term - nor how they will affect the fulfilment of the Government&apos;s otherpromises in the housing field, see paragraph 3.Regret
6.    The impact of a &quot;fair rents&quot; policy will probably be felt throughoutthe housing market.     There may well be a flight from council tenanciesand a related move towards owner-occupation.     As part of this, morecouncil houses may be sold to tenants.     The existing downward trend in private letting may continue.    Decontrol of rents and, in the public sector, the increase in the relative significance of incentives for improvements may both encourage the modernisation of older houses.     Ingeneral, it is hard to assess how local authorities will react to thenew arrangements.     It may become more difficult to implement the promise to build more houses;     the 1971 PE3C report envisages a public sectorhouse building programme slightly higher than the 1970 level, but wellbelow that of I965-68.     There may in fact be some tension between the traditional and relatively short-term objective of building more houses in aggregate, and the more radical and longer-term objective of reformingthe housing market - which means building houses only where they are needed.7.     The effects of the proposed housing reforms are likely to be feltthroughout the housing market.     But although decisions have now beentaken on the principles, the details have yet to be presented toParliament in legislation.     In the very short term, they are bound to be politically contentious, both during the discussion of the Bill and afterwards, in specific cases when implementation begins.     Their impactshould start to become clear fairly soon after this, between 1972 and1974&apos;    Until then, Ministers&apos; main task will be to sell the proposals.One important aspect of this will be getting the public to understand the complexities of the housing situation and, especially if there islikely to be a continuing decline in the house building programme, tokill for ever the idea that there is a single simple indicator of success in housing policy in the form of the total number of houses built.8.     In due course, Ministers will need to consider the status and futureof rented housing, public and private.    Should the decline in privateletting be allowed to continue unchecked?   If it is true, as is claimed,that public housing will come to be regarded as &quot;welfare housing&quot; and asa kind of residual social service for those who cannot aspire to owner-ship, what would be the implications of this change in outlook?    is there a point beyond which encouragement of owner-occupation ceases to bea desirable objective?
REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper &quot;by the Central Policy Review StaffVI B. transport the Situation in 19701.     In cities, the pressxire of traffic threatened the urban fabric and made it increasingly difficult to provide adequate and efficient public transport services, themselves one essential means of relieving this pressure.    Outside cities, public transport was finding it no easier to compete.     Many rail services were being run at a loss in the face ofincreasing competition from road transport.    Many bus services, some ofwhich had rep&apos;laced unremunerativo rail services, were being run at a lossdue to the inroads of the private car.     The 1968 Transport Act made a clear distinction between commercial and unremunerative services, thelatter being supported by specific grants.     Expenditure on roads was growing much faster than public expenditure as a whole.     But on therailways, most of the easy decisions about pruning services had beentaken and the closure programme was losing its momentum.2.     The Government did not commit itself at the outset to any distinctivepolicies in the transport field, beyond promising to abolish some of the detailed controls introduced by the previous Administration.Progress to Bate3.     Some detailed controls have been abolished.     In the current H3SCperiod, expenditure on roads is forecast as growing at 6 per cent a year.Capital investment by the railways is forecast as remaining fairlyconstant.    The general thrust of transport policy has been,to intensifythe existing trend towards adjusting supply more closely to demand.4* This has not been easy to do in practice. The proposal to withdraw the subsidies to London commuter rail services has been frustrated by the impossibility of introducing the necessary contingent fare increases under the present price restraint policy. Proposals for a further round of closures of unremunerative rail services have been made, but ministers have now asked for them to be reviewed. On the other hand, a move towards making the supply of passenger road transport more responsive to35
demand in rural areas has been made in the form of the proposals todismantle the existing licensing arrangements.     In the current PARexercise, the Department of the Environment is studying public transportoutside towns.Short-term Problems and Prospects5*     The Government has not publicly committed itself to a distinctivetransport policy.     Economic and political constraints have preventedfree play being given to market forces.    Outside cities, the rail closureprogramme in particular looks like losing its direction;   it appearssomewhat anomalous to withdraw rail services on which existing jobsdepend at the same time as attempts are being made to provide new jobs,at a high cost per job, through public l-rorks programmes.    Part of theproblem is a lack of clearly defined objectives.     The Department of the environment PAR should help to clarify the objectives of providing public transport services outside towns and thus   to refine the criteria for deciding whether or not to maintain them.     But Ministers are likely tocontinue to find it hard to withstand the more narrowly financialarguments for withdrawing services, unpalatable though the logic of this may sometimes be.    On present criteria, the need for a continuingprogramme of railway closures will continue to be strong.   If unremunerativeservices cannot be justified on wider grounds, there will be two mainalternatives to preserving them, at considerable cost to the Exchequer:first, allowing them to be replaced by others operating more economically,which will probably mean sharp increases in faros;   or secondly, withdrawingthem altogether, with the consequent problems of providing for people who do not have access to private transport.     Inside cities, there is little prospect of revolutionary changes in traffic management techniques inthe near future and central government will have to continue to be closelyinvolved in the provision of public transport.Longer-term Problems and Prospects6.     Objectives need to be defined in this field.    What is the relationship of transport policy to policies and objectives in the fields of local employment, the regions, the environment, agriculture and industry?Unless new arguments can be developed in terms related to these areas,   stillmore radical changes will have to be made to the railway network.     It willbe necessary to reach a view about public arf-fiscal policy towards the private oar;and, depending on the outcome of pilot road-pricing schemes, on whether tointroduce something on these lines.     This would certainly be politicallycontentious, and probably not practicable until the end of the decade.36SECRET
REVIEW OF OOVERMEHT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffVI C.   AMENITYThe Situation in 197,0The situation which the Government inherited on the environmental frontdoes not need description.   The basic question was two-fold:   first toensure better and more comprehensive planning, more responsive to the needsof those affected by it;    second, to control and limit actual pollution ofthe environment.   The previous Government had made a start in dealing withthese problems, for instance by putting a single Minister in charge of the ministries of Housing and Local Government and of Transport, and by settingup a standing Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution.   The present government promised to improve the machinery of government, to reviewexisting legislation, and to improve the environment in general.Progress to Date2.     Steps have been taken in several fields which, while not adding upto an &quot;environmental policy&quot;, deal in different ways with the two-foldproblem mentioned above.   The DOE has been created - a notable advance,at least in principle, on the previous set up.   The reorganisation of localgovernmentj when completed, should create units of government better ableto plan comprehensively and to devote resources to dealing with questionsof amenity.   The proposed reorganisation of water and sewage should make for more efficient administration and control of pollution.   More moneywill be made available for clearing derelict land.   The improvement of olderhousing will also help.   Individual planning decisions - most notably onthe Third London Airport as well as, for instance, on applications to building the Green Belt - have given an earnest of the Government&apos;s thinking.-^0JTJrt-eJ^JP^0blems and Prospects3o     Individual planning decisions have immediate impact.   They also help to create a climate of opinion and influence the nature of future planningapplications.   But most of the other action taken or contemplated in the&quot;environment&quot; field is unlikely to have any perceptible impact in the shortterm.   This is partly because we have already more or less defined the
environment of 1975 (because of the length of lead-time for building, forinstance, a sewage works), partly because even where money is available(eg for clearing derelict land) it is difficult to push those responsiblefor spending it, in this case local authorities, faster than they want togo.      Even drastic action, for instance in imposing noise restrictionson new vehicles, will at best produce in the short term a levelling offin presently rising trends.Longer-term Problems and Prospects4o     A major constraint in this field is the fact that preserving the environment can be extremely costly.     Increases in industrial costs maywell make some marginal activities unprofitable.     In addition, &quot;makingthe polluter pay for his pollution&quot; will mean, in the case of manufacturing industry, that it is the consumer who pays in the end.     As long as profitsare low, unemployment high and prices rising the rationale behindenvironmental policies will need to be explicit and agreed.     Anomaloussituations can be avoided only if policy towards the environment is more closely related to policies in other fields and especially to economic andindustrial policy as a whole.5.o     Government intervention in this field will often be necessary, and individual and local choice will have to be overridden in the interestsof other groups of the community at large.     This makes it important thatthe costs of preserving amenities be identified and appreciated.     It willbe the task of Government to define the issues and to cost the options:to explain, for instance, how much more the average motorist would haveto pay for his car if pollution from petrol fumes were to be significantly reduced.     This is all the more important where &quot;pollution&quot; is in fact a natural consequence of rising population and standards of living;   aGovernment facing opposition to, for example, the construction of a newreservoir must, in its own interest, take pains to explain what would bethe costs to the potential consumers of water of not building it.Ultimately, a rational and acceptable policy towards the environment mustbe based on a ranking of costed alternatives which takes account so far aspossible of the opinions of those affected.
REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffVIIA.   HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL services the Situation in 1970The Government1s pledges as contained in the Conservative PartyManifesto are:organisation . To improve the administration of the Health Servicesb. To co-ordinate more effectively the 3 main branches of theNational Health Service - the hospitals, general practitioners andlocal Health ServicesCo     To improve arrangements for General Practice, by increasingthe number of Health Centres and encouraging Group practicesoPriorities and Standardsdo   To develop and improve the Social Servicese.   To determine more sensible priorities, giving more emphasisto care for the elderly, chronic sick and handicapped, and to providing help in the homeProceduralfo   To find better ways of dealing with suggestions and complaintsfrom patients and staffProgress to date2o     The Government have taken the following action:a.   Allocated an extra  110 million last year to these services,primarily to help meet the needs of the elderly, the mentally illand the handicapped;   and are considering adding a further 118 million in this year5s PESC for special capital programmes of high priority.bo   In pursuance of the government&apos;s policies to reduce taxation andto dispense free Government services more selectively, cheap welfare milk has been abolished and more milk made available free to those in need.   Charges for prescriptions and dental and ophthalmic treatmenthave been increased, and the increase has been offset by improvedremission arrangements.
c. Proposals for a unified and more efficient management of theHoalth Services on the basis of a two-tier structure have beenpublishedo     The reorganisation should take effect in 1974? atthe same time as the reorganisation of local government;   and the links between the National Health Service and the local personal social services are being studied.d. The role and organisation of the Department of Health and social security headquarters and of the executive authorities, are being reviewed with the help of outside consultants.e. The appointment of Health Commissioners to deal with complaintshas been agreed by Ministers in Committee, but not yet by theCabinet.Short-term Problems and Prospects3.     The transfer of resources to the Health a-nd Personal Social Services(paragraph 2a. above) represents a significant adjustment of priorities and a determined and coherent effort to meet existing pledges.     Action isin train to give effect to the remaining short-term pledges.     decisions on further increases in the prescription charges have still to be taken.4.     A major short-term issue arises out of the reviews of the role and organisation of the Department and of the health authorities(paragraph 2d. above).   Broadly speaking, the Department has in the pastoperated by issuing circulars to the executive authorities in the fieldsetting out the Departments desiderata.    But it has been largely leftto the executive authorities to implement the policies when they feel thatthey can do so within the resources allowed to them.     Thus they haveeffectively decided priorities between one departmental policy and another.Decisions will soon be required on whether this should continue to be the role of the Department, or whether it should adopt a more positive role of central direction of resources to given objectives laid down by theDepartment.     The PPB system which the Department is developing should enable it to play a more positive role more effectively.Longer-term Problems and Prospects5o     The availability of national resources of money and manpower are the major constraints operating on the Health and Personal Social Services.Expenditure on these services over the period 1971-72 to 1975-76, not
including the  118 million mentioned in paragraph 2a. above, Is risingsignificantly faster than public expenditure as a whole (4=8 per cent per annum compared with 2.6 per cent per annum).     This rate of growthcannot be sustained into the 1980s without either an increase in public expenditure, and hence in taxation, or very significant shifts of resources from other programmes.     Ministers may have a clear strategy for one or other alternative;   but if they have not, they will wish toexamine the consequences of:a. reducing the long-term rate of growth of resources on these services - perhaps by reducing standards or by abandoning certain services altogether;   orb. financing them, and the National Health Service in particular,in new ways, so as to relieve, if not the resource burden, at least the burden of public sector financing.The financing of the National Health Service has in fact been recentlystudied and the arguments against new forms of finance have been acceptedby the Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     ButMinisters may wish to examine the viability of present rates of growth ofthe Health and Personal Social Services, and their financing, in the yearsbeyond the current PESO period.6.     Demand for the Services is potentially unlimited, and to a largeextent supply-determined.     It cannot, therefore, be satisfied in thenormal sense of that word.     In such a situation it is essential todetermine priorities between objectives and programmes in order tocontrol the total, and concentrate on the more important components oftotal demand.7.     Much, if not most, of the demand for more resources for the health services comes from the medical profession itself.     Attempts to chokethis demand off would be ineffective and misconceived.     The solutionof the problem lies in involving the medical profession more fully indecisions about resource alloca/bion throughout the Service.     Actionalready in hand to achieve this should be pressed   forwa.rd with thegreatest urgency.41ccrscT
8.     With manpower perhaps in the longer rim a more severe constraint-than money, less skilled labour should be substituted for the more highly skilled throughout the Health Services, and productivity must bo improved in all Services.     This cannot be done in the teeth of opposition fromthe professions concerned, but all means must be used to secure their co-operation.9. Management of the Health Services will remain a major problem, but the foundations for better management have been laid (paragraph 2c. above).10.   The problems of deficiencies of care - of the elderly, of children,of the physically and mentally handicapped, and of the inadequate anddeprived - need to be studied and tackled in a comprehensive and properlyarticulated way.     Among other studies, the Department of Health a.ndSocial Security is this year carrying out a PAR on the Elderly in thecourse of which all aspects of the problem, including those which arethe responsibility of other Departments than the Department of health and Social Security, are being considered.     It is important that studies of such problems should continue to be tackled fundamentally and in all their aspects.11.   More and better designed and co-ordinated research appears to benecessary.     This is not perhaps primarily a question of resources, as ofthe proper formulation and mounting of research projectsj   the iiarnessingof the best brains in the field to well-thought-out customer-orientedapplied research?   the balance in the Health field between clinical and operations-oriented research;   and the building-up of a body ofprofessionally qualified advisers, with a good organisation and careerstructure (like the economists).42
REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffVII B. SOCIAL security the Situation in 1970The pledges in the Conservative Party Manifesto are:a.Retirement Pensions - biennial review- purchasing power to be at least maintained- pensions as of right to the over-80&apos;s- continue to ease the earnings rule- increase additions earned by postponingpensionsb. To improve the pension position of younger widows.c. To improve benefits for the long term sick and disabled and provide attendance allowance for the most seriously disabled.&amp;.     Earnings-related contributions to relieve flat rate burden.er.     To encourage earnings-related pensions through occupational schemes: to introduce a reserve earnings-related pensions scheme for those not covered by occupational schemes; to preserve occupational pension rights on change of job.f.      To tackle the problem of family poverty, giving adequate family allowances to those who need them.ft.      To seek a practical solution to the problems of introducing a negative income tax.h.      To deal with abuse of the Social Security system.Progress to date2.     The Government have:a. Reviewed retirement pensions to ensure that they at leastmaintain purchasing power.b. Eased the earnings rule for retirement pensioners and increasedadditions for postponed retirement.43
c. Provided pensions for the over-80&apos;s.d. Improved the benefits for the chronically sick and disabled.e. Introduced attendance allowance for the most seriously disabled.f. Provided pensions for women widowed between the ages of 40 and 50.g. Introduced family income supplement for poorer families whosehead is in full time work.h. Appointed a committee to look into the abuse of the social security system..... *i. Restricted the payments of supplementary benefits for strikersand those who are unemployed through their own fault; and stoppedretrospective payment for the first 3 days off work through sicknessor unemployment.-Short-Term Problems and Prospects3.     The G-Qvernment has a comprehensive and coherent strategy in this fieldcovering nearly all existing pledges in one way or another.   The Finer reporton the one-parent family may raise issues for decision by Ministers.Longer-Te^rjnJ^roblems and Prospects4.     There are two major issues: the reconstruction of National Insurance,and Family Poverty.5.     On the former, Ministers published a Unite Paper (strategy for Pensions) setting out the G-overnment1 s long-term proposals for encouraging occupational pensions schemes, and providing a basio earnings-related State pension, with a State earnings-related scheme as a reserve.Pensions will be regularly reviewed to maintain purchasing power as aminimum.   This reconstruction is in line with the G-overnment&apos; s strategy toencourage people to provide for their own pensions as far as possible andwill set the stage for pensions for many years to come.6.     A study is being made of the disincentive effects of the presentsickness and unemployment benefits.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for Health and Social Security have agreed that44
these benefits should be taxed, and the possibility of doing this without causing even greater anomalies than would be removed is being studied.7.     Once the reconstruction is under way, there will be problems of adjustment to the scheme requiring Ministerial attention, notably thedisposal of improvements within any sum available between all pensioners,or, as recently, to particularly hard-pressed groups of people such as thelong-terra sick, the seriously disabled or the very old.8.     The reconstruction has, of course, fully taken account of the age atwhich retirement pensions shall be paid-   But as medical care and social conditions improve, more people may be able to continue working in one   -capacity or another,   ilnd since the ratio of retirement pensioners to working population will corfinue to deteriorate for another 10 years, itmight be sensible to encourage people to go on working, and if necessarytrain them to do so.9.     Much has already been done to relieve the problem of Family Povertyand a major study of possible future action is now before Ministers.   Thenumber of families living below or only a little above supplementary benefitlevel is now relatively small, and should be further reduced by the new family income Supplement (FIS), rent and rate rebates and the housing allowance.The problems that remain, mainly those of the hard-pressed family, disincen-&apos;tives and &quot;take-up&quot; are dealt with in the Family Poverty Review Report now before Ministers (HS(71) 7).10.   This report points to the limitations of the scheme of family allowances as a weapon against family poverty and to the possibility that the cumulative effect of means-tested benefits may be a disincentive to extra effort at certain income levels.   It outlines a scheme for the reorganisation of familysupport, (subject to the FIS scheme&apos;s proving workable), whereby family allowances (FAM) would be abolished; child tax allowances increased to compensate; and the FIS scheme extended. This could ease the problem of thedisincentive to increases in earnings at the benefit margin through a muchsmoother &quot;tapering off&quot; of benefit; provide a simpler means-tested benefit
which could take in free welfare milk and free school meals; extendbenefit into the &quot;hard-pressed&quot; areas just above the supplementary benefitlevel; and make possible greater &quot;take-up&quot;.   It would in effect act verymuch like a negative incomes tax scheme, would involve a direct incometest and would entail significant adjustment of the tax threshold.11.   It will liaise political problems, not least because of existing government pledges; the complexity of the issues; and the public discussionof poverty and the role of taxation in curing it which is bound to begenerated by publication of any new proposals.   The whole matter will there-fore need careful handling.12.   YJhatever Ministers decide on the Family Poverty Review, it willremain to ensure that performance is adequately monitored and researchedthereafter so that the facts about family poverty are always known and theGovernment is not caught ty being unable to prove that mistaken accusationsby pressure groups are wrong.
REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffVII C. education the Situation in 1970The Government&apos;s pledges in the field of Education as set out in theConservative Party Manifesto can be summarised briefly as follows:a&apos; To shift resources within the education budget in favour of primary schools.b. Recognition of the need to expand nursery education, particularly in areas of social handicapc     To maintain the existing rights of local education authorities tedecide what pattern of secondary education is best for their area.d. To raise the school-leaving age to 16 as planned.e. To encourage direct-grant schoolsf. To expand the number of plaoes in further and higher education.g. To carry out an enquiry into teacher training, as recommended bythe Plowden Committee.Progress to date2.     In accordance with the Government&apos;s intention to reduce taxation and shiftthe burden from the taxpayer to the user where the latter could afford to pay,the Secretary of State for Education and Science made cuts of  102 million inthe education budget (Cmnd 4578) by curtailing free school milk, increasingschool meal charges and increasing fees for further education.3.     In the 1971 PESC exercise it was agreed:a.     to add  33 million new starts to the primary school replacementprogramme for England in each of the three years 1973-74 to 1975-76(and broadly proportionate amounts for Scotland and Wales);47
&quot; b. Subject to confirmation, to improve standards for Polytechnicsand Colleges of Further Education at a cost during the 1971 to 1976PESC period of  11.8 million for Great Britain as a whole; andc.     to increased expenditure of  9 million on direct grant schools.To pay for these additions the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceproposes to find  126 million from the University programme   - a significantshift of resources from the University programme to primary education.1+.     A circular has been issued to local authorities indicating that theyare free to decide what pattern of secondary education is best for their area.   But the Secretary of State continues to take an active interest in local authority proposals.5. The James Committee has been appointed to enquire into teacher training.Short-term Problems and Prospects6.     The Government has made a good start in implementing a coherentstrategy for education which meets most of the immediate pledges made atthe time of the General Election.   Moreover, a clear choice ef prioritiesbetween different programmes in the education budget has been made.   Thenew PPB system of budgeting being introduced by the DES will be a significantaid to continuing this process.7.     The diversion of resources to primary education has been achieved atthe cost of expansion in the field of University education, reducing thegrowth of University expenditure from 9*4 per cent to 6.4 per cent per annum(though no mention was made of this in the Governments pledges).   Such areduction in provision cannot be kept secret and a reaction can be expected from the Universities when discussions on the next five years&apos; of Universityexpenditure open in the autumn.&quot;48
8.     No major initiative has been made in the field of nursery education.Despite a start in areas of social handicap, expenditure on nursery education is planned to rise by only 1.4 per cent per annum over the PESCperiod, and the G-overnment will face criticism if it does no more.   On theother hand, not every programme can be given high priority; the Government&apos;spledge (paragraph  1  (b))was restrictively worded; and it could be argued that it has been, or could be, met with little or no additional demand on resources.   Moreover, objectives in this field are mixed, the differingeconomic, educational and social aims being reflected in the variety of provision by the DES, the DHSS and the private sector.    These objectivesneed to be closely examined and articulated before the scale of provision,the means of providing and financing the service, and the type of supervisionrequired, whether by teachers or by less highly trained people, can be morerationally decided.Longer-term Problems and prospects .     The rate of growth of national resources and of qualified manpower willremain the major constraints on education in the longer term.   Expenditureon education over the PESC period is rising faster than public expenditure as a whole (4.6 per oent, compared with 2.6 per cent, per annum)   - mainly because of the raising of the school leaving age; the tendency for more children to stay on at school; the growing number of school leavers qualifying for higher education; and the progressive improvement in teacher/pupil ratios.In the past, high rates of growth of expenditure on education have beenpossible only because other programmes, such as Defence, Housing and Invest-raent in the Nationalised Industries have been cut back.    In future, ifeducation expenditure is to continue to rise faster than the overall rate,either a matching rate of economic growth must be achieved, or Ministersmust be prepared to continue to divert resources to education from other programmes.   In either case Ministers will continue to have to take decisions on priorities within the education budget, and will need a clear forwardstrategy in education in order to decide in advance what the balance shouldbe.ccrncT
10.   Three-quarters of the education budget is spent on manpower, mainlyqualified manpower with a high opportunity cost in the private sector.   Classsizes in schools are steadily improving, and before long Ministers will bein a position to choose whether to stop reducing class sizes, cut back onteacher training and use the resources elsewhere; or to continue to reduceclass sizes and maintain high rates of teacher recruitment and training.This raises a complex of issues, suoh as the future scale, deployment, pay and salary structure of the teaching profession; measures for increasingteacher productivity; the balance between teacher training and other formsof higher education; and the opportunities for higher education andemployment for large numbers of women3 single and married.11.   There remains the problem of the scale of provision and future organisation of further and higher education.   The Department of education and Science is already carrying out a fundamental PAR. on this problem tohelp to clarify objectives, and different ways of achieving them.   Theimmediate situation on University expenditure (paragraph 7 above) is part.ofthis problem, but Ministers must be in a position to reach a view within thenext 12 months on their longer term strategy over the whole field of tertiaryeducation.   The PAR should display the various options on the scale of student numbers in each area of higher education, standards of provision,and methods of financing as between the public and private sectors.   these issues will have to be studied as a whole before policy decisions can betaken.50
REVIEW OF GOVFiaWENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffVII D. THE LAW AND RACE RELATIONS -The Situation in 19701.     The Governments pledges, as set out in the Conservative PartyManifesto, can be summarised as follows.The. law a. To strengthen the policeb. To restore the prison building programme, especially maximumsecurity facilitiesc. To streamline the law to review the Official Secrets Acte*     To compensate victims of violence^-     To remove discrimination against women and clear away anomaliesin Family Law.Race. Relations and Immigration3*     To increase funds to local authorities with large immigrantpopulationsbt     To discontinue further large-scale permanent immigration, limitingwork permits to specific jobs in specific areas for set periodsi.     To allow existing Commonwealth immigrants to bring their wives q&amp;&amp;younger children into the countryj.     To assist Commonwealth immigrants wanting to return home but without harassmentk.     To introduce new single and permanent legislation to control allimmigration.Progress to date2.     The police pay settlement earlier this year was a generous one takingundermanning into account and providing advantages for long service officersand encouragement for early promotion.     There is some evidence thatrecruitment is improving.51
3.     A Criminal Justice Bill ia being discuesed,   which, amongst other provisions, streamlines the law and compensates the victims of violence.4.     A new prison building programme has been started.5.     A committee under Lord Franks is reviewing the Official Secrets Act.6.     Considerable progress is being made on discrimination against women and anomalies in Family Law in following up the Cripps report &quot;FairShares for the Fair Sex&quot;.7.     Additional funds are being channelled to local authorities with large immigrant populations through further developments in the urban programme, including the Community DevelCpment Project.8.     The remaining commitments on immigration are covered in the immigration Bill and its subsequent orders.Short-term Problems and prospects .     There are no obvious gaps in meeting the Government&apos;s commitments ininitiatives in these fields is a shortage of staff.    This is particularlyacute in considering the treatment of offenders, the subject of the 1971Home Office PAR, which is examining inter alia the balance betweencustodial and non-custodial treatment.     More imaginative and constructivepolicies will generally require more manpower and there is severe difficultyin attracting and training sufficient staff of the right quality for the prison and probation services.     An additional constraint has recentlyoperated on the parole scheme where the possibility of reducing the parolethreshhold, and thus releasing a significant number of men at present in prison, has been put aside largely because of the overall ceiling on non-industrial Civil Service numbers.    A number of manpower issues aretherefore likely to be thrown up by the Home Office PAE.10.    For the police, manpower is also a major problem.    But in this casethe answer lies not so much in increasing recruiting as in deployingpolice manpower to the best advantage, providing better support facilities,the short-term but it is clear that the major constraint on new policy52
concentrating on serious crime and msking &quot;better use of civilianauxiliaries.     The output budgeting system being developed for the policemay help in this respect but the structure of local independent police forces may narrow the room for improvement from the centre.11.   The PAR is also likely to highlight the crucial role of research inmost aspects of crime prevention, detection and cure.     Better designed and co-ordinated customer-orientated applied research may be needed, andefforts made to build up a body of researchers capable of meeting theGovernments needs.Longer-^erm Problems and Prospects12.     The Law.     In the long-term the most effective use of scarce staffin the fight against crime might be to concentrate the available resources on child care, now the responsibility of the Deportment of Health and social Security and the Department of Education and Science.     Immediateproblems of pay, recruitment and training all make the expansion of the probation service a long-term solution, and if this is to be undertakensome consideration might be given to transforming it into a nationalservice.     This would logically follow the reorganisation of the Courtsfollowing Beeching and might make a big improvement in morale and recruitment.     The prison building programme will require a large shareof available funds and design effort to meet the further growth ofprisoners, the more so if some existing buildings are to be replaced andthe present poor conditions improved.13o     Race Relations.   The next 10 years could be critical to the harmonyof race relations in this country.     If a growing divergence of differentcommunities is to be avoided, serious forward thinking is needed on suchproblems as the creation of ghettoes, housing, the coloured school leaver,the role of law in race relations;   and considerable co-ordination will berequired between housing, education, employment, and legal authorities toback up the day to day work of the Race Relations Board and the community relations Commission.14.     Immigration.   Once the present Immigration Bill is on the Statute Book,a breathing space will have been gained for the careful consideration of the longer term issues of immigration and the foundations on which policy shouldbe built.     The factors that might be taken into account in this are:   theeconomic needs of the country;   the net effect of immigration and emigration(very little being known about emigration at present); the consequences of joining the e.c. and the overall racial pattern in this country.53
REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT strategy supporting Paper by the Central Policy Review StaffVIII. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENTThe Situation in 19701.     When they came to power, the Government found a situation which wasdisturbing for 3 main reasons.a. Central Government had expanded beyond its sphere, especially inthe industrial field. Symptoms of this wore the fast groirth in publiexpenditure and in the numbers of civil servants.b. The capacity of central&quot;and local Government for effective and informed decision making did rot seem to be adequate.c. Because of these 2 factors, there was a- growing alienationbetween citizens and Government, especially in the provinces.2.     The Government had in opposition developed a number of ideas which-were intended to provide a strategy for these 3 grcat problems.a. The main elements of this thinking sre-ro that there was a properrole for Central Government, which could be defined and limited.There were activities at present done by Government which could bedone as well or better in the private sector.   There were alsoactivities which, at present concentrated under central Government,could be done as well or better if they were decentralised.   These2 principles can be called privatisation and devolution.b. The present central and local arms of Government needed radicalmodernisation.   For central Government, this involved reorganisation of the Ministries themselves into functional groups; greater efficiency in the Civil Service by control of numbers and increasedaccountability; fewer Cabinet Ministers and better collective Cabinetbriefing, and a move towards more effective considerations of options54
costs and benefits in policy making,.   For local government it meantas a first step the creation of effective units of administration,,c.     The Government believed that the alienation of people from government could be attacked with 2 main weapons: honesty andopenness.3.     These 3 ideas intermesh closely.   Devolution involves improvement in management structure, since Government is overcentralised; if it transfersfunctions to local Government this furthers the necessary developmentthere.   Openness is necessary for effective and fair accountability of theexecutive; which latter also involves clarity about the objectives whichhave been set for civil servants.   The openness necessary for efficiencyattacks the problem of the alienation of the public.   Privatisation bringsbenefits in limitation of Government size and better management.Progress to Date4.     The first few months of this Government sew an impressive attack on  of the 3 problems identified above.i. The size and scope of central Government was attacked by the campaign, not yet successful, on the size of the Civil Service.There was a major attempt to keep the rate of growth of public expenditure below that of the growth of GDP.ii. Ports nationalisation was stopped; Cooks and one or 2 other undertakings were denationalised.   The Industrial reorganisation corporation, the Prices and Incomes Board and a number of advisoryboards and committees were abolished; an attempt was made to lessen the involvement of Government money in private companies.   TheSecretary of State for the Environment proposed the abolition of alarge number of the 1,000 or so controls over local governmentactivities.55
iii. The capacity for effective government was improved &quot;by a majorreorganisation of central Government machinery, resulting infunctional Ministries, fewer Ministers, a smaller Cabinet, and theestablishment of the CPRS, PAR and the Defence Procurement Agency,A fundamental reform of local government into a 2-tier structure is planned, with a concomitant reform of the organisation of the national health Service, and proposals are under discussion for a similarreform of Water Resource Organisation,iv. About the relations between Government and people, little hasbeen done   Parliamentary ability to scrutinise Government has been improved by the reform of the Select Committee structure;Lord Pranks is investigating the workings of part of the official secrets Act and the Prime Minister has made proposals for a majorreform of Consumer Protection Policy.   But as we argue below, these will not be enough to make perceptible headway against the problem.5.     The impact of all these measures is of 2 sorts.   First the improve-ment of Government machinery and limitation of its size should steadilyincrease if the policies are adhered to; the impact of the localgovernment reforms will begin in 3-974 (1975, Scotland) when they come intoforce.   Second, there are those negative shock treatment policies,withdrawal of support from companies and cuts in programmes which are of aonce-for-all kind; they have certainly had an impact.   Whether the message which will be learnt from them is the right one will depend on whether theyare followed up with positive policies in the same direction.6.     There has been little progress with devolution.   It is not clear thatany real devolution will follow from the proposals for Local GovernmentReform.   The existing devolved powers will be organised far better, butthe Green Pamper on local government finance implies at best a lukewarmattitude towards the possibilities of finding new sources of local revenue.The argument over Health Service reorganisation was settled in favour of central direction; proposals 20 far brought forward for Water Resourcestend in the same direction; though DOE circular 2/7O relaxed loansanction procedures, the reform of housing finance has inevitably much56
96        Ireduced local discretion, in the housing field.   In education, centralpressure towards comprehensives has of course disappeared; hut pressure in the opposite sense has taken its place.   The decision against school milk for the over-7s has involved withholding local discretion about the financing of school milk out of the rates.   Local authorities incur nearly one-third of Government expenditure; but though the Rate Support Grantdiscussions are now to take place annually instead of bi-ennially, localauthorities can still take no part in PESO.   The conflict running through this is between devolution and, in the terms of the centre, efficiency.Devolution involves diversity and loss of uniformity: that is the point ofit.7.     The second attack on devolution derives from the closer than evercontrol that has been placed on the nationalised industries as part ofthe fight against inflation.   Nothing significant has yet been done orthought about open Government or the relations of Government with the publlittle impact can be expected from the Select Committee reform alone; thePranks Committee is studying a limited area; and developments inconsumerism are proposals only.Short-term Problems and Prospects8.     The urgent priorities are to develop policies in the fields ofprivatisation, devolution and Government relations with the public.   Inthe first, denationalisation itself has probably gone 3* far as it can.The next stage will be to consider steps such as tax incentives toencourage the use of resources in the private sector for functions whichwould otherwise have to be undertaken by the Government.   The social services, the arts, education and sport might benefit from such a policy.Devolution, in view of its importance to the total strategy, will need tobe pushed forward and the conflict resolved between uniformity and localdiscretion.   Insofar as these policies may involve potentially dangerousvariations in practice and standards, the dangers will need to be mitigated by a nextf approach to Government relations with the public.This might include a major development of the Government&apos;s activities onbehalf of the consumer.   It might also be worth considering a further development of the Select Committee system, and a general study of ways ofeffectively opening more of the processes of Government to MPs and others.57
Longer-term Problems and prospects .     None of the policies sketched here produce easily quantified results.By 1974-75 no impact will have been felt from local government reform.The &quot;shock-treatment&quot; mentioned earlier will probably have begun to wearoff, unless new policies follow it up.   Improvement of Government machinerywill be steadily taking effect; the vigour with which PAR is developed will affect the extent of this.   If the momentum towards devolution can be resumed in the near future, the effects will begin to be felt in 1974-75on a significant scale.   If the consumer and privatisation policies weredeveloped rapidly, their initial impact could precede the next election and their effect be cumulative thereafter.58
