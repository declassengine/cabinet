ConfidentialllS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST VS government cp(71) 134 COPY NO6215 November 1971CABINETPROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND REVIEWNote by the Prime Minister1. Earlier this year the Cabinet agreed to establish a system of programme Analysis and Review (PAR) and approved 11 subjects for studyin depth.2. In the course of the next two months the responsible Ministers will present their 1971 PAR reports to the appropriate Cabinet Committees.The details are set out in the Annex.3. In its first year the PAR system has faced special difficulties.    Manareas of policy were pre-empted from analysis by other government decisions and reviews already in train; and Departments were hampered by shortage of time and in some cases by lack of experience in these techniquesIn spice of this a great deal of work has been done; and the 1971 PAR studieswill provide both an opportunity for stocktaking over a wide range of policyquestions and a basis for a number of important decisions.4. The Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS), after consulting theDepartments concerned and the Treasury, will circulate memoranda on each PAR to the members of the relevant Committees.    These memorandawill draw attention to issues which relate to the Governments strategicobjectives and will suggest the major questions which may requirediscussion before final conclusions are reached.    AFTER the PAR reports have been discussed individually the CPRS will submit a report to theCabinet,, dealing with any wider implications which need collectivediscussion or decision.5. The comprehensive consideration by Ministers collectively of the issues raised in these reports is an essential part of the PAR system.Accordingly, I am asking the Chairmen of the Committees concerned toensure that sufficient time is available for these discussions and that theyreflect the essential difference between examination of PARs and normalCommittee business.    I hope that the Committees will pay particular attention to the quality of the analysis, will concentrate on the policy options
which the PARs provide and will reach firm conclusions.    these conclusions will normally relate to priorities within programmes; and theyshould accordingly be reflected in next year*s Public Expenditure Survey(PESC).    But3 if there are significant implications for priorities or levels of expenditure in other sectors, the CPRS will deal with these in theirreport to the Cabinet., in order that Ministers may consider them beforedetailed work on PESC is put In hand.6. PAR is a new system; and at this stage the procedures fox* dealingwith it must necessarily be experimental.    The arrangements which I amproposing will add to the work of the individual Cabinet Committees; but i hope that my colleagues will accept this as part of our general objective of improving our decision-taking machinery,,    In view of the omphasis whichwe have given to the PAR system In the White Paper on the reorganisation of Central Government and in evidence to the Select Committee on expenditure, I hope that we shall do all we can to see that this experimentsucceeds.E H10 Downing Street15 November 19712
