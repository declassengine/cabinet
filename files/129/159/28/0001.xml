If negotiations break down finally or if the agreed settlement is rejected in the Test of Acceptability, we shall have a very difficult situationwhen the Sanctions Order falls to be renewed in November 1972.    We shallhave three courses of action open to us -i. To repeal the sanctions legislation outstanding and divestourselves of our special responsibility for Rhodesia as the administering power.ii. To continue sanctions and to maintain our present position.iii. To continue sanctions but to divest ourselves of our special responsibility for Rhodesia as the metropolitan power.2. The objections to ending sanctions are manifold.    Probably themost compelling is that to do so would be to put ourselves in the positionof breaching the Charter (Article 25), with no adequate legal defence forour actions.    The Law Officers consider that the International Court wouldso hold if the question were referred to it.    This would have a grave and perhaps lasting effect on our standing in the United Nations and on ourrelations with many of our allies, notably the United States.    It could alsolead to serious action being taken by some countries against our economicand other interests, including a threat to certain of our communitiesoverseas.    To end sanctions without a settlement would also be in effect to concede Rhodesian independence on the unrevised 1969 Constitution, whichwe have always condemned.    However, we must accept that in the absenceof an agreed settlement we shall be under very strong pressure in theParty to &quot;recognise the facts&quot; and to abolish sanctions.    I assume that if weended sanctions we should also terminate our sovereignty; the legal aspect of this is dealt with in paragraph 4 below.1
3. Course (ii) would raise no legal or international difficulties, but itis unlikely to be welcome to a large proportion of the Party.    No doubt the motion for a renewal could be carried in the House because the opposition would presumably abstain, if not vote for it, but the number of defectionson our side would be large.4. Course (iii) would free us from the present responsibilities laid upon us as Administering Power, e.g. the responsibility for reporting sanctionsevasion to the Sanctions Committee.    This action would be likely to accelerate the breakdown of the sanctions system.    But this course, likeCourse (i), would be likely to cause us difficulties in the United Nations.The Law Officers consider however that the available arguments have-sufficient merit to be used as justification of a policy of terminatingsovereignty, though they advise that these arguments would probably not succeed before the International Court.    (By contrast the Law Officers can find no satisfactory argument for the abandonment of sanctions which involves a breach of Article 25, on which the whole United Nations system for maintaining peace and security rests).    By divesting ourselves of our special responsibility and thus putting ourselves in the same position as any other member of the United Nations, we might make the renewal of sanctions legislation somewhat more palatable to the Party and there wouldbe the prospect that sanctions would themselves become even morediscredited.5. There is no need for us to take a decision now on which course toadopt.    I hope that my negotiations with Mr Smith will produce a settlementthat will be found acceptable in the Test of Acceptability, and that we canrecommend to Parliament.    Nevertheless I think that my colleagues shouldbe aware of the difficult choices before us should a settlement prove impossible, and of the probability that one way or another we shall have to renew the sanctions legislation if we are to avoid the major difficulties that a deliberate breach of the United Nations Charter would involve us in.A D-foreign and Commonwealth office November 19712
