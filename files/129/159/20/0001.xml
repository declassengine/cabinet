CCD N Fl DENT&quot;! AlL-[document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(71) 120 COPY NO     D25 October 1971CABINETEMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS IN GREAT BRITAINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. At the meeting of the Cabinet on 3 August 1971(CM(71) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 7) it was agreed that discussions shouldbe held with the hotel and catering industry about the introduction of a quotato reduce the number of aliens admitted to take unskilled and semi-skilledwork in the industry and about measures to encourage a greater number ofsuitable indigenous workers to take employment in the industry.2. My Department, in consultation with the other Departmentsconcerned, has now completed these discussions.    The majority of theemployers1 organisations are opposed to any restrictions; the unions, onthe other hand, consider that no permits should be issued for aliens.Virtually none of the organisations consulted were prepared to discuss the size of the quota in rational terms, but some of the employers gave theirviews on how a quota might operate if, despite their representations, a quota were to be introduced.    During the discussions a number of suggestions were made for improving training arrangements for the industry;and for improving the facilities provided by the official employment services for the industry.3. In these circumstances, I consider that we should go ahead andintroduce a quota and that, as originally intended, it should apply tounskilled and semi-skilled male aliens from countries other than theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) or Denmark and Norway.    In orderto give the industry sufficient time to recruit and train more indigenouslabour, I propose that the quota should be introduced gradually and shouldbe set at 5, 500 permits for 1972 and 3, 500 permits for 1973; that we should announce the quota for both years at the same time; and that the quota for1974 should be determined later.    These figures should be compared with about 7,500 permits issued in 1970.    Detailed proposals for the operationof the quota are set out in the Annex.    I understand that these proposals are acceptable to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and to theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.1
4. The points raised by the industry about training provided by theGovernment and about the official employment services are being considered as a matter of urgency by my Department in consultation, as regardtraining, with the industry*s Industrial Training Board.    Points raisedabout the industry*s own training arrangements are being referred to theBoard for its consideration.5.        We have previously agreed on the other measures necessary toreduce the inflow of alien workers and I propose therefore, on theassumption that Parliament votes to join the e.c., that I should announceas soon as possible after 28 October that as from 1 January 1972:-i. No further permits for unskilled and semi-skilled menfrom non-e.c. countries (other than Denmark and Norway) willbe issued for work in industry and commerce.ii. A quota of 5, 500 permits for 1972 will be introduced forunskilled and semi-skilled men in the hotel and catering industry from non-e.c. countries (other than Denmark or Norway); andwill be reduced to 3, 500 in 1973.iii. We shall apply more stringently our arrangements for ensuring that no permits are issued where suitable indigenousworkers are available.6.        I propose that the announcement should also make clear that we arepursuing as a matter of urgency the points raised by the industry abouttraining provided by the Government and about the facilities for the industryprovided by the official employment services.R department of Employment25 October 19712
(confidential)annex proposed Quota System fox* the Hotel and Catering industry.

No &quot;old&quot;  establishment  should be allowed in 1972 more than60% (rounded up to the nearest whole permit)  of its intake ofnon-e.c. nationals in 1971.5.      Of the 500 permits  set aside for new establishments,   125 shouldbe reserved for restaurants and 375 for hotels;    and these shouldbe issued on the basis of &quot;first come,  first  served&quot;.6.
