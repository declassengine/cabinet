SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONSIntroduction1. The United Kingdom has co-operated fully in the development ofsatellite communications since the launching of the first experimental com-munications satellite TELSTAR I in 1962 and was a founder member ofthe International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (now known asINTELSAT) which was set up in 1964 under an IntergovernmentalAgreement establishing interim arrangements for a global commercialcommunications satellite system. The background to the government&apos;s decision to participate in the creation of a global commercial communicationssatellite system was set out in a White Paper (Cmnd. 2436) presented toParliament by the Postmaster General in August 1964, to which the texts ofthe Intergovernmental Agreement and the associated Special Agreementbetween telecommunications entities were annexed. The White Paper lookedforward to the establishment of definitive arrangements which it was theintention, under the Agreement, should enter into force by 1st January 1970.Developments since 19642. Membership of INTELSAT has grown from 19 countries in 1964 to 80in mid-1971. There have also been rapid developments in the INTELSATsystem. An operational satellite, known as &quot; Early Bird &quot;, was launchedover the Atlantic in 1965 and became INTELSAT T. The INTELSAT IIseries (the first fully designed and developed under INTELSAT auspices)followed in 1966-67 and the much larger INTELSAT III series becameoperational over the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans during 1969, whencomplete global intercontinental coverage was first achieved. The firstsatellite in the still larger and more versatile INTELSAT IV series was launched early this year to become operational over the North Atlantic andglobal coverage with greatly increased capacity will be provided byINTELSAT IV by about mid 1973. Preliminary planning has already started for the next generation of satellites INTELSAT V likely to be needed by the late 1970&apos;s. Clear&apos;y satellite communications have now established themselves as a significant and indispensable element in the globalpublic telecommunications network.Definitive Arrangements3. A Plenipotentiary Conference on definitive arrangements for INTELSATopened in Washington in February 1969. Because of the wide range ofissues involved and their long-term importance solutions which would be acceptable to all parties proved difficult to achieve and negotiations werepursued over a number of sessions for more than two years. However, on21st May 1971 agreement was reached on the texts of definitive Inter-governmenlal and Operational Agreements, which were opened for signaturein Washington from 20lh August 1971. The Intergovernmental agreement was signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government onthat day ; at the same time the Post Office, as the designated telecommunications-tions entity for the United Kingdom, signed the Operating Agreement.
Fifty-three other countries including the United States, Canada, Australia,Japan and ten European countries also signed the Agreements on 20thAugust 1971. Subject to the necessary quotas of signatures or ratifications*the Agreements will enter into force some time between April 1972 and february 1973.The Agreements4. Her Majeoty&apos;s Governments objective during the negotiations was towork with others for a new constitution which, while preserving thecommercial viability of the system, would give participants a greater measureof responsibility in determining policy, would provide for the establishmentcf an integrated management body responsible only to the Organisation and independent of any signatory, and would afford fair opportunities in thesupply of equipment for the system. The final texts of the Agreements,which are annexed hereto, adequately reflect this objective. They providefor a four-tier structure comprising(a) an Assembly of Parties composed of representatives of governments to consider general policy and scheduled to meet every two years.(b) an annual Meeting of Signatories of the Operating Agreement (the telecommunications entities).(c) a Board of Governors (about 25) which will meet several times a yearand have responsibility for the design, development, construction,establishment, operation and maintenance of the system.id) an executive organ.   During a transitional period of 6 years theUnited States Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT) willperform technical and operational management functions under contract, its performance being monitored by a Secretary general who, in addition, will be responsible for the other managementfunctions.   After the transitional period, a Director General will assume  responsibility  for all  management  functions,  acting  inaccordance with the policies and directives of the Board of Governors.In the Assembly of Parties and in the Meeting of Signatories each Party orSignatory, as the case may be, will have one vote.   Decisions on mattersof substance will be taken by a two-thirds majority.   In the Board of governors, voting will be related to investment which, in turn, will be related to use of the system.   No member will be able to cast more than40 per cent of the total vote and decisions will be taken by at least 4members holding two-thirds of the investment-related vote, or by at least the total number of members minus three, regardless of weight of vote.  ThePost Office&apos;s investment, and hence vole, will increase from the present 7-2 per cent to about 10 per cent.  The effect of these arrangements will thus beto increase the United Kingdom stake and influence in the Organisation.conclusion. INTELSAT, in which the United Kingdom (Post Office) has the secondlargest investment share, is already a profitable commercial enterprise andits satellites will carry an increasing proportion of intercontinental traffic.The Definitive Arrangements form a sound basis for the future management and development of the global satellite communications system. The Govern-ment therefore consider that the Agreements offer satisfactory conditions for continued participation and investment by the United Kingdom.* See Article XX (a). -iv
