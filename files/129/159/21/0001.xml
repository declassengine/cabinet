HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 1211 November 1971SELECT COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURES REPORTON THE PROCESS OF legislation memorandum by the Lord President of the Council11. The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure have considered the Select Committee on Procedure&apos;s Report on the Processof Legislation which was published during the summer recess.    TheSelect Committee&apos;s 28 recommendations, and the course of action the ministerial Committee propose on each, are summarised in the Annex.2. A large majority of the Select Committeefs proposals are acceptable.We can therefore gain a worthwhile advantage by taking the initiative and giving a prompt response.    In particular, we shall be able to make earlyuse of some valuable procedural changes.    I would propose, therefore,subject to the views of colleagues, to take the opportunity to inform theHouse of the Governments proposals on a number of the recommendations in the course of the debate on the Address.COPY NO        0CABINET3. The Select Committee made two proposals for further inquiries.The first is for a joint committee of both Houses to inquire into the procedures and practice by which the control of each House over delegated legislation is exercised, and to report on how they might be improved (24);the other is for a Government-appointed committee to review the form,drafting and amendment of legislation and the practice in the preparationof legislation for presentation to Parliament (28).4. There is clearly a case on general Parliamentary grounds for aJoint Committee on delegated legislation.    There is of course a likelihood that such a Committee would include in its recommendations the need for more time to debate prayers and would consider the present powers of theHouse of Lords in relation to statutory instruments.    But at the same time it will be an advantage to us that such an inquiry is in progress whenproposals for the extensive use of delegated legislation consequent uponUnited Kingdom membership of the European Communities come to be debated.    Therefore, it is proposed that this recommendation should beaccepted.1
5. The Select Committee^ proposal (28) for a committee appointed bythe Government to review the form, drafting, etc. , of legislation is perhaps the most important of their recommendations.    The ministerial committee concluded that the recommendation should be accepted, subjectto further consideration being given to the composition of the committeeand terms of reference.    The general view was that the committee shouldbe a small independent one chaired by a former Minister;   the membershipcould include other members of both Houses (probably including some otherformer Ministers), an officer from each House, and possibly a retiredcivil servant and a former ParHamentary draftsman.    The ministerial committee agreed that this review should be separate from the inquiry into delegated legislation, from which earlier results could be expected;and also that an immediate, although limited, acceptance should be givento the recommendations on the use of pre- and post-legislation committee (1 and 2).6. As indicated in the Annex, the remainder of the Select Committee1 $recommendations are mainly concerned with procedural matters.    Iwould, however, draw attention to the proposal to appoint a second deputy chairman of Ways and Means (17) and the proposal for the compulsorylimitation of speeches in certain debates (18).7. I invite the agreement of colleagues to the proposals outlined above and to the other proposals summarised in the Annex.W w privy Council Office, SW11 November 19712
ANNEXSelect Committee on Procedure^RecommendationProposed Course of ActionL, Regular use should in future be madeof pre-legislation committees, whenappropriate in the form of joint committees,to consider matters with a view to conse-quent legislation.2. Post-legislation committees shouldbe appointed where necessary to enquire into difficulties in the application orinterpretation of statutes and consequentdelegated legislation within a short periodof their enactment; where appropriate,such committees should be appointed asjoint committees of both House ofParliament.3. The Chairman*s Panel should be excluded entirely from membership of theBusiness Committee.4.        Standing Order No. 44 should be repealed (&apos;voluntary&apos; timetable procedure),5.        Standing Order No. 43 should be amended to provide as follows:(1)        The Business Committee should meet under the chairmanship of theChairman of Y/ays and Means.(2)       The Committee should be composed of five members who will betaking an active part in proceedings onthe Bill.    In addition Mr Speaker should nominate three senior Members of theHouse, if possible with previous experience of the functioning of BusinessCommittees,(3)The quorum should be four members(4)       Debate on any allocation of timemotion should be restricted to three hours.Accept in principle, butemphasise that the scope forsuch committees is extremelylimited.    It remains difficultto see where such committeescan be of much practical valueoutside a strictly limited areaof social issues of a non-Party-political kind.Accept,    These are, ineffect, the proposals whichthe Chief Whip and I made tothe Committee,    they provide for an improvedtimetable procedure and forthe Chair man&apos;s Panel to be excluded in future from theBusiness Committee, whichwill relieve them from the dilemma of the conflictingclaims of independence and
(5)       Paragraph (b) of Standing order no. 43 should be omitted.(6)       The minutes of proceedings of theBusiness Committee should be publishedunless the Committee otherwise decide.Party allegiance in highlypolitical1 situations.6.        A new Standing Order should beintroduced extending the waiver of the&apos;ancient and undoubted privileges&apos; of theHouse in order to secure that all Billsother than Bills of aids and supplies maybe introduced in the Lords and to obviatethe necessity for using proceduraldevices to enable Bills v/ith subsidiaryexpenditure to begin in the Lords.Accept.    This will providerather more freedom to startBills in the House of Lords.7. Explanatory memoranda shouldbe drafted to give a description of thepurposes and effect of a Bill and, where appropriate, of its origin in a White paper or Report; in the case of long or comp-licated Bills, detailed explanations shouldbe provided in a separate Y/hite Paper.******* *      &quot; awn h&apos;i&quot;&apos;.vi 11 i^pi -hiAgree to consider, but without commitment.C.        A Bill which has been consideredby a Second Reading Committee in oneSession and read a second time should in thenext Session proceed immediately to itslater stages provided that the Bill has notbeen objected to by 20 Members.Reject on the grounds that itwould erode the principlethat each Session&apos;s publiclegislation must remainself-contained.9.        It should be made possible to refertwo or more minor Bills to the same SecondReading Committee, which should have a correspondingly increased membership.Agree to consider.    It is of minor significance, but itmight prove difficult toarrange without Membersinvolved in a later Bill beinginconvenienced by theuncertain length of theCommittee sitting on theearlier Bill.    Therecommendation might bere considered when moreexperience has been gained of the working of SecondReading Committees.2
10.       The minimum number on the firstScottish Standing Committee should bereduced to 16 Members from Scottishconstituencies, the maximum number of50 being retained.Accept.    This was previously proposed by theGovernment.    It will represent a modest saving in committee manpower.Acceptance can be based onthe desirability of havingarrangements consistent with those for otherStanding Committees.11,        Suitable Bills should in future be committed to Select Committees, and should only in exceptional circumstances berecommitted to a Committee of the wholeMouse,Accept in principle, making it clear that 1 suitable5 bills would, in view of theadditional Parliamentary time required under this procedure, be likely to benon-urgent Bills, wMchcould, if they were not completed in the Session, be reintroduced and completed in the next Session withoutsignificant harm.12,       Standing Order No. 40 should be amended to enable Bills to be committed in part to a Standing Committee and inpart to a Select Committee.Subsidiary to 11 (i. e. partial,rather than total, reference of a Bill to a SelectCommittee).13,       Standing Order No, 10 should be amended to enable the House to be adjournedto facilitate the work of Select, as well as of Standing, Committees J   the Governmentshould make use of the amended standing order to enable legislation committees tomeet without clashing with a sitting of theHouse.This proposal would increasethe pressure on the limited time available on the Floor.It is proposed to state thatsuch a development wouldnot be practicable in theforthcoming Session.14,        Two days&apos; notice should be required of motions under Standing Order No. 40(3)to commit Bills in part to a StandingCommittee and in part to a committee ofthe whole House or to a Select Committee;proceedings on such motions should be exempted business for three-quarters ofan hour after their commencement.Accept, subject to theagreement of the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    Theproposal largely arises fromthe splitting of the finance bill,
15.Opposition and back-bench Members   Accept.    I would say.should, before amendments are selected on    however, that it would bereport, indicate to the Public Bill Officethose amendments to which they attachspecial importance.expected that the Chair v/ouldcontinue to have regard tothe extent to which the amendments had beenconsidered previously in committee,16. The question should be put forthwith Discuss with Opposition withon the motion for Third Reading of all Bills,   a view to acceptance.17,       A second Deputy Chairman of ways and Means should be appointed; theChairman and Deputy Chairmen of Ways and means should have power to accept a motion for closure on any class of business and to select amendments during the business ofSupply.Accept, subject to discussionwith the Opposition.    this seems likely to be welcomed by the House in view of thegeneral recognition of the burdens placed upon the speaker.18.       In certain half-day debates and in        Leave the House to decide.debates on delegated legislation, for an experimental period front bench speakersand the movers of motions should be limitedto a maximum of 20, and back-benchspeakers to a maximum of 10, minutes.19.       Once the Statutory InstrumentsCommittee have drawn the special attention of the House to any negativeinstrument, it should, unless debatedwithin the 40-day period, automaticallybecome subject to the affirmativeprocedure.This would require legislation.Moreover, uncertainty would arise as to whether such an instrument was still in force.A decision could, however,await the outcome of the inquiry into delegated legislation (recommendation24),20,       One Government Friday before This could also await the christmas and two after Easter should outcome of the inquiry intobe appointed as &quot;Prayer days&quot; on which delegated legislation,Private Members1 Prayers could beconsidered.21,       Non-contentious Prayers and non-      As 20.contentious affirmative resolutions shouldbe referred to a special StandingCommittee,4
22.       The order of reference of theStatutory Instruments Committee should beextended (this would remove certainrestrictions on the way in which theCommittee report at present to the House),Accept.    This would notpre-empt the inquiry intodelegated legislation in any significant way.23.       Proposals of the statutory instruments Committee relating to the dateof coming into operation of statutory instruments should be adopted (they propose a normal 21-day interval betweenthe laying and operation of instruments,and the provision of an officialexplanation by Departments when theyfail to provide it).Accept that 21 days should beallowed wherever practicable, but without giving a specific commitment to the provision of an explanation in cases whereit is not.24.       A joint committee should beappointed to enquire into the procedures and practice by which the control ofeach House over delegated legislation is exercised, and to report on how they mightbe improved.Accept. Paragraph 4 of my memorandum refers.25.       The ballot for Private Members1Bills should be held before the summeradjournment J  Bills should be presented in the succeeding Session, earlier thanat present.I propose to announce an experiment in the forth-coming Session undei* whichSecond Readings of private members&apos; Bills will not betaken until after Christmas,so providing more time after the ballot for draftingpurposes.26.       Government draftsmen should draft the Bills being prepared by the 10 leading members in the ballot; in the alternative,the Government should reimburse to thosePrivate Members the fees charged by outside draftsmen.I suggest that the first partof the recommendations should be rejected.    As tothe alternative, I suggest we make a grant up to  200 tomeet the drafting expensesof each of the first 10Private Members&apos; Bills inthe ballot.    But essentially the problem is the rarity ofthe necessary expertise.
27,       Counting should be abolished, but if    Accept, and rely on otherit should appear on a division that 40 safeguards (required numbersMembers were not present, the next for divisions and closure) to business should be taken, maintain attendance in theHouse,28.       The Government should appoint a        Accept in principle,committee, including Members and Paragraph 5 of myofficers of both Houses, to review the memorandum refers,form, drafting and amendment oflegislation and the practice in thepreparation of legislation for presentation to Parliament.1 November 19716
