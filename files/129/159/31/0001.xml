DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government cp(71) 13115 November 1971CABINETTHE EUROPEAN SPACE RESEARCH ORGANISATIONSPROGRAMMEMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal. At a meeting of the Council of the European Space research organisation (ESRO), on 23^24 November, delegates will decide on a proposed long-term package programme of work for the Organisation,comprising scientific space research and the development of satellites fortelecommunications, air traffic control and weather watching.    the ministerial Committee on Science and Technology have considered the options open to the United Kingdom, as set out in the annexed report by officials.2.        Apart from the air traffic satellite, the constituents of the packageare all unattractive, because they do not meet real user needs or areunnecessarily expensive.    The Committee were unanimous that rejectionwould therefore be the right course on scientific, technological andeconomic grounds.    Nevertheless they considered that this course was unlikely to be acceptable on broad political grounds of European policy.3.        As alternatives to outright acceptance (Option (i)) or outrightrejection (Option (ii)), Options (iii) and (iv) both propose amendments tothe package.    They are designed to avoid a continuing and open-endedcommitment to costly development of a telecommunications satellitesystem.    Option (iv) is designed to provide an escape through arbitration,should the criteria for continuing this project be in dispute when the finalstage is decided upon in 1975.    The Committee considered, however, that itwould be a mistake to try to base European technological collaboration inthis sensitive area on the likelihood of recourse to legal proceedings.    Onthe whole they greatly preferred Option (iii) which ensures at least 5 yearscontinuing support for ESRO.4.        The Committee recognised, however, that the other countries were unlikely to agree to this proposal.    Thus the ultimate choice for us was, inthe CommitteeTs view, likely to lie between straightforward acceptance on political grounds, or rejection on technical and economic grounds, of theESRO package.copy NO       82
RE C OMMEND AT ION5. I invite my colleagvies to endorse the choice of Option (iii) as the initial position to be adopted by the United Kingdom delegation to the ESROCouncil and to choose between Options (i) and (ii) as a fall-back position should Option (iii) be rejected by the Council.J civil  Service Department12 November 19712
annex the EUROPEAN SPACE RESEARCH ORGV-NISATI0IJ* S JROGRAiaaEMemorandum &quot;by the Chairman of the Communications-Electronicsand Space committee at a meeting of the Council of the European Space Research Organisation(ESRO) on 23-2A- November, all members will be expected to declare their position on a proposed long-term programme,2.    Earlier this year, ESRG proposed a package programme of work for1972-80, consisting of a reduced scientific programme, and a large programme of applications satellites, both supported by common costs.This would give ESRO an annual budget of at least $110 million for thenext decade.   Last July, the United Kingdom supported a resolution to acceptthe package subject to clarification on various points, including-user..requirements for the applications projects, even though v/e do   not considerthe scientific programme would give value for money,3.    As regards the applications programme, ESRO has collaborated with theUnited States in-developing proposals for an aeronautical satellite forwhich research and development costs would be $92 million (United kingdom share  8.4 million).   By about 1980 air traffic control services will need a satellite system for communications and surveillance, to cope withthe rapid growth of air traffic.   There is also a call for a world systemof weather watching satellites, to which Europe is expected to contribute,and ESRO envisages providing a satellite at a cost of about $91 million(United Kingdom share  8.3 million).   This is several times more than thecost of an equivalent meteorological satellite purchased from the Americans,1
4.    The third application, to telecommunications, is the largest and key-part of the package, the cost of developing a satellite system beingabout $450 million.   The aim is to transmit via a European telecommunicationssatellite about one-third of the intra-European traffic beyond 800 km range,as well as to provide two television channels.   But as now defined the project is not economically viable.   The European telecommunicationsadministrations estimate that the system during the decade 1980-90 wouldbe more than twice as expensive as the alternative terrestrial network.To go ahead would necessitate governments not only paying for and writing offthe cost of development, but also reimbursing their telecommunicationsadministrations during the operational phase; for the United Kingdomthis is estimated to require about  40 million for development and 10 million for excess operating costs in 1980-90.   Other european countries, however, do not regard the economic case as decisive and placegreater weight on the political and industrial benefits.5.    Very recently, several member states have expressed misgivings aboutthe expense of the original proposals.   As a result, the ESE.0 secretariatis proposing to table a modified version, originated by the French, inwhich expenditure would be contained within a ceiling of $110 million perannum from 1974 onwards.   The telecommunications satellite project wouldbe taken in two phases.   During Phase I, up to 1976, the mission of thesystem would be reviewed, basic technological work would continue, and sub-systems would be tested in satellites&quot;flown &quot;for:other purposes; thispart of the programme would cost, in round terms, up to about $130 million.In 1975* a decision would be taken, by a double qualified two thirds majority of participating countries, whether to proceed with Phase II, inwhich the telecommunications satellite would be developed, at a totalfurther cost of about $300 million, to become operational in 1982.   Thismodified proposal seems likely to be widely supported by the member states.6.    The options for the United Kingdom, which all refer to the modified proposal outlined in paragraph 5 are as follows (in each casethe estimate is of United Kingdom commitment to ESRO at 1971 prices):COMFSDENTSAt
i.     ACCEPT PACKAGEAdvantages:   Preserves viability of ESRO and opportunities for european space industry.   United Kingdom seen as good Europeans.The double two-thirds majority vote, before entry into Phase ii of the telecommunications project, affords some protection againstcommitment to heavy expenditure unsupported by a user requirement.Before 1975 we should have three years of full e.c. membershipduring which to develop common policies of cost-effectiveness.Disadvantages:   None of the items, with the exception of theaeronautical satellite, is cost-effective on present evidencebut our partners want a commitment until 1982,   Bad projects rarelypay political dividends.   The double two-thirds vcte does not guarantee to the United Kingdom protection against uneconomicexpenditure on the telecommunications project beyond 1976.   TheUnited Kingdom would be bound by a legal agreement with an arbitration clause.Estimated United Kingdom commitment:    6-g- million in 1972 rising to about  92 million in 1975 and remaining at that level until1982.-ii,     REJECT PACKAGEAdvantages:   Saves the United Kirgdom  50 million on the telecommunications project alone and is the only option whichis wholly consistent with criteria for assessment of R and Dprojects.Disadvantages:   Possibility of breaking up ESRO, for which theUnited Kingdom would be blamed.   Non-participation in theaeronautical satellite project risks loss   of United Kingdompre-eminence in air traffic control of the Western approaches.Estimated United Kingdom commitment:   Of order  5 million,exactfigure depending on agreement about run-down.iii. PROPOSE AMENDMENT TO PACKAGE: Accept whole package, includingFhase I of the telecommunications project, but make Phase II . .optional, ie not subject to a vote in 1975.Advantages:   Preservation of aeronautical project.   Decision onPhase II of telecommunications project deferred until after entry into e.c. and further consideration has been given to userrequirements.  ESRO viable for at least five years.3
a* Disadvantages:   Open to accusation of prevarication.   Continuingexpenditure for doubtful ends.   Unlikely to be accepted byother countries.Estimated United Kingdom commitment:    6-g- million in 1972 rising to about  9^ million in 1975 and 1976.iv.     PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE AMENDMENT TO PACKAGE:   The package would beaccepted with the modification that the double qualified majority vote, for Phase II of the telecommunications project, would be dependant on the establishment of a definite user requirementand the operational cost not being disproportionate with alternative terrestrial communications.  Whez* proposing this modification, the United Kingdom would place on record itsinterpretation of the term &quot;disproportionate&quot;.Advantages:   Probability of preserving unity of ESRO, includingthe aeronautical project, and opportunities for United Kingdomspace industry.   Gives United Kingdom a possibility of legallyopting out in 1975.   Can be presented as consistent with formerpractice and present European wishes.Disadvantages:   No guarantee of acceptability.   Risk of accusationsof prevarication, and if we were taken to arbitration, a risk ofthe case going against   us.   Difficult to define in advance agreedcriteria for guidance of the arbitrator.   Continuing expenditure for doubtful ends.Estimated United Kingdom commitment:    6-g- million in 1972 rising to about  9^ million in 1975 and 1976.7.     If Ministers decide on either option iii or option iv it will benecessary to consider a fall-back position should the proposed amendment be rejected by ESRO.   The most likely situation then is that we shall be facedwith a choice between options i and ii and our delegation will be requiredto give a definite answer.15 November 19714
