A FRAMEWORK FOR GOVERNMENT research and development . In the White Paper on the Reorganisation of Central Government(Cmnd. 4506) it was announced that all Ministers were reviewing the func-tions of their departments, placing emphasis on ensuring that wherever possible, at all levels, responsibility and accountability were clearly defined and allocated. The need was also indicated for a clear and comprehensivedefinition of Government strategy which could be systematically developed to take account of changing circumstances and could provide a framework within which the Governmenfs policies as a whole could be more effectivelyformulated.2. These studies of course include departmental activities in the field of research and development and as part of this process the Government com-missioned a report from Lord Rothschild, the Head of the Central policy review Staff, on Government research and development. In addition, theysought advice, through the Council for Scientific Policy, on the most effectivearrangements for organising and supporting pure and applied scientific research and post-graduate training.3. The Government have now received reports from both Lord Rothschildand the Council for Scientific Policy, and have decided to publish both ofthem in full as a basis for consultation on the future organisation of Govern-ment research and development. They are included as appendices to thisGreen Paper.4. The Government welcome the recommendation in the report by LordRothschild that applied research and development commissioned by theGovernment should be controlled in accordance with a&apos; customer/contractor &apos;principle which is already being applied in certain areas. The report alsoconsiders the implications of adopting this principle for the Science budget of the Department of Education and Science and the work of the research councils. The Government note that the report of the Council for scientific policy is not at variance with this principle.5. The Government endorse the &apos; customer/contractor &apos; principle and consider that it should be applicable to applied research and developmentcarried out or sponsored by the Government, whether by the research councils or elsewhere. The Government believe that, subject to this principle,it would be right to preserve the Research Councils under the sponsorshipof the Department of Education and Science. It is also the Governmenfsview that it would continue to be desirable for a body of authoritative advice to be available to the Secretary of State for Education and Science on theallocation of her Departments Science Budget.6. Before reaching decisions on the detailed application of the &apos; cus-tomer/contractor&apos; principle, the Government intend to allow time for widepublic debate and to discuss the issues involved with the scientific community.Discussions will therefore be held with the Royal Society, the Council for
Scientific Policy, the Research Councils and the appropriate Staff Associa-tions. The Government will aim to complete these discussions by 29February 1972 and to publish their final conclusions in a White Paper as soonas possible thereafter.7. Written comments from interested bodies would be welcomed by theGovernment. These should be addressed to the Government^ Chief scientific adviser at the Cabinet Office, Whitehall, London S.W.1, and should bereceived not later than Friday 14 January 1972.
THE ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT OFGOVERNMENT R. &amp; D.ByLORD ROTHSCHILDHead of the Central Policy Review Staff
THE ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT OFGOVERNMENT R. &amp; D.BY LORD ROTHSCHILD, HEAD OF THE CENTRAL policy review STAFFCHAPTER IINTRODUCTION1. One might expect that a review of Government research and develop-ment (R. &amp; D.) would be greatly concerned with answers to such questions as:(a) Are we doing too much, too little, or about the right amount ofR. &amp; D.?(b) Is the balance between pure and applied research about right?(c) Should we do more intramural and less extramural R. &amp; D., orvice versa ?(d) What R. &amp; D. are we doing which should not be done?(e) What R. &amp; D. should we do which is not being done?(/) Is there adequate machinery, at the centre, critically to evaluate the overall R. &amp; D. scene?2. These questions, and possible answers to them, are not systematicallydiscussed in this report because to try and do so would not help to provide a framework in which the efficiency of Government R. &amp; D. can be maximised.The questions either relate to an out-of-date concept of R. &amp; D. management,or they are unanswerable. The resolution of the dilemma, which is moreapparent than real, is to ensure that the organisation and management ofR. &amp; D. is logical, flexible, humane and decentralised, the prerequisites of an efficient system. Furthermore, that each person in the system has clearly defined responsibilities. This report is, therefore, concerned with the estab-lishment of the principles on which such an efficient system must rest and theconsequences of accepting and implementing them.3. Some comments may, however, be made about the six questionsenumerated above, (a) is discussed later; (b) is not a meaningful questionbecause there cannot be a correct &apos; balance&apos; between the resources devotedto pure and applied research. The amount of pure research done at Univer-necessities and elsewhere depends on the talent and money available; but one can make certain assertions about the proportion of pure research permissible ornecessary within an applied research programme. Questions (c), (d) and (e)are automatically answered when a satisfactory organisation for the manage-ment and prosecution of R. &amp; D. exists and it is one of the purposes of thisreport to recommend one. Question (/) is difficult to answer, because it isdoubtful whether any central body can or should try critically to evaluate the Governments R. &amp; D. as a whole. Nevertheless, some focal point, i.e.the Chief Scientific Adviser, is necessary at the centre, not only to satisfy thegeneral desire for such focal points, but also to co-ordinate trans-departmentaland trans-national subjects involving R. &amp; D. The phrase &apos; subjects involvingR. &amp; D.&apos; is deliberate and intended to emphasise that applied R. &amp; D., with
which this report is mainly concerned, is not an activity in its own right; it is part of a wider process, for reasons that are discussed at length in the followingpages.too much r. &amp;d., too little, or just about right?4. In spite of many books and papers, some of a mathematical nature,no-one, in industry or Government, has found a method of determining the&apos; right&apos; amount of R. &amp; D. to do. In fact, most research directors and R. &amp; D.administrators admit that decisions on this matter are an art rather than ascience. Nevertheless, the person who has to pay for the end-product ofapplied R. &amp; D. is, for obvious reasons, in the best position to decide how much he can afford. Depending on his qualifications, he may need to takethe advice of scientists, mathematicians or engineers skilled in the subjectunder consideration.5. Some people believe that eminent scientists, mathematicians and engineers should have an opportunity to express an overall view on thenation&apos;s R. &amp; D. to those ultimately in charge. But such an overall view,whether greatly desired or even ordered, is of questionable value. Somecomfort or discomfort may, for example, be gained from comparisons with other countries, see Table 1.Table public EXPENDITURE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVARIOUS COUNTRIES(1970 figures except where stated)	Total ( m.)	Civil ( m.)United States (1969)      ..................	6,652	3,393Germany........................	725	600France     ......	735	510United Kingdom.....................	581	353Japan (1969)       .....................	351	344Italy...     ...     ......     .!.     ...     ...     ...     ...	191	185Netherlands       .....................	128	122Belgium    ........................	52	50The countries in this Table almost certainly define R. &amp; D. in differentways; they have widely different populations; and they are at different stages of industrial development. The reader may, therefore, feel that the figures should be divided by some factor or factors to take account of these differences;but the question is, by what? If this exercise is not undertaken, if only because it is unclear how to do it, the reader may derive some satisfactionfrom the United Kingdom being &apos; about in the middle &apos;. Why, on the otherhand, does France spend more than us? Should this be a matter for satis-faction or discomfort ? Leaving aside this difficult or, perhaps, unanswerablequestion, one must remember that the R. &amp; D. effort of a country will haveno effect on that country&apos;s welfare for at least seven years after the date of
the effort in question; so that no inferences can be made from the figures inTable 1 until, at the earliest, 1977. Even then the inferences will be of question-able value because it is not, for example, known whether an increase in G.N.P.is in part caused by an increase in R. &amp; D. expenditure, or whether the latter is a consequence of increased prosperity. Writers sometimes seem confusedabout this point.CHAPTER IIAPPLIED R. &amp; D.principles6. This report is based on the principle that applied R. &amp; D., that isR. &amp; D. with a practical application as its objective, must be done on acustomer-contractor basis. The customer says what he wants; the contractor rdoes it (if he can); and the customer pays. Basic, fundamental or pureresearch, called basic research in this report, has no analogous customer-contractor basis(2), though those engaged in such work may and, sometimes,too often do become involved in applied R. &amp; D. The words customer andcontractor are discussed in detail later. Here, some observations about basicand applied R. &amp; D. are necessary. Much time can be lost in semanticarguments about the nature of basic research, its impact, accidental or other-wise, on applied research, and the difference between them; and the sameapplies to research and development. It is sometimes said, for example, that development should be done by different people, in a different place, and witha different administrative system from research. The reverse is the case,whenever possible. It is also sometimes said, in justification of basic research,that chance observations made during such work, and their subsequent study,may be just as important as those made during applied R. &amp; D. While thereis some truth in this contention, the country&apos;s needs are not so trivial as to beleft to the mercies of a form of scientific roulette, with many more than the conventional 37 numbers on which the ball may land.7. The end-product or objective of applied R. &amp; D. is:(a) A Product, e.g. a tank, an antibiotic, a nuclear reactor, an artificialhand, an instrument for measuring the concentration of nitrogenoxides in exhaust gases, or a drought-resistant variety of wheat;(b) A Process, e.g. for the manufacture of an antibiotic, for convertingnatural gas into protein, for purifying uranium from uranium oxide,or for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases;(c) A Method of Operation, e.g. to prevent collisions in the english channel, to speed up the delivery of letters, or to give advice, some-times in the discharge of a statutory obligation.(x) R stands for recommendation.(2) It is scarcely meaningful or productive to stretch the customer-contractor principle tothe extent of claiming that the Department of Education and Science (D.E.S.) is a customerwho says &apos; i want good science, basic research and education, and am prepared to pay for it&apos;.
The end-product of basic research is an increase in knowledge. In moresophisticated language, basic research is concerned with the discovery ofrational correlations and principles.8. The Government supports basic research and commissions appliedR. &amp; D. The former is almost exclusively financed by the Department ofEducation and Science (D.E.S.) and the latter by all the other departments which commission R. &amp; D. The D.E.S. supports basic research, via theUniversity Grants Committee, at the Universities; and via the Council for scientific Policy (C.S.P.) and &apos; subordinate&apos; Research Councils, at the Re-search Councils&apos; own institutes, units and elsewhere. The five research councils are only &apos; subordinate &apos; to the C.S.P. in respect of the allocation of funds. They are autonomous in respect of their programmes, an unsatisfactorysituation in some cases, which is the subject of recommendations in this report.According to the D.E.S. an appreciable part of the work of the medical research Council (M.R.C.); and a major part of the work of the agricultural research Council (A.R.C.) and of the Natural Environment Research Council(N.E.R.C.) is &apos; applied&apos;. But this work had and has no customer to corn-mission and approve it. This is wrong. However distinguished, intelligentand practical scientists may be, they cannot be so well qualified to decide whatthe needs of the nation are, and their priorities, as those responsible for ensuring that those needs are met. This is why applied R. &amp; D. must have aR. 2 customer, whose role is described immediately below.THE CUSTOMER9. The customer (client, user, or their representative) may be direct, forexample the Vice-Chief of the Naval Staff who requires a new or improvedtorpedo; or indirect, in that he represents, sometimes in quite an oblique way,the user of the product, process, or method of operation which constitutes theend-product of an applied R. &amp; D. programme. An example is road R. &amp; D.,sponsored by the Department of the Environment (D.O.E.) on behalf of themotorist (at any rate in part). The customer should have the followingresponsibilities or accountabilities^):R. 3       (a) He should decide, with advice or on his own initiative, that an R. &amp; D.programme is needed to achieve a specific objective.NoteUnspecific or unduly general objectives such as &apos; We must find outall about the physiology of domestic farm animals&apos; or &apos; We must beable to describe engine knock in precise physico-chemical terms&apos;should be treated with caution, however admirable they may seem atfirst glance. More often than not they imply financial and scientificcommitments of an open-ended nature. These are rarely justifiablein an applied R. &amp; D. programme.(b) He should decide how much can be spent on the programme. (Refer-ence is made to operating expenditure, not capital expenditure on equipment.)(x) The word accountability is used in its normal sense. i.e. someone who is accountableis not necessarily an Accounting Officer.
Notes(i) The customer will normally need the advice of the Chief Scientist(q.v.) and the Controller R. &amp; D. (q.v.), the latter being, inter alia,a specialist on programme costs and the relationship between themand estimated completion dates.(ii) The work &apos; spent&apos; does not imply the physical transfer of funds. It R. 5is, however, recommended that the amounts spent on differentprogrammes should be formally debited, with account numbers, tothe named, accountable customer.(iii) Operating expenditure should include a depreciation or obsolescence R- 6charge.(c) He should approve capital expenditure for the development, as op- R. 7posed to the research, phase of the programme, and for new researchbuildings.NoteDifficulties are sometimes raised about making a clear-cut distinctionbetween research and development, and the familiar &apos; continuousR. &amp; D. spectrum &apos; argument is adduced in support of these allegeddifficulties. There are two ways of dealing with this question, whetherthe problem is a real one or not; first, by recognising that a develop-ment programme almost invariably costs at least ten times as muchas the research component of the same programme; secondly, by accepting that development should very rarely be started until and unless there is a better than 90 per cent chance that the objective ofthe R. &amp; D. programme will be realised.(d) He should determine priorities between programmes. R. 8the chief scientist10. The Chief Scientist is part of the customer organisations for all departmental R. &amp; D. This title is preferred to that of Chief Scientific Adviserbecause he must be closely associated with the customer in the decisionsenumerated in paragraphs 9(a)-(d). Depending on the expertise within the&apos; divisions &apos; of which a Department is composed, and their R. &amp; D. needs, theChief Scientist may have representatives within them. This implies that amember of the Chief Scientists&apos; organisation may have two bosses, the headof the division and the Chief Scientist. There is nothing organisationallyabnormal or unsound about such a system; indeed, there are precedents for it within goverment at the present time. A similar situation arises whencustomers commission R. &amp; D. at multifunctional laboratories (q.v.).11. There should be no line relationship between the Chief Scientist and R. 9the Controller R. &amp; D. (whose role is described immediately below). Theyare engaged in quite different activities.
the controller r. &amp; d.K- 10 12. The Controller R. &amp; D. should be the chief executive of the R. &amp; D.function, the contractor providing an R. &amp; D. service for the customer. Heis the head office focal point to which the R. &amp; D. function is accountable and,as such, is immune to parochial considerations which sometimes affect the directors of individual research establishments, however objective they mayaim to be. The R. &amp; D. function consists of the research workers and theirsupporting staff, their laboratories or analogous institutions where they work,and a very small head office organisation in which the Controller R. &amp; D. islocated. The reason why there is only a skeleton head office organisation isR. 11 because the Controller R. &amp; D. should draw on his laboratories, often bysecondment, for expertise. A scientist soon loses his skills if he does not use them.R. 12 13. The Controller R. &amp; D., like the customer, may commission work at universities or other extramural organisations when his &apos; in-house &apos; organisa-tion has not got the facilities or expertise needed to implement the customersrequirements.R. 13 14. The Controller R. &amp; D. should have the following responsibilities oraccountabilities:(a) to provide his customers with an efficient R. &amp; D. service.Notes(i) &apos; An efficient R. &amp; D. service&apos; covers a multitude of factors whichwill be well known to research administrators. They range fromauthorisation, within certain budgetary and administrative restraints,of capital expenditure on research but not on development equipmentnor research buildings, to ensuring a proper flow of people into and out of the R. &amp; D. function. The accountability of the ControllerR. &amp; D. for capital expenditure on research equipment involves twoR. 14 departures from current practice: first, operating and capitalexpenditure should not be lumped together as one cost item. Apartfrom other considerations, this avoids footnotes explaining &apos; excep-tional items &apos; such as the purchase, in a particular year, of a surveyvessel. Secondly, accountability for operating and capital expendi-R. 15 ture should not be vested in the same individual except, naturally,at the Permanent Secretary level. Expenditure at the developmentstage of a project, which is at least ten times as great as at the re-search stage and has quite different probability criteria naturallyneeds the customers approval. It is, therefore, not the responsibilityof the Controller R. &amp; D. on his own.(ii) The Controller R. &amp; D. faces serious difficulties in ensuring a properflux of people through the R. &amp; D. function. This question is of sufficient importance to merit special discussion, see Chapter IV.(b) to spent the 10 per cent General Research Surcharge .Note this subject is discussed immediately below.
THE GENERAL RESEARCH SURCHARGE15. Virtually all applied R. &amp; D. laboratories, except those exclusivelyconcerned with testing or technical service, sooner or later engage, overtly orclandestinely, in research which is not directly concerned with the programmescommissioned by the customers: and it is a good thing that they do. It is,however, important that such activities should be recognised as being necessary R. 16and that they should be formally quantified. The average operating expendi- R. 17ture on them should not amount to more than about 10 per cent of thatsanctioned by the customers and the expenditure, which is a surcharge on thecustomers, should be wholly at the discretion of the Controller R. &amp; D. R-18These activities are called General Research because they do not necessarilyconsist of applied R. &amp; D., nor of pure research. General Research is done for the following reasons:(a) to engage in basic research in a field relevant to the applied tasks ofthe laboratory, but which is not being done elsewhere, e.g. at a Univer-sity;(Jb) to test out new, way-out and unprogrammed ideas of the scientists,engineers and mathematicians themselves;(c) to maintain expertise, e.g. to recruit and keep a spectroscopist whowill not join the laboratory unless he can spend part of his time onhis own research;(d) to facilitate the transition from academic life to that in an appliedR. &amp; D. organisation.16. It is important to appreciate that the General Research surcharge ofabout 10 per cent is an average figure per Department. Some establishmentsmay be almost wholly engaged in General Research, for example in molecularbiology or superconductivity. Others may do very little but the averageexpenditure must not be more than about 10 per cent of the departmentalR. &amp; D. budget and it is the Controller R. &amp; D&apos;s. responsibility to see that itis not. There is no reason why the General Research surcharge should increase R- 19a Departments overall R. &amp; D. expenditure.17. If the General Research surcharge principle were accepted now and if,for the time being, the D.E.S. payments were excluded, some  54 million would be spent on work in this category in 1971.18. The D.E.S. is excluded &apos; for the time being &apos; because until and unlessthe recommendations in this report are accepted, the D.E.S. research councils, to whom the D.E.S. will pay  109-5 million in 1971-72, do notconform with the customer-contractor concept. Apart from this, two of theseResearch Councils, concerned with &apos; Science&apos; ( 50-9 million) and &apos; SocialScience&apos; ( 2-2 million) are not suitable for inclusion within this concept.Table 2 shows how the figure  54 million is arrived at, as 10 per cent of( 645-5 million -  109-5 million) =  53-6 million.6 RC
Table 2DEPARTMENTAL R. &amp; D.

Departments which commission or ought to commission a significantamount of R. &amp; D. should have within their headquarters a Chief Scientistand a Controller R. &amp; D;. and, to avoid confusion between these two quite different jobs, the Chief Scientist-Controller R. &amp; D. terminology should beR. 20 adopted by all Departments except for the D.E.S. and, for the time being, theHome Office. The Department of Trade and Industry (D.T.I.) and theDepartment of the Environment (D.O.E.) will need time to become adjusted to this proposal. The recommendation that Departments should adopt thisuniform terminology is not caused by a passion for tidiness; nor by any wishto indulge in semantic hair-splitting. At present, June 1971, the D.T.I., forexample, has a Chief Scientist, some of whose duties are identical with thoseof a Controller R. &amp; D., and a Chief Scientific Adviser (Energy). The HomeOffice has one man called &apos; Director General of Research and Chief Scientist&apos;.The Ministry of Agriciilture, Fisheries and Food (M.A.F.F.) has a director general Agricultural Development and Advisory Services, who is partlyconcerned with R. &amp; D., and a Chief Scientific Adviser (Food). The D.O.E.has a Director General of Research who has both Chief Scientist and Con-troller R. &amp; D. responsibilities. The Ministry of Defence has a ControllerEstablishments and Research, with the exact responsibilities of a ControllerR. &amp;D. All Departments accept the customer-contractor principle; but itmust be hard for the departmental customer and contractor to understandtheir respective roles in the Departments R. &amp; D. with such a bewilderingarray of designations. The confusion is confounded when extra- or inter-departmental relationships are involved.20. Such laboratories and institutes have programmes for which differentcustomers should be accountable even if the customers are not in the sameR. 21 Department. There is nothing abnormal nor organisationally unsound in need for uniform terminologymultifunctional laboratories and institutes
such a situation, though some people have difficulty in accepting or becomingacclimatised to it. One of the duties of the Controller R. &amp; D. is to integratethe requirements of these separate programme bosses (the customers) withthe overall administration of the laboratory or institute. The acceptance ofthe concept of the multifunctional laboratory or institute is important.dialogues21. No system for the administration and prosecution of applied R. &amp; D.will work efficiently and successfully without a continuing dialogue betweenthe customer, the Chief Scientist, the Controller R. &amp; D. and those concernedwith the actual prosecution of the R. &amp; D. In an efficient and successfulorganisation, all those concerned act and behave as a team in spite of formalaccountabilities. Without the accountabilities, however, both efficiency andthe probability of success are reduced.CHAPTER iii the RESEARCH COUNCILS OF THE DEPARTMENT OFEDUCATION AND SCIENCE (D.E.S.)expenditure, head office staff and mechanism of financial support22. There are five Research Councils, the A.R.C., the M.R.C., theN.E.R.C., the Science Research Council (S.R.C.), and the Social science research Council (S.S.R.C.). Their expenditure on R. &amp;D., in 1971-72, isgiven in Table 3, immediately below.Table estimated NET RESEARCH COUNCIL EXPENDITURE (DES),1971-72*Science    ......Social ScienceAgriculturalMedical   ......Natural Environment  million50-92-218-722-415-3109-5* Excluding the Natural History Museum,  1-7 mjllion ( 0-5 million from the D.O.E.)and Grants for Science (including the Royal Societies)  2-0 million.23. One of the main tasks of the Council for Scientific Policy, also underthe D.E.S., is to advise the Secretary of State for Education and Science aboutthe distribution of funds,  109-5 million in 1971-72, between the five research councils.24. The head office organisations of the C.S.P. and the Research Councilsconsist of 1,078 people (4.6.1971) and 116 Council Members (3 vacancies)plus Assessors, together with 128 permanent committees, boards or groups.B*  RC
The cost of the 1,078 whole-time staff will be about  4 million in 1971. AR. 22 review of these numbers is needed. The C.S.P. and the Research CouncilsR. 23 would be well advised to obtain the co-operation of specialists within the CivilService Department when conducting this review, which should include aR. 24 study of the need for the 128 permanent committees, boards and groups.Much valuable, specialised manpower is tied up in them.25. In what follows the S.R.C. and S.S.R.C. have not been consideredbecause the first is largely concerned with pure, and to a lesser extent appliedscience, which is not synonymous with research; while the second is in itsR. 25 infancy; but in both cases some applied research is done, and should, accord-ingly, be studied in due course. This leaves N.E.R.C., the M.R.C. and theA.R.C. which are discussed below. Before that, however, some general observations must be made about the Research Councils. The Council for scientific Policy, in its role of spokesman for the Research Councils, does not accept that there is an unambiguous difference between pure and applied research. It believes that the adjectives pure and applied imply a divisionwhere none should exist and that their use can be harmful. This view is not easy to understand, if the distinction is made in the terms of paragraph above. It is not of course in dispute that the results of pure research maysometimes be of applied or practical value, and that applied research mayR. 26 produce results of&apos; pure &apos; interest and importance. The Government should,therefore, reject the view that there is no logical division between pure and applied research, a view that may be intended to protect the Research Councilsfrom the imaginary ravages of applied R. &amp; D. users.R. 27 26. The Research Council Members should have two functions in regardto the applied R. &amp; D. with which they are concerned: first, to advise the chiefexecutives of the Research Councils&apos; organisations about the quality of theirscientists, engineers and mathematicians and of their work; and, secondly, to&apos; protect&apos; their organisations from hypothetical political or administrativepressures of an undesirable nature. A number of executive departments, forexample, the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Tradeand Industry and the Department of the Environment have Research Councilsor equivalent bodies, which, though constitutionally different from the D.E.S.Research Councils, have or should have analogous functions. The indepen-dence of such Council Members is an important component of the system.27. Reference was made above to the &apos; chief executives of the research councils&apos; organisations&apos;. In D.E.S. Research Council language, they maybe the Secretary or the Chairman. The reader will, doubtless, have realised that, in the case of the M.R.C., A.R.C. and N.E.R.C., the Secretary&apos;s func-R. 28 tions in respect of applied R. &amp; D. should be identical with those of theController R. &amp; D., see paragraph 12 et seq., pages 10-11 in this report, and itwould be in the interests of clarity and, therefore, efficiency if he were designated-nated as such. The Secretary of State for Education and Science should obtainthe approval of the Secretaries of State or Ministers of the appropriate execu-tive departments before appointing the chief executives and part-timeChairmen of the M.R.C., A.R.C. and N.E.R.C., apart from consulting thePresident of the Royal Society. In the case of the M.R.C. this implies getting
the approval of the Secretary of State of the Department of Health and social security (D.H.S.S.); in the case of the A.R.C., the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food; in the case of N.E.R.C., the Secretaries of State for Wales R- 29and of the D.O.E. and the D.T.I.; and in the case of all three, the Secretaryof State for Scotland.28. Ultimately and logically, the Chief Executive of the M.R.C. should assume the role of Controller R. &amp; D. in relation to the appropriate experi-mental work by or on behalf of the D.H.S.S. The same naturally applies tothe M.A.F.F. with respect to the A-R-C^1) The present division is bothillogical and undesirable. It perpetuates meaningless or harmful distinctionsbetween research and development, and panders to scientific snobbery the&apos; haves &apos; in the Research Councils and the &apos; have nots&apos; in the Departments.29. Each Research Council should have a whole-time Secretary, chief executive or Controller R. &amp; D., and a part-time Chairman, to obviate what R. 30is believed to be the inefficient situation mentioned in the second sentence ofparagraph 27.30. A recommendation was made by the Council for Scientific policy that executive departments should be enabled to place contracts with the research Councils. This is strongly supported and the recommended size ofthese contracts is given in Table 4; but the Research Councils should not have R- 31the right to reject such contracts without good reasons agreed with the spon-soring executive department. Some observations must, however, be made:first, the Council for Scientific Policy referred to the executive departmentsrequiring scientific support. They do not require scientific support, butapplied R. &amp; D., to achieve specific, pre-determined objectives. Secondly, theCouncil for Scientific Policy suggested the replacement of the C.S.P. by an executive, chartered body, the Board of Research Councils, one of whosefunctions would be to ensure that the requirements of executive departments were being properly met. This function is unnecessary except in regard towork quality. Subject to certain reservations discussed later, the executivedepartments should themselves ensure that they get what they want from the R- 32Research Councils. If they do not, they can and, doubtless, will go elsewhere, R. 33with their money, to get their objectives met.31. The recommendations in Table 4 imply a 25 per cent reduction in theD.E.S. vote (the Science Budget) for the Research Councils, and, in the firstinstance, a corresponding increase in the votes of the appropriate Departments.These recommendations explain and amplify the remark, made immediatelyabove, that the executive departments should themselves ensure that they getwhat they want from the Research Councils. Nevertheless, the recommenda-tions in the Table are conditional and the conditions are mentioned im-mediately below. One is that before the recommended changes for the new system of financing the Research Councils are implemented, in principle on(*) The arrangements for applied agricultural R. &amp; D. in Scotland differ from those inEngland and Wales. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland (D.A.F.S.)already finances the bulk of agricultural research in Scotland, with A.R.C. advice, and alsofinances three Colleges with R. &amp; D. functions. This difference in existing practice will no doubt be taken into account in discussion of the principles referred to in this Report.
R. 34 5.4.1972, the D.H.S.S. and the M.A.F.F. must have set up Chief Scientistorganisations to enable the customers in these two Departments to carry out their new and onerous responsibilities. At the time of writing this report,16.9.1971, the M.A.F.F.&apos;s Chief Scientist organisation is inadequate and thatof the D.H.S.S. is incomplete. That of the D.O.E. is broadly satisfactory and this Department should have no difficulty with its contracts to N.E.R.C.Table 4RECOMMENDED CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM OF financing the D.E.S.

This split would be inappropriate and unmanageable in the case of the Research Councils,which explains why, in Tables 3 and 4, capital and operating expendi-ture have not been separated.32. A Chief Scientist organisation does not just consist of a Chief Scientistand, for example, some Advisory Council which may well not be necessary.A Chief Scientist organisation is, as the phrase indicates, an organisation. Inthe Ministry of Defence, where there is more technical expertise than in several other Departments, which might be held to imply a need for a relatively smallChief Scientist organisation, the Chief Scientific Adviser&apos;s organisation infact consists of more than 50 people.33. A second condition is that if this recommended change in the financing of the Research Councils is implemented, the amount paid to the research councils by the Departments in the first year under the new regime should
not be less than would have been spent if no change had occurred. Further- R. 36more, after this first year, the Departments should not reduce their payments to the Research Councils by more than 10 per cent per year for three years. R. 37It is, naturally, a matter for the Departments to decide if they wish to increase their payments to the Research Councils.34. There is, therefore, a four-year Transition Period. Towards the endof it, the Departments and the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government(see paragraph 57) should review the need for any increase or decrease in theextent to which the M.R.C., A.R.C. and N.E.R.C. should be direcly financed R. 38by the Departments concerned; also whether the 10 per cent rate of reductionin payments, if it has occurred, should be allowed to continue or not.35. Because of the rather small size of the D.H.S.S. and S.H.H.D. par-ticipation in the M.R.C.&apos;s affairs and because of the intimate relationship which should exist between these Departments and the M.R.C., the ChiefMedical Officer of the D.H.S.S. and S.H.H.D. should be Members of theMedical Research Council, not only Assessors to the Council. In addition,both Departments should be represented on those Boards and committees of the MRC which are relevant to their interests. Apart from other depart-mental representation, the Chief Scientists, D.H.S.S., M.A.F.F., D.O.E. and d.T.I. should, of course, respectively be Members of the M.R.C., A.R.C.and N.E.R.C., the D.O.E. and the D.T.I. both having a considerable interestin N.E.R.C. programmes.36. The composition and duties of the Council for Scientific Policy should R- 41be as follows:(a) It should have a part-time independent Chairman, appointed by theSecretary of State for Education and Science with the agreement ofthe President of the Royal Society;(b) Its members should consist of an independent Chairman, the fiveChief Executives or Controllers R. &amp; D. of the Research Councils,the Chairman of the University Grants Committee and four eminent,independent Scientists, but no Assessors.(c) It should, as at present, have an extremely small secretariat, providedbytheD.E.S.;(d) It should advise the Secretary of State about the distribution of funds between the Research Councils apart from money provided bythe Departments or others, with which it will not be concerned;note no useful purpose would appear to be served by the President of theRoyal Society being a Member, first because the President is tooimportant, as ex officio head of the scientific establishment, to become R- 42involved in departmental decision-making; and, secondly, because it is neither desirable nor possible to distinguish between the Presidentas a distinguished scientist and the President as President.37. The Council for Scientific Policy does not accept that the research councils are concerned with applied R. &amp; D. but with &apos; strategic and basicscience &apos;. Basic research or science seems to be identical with pure research
or science. Strategic science refers to work in a field of general practicalinterest, but there is no precise objective specified by a customer, user, orrepresentative of a customer or user. A comment has been made about this type of R. &amp; D., in paragraph 9 (a), Note, on page 8. &apos; Tactical science&apos;,which is equated with &apos; scientific knowledge &apos;, is said to be done by the execu-tive departments but not the Research Councils, except, in the future, under contract, with the Research Councils having the right to refuse to acceptcontracts. Given that the very names of the Research Councils, Medical,Agricultural, and Natural Environment, obviously imply applications, thisphilosophy or outlook should be rejected.research council units38. The Research Councils have had the policy of establishing Units,usually but not necessarily at universities and hospitals, centred often on oneparticularly good scientist; and of closing down the Unit if or when thescientist in question is no longer available. The Research Councils should payR. 43 particular attention to the second part of this policy.&apos; longer-term &apos; research39. Anxiety is sometimes expressed about the will or ability of executivedepartments and industry to engage in longer-term R. &amp; D., which is assumed to refer to an R. &amp; D. project that is expected to last more than five years;and it is said there is a natural tendency for it to be displaced or replaced byshort-term or ad hoc work. The Universities, the Research Councils and theGeneral Research surcharge exist to counter this tendency when, in an im-perfect world, it occurs. Nevertheless, it is the duty of an applied R. &amp; D.administrator to ensure that there is a mix of short, medium and longer-termR. &amp; D. in most of the laboratories under his control, not only because of theintrinsic desirability of the mix, provided the end objectives are clearlyspecified; but also to gratify the desires of, at any rate, some of the scientists,engineers and mathematicians in the establishments. But longer-term re-search has no special merit or value in itself, and there is no positive correlationbetween the importance of a discovery and the time it took to make.the royal societies grant40. At present this is paid by the D.E.S. Considering the status and role of the Royal Societies in science, engineering and mathematics, both in theUnited Kingdom and elsewhere, it would seem more appropriate for theirgrants to be paid centrally, i.e. by the Cabinet Office and the Scottish Office,rather than by a particular Department of State. It is, accordingly, recom-R. 44 mended that this change should be made as from 5.4.1972, although the royal society (London) is satisfied with the present arrangement.contracts from government departments, excluding thed.e.s., to the research councils61. All contracts from Government Departments to the Research Councils,or work sponsored by Government Departments and carried out by theR. 45 Research Councils should, without exception, be paid for by the GovernmentDepartment in question. When more than one Government Department is involved, a decision should be taken by the Government Departments, not
by the Research Councils, as to which Government Department should pay.Little difficulty should be experienced in most cases in deciding which Govern-ment Department is the most interested.42. The reader will remember &apos; Multifunctional Laboratories &apos;, paragraph20 on page 12, which is relevant to this subject.the pay of chairmen and members of some research councils and other scientific advisory bodies43. It is hard to understand the logic of any system there may be withinGovernment for deciding whether or not independent members of Councils,Boards and Standing Committees should be paid, or give their services freeapart from out-of-pocket expenses, Table 5; and it is strongly recommended R-that this subject be examined, or re-examined, by the Civil Service Depart-ment, attention being paid to the duty of the citizen to render public serviceand to be remunerated with this in mind. The subject is a difficult one becausemembership of a high-sounding Council, Board, etc. may well be less arduousthan that of a comparatively obscure Government Committee.Table 5THE PAY OF CHAIRMEN AND MEMBERS OF SOME research councils AND OTHER SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BODIESIndependentBody Chairman MembersDefence Scientific Advisory Council, M.O.D.	 18-90	per	day	 15-75	per	dayHome Office Scientific Advisory Council	0			0		Noise Advisory Council, D.O.E.       ......	 15-75	per	day	 12-60	per	dayAdvisory Council on Research &amp; Development						for Fuel and Power, D.T.I..........	0			0		Aeronautical Research Council, D.T.I.	 15-75	per	day	 12-60	per	dayCouncil for Scientific Policy    .........	 1,500	per	year	 15-75	per	dayMedical Research Council     .........	 1,000	per	year	 750 per year		CHAPTER IVSCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS AND MATHEMATICIANS IN THECIVIL SERVICE AND THEIR MOVEMENTS44. Reference was made in paragraph 14 to the responsibility of theController R. &amp; D. for ensuring an adequate, systematic and continuing flow of people out of and into research establishments. It is, therefore, of interestto study the present situation. The following table shows the number of seniorNumber in        Number withGrade grade S.E.M. degrees       PercentagePermanent Secretary   ...... 28 3 11Deputy Secretary       ...... 82 13 16Under-Secretary        ...... 304 33 11Assistant Secretary     ...... 824 72 9Principal         ......... 1,086 118 11Assistant Principal     ...... 325 40 12
civil servants in the former Administrative Class with degrees in science,engineering or mathematics (S.E.M.) on 30.4.1971.The rather low percentage of ex-scientists, mathematicians and engineersamong senior administrative civil servants may be due to the almost completelack of movement from the Scientific Civil Service into the administrative class. Only 36 former members of the Scientific Civil Service have movedover to the Administrative Class, and although the majority of these were transferred in comparatively recent years, the annual rate of movement is small. The number of transfers to and from the United Kingdom atomic energy Authority and the Medical Research Council was equally low. Whilethe paucity of technically qualified people within the Administrative Class ofthe Civil Service may cause some despondency, the virtually complete im-mobility of the Scientific Civil Service is, or shortly will become, a majornational problem. The immobility of the Scientific Civil Service has beeneased in recent years by the introduction of so-called &apos; opportunity posts &apos; inheadquarters organisations; this is all to the good and should be encouraged.The vitality and efficiency of a laboratory depends on an adequate flow of scientists, mathematicians and engineers through it, apart from that whichoccurs through retirement and recruitment; and it is one important function of the research administrator, the Controller R. &amp; D., to ensure that this flowtakes place. If he is prevented from discharging this function, someone elsemust take the blame for the undesirably skewed age distributions which resultR. 47 from this policy. As a start in the rectification of this organisational failure,the quality of management at the higher levels of the Scientific Civil service should be improved by insisting that no-one should be appointed Director orDeputy Director of a Laboratory or Institute unless he or she has had a spellof at least one year in the Departments headquarters in London, preferablyon the administrative side. The acquisition of administrative experience at a fairly early age is also necessary to enable scientists to make their propercontribution in policy-making posts at headquarters.45. Equally, there is no a priori reason why an Under-Secretary or DeputyR. 48 Secretary should not become the Director of a large Government Laboratory,Institute or Establishment, for a period of years. The larger the undertaking,the less critical the Directors technical training becomes. It is administrativeability that counts in such cases.46. It may be of interest to compare what is said above with the views ofthe Fulton Committee about scientists and other specialists in the CivilService. The Committee expressed the view that:(a) the specialist classes (architects, laywers, doctors, engineers, scientists,accountants, economists, draughtsmen, technicians and so on) did not get the responsibility,1 authority and opportunities they ought to have;(b) there should be an open road to the top of the Service for all kinds oftalent and an open structure in the top management posts;(c) suitable specialists at the lower and middle levels of the Service shouldbe employed outside their own specialisation;(d) there should be greater mobility between the Civil Service and other employment.
47. The Committee concluded that:(a) all classes should be abolished and replaced by a single unified gradingstructure covering all civil servants from top to bottom in the non-industrial part of the Service, the correct grading of each post being determined by job evaluation;(b) specialists should receive more training in management and oppor-tunities for greater responsibility and wider careers, e.g., in policyformulation and financial control;(c) in some of the big technical departments there might be a need for afurther senior post; a Chief Scientist, engineer or other specialist.48. The programme of work jointly agreed by the Official and Staff Sidesfollowing the Fulton Report has had the following results to date:(a) Unified grading is to be applied to all posts of Under Secretary leveland above, and the aim is to complete this process in about six monthstime;(b) The Administrative, Executive and Clerical Classes up to assistant secretary level have been amalgamated to form the AdministrationGroup of the new General Category; the former Economist andStatistician Classes at these levels have been replaced by occupationalgroups within the General Category;(c) The Scientific Classes up to the level of Principal Scientific Officerhave been amalgamated to form the new Science Category; con-consultations continue on a projected merger of the Works Group andAssociated Classes to form a third major category;(d) Freer movement between specialisations and into general manage-ment has already been achieved. Proposals for improved careermanagement of specialists including their development for topposts -are being worked out. These include arrangements foridentifying, at about Principal level, professionals who would benefit from experience in administrative and managerial posts. Manage-ment training for specialist staff has been introduced and is beingextended.Advantage should be taken of these change^ greatly to accelerate the flow of scientists from departmental research to other work in the Civil Service. The R. 49best scientists should be encouraged to gain administrative experience earlyin their careers, but satisfactory progress in this matter will only be achieved if it attracts the full support of Ministers and top management, including thepresent generation of senior scientists. It is not enough just to offer theopportunity. The good scientist will be unwilling to risk his research careerwithout positive assurance that the acquisition of administrative experiencewill be regarded as a positive asset in a career leading to senior posts in the scientific field as well as outside it.CHAPTER VTHE &apos; HALDANE PRINCIPLE &apos;49. This &apos; Principle &apos; is sometimes invoked to justify the independence ofapplied scientists from those who may benefit from the results of their work.
Before accepting this concept, it is worth studying what the Haldane Com-mittee(1) actuallys aid, particularly since more than 50 years have elapsed since it was set up. The Haldane Committee found that Government would, ingeneral, be better able to formulate policy if more facts, information and research facilities were available to Government decision makers. CertainGovernment Departments, namely the Departments of the Army and Navy,already benefited from such services.50. The Committee recommended that the Departments of the CentralGovernment should be divided according to the services they rendered to thecommunity as a whole. One such service was the provision of research and information.51. There were three different levels of Government research:(a) research done in administrative Departments;(b) research supervised by administrative Departments; and(c) research done for the use of all Departments.52. Research for general Government use had several functions:(a) to keep Ministers informed;(b) to carry out investigations in response, for example, to questions inthe House of Commons (and the need for Government answers);(c) to make sure that the Government kept in touch with scientificworkers in different parts of the country;(d) to enquire, without (sic) implementing findings; and(e) to carry out enquiries the result of which would be useful to different departments.53. The Committee could not predict in which direction research wouldprogress, but it anticipated that a separate Department of intelligence and research would eventually be established with its own Minister.54. The concepts of scientific independence used in the Haldane report are not relevant to contemporary discussion of Government research. TheReport argued that a Government research Department should be administra-tively independent of other Government Departments; but so far as the content of research programmes was concerned, the committee used two distinct concepts of Government research. First, it argued that CentralGovernment research should serve different Departments and help them inthe formulation of policy, as in functions (a)-(e) in paragraph 52. Theselimited functions of Government research are not controversial, either in1918 or now. Secondly, the Report asserted that Government research should serve the community as a whole; but, in fact, the Report mentions only such&apos; community-serving&apos; research activities as follow directly from specific andformulated Government policies. The specific policies mentioned in theReport are of great generality and little contemporary use: to promote anC) Report on the Machinery of Government, Cd. 9230, 14.12.1918.
increase of material production; to promote the health of the entire com-munity; and to apply science to industry.55. From what is said above it is clear that there is no single &apos; HaldanePrinciple &apos;; but the following sentence from the Haldane Committee&apos;s report is sometimes quoted, out of context, to justify &apos; scientific independence &apos;:&apos; It &apos;the recommended structure&apos; places responsibility to Parliament inthe hands of a Minister who is . . . immune from any suspicion of beingbiased by administrative considerations against the application of theresults of research.&apos;The question of administrative independence is not central to the customer-. contractor principle; but if this sentence implies that the application of theresults of research should be the responsibility of the independent scientificMinistry, it should have been unacceptable in 1918 and must be now. Thefurther implication that the objectives that require applied R. &amp; D. for theirachievement should be formulated by this independent Ministry, Department,Council or Committee is, of course, entirely unrealistic. The &apos; HaldanePrinciple &apos; has, evidently, little or no bearing on the conduct and management of Government R. &amp; D. in the &apos;70s.CHAPTER vi the CHIEF SCIENTIFIC ADVISER56. In June 1971, the Chief Scientific Adviser&apos;s inherited staff consisted,including himself, of four physicists, two mathematicians, one engineer andone economist. If this organisation is to exercise any form of oversight of trans-departmental and trans-national science, this distribution of disciplinesneeds revision. There should be one chemist (preferably a physical chemist)and one life scientist within the Chief Scientific Adviser&apos;s organisation. This R- 50does not imply that the staff should be proportionately increased, though this could be done by secondment.inter-departmental co-ordination and general oversight57. There is a danger that R. &amp; D. done by one Department may have animpact on that done elsewhere or by another Department, but that the latter will not know about the work of the former. The avoidance of this danger isa matter for the Chief Scientific Adviser and implies both a knowledge of the programmes and budgets of the principal laboratories or institutes supportedby the Departments, and of research projects that will become expensive inthe development phase and that may compete with, or have a bearing on,analogous projects in another Department. The Advanced Passenger Trainand the Tracked Hovercraft projects would be a case in point, were it not forthe fact that the former got to the development stage much earlier than thelatter. It is recommended that such inter-departmental co-ordination and R- 51compilation of information should be clearly understood to be the responsi-bility of the Chief Scientific Adviser. The successful compilation and co-ordination of such information also involves knowledge of industrial R. &amp; D.projects. This task, of the Chief Scientific Adviser, is a major and continuing
one whose successful prosecution will greatly improve the efficiency ofGovernment R. &amp; D.58. Reference has been made elsewhere in this report, see, for example,page j, to the feeling many people have that advantages accrue from there being some central body whose duty is to exercise &apos; general oversight&apos; ofGovernment and, even, national R. &amp; D. So far as pure or fundamental researchis concerned, this oversight is exercised by the Research Councils, particularly the Science Research Council and the Council for Scientific Policy. So far as applied R. &amp; D. is concerned, the inescapable conclusion from this report isthat general oversight would serve no useful purpose and, indeed, wouldnegate the principles put forward in the report.59. Reference has, however, been made to the Chief Scientific Adviser&apos;sco-ordinating role when projects involving R. &amp; D. in one Department havean impact elsewhere. There is nothing to stop the Chief Scientific Advisersetting up ad hoc committees to deal with such situations or, indeed, others;R. 52 and it is strongly recommended that this system be used rather than set upyet another scientific advisory organisation, unless events in the future makeit desirable to reconsider this question.COMMENT60. The recommendations made in this report cannot be implementedovernight. Many of them involve changes in attitude, orientation and pro-cedure which will take time to accept, let alone digest. Their implementationR- 53 should, therefore, be monitored and reported on by the Chief scientific adviser to the Government.
APPENDIXINTERPRETATION OF TABLE 4D.H.S.S.,-S.H.H.D.-M.R.C.(i) The interaction between the D.H.S.S. and S.H.H.D. and the M.R.C.has, so far, been inadequate and the changes recommended in Table 4and elsewhere are intended to rectify this deficiency. At present, althoughthe D.H.S.S. and S.H.H.D. have direct responsibilities in the field ofpublic health, they have no share, as of right, in M.R.C. decisions and cannot be certain of always being consulted about the M.R.C.&apos;s workon, for example, nutrition, toxicology, vaccines and blood transfusion.The same applies to clinical medicine, despite the direct responsibilityof D.H.S.S. and S.H.H.D. for the N.H.S.; to cancer and radiation; toageing (on which the M.R.C. spent  9,000 in 1970-71); to cardio-vascular disease, renal disorders and rheumatism; to endocrinology,psychiatry and psychology, neurology (special senses), and occupationalhealth. The same applies to epidemiology and social medicine. In thelight of these factors a good case could be made for transferring to theD.H.S.S. and, where relevant, the S.H.H.D. about  11 million out ofthe D.E.S. total for the M.R.C. of  22-4 million (1971-72); but in thefirst instance, the recommended transfer has been reduced from thisvalue to  5-6 million, Table 4, as if the changes were to take place in1971-72. In 1972-73, the D.E.S. total for the M.R.C. and the corre-sponding transfer to the D.H.S.S. and S.H.H.D. will be proportionatelygreater and this naturally applies to other cases mentioned in this appendix and in Table 4.M.A.F.F.,-D.A.F.S.-A.R.C.(ii) The reason why it is recommended that only  14-5 million of the D.E.S.total of  18-7 million for the A.R.C. should be transferred to theM.A.F.F. is as follows: the A.R.C. will spend about  1-3 million^) in1971-72 on its Units. Most of their work is long-term and some, forexample the study of the mechanism of muscular contraction, of ques-tionable relevance to agriculture. This does not, of course, mean thatsuch work is uninteresting; nor that it should not be done. Three Insti-tutes, the Animal Breeding Research Organisation ( 0-6 million), the institute of Animal Physiology ( 1 million), and the Letcombe laboratory-tory ( 0-3 million) should also continue to be financed by the A.R.C.Their programmes come into the category of what is sometimes called&apos; strategic research&apos;, i.e. research in a field of agricultural interest, but without an applied objective which is likely to be realised in a specified time, however long. Some observations about this type of research aremade in paragraph 9 (a) Note, on page 8. The Soil Survey of Englandand Wales ( 0-2 million) should continue to be financed by the A.R.C.,and the corresponding Scottish survey by D.A.F.S., pending the resultsof a study, which it is recommended should be made, of its relationship R-(*) This and other figures in this section have been rounded off, which explains minordiscrepancies between them and those in Table 4.
with the work of N.E.R.C. in general, the Institute of Geological Sciencesand the Experimental Cartography Unit in particular, and with theDepartment of the Environment. Such a study would, it is hoped, lead,inter alia, to organisational recommendations.(iii) A proportion of the work of the John Innes Institute ( 0-2 million)and of Rothamsted Experimental Station ( 0-5 million) should con-tinue to be paid for by the A.R.C. because these amounts fall in the basicor strategic research category.D.O.E., D.T.I., M.A.F.F., D.A.F.S., S.D.D.-N.E.R.C.(iv) The recommendations affecting the N.E.R.C. are slightly more compli-cated than those relating to the M.R.C. and A.R.C., because of theheterogeneity of the subjects embraced by N.E.R.C. But the recom-mendations are in no sense intrinsically complicated provided attention is paid to the customer-contractor principle and the concept of themultifunctional laboratory or institute.(v) The N.E.R.C. programme is divided into work related to the Earth, theOceans and Seas, Inland Waters and the Countryside. To give an example as to how the N.E.R.C. financial transfers recommended inTable 4 were arrived at, two items from N.E.R.C.&apos;s Earth programme are mentioned immediately below, with comments:&apos; Mineral Resources: To undertake scientific reconnaissance andassess the potential of mineral deposits.&apos;Comment: The D.T.I. is the sponsoring Department for the minerals industry (except sand and gravel). It also has a statutory responsibility for all mineral extraction.^Underground Water: To determine ground-water conditions andevaluate underground water resources, including undergroundstorage and transport.&apos;Comment: The D.O.E. and S.D.D. are the sponsoring Depart-ments for the water industry.The Oceans and Seas provide a different example:&apos; Biological Resources of the Sea: To study transmission throughfood chains to useable resources of fish, shellfish and sea mammals;optimum conditions for growth and nutrition.&apos;Comment: This work should be sponsored by the M.A.F.F.and/or D.A.F.S.Inland Waters contains such projects as &apos; Water balance of catch-ments&apos;,&apos; River regimes &apos; and &apos; Pollution of inland waters &apos;, which shouldbe paid for by the D.O.E. Exceptionally, the Institute of Hydrologyshould be physically transferred, together with its staff, to the D.O.E.,where it should be fused with the D.O.E.&apos;s contiguous HydraulicResearch Station. The whole of the Countryside programme should be financed by the D.O.E. and S.D.D., which explains why the NatureConservancy (excluding basic ecological research ( 0-25 million))should be paid for by these Departments.

THE FUTURE OF the research COUNCIL SYSTEMREPORT OF A C.S.P. WORKING GROUPUNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OFSIR FREDERICK DAINTONIRC
COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC POLICYMay 1971Dear Secretary of State,FUTURE OF THE RESEARCH COUNCIL SYSTEMI enclose the report of a Working Group of the Council for scientific policy on the future of the Research Council system.As the body appointed to advise you on your Department^ scientificresponsibilities, we welcome this opportunity to make a general review of the research Council system. Throughout our enquiry we have borne in mind the stated intention of the Government to review the whole of its Research andDevelopment effort and we hope that, in addition to being of use to you in anarrower context, this report will be of further use when that appraisal iscarried out.Criticisms have been levelled against the Research Council system whichwe have taken into account during our work and in the drafting of our recommendations. In particular we have sought to devise an organisationalstructure for the system which incorporates the important advantages of thepresent system and which would also enable the Research Councils to play astill more effective part in making progress towards national goals.In the course of our work we have identified some problems which requireclear and more protracted examination. We consider that one of the features of our proposal is that it provides a mechanism by which such problems couldbe discussed and resolved.The Council believes that the future of the Research Councils is of greatimportance and hopes that you will agree to the reports publication to facil-itate wide discussion.Yours sincerely,(Signed) Frederick Dainton.The Rt. Hon. Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, M.P.i

I  introduction. We were appointed by the Council for Scientific Policy (C.S.P.) andwith the approval of the Secretary of State in October 1970&apos; to advise the Secretary of State, through the Council for scientific policy, on the most effective arrangements for organising and supportingpure and applied scientific research and postgraduate training.&apos;The membership of our Group wasSir Frederick Dainton, F.R.S. (Chairman)Dr. T. L. CottrellDr. J. C. Kendrew, F.R.S.Dr. P. E. Kent, F.R.S.Dr. A. W. Merrison, F.R.S.SECRETARIATMr. R. EdmondsMr. M. J. G. SmithWe met on 18 days.Professor F. H. Stewart, F.R.S. who will cease to be a member of the C.S.P.on his appointment as Chairman of N.E.R.C. on 1 October 1971 has not beena member of the Group but has been associated with its work throughout, andwe have benefited greatly from his experience and advice.II  WHY THE C.S.P. UNDERTOOK THE ENQUIRY2. The immediate cause of our appointment was the proposal to transfer the Agricultural Research Council to the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food. This proposal had not previously been discussed with the C.S.P.who felt that no sufficient case had been made for what appeared to them tobe a fundamental and ill-advised change.3. Furthermore, nearly six years had elapsed since the C.S.P. was set up and it seemed an appropriate time to consider how the Research Council-C.S.P. system had evolved. During this period the annual growth rate of the science Budget of the D.E.S. had declined from 12 per cent to 4f per cent. In1970 it became clear that it would decline further, whereas the demands on the research Councils from Government, universities and the general publicseemed likely to continue to increase.4. Finally, the Government announced in October 1970 its intention to review all its research and development activities and it seemed to the C.S.P.that our own enquiry would be essential to that review. The C.S.P. therefore proposed to the Secretary of State that this enquiry should be made, and she
welcomed it both in relation to the work of her own department and as a contribution to the wider Governmental appraisal of its research and develop-ment activities.Ill   PROCEDURE ADOPTED5. The need to present a report within a short period of time has con-strained us to work with only a limited number of consultants. We have discussed with the chief officers of the Agricultural Research Council (A.R.C.),the Medical Research Council (M.R.C.), the Natural Environment research council (N.E.R.C.) and the Science Research Council (S.R.C.), the way inwhich the Research Council system works and possible improvements to it.To assist us in this the Councils prepared at our request detailed analyses oftheir programmes of work which are presented in an abbreviated form at appendix C. The Social Science Research Council (S.S.R.C.), which has now come under the aegis of the C.S.P. and the Chairman of which has attendedC.S.P. meetings as an assessor for the past two years, was not subjected to a systematic examination, but we have had regard to the functions of theS.S.R.C. in our consideration of the general question of the future manage-ment of science, and have been able to take account of the views of the Chair-man of the S.S.R.C. We have also had views from officials of the Departmentof Education and Science, from the Chairman of the University GrantsCommittee and from other members of the C.S.P. including the President ofthe Royal Society. We have taken account of unsolicited written evidence from several interested parties including members of Research Council staff and university research workers.IV   SCIENCE AND THE NATION6. Science is a means of obtaining knowledge about the structure andcharacteristics of the animate and inanimate world, and its importance tohuman society is that such knowledge lies at the base of nearly all humanactivities that influence positively or negatively the quality of human life andits environment. Science makes major contributions to the improvement ofhealth; to the provision of good food, shelter, transport and communication;to the efficient use and conservation of natural resources and the maintenanceof a good physical environment; to education; and to the development andmaintenance of an internationally competitive industry leading to a healthyeconomy. It is because governments are aware of the power of science toserve national goals that they are prepared to provide substantial nationalresources1 to sustain scientific activities over and above those which anycivilised society must provide to allow responsive and creative individuals to advance knowledge in any sphere.7. The determination of a national policy for science involves manydiverse judgments, but most of these are concerned with two broad aims;first, to assess and arrive at a reasonable consensus on various argumentsconcerning the amount of governmental support that should be provided for science, and second, to ensure that the arrangements for its disposal and use1 For details of support of research and development in the U.K. in the period 1961-71see Appendix D.
will enable the nation to be well served by science. In examining the work ofthe Research Councils the many national objectives to which science is relevant have therefore been constantly in our minds. In order to understand the relationships between the objectives and the work which needs to becarried out it is necessary to consider the nature of scientific activity, the people who engage in it and how these are organised.8. The most important elements in science are the content of attested facts and the theories which give it form and structure and which facilitate furtheradvances. Engineering is commonly thought of as being concerned with the conception, design, and construction of a machine, a structure or a process to achieve some well-defined purpose, such as the conversion of chemical energyinto electrical energy. Some would distinguish technology as contributingparticularly to the improvement and control of manufacture and of the prod-ucts of industry. These distinctions are often not very useful and lead topopular misconceptions which can be damaging. There is still a tendency toclassify engineers and technologists as &apos; applied&apos; scientists. The adjectives&apos; pure &apos; and &apos; applied &apos; imply a division where none should exist and their usecan be harmful. In the course of his work the engineer or technologist makesuse of experiment and theory in just the same way as the &apos; pure &apos; scientist, andat least as great demands are likely to be put upon his intelligence, judgmentand imagination. Moreover, advances in knowledge or improvements in theuse of any one of &apos; pure science &apos; or &apos; engineering &apos; or &apos; technology &apos; dependenormously on progress in the other two. In this report we use &apos; scientist&apos; toinclude also engineer and technologist, and &apos; science&apos; to include, as well asresearch, development and teaching activities in science, engineering and technology.9. The historical boundaries of scientific disciplines are becoming increas-ingly blurred. Multi- and inter-disciplinary studies grow apace and as a resultold boundaries dissolve and the links between seemingly disparate parts growstronger. This internal cohesion of science is one of its most characteristicfeatures and will surely increase rather than diminish.10. Rather than adopt any classification by subject or into &apos; pure&apos; and&apos; applied&apos; we have found it useful to have in our minds the following 3categories of scientific work(a) tactical science the science and its application and developmentneeded by departments of state and by industry to further their immediate executive or commercial functions. The extent and natureof this activity may vary widely according to the functions served andto the degree that they involve science. At one extreme it may contain a significant element of sophisticated research over a long period;whilst at the other extreme it amounts to little more than a modestintelligence and advisory activity;(b) strategic science the broad spread of more general scientific effort which is needed as a foundation for this tactical science. It is no lessrelevant in terms of practical objectives of the sort we have mentioned,but more wide ranging. For this &apos; strategic &apos; work to be successful it is
necessary to maintain the vigour of the underlying scientific disciplinesand to deploy these disciplines with due regard to national goals;(c) basic science research and training which have no specific application in view but which are necessary to ensure the advance of scientificknowledge and the maintenance of a corps of able scientists, uponwhich depends the future ability of the country to use science.These wide-ranging scientific activities are carried out by people who areemployed in public and private industry, in Government Departments, in research Councils and in higher education.11. Moreover, in order that research may be carried quickly to the point at which it can be applied and that scientifically trained men and women maybe employed to the best advantage, it is important that channels of communi-cations between scientists engaged on basic, strategic and tactical research should not be impeded and that there should be no hindrance to any desirablemovement of people between these three types of work.12. It is important to emphasise that the boundaries between these three categories are not always sharply defined. Basic and strategic science areespecially closely linked both with one another and with the higher educational system. A large contribution to research and to the education of futurescientists is made by academic staff in science-based university departments(numbering over 15,000 in 1968). The &apos; users&apos; of scientific knowledge and of scientists also need to have close connections with basic and strategic scienceas well as with tactical science. &apos; Users &apos; are often thought of merely in termsof employers, for example, science-based industry and Government depart-ments. The category is of course, much wider than this and includes, directly,many self-employed persons, such as doctors, veterinary surgeons, farmers,architects and consultant engineers, and indirectly, the whole community.V  THE PRESENT RESEARCH COUNCIL system a . history13. The C.S.P. is now concerned with the 5 Research Councils: Agri-cultural Research Council (A.R.C.), founded in 1931, Medical research council (M.R.C.), originally set up in 1913 and incorporated under its presenttitle in 1920, Natural Environment Research Council (N.E.R.C.), science research Council (S.R.C.) and Social Science Research Council (S.S.R.C.),all 3 established in 1965. This system derives from the Science and TechnologyAct 1965 which was based on some of the recommendations of the TrendCommittee (Cmnd. 2171).1 The relevant recommendations of this Committeewere that:(i) there should be no major change in the functions of the medical research Council and the Agricultural Research Council;(ii) a new Science Research Council should be established for the supportof research projects in pure and applied science, including nuclear1 The Social Science Research Council (S.S.R.C.) was established under the Science and technology Act 1965 on the recommendations of the Heyworth Committee (Cmnd. 2660),and has only this year come under the aegis of the C.S.P.
science and space research, and that it should assume direct controlover the Royal Observatories; but responsibility for the Meteoro-logical Office should remain with the Air Ministry (now Ministry ofDefence);(iii) a new Natural Resources Research Council should be established tobe responsible for the work of the Nature Conservancy, the Geo-logical Survey and the Soil Surveys and for research into long-termforestry, oceanography, hydrology, fisheries and related aspects ofaquatic biology;(iv) the system whereby the financing of the main body of scientific research in the universities was shared between the University GrantsCommittee and the Research Councils should be maintained;(v) there should be a new body to advise the Minister for Science on all aspects of his responsibilities in relation to civil scientific research.b. the work of the research councils14. The Research Councils are autonomous bodies, incorporated by royal Charter and receiving from the Secretary of State for Education and science under the 1965 Act grants-in-aid which account for almost all their income. Broadly their purpose is to foster research and training in the fieldsspecified in their Charters and they operate flexibly in many ways, includingthe following:(i) by the provision of grants to support work undertaken in universitydepartments and in other higher educational establishments, usuallyfor specified periods of up to 3 years but occasionally long-term.These grants can provide the university or college investigator withassistants at any level from technician to post-doctoral researchworker and can finance the purchase and maintenance of equipment.They may be used to establish &apos; groups&apos; in order to initiate thedevelopment of research and teaching in a new field;(ii) by the provision of maintenance awards and fees to support students who proceed to further studies or training in research after their first degree. About half the British postgraduate students in scienceare supported in this way. The Councils also provide researchtraining support grants to university departments in respect ofholders of such research training awards;(iii) by the establishment of units, generally in a university or comparableenvironment, where most of the staff are employed by the Councilusually on short-term contract; their directors may be research council employees or may be appointed on an honorary basis from among the salaried staff of a university;(iv) by the provision of expensive experimental facilities used by univer-sity research workers, such as the Rutherford and Daresbury highenergy physics laboratories of the S.R.C., and of other facilities forthe use of both Universities and Council Institutes, such as the research vessels of the N.E.R.C.;
(v) by means of grants to independent research agencies, laboratoriesand institutes. Examples of these are the Institute of Cancer Researchwhich derives just over 40 per cent of its budget from M.R.C. funds,institutes such as the Rothamsted Experimental Station grant-aided by the A.R.C. and associations such as the Marine BiologicalAssociation grant-aided by the N.E.R.C., where the research councils provide almost 100 per cent of the independent bodies&apos;budgets;(vi) by carrying out their own research programmes in their own researchinstitutions and component bodies (which may also provide researchfacilities for researchers from outside). Examples are the M.R.C.National Institute for Medical Research, the N.E.R.C. Institute ofGeological Sciences and A.R.C. Institutes such as the Institute of animal Physiology, where the research workers are the full-timeemployees of the Council concerned; and(vii) by participation in international scientific projects providing facilitiesfor U.K. researchers, such as the European Organisation for NuclearResearch (C.E.R.N.).15. The degree of detailed administration of research policies exercised bythe Research Councils varies considerably according to circumstances butgreat importance is rightly attached to the encouragement of good ideasgenerated by individual scientists. For this reason a large element in the policyof the Research Councils has been and will continue to be to support projectson scientific merit in terms of timeliness and promise. However, the research councils do not merely react to individual proposals put to them but, afterconsultation with those concerned, choose for particular support areas whichthey judge to be of national importance. Additionally in some fields and for awhole variety of reasons, including that of expense, they have found it necessaryto encourage the concentration of activity and resources. By these means the council&apos;s seek to maintain the supply of highly-trained manpower at the rightlevel and to develop their fields of responsibility in the national interest.16. The Research Councils have links with and provide advice and services to a remarkably wide range of Ministries and other public bodies as well as to industry. This is shown clearly in the Research Councils&apos; analyses of their activities (see Appendix C) and a list of the major links is given in Table 1.Table 1RESEARCH COUNCILS:SUMMARY OF LINKS WITH WORKOF OTHER PUBLIC ORGANISATIONSA.R.C.Building Research Station (Department of the Environment)Commonwealth Agricultural BureauxDepartment of Agriculture and Fisheries, ScotlandFood Research AssociationsForestry CommissionHome-Grown Cereals AuthorityHop Marketing BoardMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodMeat and Livestock Commission

THE WORK OF THE C.S.P.17. Changes in Ministerial functions in 1964 resulted in the transfer of the responsibilities of the Minister for Science to the new Secretary of State for
Education and Science.1 Following the recommendation of the TrendCommittee (see paragraph 13(v) above), the Council for Scientific Policy was set up in January 1965 &apos; to advise the Secretary of State for Education and science in the exercise of his responsibility for the formation and execution ofGovernment science policy.&apos;18. The Council has 15 members drawn from universities, industry and research establishments; its meetings are attended by assessors from the 4natural science Research Councils and the U.G.C. Because of the developinglinks between the C.S.P. and his Council, the Chairman of the S.S.R.C. hasalso attended the meetings of the C.S.P. for the last 2 years. C.S.P. papershave been circulated to other Government departments with an interest in its proceedings and some of these departments have sent assessors to its meetings.19. Much of the C.S.P.&apos;s work has been concerned with making the case for particular levels and growth rates for expenditure on science under the D.E.S.and with advising on the allocation of resources to the 4 Research Councils,the Royal Society, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Natural HistoryMuseum and the Office for Scientific and Technical Information. The totalcivil science budget on which the C.S.P. advises the Secretary of State is nownearly  120m. and in Table 2 below we show how this sum is distributed among the various agencies concerned. The way in which this total and its constituent parts have developed since 1965 is shown at Appendix A.Table 2SCIENCE VOTES ESTIMATES 1971-72	(  millions)	%of	Estimate	TotalA.R.C......................	18-704	16-0M.R.C......................	23-015	19-6N.E.R.C......................	15-888	13-6S.R.C......................	55-733	47-5Natural History Museum...............	1-877	1-6Science: Grants and Services4    ............	2-030	1-7Total      .....................	117-247	100-0S.S.R.C.t    .....................	4-141	* Including grants-in-aid to Royal Society and Royal Society of Edinburgh and theOffice for Scientific and Technical Information (O.S.T.I.).t The S.S.R.C. has come under the aegis of the C.S.P. in 1971.20. The C.S.P. has concerned itself with other more general problems of scientific policy. Some of this work has been published (see Appendix B) and additional studies on the following subjects have recently been completed or are in progress: biological manpower, the proposed European laboratory for molecularbiology, economic benefits of research, international scientific relations,1 A little later, in Autumn 1964, responsibility for the more applied and industrial work ofthe D.S.I.R. was transferred to the newly created Ministry of Technology (now D.T.I.) andother executive Government departments.
scientific interchange, survey of biological research, human resources inscience and technology, implications for scientific research of universityexpansion, the determination of priorities in research and the support of scientific research in universities.21. The function of the C.S.P. is purely advisory, and its advice is tendered to the Secretary of State for Education and Science, to whom the research councils also have direct access. This has meant that the C.S.P. has feltunable to concern itself too closely with the internal policies, priorities and organisation of individual Councils, although in the course of budgetaryreviews it has tried to ensure that their major policies and new developmentsare generally serving national requirements. In particular, although it hasnoted and drawn attention to various problems for instance, those ofco-operation or overlap the C.S.P. has not sought to intervene directly inany matter affecting the spread of scientific responsibility of an individualResearch Council.VI   GENERAL DISCUSSIONa. broad considerations22. In our deliberations we have borne in mind some relevant features ofthe contemporary situation, to some of which reference has already been made and all of which we believe will increase rather than diminish in importancein the future.23. The first point we have had to remember is the increasing pervasivenessof science and technology into all aspects of national activity, one result ofwhich is the increasing need experienced by many executive organisations,including Government departments, to have ready access to tactical researchto deal with specific problems. Additionally, at the level of basic research, it means that any given piece of basic research may have consequences for alarge number of different sectors of national activity. The discovery ofpolythene, for example, was an unforeseen consequence of basic research in industry, springing from theories developed in universities concerning theeffect of high pressures on chemical reactions, which in its turn, had even morediverse and unforeseen consequences; first, by facilitating the application ofcentimetric radar in wartime, and, at the other extreme, by enabling manu-facturers to produce lighter and pleasanter domestic utensils. The fact thatany piece of basic research finds many different users and not simply one isamply borne out by the study of the activities of the Research Councils, and isexemplified by the first Table in Chapter V.24. Analyses of past technical achievements frequently show that theywere based on many different pieces of basic research and the actual benefits of an individual basic research project have not lain in any one particular areaof application. These factors make it extremely difficult in most cases toquantify the economic benefits of past research and almost impossible to useestimates of future economic gains from a projected basic research programme as a criterion for decision.25. Another important point is that not only are the links between research and application complicated, but so also are the links between different pieces2rc
of basic research. Although in certain phases of the history of science therehas been great intellectual value, leading to rapid advances, in a fairly rigorousclassification of science into different disciplines, the increasing importance of inter-disciplinary research, particularly exemplified in molecular biology,must be borne in mind in considering the organisation of research as a whole.But the importance of inter-disciplinary research, great though it is, is not theonly manifestation of the inter-relatedness of different pieces of basic research.Advances in one discipline often lead indirectly, partly through improvedinstrumentation and other technological factors and partly through theintroduction of new concepts, to advances in another.26. A further point is the realisation that whereas the groupings, theconclusions, and the practical consequences of the sciences may change, the inherent characteristics of the scientific method remain constant, and it istherefore of fundamental importance for national scientific policy that thereshould be a corps of people soundly trained in the methods of scientific research.27. These points: the pervasiveness of the consequences of science, thediversity of its users, the complexity of the connections between basic research and related economic benefits, the close relationships between differentscientific disciplines, and the unifying importance of training in the methods of research, are, we believe, the most important general points about the natureof the scientific activity that we have to bear in mind in considering the research councils.28. Additionally, we are faced with a series of problems that have become increasingly important matters of public concern.29. Although we are convinced that science if adequately supported and properly managed will always be able to make a major contribution to the prosperity and wellbeing of society, we realise that there is now some publicdisillusion with science and concern with the adverse consequences of the useof at least some technologies, particularly in relation to the environment.Thus it may no longer be possible to assume that there will be general assent to the proposition that more science will make us wiser and richer. None-theless, it is certain that science must play a major role in the prevention of afurther deterioration in our environment.30. Because of the increasing pressure on government resources of other more directly appealing or social claims, we are now probably past the pointof maximum growth rate of resources for science. This creates difficultieswhich are increased by &apos; sophistication &apos; (a term used to express the fact that it becomes more expensive to make equivalent advances in knowledge) and bythe growth of &apos; big science &apos; (where the threshold of expenditure needed to achieve any worthwhile result tends to rise continually, as the fields of nuclearphysics and radio-astronomy illustrate). This growth of expense for what mightbe considered the same &apos; amount&apos; of good science can partially be offset, forexample, by increasing international collaboration and by selectivity in thesupport of science.31. The consequence of an increasing need for selectivity in support of science and for an increasing amount of international science at a time of
decreasing popular approval of science will be that Research Councils willhave to become increasingly well-informed about national needs and objectives,so that they may try to deploy scarce resources in the most appropriatedirection, and be seen to be doing so. Though, as we have seen above, this is atask of considerable complexity, it is also one of immense importance and we regard it as imperative that those responsible for determining scientificpriorities should be fully informed of and should pay due regard to government policy and national needs.32. Finally, there is the growing realisation that we can no longer expect toimprove existing technologies or introduce new developments by simpleapplication of knowledge based on the physical and biological sciences.Increasingly we need to know more about ways in which such new knowledgecan be used in harmony with the economic and human needs of the situation.And this calls for a much closer integration between the natural sciences andthe social sciences, in research certainly, but also in the broader training ofable people so that we may deploy our existing and new knowledge in ways which will give the maximum benefit to the community. Natural scientistswill find it increasingly desirable to collaborate with social scientists in trying to determine the best objectives for and the probable consequences of theirown activities. In some fields, notably the study of the control of environ-mental pollution, the development of social medicine and the encouragement of broader postgraduate training, joint work by the S.S.R.C. and otherResearch Councils is already going forward. We expect that there will be a growing range of activities in which such collaboration will be necessary.b. the research council principle33. Basic and strategic science comprises an extremely complex network of scientific activities. Some of these can be classified into particular scientificdisciplines but, as we have already mentioned, the boundaries between the mare rapidly being eroded. We have been impressed by the great extent ofmulti- and inter-disciplinary work and by the rapidly increasing tendency forthe interactions between the disciplines to grow stronger. The interactions arefacilitated by having productive and imaginative scientists in day-to-daycontact with colleagues working on related scientific projects with whom theycan collaborate directly in new research. An interaction of this sort is quiteunpredictable both in its nature and in the nature and extent of its conse-quences which may be the emergence of an entirely new area of scientificactivity or the application of a particular scientific technique to an entirely different field of science. To maintain therefore strong and flexible linkagesbetween scientists working in these fields it is important that they should be within the same organisation administered by people who recognise the benefitof these interactions and should not be dispersed to executive departments.For the same reason it is necessary to have a coherent policy for the whole ofthis scientific activity, especially during a period when costs are likely to growmore rapidly than resources.34. Despite our belief that science is a unity and that it could only suffer byfragmentation corresponding to the responsibilities of different executivedepartments, we felt that we ought to analyse the activities of the Research2*RC
Councils with a view to seeing whether it would be practicable to assign these activities to particular individual users of research, since we recognise the needfor close integration of the needs of users in the planning of research. Althoughat first sight the A.R.C., M.R.C. and N.E.R.C. might seem to fit naturallyinto M.A.F.F. (D.A.F.S.), D.H.S.S. (S.H.H.D.) and the Department of the environment respectively, this analysis has convinced us that great difficulties would arise from a transfer of the activities even of these three Councils enbloc to different government departments; further, few if any of the science research Council and Social Science Research Council activities could befitted appropriately into any executive Department of Government. The leastdifficulty would arise with the A.R.C. but even with this Council and moreespecially with the M.R.C. and N.E.R.C. the number of government depart-ments and other organisations whose work is assisted by particular researchprogrammes is surprisingly large (see Table 1 and Appendix C). For example,the applied psychology work which is undertaken by the M.R.C. is of veryconsiderable value to the Post Office, to the Ministry of Defence, to D.T.I.and to Industry. To allocate an activity of this kind to a particular governmentdepartment would create difficulties for the other interested governmentdepartments and would involve fragmentation of existing teams of scientistsmaking their work much less effective than it otherwise would be. Moreover,if wasteful duplication is to be avoided and work in similar fields is to be properly co-ordinated, any such dispersal of activity even if it were feasiblewould necessitate the establishment of inter-connections between the separately -ated parts which would be more numerous and more complex than thearrangements which now exist.35. We have deliberately made no reference to the Haldane Report(Cd. 9230), traditionally regarded as the basis for the Research Councilsystem, because we have examined the Research Council principle afresh in a modern context. For many years past it has been evident that Governmentdepartments need scientific knowledge (tactical science) and in some caseslarge scientific establishments to enable them to carry out their functions.But departments also need to be able to obtain help and independent advice from those who are engaged in strategic and basic science which underpins thework of several departments. It is essential that the advice and information from this source should be free from considerations of administrative andpolitical convenience; but it does not mean that policies for strategic and basicscience should be devised without proper regard for public policy. In fact, aswe have argued above it is of paramount importance that public needs shouldbe taken into consideration at all levels.36. Despite the different ways in which the Councils operate, a largeproportion of basic and strategic scientific activity is carried out within the universities where university and Research Council staff and funds are allinvolved with mutual benefit. This symbiotic relationship between the universities and the Research Councils is of the utmost importance. it provides the base from which future advances will be made and the education of future scientists beneficially influenced. To hope to replace this relationshipby a whole series of relationships between the universities and a multiplicityof Government departments which in total would be equally beneficial is inour view unrealistic.
37. It is a characteristic of basic and strategic science that neither thedevising of programmes of work nor the assignment of relative scientificpriorities to each programme can be carried out by non-scientists. If wisedecisions are to be made, programmes must be scrutinised and assessed byscientists of wide knowledge, much experience and a broad synoptic view of science. However, it is of the utmost importance that those making thesejudgments should be continually aware of national needs and objectives.Otherwise there will develop a dangerous and corrupting &apos; ivory towerism&apos;,which will also impede the most effective transfer of scientific ideas and dis-coveries to practical use.38. Finally, it is necessary to stress that the reduction of scientific co-ordination which would in our view be an inevitable consequence of theallocation of Research Councils to different executive bodies would result ina degree of financial inefficiency. Even with the addition of a complex ofco-ordinating committees (themselves an extra cost) there would inevitably bean increased degree of overlapping and duplication within Governmentsponsored scientific research. We suggest that the nation cannot afford theloss of efficiency, scientific and financial, which this action would entail.39. For all these reasons we recommend that whatever organisation isultimately adopted to manage basic and strategic research it should be one that unifies rather than fragments scientific activity, one in which the deter-mination of the scientific programmes is in the hands of scientists and onewhich retains a close association with the education and training of thescientists of the future. This is essentially a reaffirmation of the research council principle, to which we would add the essential qualification that theviews and needs of departments, of industry and of professional users shouldbe expressed at all levels, as much to those &apos; at the bench&apos; as to the policymakers.c. the need for closer links between research councils40. In our view it is illogical on the one hand to assert the unity of science and the fluidity of its internal boundaries, and on the other hand to approve asystem of completely independent Research Councils, each of which can onlyoperate within relatively rigid boundaries set by its individual charter. Theexistence of these charters inevitably introduces a constraint which inhibitsredeployment of effort and creates unnecessary demarcation problems. the research Councils have recognised this; in the last few years some havereorganised their own internal boundaries and all have effected some co-ordination of their activities. Moreover, there are many matters of common concern which in varying degrees affect their policies and which they cannotdetermine alone. There is, for example, the major problem of the BALANCEOF EFFORT within disciplines such as biology which are supported by morethan one Research Council and the timing and extent of any necessaryredistribution of effort. There are also FIELDS, for example, pollution, wherethe five Research Councils have already collaborated on joint projects; suchcollaboration is likely to be needed more frequently in the future. equally important is the question as to whether the BOUNDARIES have beencorrectly drawn, first, between responsibilities of individual Research councils and, secondly, between them and the responsibilities for science of many
government departments. Growing international involvement in research willrequire increasingly close co-ordination of the Research Councils&apos; policies.There are also questions of SCIENTIFIC MANPOWER that need study byeducationalists and industrialists as well as by the Research Councils them-selves: the number and kind of scientists required, balance between supply and demand, remedies for imbalance and the implications for the education of scientists. Finally, there are problems of STAFF POLICY: the desirability orotherwise of common grades and a common pension scheme and the pro-motion of mobility between the Research Councils and between them andindustry, universities, and government departments.41. We have already indicated that the Council for Scientific Policy hasmade studies of some of these problems as well as advising successive Secret-aries of State about monetary allocations to the Research Councils both in thelong-term and the short-term. It is, however, an advisory body only (seeparagraph 21 above) and has no executive power to ensure that its recom-mendations aie implemented. Its ability to determine policy has thus been limited to the influence which its discussions and published reports may have(an influence which is both varied and difficult to assess) and to the conse-quences for the Research Councils of its advice on financial allocations.42. It could be argued that it would be possible to achieve much of the closer co-ordination and collaboration between Research Councils, which we see as likely to be of increasing importance in the. future, within the presentframework of separate chartered Research Councils; that a central body suchas the C.S.P. could be strengthened and entrusted with responsibility fordevelopments within the whole Research Council system.43. Although we have given long and careful consideration to a possiblestrengthening of the C.S.P., we cannot see that this would be an effectivesolution even if on the advice of the Council, the Secretary of State were fromtime to time to use her power under the Science and Technology Act 1965 to direct the Research Councils on matters affecting the use and expenditure ofpublic funds and their responsibility for particular activities. Such an arrange-ment would inevitably rely on convention only and the central body wouldlack the authority and power to translate its conclusions directly into actions,which we regard as essential if it is to be effective. It would still remaindifficult to deal effectively with questions arising at the boundaries betweenResearch Councils or between their activities and those of Governmentdepartments, to encourage scientific developments made necessary by the changing scientific scene and to determine priorities in a meaningful wayacross the whole Research Council field, having regard to major nationalneeds.VII  PROPOSALS44. For the reasons discussed above we conclude that our purpose couldnot be achieved by simple modification of the present system, and there mustbe some important changes. In particular it is essential that governmentdepartments should play their part in the formulation of scientific policy. Theprinciples of scientific responsibility and of judgment on scientific merit whichare the important characteristics of the Research Council system must, how-
ever, be preserved. To lose these would undermine the confidence whichscientists justifiably have in the present system, which at the working leveloperates well and is highly regarded. In our view, this confidence would notsurvive the dismemberment of the Research Councils and the result would be aserious weakening of the national scientific effort.45. Although our arguments would seem to point to the establishment of amonolithic National Research Council we are opposed to this solution. Asingle Council given authority and responsibility over the whole range of strategic and basic science might become too remote from the scientistsactually carrying out the work; there would be a serious danger that a para-lysing bureaucracy might develop. There would also be a risk that if thegrant-giving authority were monolithic, its errors would have graver conse-quences.46. The morale of the scientific community, and therefore its effectivenessin research or teaching, in large measure depends on the fact that the people who make the detailed decisions on scientific programmes, awards of grants,studentship policy etc., are known to and respected by the working scientist.It is vital to maintain this morale by retaining the degree of devolution of decision and discussion which at present exists and perhaps even to increase it.We conclude therefore that there should continue to be individual research councils, each with a scientist at its head, much as at present. Such councils should be free to make and execute policy within areas which had been agreed by the mechanism described below; to formulate scientific policies related toobjectives within their own fields; to make scientific assessments of projects andto commit funds for their support up to certain levels within their total budget and to manage their own staff. The present status of the chief officers of the council&apos;s should also be preserved in order to retain the confidence of those with whom they have to negotiate. In this way we hope that the valuable andbeneficial relationships which have been established between policy deter-mining bodies such as the present Research Councils and their respectiveprofessional groups would be preserved and strengthened.47. We recommend that the activities of the Research Councils should become-ordinated and administered by a Board, which would include as fullmembers the scientific heads of the Research Councils (at present either theChairman or the Secretary). They have hitherto merely attended C.S.P.meetings as assessors. We regard it as essential that they should play a full part in the formulation and development of science policy, hearing and contri-buting to the arguments which apply in every field of science and sharing incorporate decision making.48. Because of the very strong connection between scientific research and higher education, we believe that the Board should be associated with theDepartment of Education and Science. It would enjoy a relationship with theDepartment similar to that between the present Research Councils and theDepartment. It would be a statutory body with a charter which would protect the independence of Government-supported basic and strategic science andwhich would empower it to delegate authority to the Research Councils along the lines envisaged in paragraph 46 above.
49. The Board would be the main source of scientific advice to the Secretaryof State for Education and Science and would make the case to her for theresources which it needed to carry out its tasks. Subject to the Secretary ofState&apos;s power of direction it would determine broad problems of sciencepolicy (such as those mentioned in paragraph 40 above) including any necessaryreorientation of that policy and any readjustment of the internal boundariesbetween Research Councils, and would allocate resources to the individualResearch Councils. It would also be able to add to and subtract from thenumber of the Research Councils, in response, for example, to the growth ofnew disciplines and the emergence of new professional groups. It should not however at any stage so reduce the number of Research Councils that thevirtues of the specialist Council were lost.50. In addition to the scientific heads of the Research Councils, the board should include a substantial number of independent members; some of these would be professional scientists whose combined knowledge would broadlycover the range of the natural and social sciences embraced by the research councils, and some would be persons with an understanding and experienceof science-in-action, most of them drawn from public or private industry. TheRoyal Society occupies a special position in the scientific life of the countryand for this reason we believe that the President should always be a member.Since more than half the students in universities are in science-based faculties,one member should be a Vice-Chancellor. The Chairman of the U.G.C.should also be a member.51. In order that the Board may be fully and continually aware of public policy and of those needs of executive departments of Government which canbe served by the scientific activities of Research Councils and in order thatwasteful overlap or duplication may be avoided, it is essential that Govern-ment departments should be informed about the Board&apos;s activities and thatthey should be guaranteed access to the Board&apos;s discussions and should beable to raise at Board level matters of interest to them, which had a bearing on research Council activities. The Board should therefore include, as members,playing a full part in decision-making, representatives from Governmentdepartments with major scientific interests. We suggest that the Chief scientific adviser, Cabinet Office and an appropriate officer of the D.E.S. should be twosuch members and that, so as not to make the Board too big, three other mem-bers should be appointed, perhaps in rotation, from other departments closely concerned with the BoarrTs work. Other departments should receive theBoard&apos;s papers and be able to attend any meeting discussing matters of direct interest to them. The Board should also from time to time arrange specialdiscussions on policies and programmes to which appropriate user interests,both inside and outside government, should be invited. We would, however,wish to emphasise very strongly that the views of Government departments should not be expressed at Board level only but should continue to be heardand to exert influence at the level of the Research Councils and at any otherlower level which is thought to be appropriate and necessary. Conversely, we see comparable advantages in representation of the Research Council system on advisory bodies of other government departments.52. The organisational arrangement we envisage for the proposed board is shown in the following diagram:
SECRETARY OF STATE		BOARD OF THE RESEARCH COUNCILS			Chairman (Accounting Officer) Independent Members President of the Royal Society, Vice-chancellor 1, DES 1, Cabinet Officel, Other Ministries 3, UGC1.			Scientific Heads of Research Councils		RESEARCH COUNCILS		
53. The task of the Chairman would be a highly responsible one: his duties would be onerous and could not be discharged on a part-time basis. We,therefore, propose that he should be appointed full-time for a prescribed period with very limited possibility of renewal of the appointment only in exceptional cases. It is clearly highly desirable that most of his working lifeshould have been spent as a scientist rather than an administrator. He wouldbe the Research Councils&apos; natural link with the rest of the Governmenfseffort in research and development, and should represent the research council system on any central body concerned with the co-ordination of the government&apos;s overall R. &amp; D. programme. One of the independent members should be appointed Deputy Chairman to help him in these responsible tasks,and the Board would certainly require its own secretariat.54. The Research Council and independent members of the Board wouldbe appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science. In orderto preserve the status of the individual Councils, we would like their chairmen and members to be appointed by the Secretary of State after consultation withthe Board, with her ministerial colleagues where appropriate, and in the caseof scientific members, with the P.R.S. Existing arrangements for the appoint-ment of representatives from other departments would remain unaffected.The full-time chief officer of each Council (where not himself the Chairman)should also be appointed by the Secretary of State on the advice of the Boardand the P.R.S. In practice one would expect that conventions would developwhich would simplify the consultational processes.55. Before the Board is established, careful consideration should be givento the scope and extent of its responsibilities. Our analysis of the work of the research Councils has convinced us that, whilst most of the work of all theexisting Research Councils would fall naturally within its competence, thereare certain areas of activity within the present Research Council structurewhich merit further study to see whether they ought not to be transferred tosome other department of Government and equally there are activities atpresent within the responsibility of departments of Government which mightafter examination be better placed within the jurisdiction of the Board. Inparticular, we think it would be inappropriate for the Board to assume financial responsibility for independent private bodies such as the Royal Society or forinstitutions such as the Natural History Museum. In our view under the new arrangements these might receive their financial support direct from the D.E.S.We have had neither time nor opportunity to examine specific areas wheretransfer into or out of the Research Council system might be advisable. Themain point we wish to make here is that there is a whole range of such problemsneeding detailed study in which the C.S.P. or, after its establishment, theBoard should participate.56. The acceptance of these proposals would mean the dissolution of theC.S.P. and devolution of some of the responsibilities of the Department ofEducation and Science. In particular, it would be logical if some of thefunctions and responsibilites now discharged by the Science Branch of theD.E.S., including international scientific relations, were to be transferred to theBoard.
VIII  SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND PROPOSALS57.(i) The Research Council structure with its specialist control of a wide range of highly sophisticated activities appears essential for the bestadministration and conduct of this area of government-sponsoredscientific activity in the U.K. which we consider to be of great impor-tance. It has however certain disadvantages arising from a limitedability of adjustment to changing circumstances, and requires modi-fication (paragraphs 40, 44-46).(ii) The network of responsibilities and inter-relationships of the research councils, is however of such a nature that they could not each be assigned to one uniquely appropriate department. Were each to be administered by an executive department, new and complicatedco-ordinating committee structures would be necessary, which would lead to overall loss of efficiency scientifically, administratively andfinancially (paragraph 34).(iii) In order to retain the advantages of the Research Council system,while providing for stronger links with the needs and policies ofgovernment departments and for the possibility of adjustments of responsibilities between Councils and the transfer of specific activitiesboth into and out of their field, we propose the replacement of theCouncil for Scientific Policy by a new chartered body, here referredto as the Board of the Research Councils, responsible to the Secretaryof State for Education and Science (paragraph 47).(iv) This Board would consist of a Chairman, the scientific heads of the research Councils, the President of the Royal Society, a univetsityVice-Chancellor, independent members, members from the mostrelevant Government organisations and from the U.G.C. and asses-sors from other Government departments. Under the Secretary ofState it would be responsible for financial allocations to the individualCouncils, and would keep under review their broad policies andtheir range of responsibilities with the power to make necessarymodifications, although each Council would be free to make andexecute policies within its area of responsibility (paragraphs 46-51).(v) The Board would have the overall responsibility of ensuring that therequirements of executive departments for scientific support fromResearch Councils were being properly met, on a service or contractbasis where appropriate, and by the provision of independent and authoritative information and advice in other cases (paragraph 51).(vi) We believe that these proposals represent a natural evolution fromthe present system and that they would combine the very considerable advantages that this system has for individual scientists, for scientificorganisations and for the universities with greater flexibility and an improved capacity for service to Government departments and tothe community.

2. An analysis of all sector support for R and D carried out in the U.K. since1961-62 is given above (Table 2). Government support for R and D (civil and defence together) rose from an estimated  385m. in 1961-62 to  485-3m. in 1967-68with the civil share growing from 36-2 per cent in 1961-62 to 53 per cent in 1967-68.In the same period expenditure on R and D by industry rose from an estimated 266m. in 1961-62 to  405-2m. in 1967-68.3. Government expenditure overseas on research and development since 1966-67is given in Table 3 below.Table 3GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE OVERSEAS ON R AND D  thousand	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69Defence ...      ...      ...      ......	15,930	15,502	19,385Civil:			External relations	1,317	1,475	1,402Roads and transport ...      ............	3	1	 Atomic Energy        ...............	1,402	973	1,901Aerospace     ..................	3,386	5,426	3,375M.R.C......................	54	58	63N.E.R.C...................	 	2	2S.R.C.          ..................	7,768	9,838	11,612Other science grants ...	10	22	37Agriculture, fisheries and forestry	5	5	6Health and welfare...............
