JIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government cp(71) 126 COPY NO      0 62 November 1971CABINETTHE STATE OF THE SHIPBUILDING industry note by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry, In December 1970, the Economic Policy Committee accepted theconclusions of an Official Report on Shipbuilding Policy.    These were thatafter the ending of the Shipbuilding Industry Board (SIB) in December 1971,there would be no case on economic grounds for giving special support tothe industry other than that afforded by the home credit scheme and by&quot;shipbuilders relief&quot; (the latter being a 2 per cent subsidy).    It was concluded, however, that on regional employment grounds any majorclosures ought to be phased over a period.    This policy was reviewed by theCommittee in May 1971 and reaffirmed.2. The first real test of the policy came when Upper Clyde Shipbuilders(UCS) collapsed in June 1971.    We let the collapse take place and have beenseeking to pick up the bits, redundancies being phased over a period at high cost to public funds, in view of the high level of unemployment on Clydeside,Now we are faced with Cammell Laird, saved from imminent collapse bythe promise of a Government loan, though only temporarily; Doxford whichcould go the same way at any moment, and Swan Hunter and Lower Clydeeither of which could come to grief and would no doubt be in greater dangerof doing so as a result of confidence being still further shaken byCammell Laird or Doxford.    The Annex gives more details of the situation of some major groups.3. The background to all this is inefficient management; inadequatefacilities and bad labour relations despite the Geddes report of five yearsago, the activities of the SIB and the expenditure of some  60 million ofpublic funds.    We perhaps don*t need a merchant shipbuilding industry inthe long term but4 if we mean to have one it will take a proper strategy to attain it involving a substantial new departure; further expenditure of verylarge sums; and the introduction of high quality management.    All these things would have to be found by Government because there is nobody elseprepared to do so.1
CKf RET4.        Even if we initiate the development of such a strategy it will take timeto work out and certainly wonTt help in the short-term to meet the problemsof a collapsing industry.    That can only be achieved by baling out as we are doing at UCS and are preparing to do at Cammell Laird at very high costproviding little or nothing towards the resurgence of a competitive industry for the future.    There are some 55, 000 jobs In all directly at risk, thelarge majority in assisted areas (Annex gives details).    In addition a largenumber of jobs will be at rink in suppliers, the majority also in assisted areas.5.        A working group of officials has been looking once again at thewhole problem and have tried to devise a means of rescue.    I have no doubtthat this can be done but it must be realised that it we adopt such a schemeit is in plain contradiction with our announced policy towards industry ingeneral and this industry In particular.    And it will cost a great dealpperhaps  40 million or more.    Moreover if as is likely it aims atsubsidising unviable businesses before they collapse we are going to haveto explain why we dldnTt do just that in the case of UCS.6. There is no case whatever on industrial grounds for adopting theseshort-term policies.    On the contrary it is quite probable that to pursuethem will in the end militate against the development of a sound merchantship building industry.    The only reason for them is the unacceptably high level of unemployment.    Before putting forward any proposals to saveshipbuilding firms for employment and social reasons, I am sure that weshould pause and consider the fundamental questions of industry policywhich are at issue.J d department of Trade and industry November 1971
