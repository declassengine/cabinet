HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 11418 October 1971UPPER CLYDE SHIPBUILDERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for trade and IndustryBACKGROUND1. On 12 October (CM(7I) 49th Conclusions. Minute 5), I was instructed to tell Mr McGarvey of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and engineering Unions (CSEU) that the Government would not enter into negotiations with shipowners on the conditions on which they wouldconfirm their orders except on the basis of acceptable and publicassurances by Unions of co-operation with Govan Shipbuilders Ltd andmeaningful negotiations on working practices and wage rates.    Ifassurances given by Unions were repudiated by shop stewards theGovernment would not be prepared to go ahead.    I was also asked topress Irish Shipping Ltd and the Brazilian Government to modify their demands.    Ministers wished to reconsider the position before commit-ments were entered into.UNION ATTITUDES2. Following my meeting with Mr McGarvey on 12 October, a joint statement (copy annexed), accepted by both the Unions and myself, was issued in which the Unions, after reaffirming that their objective was to preserve employment in all the four yards of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders(UCS) undertook:-a.      to give assurances as to the contribution of the workforce to the timely and efficient delivery of the ships provided the Government were prepared to give the requisiteguarantees to shipowners and the Liquidator was prepared to start work; and. b.      that as soon as these arrangements had been made theywere prepared immediately to enter into meaningfulnegotiations regarding working practices, wage rates, etc.with Govan Shipbuilders Ltd.COPY NOCABINET1
3. This statement has been approved by the shipbuilding committee ofthe CSEU and on the recommendation of the shop stewards it was endorsedat a mass meeting of workers on 15 October, though with some reservationsthat might constitute stumbling blocks in the future.DISCUSSIONS WITH SHIPOWNERS4. The Minister for Industry has discussed with Irish Shipping limited the conditions they had earlier laid down for allowing work on their ships to proceed.    Although pressed very hard, Irish Shipping refused to modify their conditions that obligations should be accepted for all four ships to be built at Govan at the original contract price.    However, they concededthat a refund guarantee should not cover payments made to UCS from theirown resources (about  800,000) before the liquidation.    They also agreedto amend the penalty clauses in the contracts to apply to realistic deliverydates and to cancel the penalty provisions in the contracts in the event ofthe shipbuilder not completing the contract.    However the company made clear that without a refund guarantee covering all payments afterliquidation and the pre-liquidation payment ( 320, 000) covered by a bankadvance, they will not proceed.    I am convinced there is no prospect ofobtaining any further modifications of their demands.5.        Negotiations with the Brazilian Government have begun.WORKING CAPITAL FOR LIQUIDATOR6. To avoid redundancies at Govan the Liquidator must be able to startwork on new ships by the end of the month, and he must order the necessarymaterials and equipment now to ensure that it is available in time.conclusion.        Despite some continuing uncertainty about the commitment of the shop stewards to the joint statement I invite my colleagues to agree to myentering into arrangements on the lines set out in CP(71) 109 with IrishShipping Limited and with the Liquidator which are necessary to enablework on new ships to begin.J d department of Trade and Industry18 October 19712SiiCItPikJi 5
