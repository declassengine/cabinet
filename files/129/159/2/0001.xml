THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 10227 September 1971CABINETSTRUCTURE PLANS: FORM OF INQUIRYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment, The Home and Social Affairs Committee discussed the attached paper at Annex on 24 September, and decided that the proposal to amend the existing procedures relating to inquiries into structure plans shouldbe considered by the Cabinet.2. Though my colleagues on the Committee accepted the general principle underlying the proposed change they expressed three maindoubts.THE POLITICAL, IMPLICATIONS3. The proposal could be criticised as removing a safeguard ofthe rights of individuals affected by a structure plan.    But the individualsright to object would remain as would the obligation on the Secretary ofState to consider the objection.    Only the right for an objector to repeathis objection at a personal hearing would go.    Furthermore structure planswill not be prepared in sufficient detail to enable the precise effect onproperty interests to be identified.    These effects will only become clear at the local plan stage; and I am proposing no alteration to the rights ofobjectors to be heard at local plan inquiries.4. In support of my proposal it can be argued that it will significantlyreduce the period during which an individuals property will be &quot;blighted&quot;by the publication of broad strategic plans whose detail can emerge only at local plan stage.PRESENTATION5.        The Lord President in particular is concerned at the implications for the Parliamentary programme of introducing a controversial elementinto the otherwise non-controversial Town and Country Planning Bill at thebeginning of the next Session.6.        I must accept the risk of controversy if the presentation of theproposal both inside and outside Parliament is not well handled.    Mybelief however is that provided we present properly the arguments aboutspeeding up the whole development plan process - enabling the Secretary1COPY NO6i
of State to concentrate more effectively and speedily on the main strategicelements of the structure plan whilst retaining the full traditional inquiryprocess at the second, local plan stage, the critics will largely be silenced.It would be a rash man who sought to justify the preservation of the sort ofendless process represented in its extreme form by the Greater LondonDevelopment Plan inquiry.TIMING7. It was suggested that the proposal could be more persuasivelypresented if it formed part of a package of which the other two ingredientswere proposals for giving more generous compensation for injuriousaffection and the establishment of the local government ombudsman.8. The latter provision will be included in the Local Government Bill.The timing and detailed content of the compensation legislation has yet tobe decided, but we are already on record on various occasions as promisingimproved compensation for injurious affection.    There seems no reason why both these arguments could not therefore be advanced at the time of theTown and Country Planning Bill,conclusion.        In my opinion we face a real dilemma if we do not legislate next session on this subject.    Structure plans will be reaching me in 1972 and once the existing inquiry arrangements start biting we will be under strong pressure to process them quickly.    The inquiry time element is the oneover which I can exercise no control.10.        The subject matter is clearly appropriate to the Town and country planning Bill.    But if, despite this, my colleagues consider itscontroversial nature would make it more expedient to include itin the Local Government Bill I would not object.P YTDepartment of the Environment27 September 19712
(confidential.     We need, within an acceptable timetable, xrorthwhile structure and local plans which will implement the new system in the Town &amp;Country Planning Act 1968, give effect to regional strategies (like that for the South East), devolve more responsibility to localauthorities, and provide a basis for effective development controland a fair system of compensation,    I-have taken administrative action and have authority for a Bill streamlining statutory procedures for preparing plans0    But these measures will not be sufficient unless we ensure that there is speedy handling of submitted structure planswithin central Government.    I therefore wish to add to my Bill, due for introduction in early November provisions designed to make thepresent inquiry process more relevant to the character of structureplans.2.     The new development plan system is described in the Annex.    the separation of policy and strategic issues over a wide area (the structure plan) from their detailed application (local plans) has been widely accepted.    But given these new two tiers of plans and the new provisions for publicity and participation on both, the presentprovision for an identical form of inquiry into both plans will involve an unacceptable overlap, lengthening of the already time-consumingplanning processes and give objectors two bites at the cherry.    It isnot as if, as the Greater London Development Plan (GLDP) inquiry hasshown, objections are a reliable indication of the issues on which theSecretary of State should concentrate in considering structure plans.Also, established usage means that a public inquiry into objectionsalone would involve, on both plans, the full apparatus of cross-examination and rebuttals.3.     The structure plan properly lies    in the process of plan-makingbetween a regional strategy and a local development plan of the traditional Ordnance Survey map-based type.   We do not hold inquiriesinto strategies;&quot;we publish them and invite and consider comments frominterested bodies before giving a formal Government view on their
contento   The traditional public inquiries to hear objections to development plans will continue to be held at the stage local plans are prepared.    These are the plans which deal with the effect of planning on individuals and their property.Ij..     The character of structure plans in terms of purpose and contentcalls for the creation of a procedure somewhere between the two justdescribed.We must maintain the right of the public (as organisations andas individuals) to object to structure plans and the obligation onthe Secretary of State to consider all objections made.    But to makethe form of structure plan inquiries realistic, to avoid the vista ofGLDP-type inquiries, and to rebut mounting criticism of our failure(like that of previous administrations) to deal with plansexpeditiously, I think it essential, subject to the retention of the key points described above, that:-i. the Secretary of State should have the power to set outpublicly, in advance of the hearing, the issues (includingspecific alternatives to the policy and general proposals inan authority&apos;s structure plan) which he wishes to see publiclyexamined, in the light of the consideration he will already have given to the plan as submitted and the objections madeto it;ii. there should no longer be a right for every objectorto be heard; objectors should have to put their objectionsand their grounds for them in writing in such a form thatthey are sufficient in themselves without the need forfurther elaboration orally;iii. the Secretary of State should have the power to decide which objections, singly or in groups, were relevant to the issues arising on the plan to which his decision would bedirected and which should therefore be heard at whatever formof public hearing he decides on;6.     These proposals could be introduced in the Bill for which I already have authority in a way which involves the minimum of amendment to the1968 Act,    They would be controversial.    But the problem of the formalinquiry into structure plans i3 already receiving public attention, in local government and in the professional world of both planners andlawyers.   We ought to anticipate the concern which Parliament and ourParty are bound to shovr if we appear to have done nothing to prevent an apparently inevitable seizing up of the central government&apos;s machineat the inquiry stage.7.     At first sight, my proposals could be criticised as breaching the manifesto&apos;3 declared intention to safeguard the rights of the citizens.But, given the entrenched safeguards I would be preserving thispotential criticism is neither realistic nor accurate.    Beforestructure plans are ever submitted there will be the nextf 19&amp;8 Actopportunities for publicity and participation at the formative stages of plan-making.   My proposals would retain a public examination ofstructure plan issues and a public consideration of all those objections which were directed to the strategic issues with which the plan was concerned.    Later there would be the traditional public local inquiryz
into objections to the local plan in which the precise effect of proposals on property and other interests could be identified.We can I believe therefore be satisfied that we are notbreaching the Manifesto,,    Convincing Parliament and the public ofthis will depend on how   effective and sympathetic a presentation of any proposal we make.    By the due date for Second Reading theG-LDP Inquiry vrill have entered well into its second year of sittings.This in itself could help to provide a climate of opinion receptiveto these proposals, but I would welcome my colleagues&apos; viewsparticularly on this presentational aspect0    If the Committeeapprove the proposals I would intend to consult on a confidentialbasis the organisations principally concerned, immediately.    I willalso seek the Lord Chancellor&apos;s advice on how best to satisfy the legitimate interest of the Council on Tribunals.    This legislationcannot in my view be deferred to some later date.    The first 1968Act structure plan is due to be submitted next year.   We cannot afford to let this become bogged down in any inquiry before we are seen to acte9o     I seek the agreement of my colleagues to these proposals and authority to instruct Counsel to draft accordingly for the Town and country Planning Amendment Bill for introduction at the beginning ofthe new Session.
VwlN.1 lUeiM I 1ALANNEXTHE 1968 ACT DEVELOPMENT PLAN system.      Content and form   The Act provides for;-i. Structure plans - a written statement, illustrateddiagrammatic ally, setting out the local planning authority8 policy and general proposals for the development and other useof land, including measures for the improvement of the physicalenvironment and the management of traffic; and ii. Local plans - a map (on an Ordnance Survey base) and a written statement, which formulate in appropriate detail the structure plan&apos;s proposals with which local plans are to confirmgenerally.2*     Procedure   In preparing both types of plan, the authority haveto give publicity to survey work and to the proposed contents of a plan.    They have to consider representations about their content fromthe public  (organisations and individuals) and other bodies beforefinally drawing up the plan.    Then:-i. structure piens have to be submitted to the Secretary ofState&quot;7&quot;15Ko must Hold a public local inquiry into objections.    Hemay approve them wholly or partly, with or without reservationsand modifications (proposed modifications are advertised and ifreflecting new matter not covered at the inquiry are likely tobe the subject of a further inquiry);ii. local plans are for adoption by the authority themselves.They Too must hold a public local inquiry into objections (byan Inspector appointed by the Secretary of State), and may adopta plan with or without modifications to meet objections.    It isthe local plan which, like existing development plans, showplanning proposals in detail and their effect on individuals andtheir property.    The Secretary of State may direct that any local plan shall need his approval.3.     It took 7 years for the first round of development plans (whichwere largely chronicles of land use) under the 191+7 Act to be prepared and submitted before the whole country was covered.    The last of these plans vras approved in 19&amp;3.    In some cases the process fromsubmission to approval was as long as 10 years.I+.      It will take longer than 7 years for the whole country to be covered by structure plans; and a longer period for these to befollowed by adopted local plans.5.     The reasons for this are partly that:--i.      a one-tier system of development plans is being replaced bya two-tier system in which detailed local plans depend on andfollow through the prior structure plan;General
UNrlublii. a new system is bound to take time to produce results,especially when the difficulties of transition from one system to another are aggravated by the concurrent reorganisation oflocal government areas and functions.6.      Other reasons as important, though less transitional, are-iii. the objectives of structure plans are more ambitious --covering social, environmental, regional and resource factors as well as &quot;land use&quot;, while techniques are more sophisticated!iv. there is now greater public involvement, interest and7.     In particular, inquiries - as Roskill and Layfield have shown -have become more wide-ranging acid lengthy.    The obvious danger isthat a form of inquiry which has involved basically the hearing ofobjections on individual properties will not prove apt for the moresearching analysis of structure plans.protest.
