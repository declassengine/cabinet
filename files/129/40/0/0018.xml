Cir- this   document  is  the   property  op  his   britannic   majesty&apos;s   government    73Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1950SECRET Copy No.3 2CP. (50) 11826th May, 1950.cabinet meeting OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL, 15th-18th MAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the following account of theFourth Session of the Atlantic Council, which was held at Lancaster House from15th to 18th May. The meeting was attended by the Foreign Ministers of all twelvecountries and was presided over by Mr. Dean Acheson, the United States Secretaryof State.2.   The Council took the following important decisions:  (i) It established a body of Deputies.(ii) It gave the Deputies a detailed directive on defence questions.(iii) In a series of Resolutions, it also gave directives to the Defence and theDefence Financial and Economic Committees for their future work.(iv) It set up a North Atlantic Planning Board for Ocean Shipping.(v) It issued a communique setting out the principles and the objectives ofthe Treaty nations.Body of Deputies3. This body consists of Deputies of members of the Council, (i.e., foreign ministers) with full authority from their Governments to carry out the policies ofthe Council in the intervals between meetings of Ministers. The Deputies willmeet regularly and will have their headquarters in London. Their chief functionswill be to ensure co-ordination in the defence field, to exchange views on political matters, to co-ordinate public information activities and to consider what further action should be taken under Article 2 of the Treaty in the economic field. the deputies will have a permanent Chairman, chosen from among their number.This Chairman will be assisted by a highly qualified staff contributed by member governments. The full text of the CounciFs resolution on this subject is at Annex I.4. The principal features of this new organisation are: first, that it givescontinuity to the work of the Council; secondly, that it enlarges the field of its work to cover not only defence questions as hitherto, but also public information,economic and general foreign policy; thirdly, that, through the permanent Chairmanof the Deputies and his staff, it provides for unified direction and vigorous leader-ship in the execution of the Treaty&apos;s objectives.5. The discussion on this question at the Council meeting centred mainly on three points:  (a) LocationThe French would have preferred Washington, but the Americans saidfrom the first that they favoured Europe. The strongest argument in favourof London was that the Permanent Staffs of the Military Supply Board andthe Defence Financial and Economic Committee are already here, and with full support from the two Scandinavian Delegations, there was little difficultyin reaching agreement on this point.
(b) Nature of the Permanent StaffThere was general agreement that, although the Deputies would need apermanent secretariat, something more than this was necessary to provide the jvigorous leadership which everyone thought necessary. The Americans took the line that this leadership could not be supplied by an international civil servant, since he would not have the backing of a member Government, andtherefore proposed the device of a permanent Chairman chosen from amongthe Deputies. Although it was not formally agreed, it was generally under-stood that this Chairman would be the American Deputy. The United StatesGovernment have not yet decided whom to appoint, but they are known to attach great importance to the post and will probably choose a first-class man.It was also on American insistence that the precise nature of the proposed newpermanent staff was deliberately left vague, since they thought that the organi-sation should be fitted round the man rather than the man into the organisation.(c) Economic QuestionsThere was general agreement that future economic relations betweenEurope and North America after 1952 required urgent study and that in this study the position of Germany was an important factor. There was, however,some difference of view on the question where and how this study should beundertaken. The Norwegian Foreign Minister thought that the Atlantic Pactwas the proper body since of all existing &quot; Western &quot; organisations it aloneincluded representatives from both sides of the Atlantic. The NetherlandsForeign Minister, on the other hand, was afraid that this would merely leadto duplication of the work of O.E.E.C., which he thought was the appropriate body to study the question. Eventually it was agreed that Article 2 (which deals with economic collaboration) was an integral and important part of theTreaty which could not be ignored and that it must be left to the Deputies toexamine what further action should be taken under it, taking into account thework of other international organisations.Directive on Defence Questions6. The French were insistent from the start that the Council should give the deputies a directive on the broad principles which should guide them in their examination of defence questions. They wished to draw attention, in particular,to the need for making available forces for the initial battle, for adapting the composition of forces to the modern weapons they would have to use, for distri-buting efficiently among the member countries the production of the arms required and for dividing the cost equitably between them. In the discussion of this questionseveral Ministers expresesd doubts whether the Council was at this stage reallyin a position to issue such a detailed directive on technical questions. After previous consultation with the Ministry of Defence, I said that I rather shared their pointof view. At the same time, I understood and sympathised with the anxiety whichunderlay the French proposal. I drew the Councils attention to the difficult and dangerous position of the Continental countries which would have to bear the firstbrunt of the battle: it would be a terrible blow to tell them that they had got tobe occupied again before they could be liberated, because there were not sufficientforces to withstand the first attack. The object of the Council must be to build upsuch a force that the people of Europe could count on being defended and that,consequently, the enemy would be deterred from risking an attack. The views expressed by M. Schuman and myself evidently made some impression on the americans, and at the last meeting of the Council Mr. Acheson made an importantdeclaration in which he said that both he and his Government were in complete agreement that it was essential to create forces sufficient to resist aggression at themoment of first attack and to continue the struggle through to the end. The Councilfinally agreed on a modified form of the French proposal which, instead of givingspecific directives, sets out certain principles and issues which it believes to be important, and asks for the advice and recommendations of the technical expertson how to give effect to them. A copy of the resolution as adopted is attached at annex II.Resolutions on Defence7.   Attached at Annex III is the text of the six principal Resolutions passedby the Council with regard to defence matters. &apos;,     ;
The chief points in these Resolutions are:    .: (i) The Council asks the Defence Committee to produce as soon as possiblean estimate of the cost of plans for the defence of the xNforth Atlanticcountries.(ii) In Order to fill the great gap between forces at present available and thosewhich will be required, the Council urges Governments to ensure the progressive build up Of defence forces.;&apos;(iii) The Council also urges Governments to concentrate on the creation of&quot;&apos;,&apos; balanced collective forces rather than balanced national forces.(iv) The Council approves the Defence Committee&apos;s request to the DefenceFinancial and Economic Committee to examine immediately thepossibility of the Treaty nations supporting additional military expenditure.; (v) The Council recognises that a sound economy is the necessary basis ofthe required defence effort,(yi) The Council recognises the need for closer liaison between the variousexisting North Atlantic Treaty bodies,(vii) The Council urges Governments to make their full contribution to common defence by means of mutual assistance.8. In my opening speech to the Council I touched on most of the important points raised by these Resolutions. I said that now if ever was the time to establishsome sort of balanced international forces. Not only the military burden, however,but also the economic burden of defence must be shared. The Western countries had to consider how they could build up an economy capable of carrying this burden. Against the almost religious fervour of the Communists, we must puta simple constructive industrial programme for the welfare of the people. Thusalone could we fortify the world&apos;s faith in Western civilisation and at the same timeprovide the means to improve our defences and deter a potential aggressor.9. The discussion on the Resolutions themselves turned on two main points: -... (a) The Question of Balanced Collective forces there was general agreement on the principle that an effective defence is1 impossible unless there are balanced collective forces for the whole north atlantic area. There was some disagreement, however, on whether the estab-lishment of balanced collective forces was compatible with the existence ofbalanced national forces in each country. M. Schuman thought that it was,and Mr. Acheson felt strongly that it was not. I said that I thought that our: purpose was to establish forces which would satisfy national requirements intime of peace and at the same time provide the most powerful co-ordinated&apos;.. striking force in time of war. This view was generally accepted, and it was finally agreed that balanced collective forces must be the objective and notbalanced national forces; but that in establishing the balanced collective forces,account must be taken of national requirements for internal security, com-. commitments outside the North Atlantic area and local defence on the outbreakof hostilities.ib) The Relative Priority of Defence Requirements and Economic RecoveryI explained that I could not at present accept any modification of thegeneral principle that economic recovery enjoyed priority over defence require-ments. Other Ministers shared my view, and it was accordingly decided toword the relevant Resolution non-committally to say that &quot; while the making of additional military expenditures must be judged in the light of economic and. financial conditions, adequate consideration must be given to the needs for defence.&quot;North Atlantic Planning Board for Ocean Shipping10. This Board will be composed of representatives of interested member countries, and there is provision for representatives of other countries to be invitedto participate in its work as appropriate. It will report directly to the Council andwill work in close co-operation with the other Treaty bodies in all matters related to defence planning. At my invitation, the Board will hold its first meeting inLondon, probably some time in June.  There was no discussion of this item at the38793 b 2
Council, which merely approved the recommendations of the Working Group in washington.Statement of Principles ;11. In my opening speech I expressed the hope that it would be possible forthe Council to make a public declaration of faith and principles. My suggestion was supported by the Danish Foreign Minister and was referred to a sub-committee.After long discussion it was eventually found impossible to reach agreement on the text of such a declaration. The Americans insisted that it should be stronglyworded and show no suggestion of weakness in the prosecution of the &quot;cold war.&quot;The French, on the other hand, wanted it to be moderate in tone and to containsome reference to the possibility of negotiations with the Soviet Union Each sideinsisted that nothing less than a declaration on the lines they proposed would be acceptable to their public opinion Prolonged attempts to bridge this disagreementfailed, and it was therefore decided, instead, to include a brief and uncontroversialstatement of principles and objectives in the final communique.12. During the discussion of the communique I expressed some doubts aboutthe following sentence:j-&apos;&quot;In formulating their directives the Council proceeded on the basis thatthe combined resources of the members of the North Atlantic Treaty are sufficient, if properly co-ordinated and applied, to ensure the progressive andspeedy development of adequate military defence without impairing the social and economic progress of these countries.&quot;The Council had passed no resolution to that effect and, although I liked the passageitself, I was not certain that it was right to put it into the communique.Mr. Acheson said that all the statement meant was that the Treaty Powers thoughtthat they had between them sufficient resources to look after both defence and social and economic progress, and he thought that it would be a bad look out forus all if we could not say this. On reflection, I feel that this passage is necessary.Conclusions13. I think the following are the main conclusions to be drawn from theMeeting:  (i) Unlike the other sessions of the Council, which were mainly concernedwith the formalities of setting up the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa-tion, this meeting was able to get down to serious discussion of the real, problems of common defence on the basis of the reports from theDefence Committee. If the results were not more spectacular, thatwas due less to the unwillingness of Ministers to tackle the problems,than to the fact that the problems themselves are not yet ripe forsolution. There was, however, a very proper sense of urgency and arealisation of the fact that unless a serious and determined start is madewith rearmament now the situation will get quite out of hand in a fewyears&apos; time.(ii) We have laid down certain general principles which mark a very con-siderable step forward in the direction of a truly integrated defence programme. In particular, we have established the principle that narrownational interests must give way to the broader requirements of the collective defence of the whole North Atlantic area. It is now for themilitary experts to give practical effect to this principle.(iii) We have also formally recognised that however much military targetsmay be reviewed and production rationalised, there will still be a heavybill to foot if available resources are to be brought up to the minimumlevel required for an effective defence policy. It is now for defence ministers to say how much that bill will be and for Finance ministers to say how far it can be met.(iv) On the organisational side, we have taken a necessary practical step... forward in establishing a body of Deputies and thus have given to thewhole North Atlantic Treaty Organisation that cohesion and directionwhich were hitherto lacking. The effectiveness of this new organisation will largely depend on the personal attributes of the Deputies andparticularly of their Chairman. It is essential that they should be ofthe highest calibre.
(v) The general attitude of the Americans throughout the Conference showed that they are determined to make a reality of the North Atlantic1 treaty and that increasingly they regard it as the focus for the further develop-ment of the Western world. For us this means that our future relationswith the United States will largely be determined by the success ofour collaboration in the Atlantic Treaty. Since it is the kernel of theirpolicy, it must also be the kernel of ours.      s iE. B. .Foreign Office, S.W. 1,26th May, .1950.ANNEX council Resolution on Deputies    :^ The North Atlantic Council established in accordance with Article 9 of theTreaty has so far only met twice at the Ministerial level and on two other occasions when Members of the Council have been represented by their Governments&apos;diplomatic representatives in Washington.But under Article 9 the Council is the principal body of the North atlantic treaty. It is therefore the paramount duty of the Council to put itself in a positionto exercise its full role as the central and most important of the various organsof the Treaty by taking the most effective steps to keep itself informed of all matters which fall within its competence, by taking the necessary decisions and by ensuring the execution of such decisions.A year&apos;s experience has shown that on the political side the meetings of theCouncil have been too infrequent to permit a sufficient exchange of views on mattersof common interest within the scope of the Treaty. On the military side the strategic concept of the Treaty has been adopted and a defence plan drawn up,and the corresponding estimate of the necessary forces is being established. Thenext step is to put these plans into effect by taking further measures in the directionof common defence, the division of financial responsibilities and the adaptation anddevelopment of the necessary forces.In view of this situation, the Council will in particular undertake the followingtasks: (a) Study the inter-relationship of the various programmes to support the plans for the defence of the North Atlantic area and ensure co-ordina-tion of the work of the Defence Committee, the Defence Financialand Economic Committee, and all other bodies established under theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation;(b) recommend to Governments the steps necessary to ensure that effect isgiven to the co-ordinated plans prepared for the defence of the north atlantic area;(c) exchange views on political matters of common interest within the scopeof the Treaty;(d) promote and co-ordinate public information in furtherance of the objectives of the Treaty while leaving responsibility for national programmes to each country;(e) consider what further action should be taken under Article 2 of the Treaty,taking into account the work of existing agencies in this field.To enable the Council effectively to carry out its responsibilities and to exercisethem continuously, each Government will appoint a Deputy! to its Council repre-sentative. Each Deputy will be in a position to give whatever time may be necessaryto ensure that the responsibilities of the Council are Carried out effectively.In the intervals between meetings of Ministers,.the Deputies, duly authorised by their respective Governments, will be responsible, on behalf of and in the nameof the Council; for carrying out its policies and for formulating issues requiringdecisions by the Member Governments.To assist the Council in fulfilling its responsibilities the Deputies, on behalfof their Governments, shall select a Permanent Chairman from among their membership.   With the advice of the Chairman, the,&apos; Deputies shall establish a
suitable full-time organisation composed of highly-qualified persons contributed byMember Governments. The Chairman, in addition to presiding at meetings of the deputies, shall be responsible for directing the organisation and its work.: Member Governments will appoint their Deputies with the least possible delay in order that a Chairman may be selected, the organisation established, and progressbe made on the urgent problems before the Council. The Deputies, assisted by theChairman and the organisation to be created, should begin functioning in the very near future in order that tangible results may be achieved before the next meetingof the Ministers when the progress made will be reviewed. Without minimisingthe importance of any of the points listed above, first priority in the work of theorganisation should be given to points (a) and (b).The Deputies will have their headquarters in London.ANNEX IICouncil Resolution on Defence principles the North Atlantic Council considers that the essential objectives of the signatory powers of the North Atlantic Treaty are to ensure that they shall becollectively in a position to deter aggression and, if aggression should take place,successfully to resist it.The Council, having reviewed the progress during the first year under theTreaty and the reports received from the Defence Committee and the DefenceFinancial and Economic Committee, has passed certain resolutions on problems raised by them.The Councils also considers the principles and resolution of the issues setforth below to be important in attaining these objectives, and urgently needs anddesires the advice and recommendations of the responsible North Atlantic Treatyagencies to resolve problems connected therewith:  1. The maintenance by the parties to the Treaty, in accordance with agreedNorth Atlantic Treaty Oganisation plans, of forces, available for combat opera-tions, adequate to resist initial attack ;2. the type and composition of the forces to resist an initial attack, to be adapted to agreed North Atlantic Treaty Organisation military plans based onthe exploitation of the latest developments in military technology in order to obtainmaximum efficiency in the collective defence of the North Atlantic area ;3. the standardisation to the maximum extent practicable and the use of themost up-to-date material and equipment capable of being produced in volume ;4. the mutual provision within the framework of collective defence of thenecessary services and material facilities for the logistic support of the collectivemilitary forces ;5.   the early determination (a) Of how balanced collective forces for the defence of the North atlantic area can hest be established ;(b) of the nature and quantity of the material and equipment necessary to attainthese objectives ;(c) of how production of this material and equipment should be distributed, asfar as military, strategic, economic, and financial considerations permit,among the industries of the participating nations so that the best resultsmay be obtained in the shortest possible time and at the lowest cost,and how these production programmes can be continuously reviewedso as to keep them up-to-date ;(d) of how the necessary facilities and services can best be provided for thelogistic support of these forces ;(e) of how the financial costs arisir sg from the carrying out of these tasks canbe most equitably distributed between the various participating nations,taking account of their economic and financial conditions.Early response is urgently needed in order that the important matters raisedby this resolution be resolved.
ANNEX IIICouncil Resolutions on Certain Reports of the Defence Committee and theDefence Financial and Economic Committee1. (Council D-4/2). Request from the Defence Financial and EconomicCommittee to the Defence Committee for a Detailed Estimate of theDefence CostsResolution&quot;The Council notes with approval the request from the Defence Financialand Economic Committee to the Defence Committee to send forward as soon aspossible the detailed estimate of the finances entailed in preparing the defenceof the North Atlantic countries setting forth the priorities therein, and wishes to record the importance it attaches to the early completion of this project.&quot;&quot; While the Council requests that this work be initiated forthwith, it recognizesthat the estimate should take into account the realistic revision of force require-ments which is expected from the current review of defence plans.&quot;2.   (Council D-4/3). Report from the Defence Committee on the status of Defence PlanningResolution&quot; The Council&quot; Fully cognizant of the need for further revision and refinement of the medium-term plan, but convinced that it provides an indication of the nature and extent ofthe effort required to achieve the necessary defensive strength.&quot; Aware that there exists a great gap between present defensive strength andthe military forces which will be required after review and refinement of the plan,and convinced that additional balanced collective defensive strength must beachieved in accordance with the agreed principles of the &apos; strategic concept.&apos;&quot; Realizing that the composition of national forces will have to take into con-sideration national commitments external to NAT, internal security, and ability to carry out effectively missions assigned in the overall NATO plan which supportsthe agreed strategic concept including the immediate urgent requirements of nationaldefence in the event of the outbreak of hostilities.&quot; Urges the governments of the North Atlantic nations to ensure the progres-sive build-up of defence forces and, in the development of these forces for thedefence of the North Atlantic area, to concentrate on the creation of balancedcollective forces rather than balanced national forces taking into account the con-siderations laid down in the preceding paragraph.&quot; In noting this report the Council wishes to emphasize the importance whichit attaches to the constant review of military plans and of the force and equipmentrequirements therefor in the light of the most modern weapons and equipment which are agreed upon as standard and capable of being produced in volume.&quot;3. (Council D-4/4). Defence Committee Memorandum to the Defence Financialand Economic Committee requesting an Examination of the Financialand Economic Potentialities of the Treaty Nations to support the Defenceof the North Atlantic AreaResolution&quot; The Council notes with approval the Defence Committee&apos;s request to theDefence Financial and Economic Committee to undertake immediately, con-currently with planning by military and production planning agencies, an examina-tion of the financial and economic potentialities of the Treaty nations to supportadditional military expenditures for the defence of the North Atlantic area and toconsider new and more adequate economic and financial dispositions, in particular for the implementation of an integrated defence programme, and wishes to record the importance it attaches to early progress on this project.&quot;&quot; In making this examination the Committee should recognize the need toincrease, as a matter of urgency, collective military security against the threat of soviet military aggression. The Council also recognizes that a sound economy isthe necessary basis of the required defence effort, but points out that, while the
making of additional military expenditures must be judged in the light of economicand financial conditions; adequate consideration must be given to the needs for defence.&quot;4.   (Council D-4/5).  Co-ordination between Agencies of the North Atlanticy Treaty OrganisationResolution&quot;The Council directs all NAT bodies to take steps which will insure imoreeffective concurrent planning and closer co-ordination, and directs that there&apos; shallbe continuous interchange of necessary information between the various principalcommittees of the N.A.T. Organisation, including their Permanent Working Staffs.(Council Directive D-l /1, 17th September, 1949, should be amended accord-ingly.)&quot;5.   (Council D-4/9).  The Report from the Defence Financial and EconomicCommitteeResolution&quot; The Council has noted with approval the report from the D.F.E.C. and wishes to record the importance it attaches to further progress on its work projects.&quot;6.   Further Steps not called for by the Reports from the Defence Committeeand from the D.F.E.C.Resolution(a) &quot; The Council, recognising the indispensability of self-help and mutual aidamong the Treaty Powers in making progress toward the achievement of an integrated defence, and, in particular, the contribution of such assistance heretoforemade.&quot; Convinced that further mutual assistance is essential to rapid progress towardthe strength required for the common security of the North Atlantic area.&quot; Recommends that each party make its full contribution through mutual assistance in all practicable forms to achieve that integrated strength necessary forthe defence of the North Atlantic area.&quot;(b) &quot; The Council urges the governments to use their best efforts and supply the necessary instructions to facilitate and hasten the implementation of thepreceding resolutions.&quot;
