&apos;  115HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVER.Jiv.ENT)confidential cp.(50) 127 COPY NO.3^-19TH JUNE, 1950CABINETECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH AND SOUTH-EAST ASIAMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations andthe Minister of State.1. A report by the Paymaster-General on the meeting at Sydneyof the British Commonwealth Consultative Committee, together with thereport and recommendations of the Consultative Committee itself, hasbeen circulated as CP. (50) 123,2. We recommend that our colleagues approve the Paymaster-GeneraUs report and endorse the recommendations of the consultative committee.    The United Kingdom will then formally notify acceptance of therecommendations to the Australian Government, at the same time informing the other Commonwealth Governments concerned.    It seems to us that the paymaster-General and his team were remarkably successful in gettingour point of view accepted by the Consultative Committee.   The only point at which the recommendations of the Consultative Committee coverground which had not been agreed here before the meeting is in theimmediate creation of a. Commonwealth Technical Assistance Scheme towhich the United Kingdom contribution is to be a maximum of  2,600,000over a three-year period.    We consider that this scheme will serve a useful and constructive purpose and during the meeting we gave the paymaster-General authority to agree to it and to the financial commitment which is part of it.3. The Consultative Committee agreed (Part VI of the report)that individual Commonwealth Governments should maintain informalcontact with the United States and other interested Governments as they thought appropriate, and that the United Kingdom should advise other commonwealth Governments of the best timing for a joint formal approach to the United States Government.    We do not think the time is yet ripe forthis formal joint approach, but we recommend that H. M.  Ambassador in washington should be instructed to inform the United States Governmentinformally of the results of the meeting.    The French and NetherlandsGovernments have shown themselves very interested in the meeting andwe recommend that H. M. Ambassadors in Paris and The Hague should be instructed to tell them also informally of its results.4. There are four major matters arising out of the meeting uponwhich energetic follow-up action will be necessary;-(i)   The Commonwealth Technical Assistance Scheme.    A meeting is to beheld in Colombo at the middle of July to work out a detailed scheme on thebasis of the principles agreed by the Consultative Committee (Part II of thereport).    It is most important that we, as the major country in the-1-

(1)   That the Paymaster-General&apos;s report should be approved andthat a communication should be sent to other commonwealth governments indicating that His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom have approved the report and recom-mendations of the Consultative Committee.(2)   That instructions should be sent to H. M. Ambassador in washington to tell, the United States Government informally of the resultsof the meeting.(3)   That instructions should be sent to H. M. Ambassadors in Paris andThe Hague to inform the French and Netherlands Governmentsinformally of the results of the. meeting.(4)   That preparations should be made as recommended in paragraph above for dealing with the work arising out of the meeting.R. S.C.P. C. G. -W.19TH JUNE, 1950.. K&apos; G* Y&quot;Commonwealth which can provide technical assistance to countries in Southand South-East Asia, should get this scheme floated in an official and business-like manner, and we have given instructions for a detailed schemeto be prepared and for the appropriate organisation to be set up in whitehall, in order that we may be able to play our full part in initiatingthe scheme effectively and then -making it run smoothly.(ii)   Preparation of programmes by Commonwealth Countries.    India,Pakistan and Ceylon are to prepare development programmes for a six-year period, and these are to be presented to the Consultative Committeethrough the Australian Government before 1st September, 1950.    TheSecretary of State for the Colonies has given instructions that a programme should similarly be prepared by the Malayan and Borneo territories.   the programmes will, at the next meeting of the Consultative Committee, be examined and assembled into a single report on the needs and resources ofthe area, on which a realistic and unified development programme can bebased.    We shall have to decide at a later stage whether an application is tobe made for United States assistance for carrying out the development programmes of the Malayan and Borneo territories.(iii)   Preparation of Programmes by non-Commonwealth Countries.Burma, Siam, Indonesia and the three Associate States of Indo-China areto be invited to participate in the preparation of development plans in orderthat the development programme shall cover as far as possible the whole area of South and South-East Asia (Part V of the report).   Thesecountries may find some difficulty in formulating their plans and we have,therefore, offered the assistance of two officials from the United Kingdom, if required.(iv)   The next meeting of the Consultative Committee is due to be heldin London, probably in September or early October.    Intensive preparationwill be required for meetings of officials and Ministers, both of Common-wealth and of non-Commonwealth countries, to draw up a comprehensivereport of the needs and resources of the area and to establish long-termmachinery, comprising both Commonwealth and non-commonwealth countries, for the carrying out of the programme, ultimately with UnitedStates assistance, if this can be obtained.    We recommend that officials should be charged with the task of submitting proposals for our consideration in time to permit us full consideration of the problems involved.5. We therefore recommend:-
