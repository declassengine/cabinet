THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May&apos; 1950SECRETCP. (50) 10111th May, 1950CABINETSCOTTISH affairs memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. At their meeting on 9th March (CM. (50) 9th Conclusions, Minute 1)the Cabinet invited me to submit, after consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, a memorandum on Scotland&apos;s contribution to, and claims upon, theUnited Kingdom Exchequer. I now ask for authority to announce the settingup of a Committee with the terms of reference set out in Appendix I to thismemorandum to consider the practicability of producing a return of Scottishrevenue and expenditure and an economic balance-sheet for Scotland.2. In CP. (49) 251 of 12th December, 1949, my predecessor referred to the&quot;Covenant&quot; which was adopted at a &quot;Scottish National Assembly&quot; held in edinburgh towards the end of last year and has since been widely circulated for signature by persons of 18 years of age or over. The number of signatures isnow understood to be about 1,250,000. The total estimated population of scotland is 5,175,000 and the total estimated population aged 18 and over is 3,660,000.These facts were reported to a further &apos;&apos; Assembly &apos;&apos; held in Edinburgh on22nd April and it was then decided that &quot; Commissioners &quot; should be appointedby the Executive of the National Covenant Committee to make a formal approach to the Government and the leaders of the Opposition with a view to placing the proposals of the &quot;Assembly&quot; before them. The names of the15 &quot;Commissioners&quot; are shown in Appendix II. A request has now beenmade to the Prime Minister to receive them.3. The &quot; Covenant &quot; is in very general terms but signatories to it bindthemselves to work for a Scottish Parliament for domestic affairs. The proposalsfor this purpose previously endorsed by the &quot;Assembly&quot; and now submittedby the &quot; Commissioners &quot; amount to the setting up in Scotland of a domesticParliament on the Northern Ireland model but with power to levy taxation otherthan customs and excise. There would be a joint Exchequer Board to apportionrevenue whether levied by the Great Britain or Scottish Parliament betweenScotland and the rest of the country. I annex as Appendix III a memorandumoutlining in more detail the terms and implications of the &quot; Covenant,&quot; thescheme of Parliamentary self-government proposed and (in paragraphs 11-23)some of the difficulties which seem to me to be inherent in it.4. I think it would be wrong to assume from the relative absence of interestshown in the matter during the Election or from the fate of the Liberal and home Rule candidates, in whose platforms the establishment of a ScottishParliament was one of the principal planks, that interest in the matter is lesswidespread than the number of signatures of the &quot;Covenant&quot; suggests. Itspromoters deliberately decided that they would not make it an issue at the recentElection. The &quot; Assembly &quot; of 22nd April and the subsequent appointment of&quot;Commissioners&quot; has given the whole issue great prominence. The&quot; Commissioners&quot; will, I feel, have to be met on behalf of the Government;and the reply made to them will be keenly examined in all parts of Scotland.38710 copy No.32
5. Apart from the &quot; Covenant&quot; the Opposition are likely to press theirown proposals in regard to Scottish administration. Very briefly they want(a) to increase by two the number of Scottish Ministers, (b) to reorganise the nationalised industries and establish wherever possible separate and autonomousboards for Scotland, and (c) to set up a Royal Commission &apos;&apos; to review the whole situation as between Scotland and England in the light of modern developments,especially as regards financial relationships, and make recommendations.&quot;6. So far as concerns the number of Ministers, I think that we can take theline that the Government are keeping the position under review but that we arenot convinced that there is any immediate necessity for an increase. As regardsthe nationalised industries, experience of the arrangements now in operation isstill limited. In reply to criticisms we have hitherto stressed the extent to whichScotland already has autonomous boards and the arrangements made in other cases to devolve responsibility to Scotland; and we have undertaken to keep a careful watch on the way in which the arrangements so recently made are working-out in practice. But I have no doubt that feeling on this subject in Scotland is strong. I have been giving the whole position close consideration and I think weare particularly vulnerable in the case of electricity where responsibility is partly in the hands of an autonomous Scottish Board answerable to the Secretary ofState and partly in the hands of the British Electricity Authority and two area boards responsible to the Minister of Fuel and Power. I propose to discuss thismatter further with the Minister and if necessary to bring proposals before mycolleagues for consideration.7. It is when we come to the question of the financial and economic relations of Scotland to the rest of Great Britain, however, that I feel some immediate action is necessary. In face of the &apos;&apos; Covenant&apos;&apos; and in the circumstances of thenew House of Commons I do not think we can continue to take a completelynegative attitude to the Conservative proposal for a Royal Commission of Enquiry,which is strongly supported in Scotland by the Press and by moderate people whohave not committed themselves to the Home Rule movement. However since werejected this proposal before the Election I do not suggest that we should nowaccept it. But I think we must deal with the demand for up-to-date informationshowing how far in the matter of Government expenditure Scotland is standingon her own feet. Information about this is clearly relevant to any examinationof Home Rule proposals. And we must be able to show that we are publishingall the economic information about Scotland that we can reasonably be expectedto do.8. Up to now we have refused to produce a financial return partly because it would involve the diversion of effort from essential work and partly because anyreturn is bound to be based to a considerable extent on arbitrary assumptions.The pre-war returns were admittedly unsatisfactory; but I am afraid we are regarded as unreasonable, not only by the people who have signed the &apos;&apos; Covenant &apos;&apos;but by many others who are genuinely interested in the subject, because we aremaking no effort to produce, as we did before the War, the best information thatwe can.9. It seems to me, therefore and I am indebted to the Chancellor of theExchequer for his patience, help and agreement on this subject that the leastwe can do is to examine impartially the practicability of a financial return ofthe kind that is being asked for, keeping in view the availability of information,the amount of work involved, and the value and reliability of any statisticsobtained.10. As regards economic information, we can claim, as we have done before,that a great deal is already published in the annual White Paper on Industryand Employment and elsewhere; and more will be available when the results ofthe Census of Production and the Census of Distribution are known. At thesame time I think we should examine the practicability of a return showing thebalance of Scottish imports and exports. While this is not strictly relevant tothe claim for a Parliament for domestic affairs, there is a widespread belief(which T do not share) that in present; circumstances Scotland&apos;s export positionis better than Englands&apos;; and I think there would be the greatest advantage
in demonstrating by impartial enquiry that the economy of the two countries-is so inextricably interlocked that an exact assessment of their relative contri-butions to exports and imports is quite impracticable,11. If my recommendation that a Committee should be appointed is approved, I should propose to make an announcement in the House of commons before the &quot;Commissioners&quot; are seen. At any meeting with the &quot; Commis-sioners,&quot; my colleagues will agree that we must refute the implication in theterms of the &apos;&apos; Covenant&apos;&apos; that Scottish interests have been neglected, and muststress the extent to which special legislative and administrative machinery hasbeen created to deal with Scottish business. For the rest I propose that we should refer to the Committee and address to the &quot;Commissioners&quot; some questions,designed to bring out the vulnerability of their scheme of legislative devolution ..H.

APPENDIX IIITerms and Implications of the &quot; Covenant &quot;introduction. The following memorandum deals with the terms and implications of the&quot; Covenant,&quot; the scheme of Parliamentary self-government which its promotershave in mind and some of the difficulties which seem to be inherent in it. these difficulties are summarised in paragraphs 11 to 23 of the memorandum. At any meeting with the Commissioners,&quot; an attempt might be made to bring them outin the course of discussion. The terms of any public statement would, of course,depend to some extent on the outcome of the discussion; but the memorandum should serve both as an aide-memoir for that discussion and as a basis for a subsequent statement.Part I(a) The Terms of the &apos;&apos; Covenant&apos;&apos;2. The terms of the &apos;&apos; Covenant&apos;&apos; which, it is claimed, about one and a quarter million people have signed, are as follows : &apos;&apos; We, the people of Scotland, who subscribe this engagement declare ourbelief that reform in the Constitution of our country is necessary to securegood government in accordance with our Scottish traditions and to promote the spiritual and economic welfare of our nation.&quot; We affirm that the desire for such reform is both deep and widespreadthroughout the whole community transcending all political differences andsectional interests, and we undertake to continue united in purpose for itsachievement.&apos;&apos; With that end in view we solemnly enter into this Covenant whereby wepledge ourselves, in all loyalty to the Crown and within the framework ofthe United Kingdom, to do everything in our power to secure for Scotland a parliament with adequate legislative authority in Scottish affairs.&quot;(b) The Scheme of Parliamentary Self-Government Proposed3. The Scheme proposes a single-chamber Scottish Parliament, consistingof two members elected by each of the existing constituencies, with authority overall matters except the following which would be reserved for the United kingdom parliament or dealt with jointly by the two Parliaments : Reserved for the United Kingdom Parliament(1) Crown and Succession.(2) Peace and War.(3) Defence.(4) Foreign Affairs.(5) Dominions, Colonies, &amp;c.(6) Treason and Alienage.(7) Currency, Coinage, &amp;c.(8) Electoral Law affecting United Kingdom Parliament.To be dealt with by both Parliaments jointly(1) Postal Services.(2) Lighthouses, &amp;c.(3) Docks and Harbours.(4) Land acquisition for public purposes.(5) Corrupt practices.This scheme is very much the same as proposed in the various early scottish home Rule Bills, except that there is no specific reservation to the United King-dom Parliament of overseas trade. Since, however, the United Kingdom Parlia-ment is to control currency and customs duties it is difficult to see how it could38710 b 3
do other than control overseas trade. It differs from the scheme in operation inNorthern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Parliament has no legislative authority in the following : (i) postal service,(ii) lighthouses,   . , -./   \-(iii) overseas trade,(iv) merchant shipping,(v) aviation,      .. , lt    -(vi) wireless and submarine cables,(vii) trade marks. &apos;The financial system proposed is also different from the Northern Ireland,system. Northern Ireland is within the fiscal system of the United Kingdom.The &quot; Covenant &quot; proposal is that the only taxes reserved to the United kingdom parliament would be customs duties and excise duties on manufactured articles,All other taxation powers would rest with the Scottish Parliament. There wouldbe a Joint Exchequer Board to determine financial relationships.6. The system of allocating revenue and expenditure between Scotland andthe United Kingdom would be somewhat complicated, as follows : (i) The allocation of revenue from the reserved taxes would be determinedby the Scottish percentage of estate duty payments during the lastseven years, plus 2-g per cent, of all reserved tax revenue in the current year, plus 15 per cent, of the receipts from whisky duty. These addi-tions are apparently intended to cover the fact that some persons orfirms who live in England pay tax in respect of goods purchased inScotland and that nearly all the whisky consumed in the United King-dom is produced in Scotland.(ii) The allocation of revenue from income tax, surtax and taxes on profitswould also be determined by reference to estate duty with the additionof 2-1 per cent, of total current British receipts while levels of taxa-tion in England and Scotland were the same. If they were higher orlower in Scotland, adjustments would be made.(iii) On the argument that, by virtue of its control over excise duties, customs,defence and foreign policy, the United Kingdom Government is responsible for full employment, expenditure in connection with unem-ployment would be borne by each country in proportion to insured population. The object of this clearly is to make England share someof the burden of expenditure on Scotland&apos;s relatively higher total ofunemployment.(iv) An Imperial contribution from the Scottish Exchequer to the UnitedKingdom Exchequer would be assessed by the Joint Exchequer board as follows : Enough net revenue would be given to Scotland to cover the costof adminstration and services on standards corresponding to thoseprevailing in England, the surplus being handed over to the UnitedKingdom Exchequer.   This is subject to the provisos that: (1) In assessing the total of necessary Scottish expenditure the JointExchequer Board must make due allowance for the necessarypriority of local needs.(2) Where rates of taxation were different in the two countries, theImperial contributon would be calculated as if they were thesame.(3) The amount of the Imperial contribution must not be in greater pro-portion to the contribution of England than the ratio of taxableincome in Scotland to that of England.Part IIThe Implications of the &quot; Covenant &quot;&apos;&apos; 7. Those who have signed the &quot; Covenant&quot; have committed themselves tothe view that Scotland is not at present being well governed in accordance withScottish traditions and that constitutional reform is necessary to promote Scot-land^ spiritual and economic welfare.   The onus of proving these statements is,
of course, on those who have subscribed them; but the Government could not possibly accept them. On the contrary, the Government must claim to have made and to be making every effort to ensure that the functions of government in Scot-land are carried out both efficiently and with the fullest regard to Scotland&apos;s sense of nationhood and to the special Scottish traditions which it is naturally the desire of all Scots to foster and strengthen.8. I doubt if there is a full understanding in Scotland of the parliamentary and administrative machinery which has been created to ensure that Scotland&apos;sneeds are adequately looked after. In the hope that it may help to remove thismisunderstanding, a comprehensive account of the existing legislative andadministrative system has been prepared and will shortly be published.9. As regards the belief that constitutional reform is necessary to promote the spiritual and economic welfare of Scotland, the facts do not bear out the impli-cation that Scotland is at present spiritually and economically unsound. Scot-land^ spiritual vigour is indeed everywhere manifest and the economic prosperity of the country is in striking contrast to the conditions of the years between thewars. Spiritual vitality anywhere does not lend itself to statistical demonstration;but no-one who is acquainted with the country as it is to-day will be likely to question it. The widespread interest in music, drama and the arts, the scale and quality of the Edinburgh festival, the demand for adult education, thegrowth of community centres, the vigour of the church these and other features of modern Scotland show how she is achieving a fuller way of life, spiritually,culturally and socially. In the economic sphere, the Government are taking every possible step to secure the fullest development of the country&apos;s resources and the series of White Papers on Industry and Employment in Scotland contain ampleevidence of their success. The economic strength of Scotland can be gauged fromthese facts and figures and from the evidence continually provided by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) both in its day-to-day work and in the courseof special efforts such as the exhibition held in Glasgow in 1949. The natural resources of the country have been, and are being, more fully exploited than at anytime in Scotland&apos;s history.10. Demands are, of course, constantly being made for more facts aboutScotland&apos;s economic position. Additional information will become available whenthe results of the Census of Production have been analysed and published andwill be further supplemented by the results of the Census of Distribution. Inthe meantime, such relevant facts as are available are published in the annualWhite Papers or in other official publications. Their volume is considerable. the statistical arrangements of the Scottish Office are kept under continuous review and a trained statistician will shortly be appointed to take fresh stock of thematerial which is available and of the way in which it is presented. Whether itis practicable to supplement these measures by producing a return giving a.complete picture of Scotland&apos;s exports and imports is a question which it isnow suggested that an impartial committee should consider.Part IIIComments on the Scheme of Parliamentary Self-Goiiernment Proposed11. The proposals for a Scottish Parliament bear certain superficialresemblances to the scheme of Parliamentary devolution in operation in NorthernIreland, but the Scottish demand for financial autonomy, outside the field of customs and Excise, differentiates their position completely from NorthernIreland. Northern Ireland has never in her history asked to be separated from great Britain either politically or financially : the contrary is the case. Thescheme of devolution in the Government of Northern Ireland Act was an attempt,which failed, to bridge the gap between the North and South. It is no precedent for Scotland, because under it Northern Ireland remains completely within the fiscal system of the United Kingdom. Economically it would not suit NorthernIreland to be outside the framework because of her naturally high rate ofunemployment, which even to-day is between 6 and 7 per cent., and she wouldnot accept a position outside that system. In both social and economic fieldsNorthern Ireland has tended to follow very closely the patterns devised at
Westminster, but this has only been possible because she has shared our fiscalsystem.12. If a separate Parliament were set up for Scottish domestic affairs, there-appears to be some danger that the influence of Scottish Members in the UnitedKingdom Parliament at Westminster would diminish. If the Northern Irelandprecedent were followed, the number of Scottish Members would be reduced to&apos;take account of the limited purposes for which the United Kingdom parliament would exercise jurisdiction in Scotland. This fact, combined with the probablereluctance of distinguished Scotsmen to serve in a Parliament in London of limited interest to Scotland, might well reduce both the quality of the Scottishcontribution to the discussion of imperial and international affairs and the^Scottish voting strength. Alternatively, if Westminster continued to attractScotsmen with the greatest aptitude for public life, the Edinburgh parliament might be in danger of becoming a second-rate affair. It is doubtful whetherScotland could find the political talent or could afford to spare it from business and the professions-necessary to maintain two groups of Parliamentaryrepresentatives of high calibre.13. A Scots Parliament no doubt implies though its protagonists have notbeen clear on the point-a Scots Cabinet and a Scots Prime Minister. the relationship between Scottish Ministers and the Cabinet in London would requiremost careful thought. No doubt the post of Secretary of State for Scotland would disappear from the British Cabinet, in which Scottish influence might be expectedto diminish. In the realms of imperial and international affairs, foreign tradeand the like, the United Kingdom Departments concerned would be less likelythan they are now to consult with the Scottish Departments in the considerationof policy. A corollary of Home Rule for Scotland is Home Rule for England;and, in domestic matters, a Government whose responsibilities in that field wouldbe limited to England and Wales, would frame its policy in the light of Englishconditions. Scotland would then be pressed to introduce North of the Border a comparable policy in the shaping of the substance of which it had taken no effec-tive part. The co-operation which has been built up over a period of years inall domestic affairs between English and Scottish Departments with parallelinterests and which has been to the advantage of both countries would be greatlyweakened to the probable detriment of each.14. There is at present much criticism of the number of civil servants andthe high cost of public administration. The setting up of a Scottish Parliamentseems likely to increase the number of civil servants and the cost of administrationconsiderably.15. The proposals submitted by the &quot;Commissioners&quot; are in certain important respects obscure. They do not, for example, say specifically who is tobe responsible for overseas trade. It might be supposed from the confidence oftenexpressed by nationalist speakers in Scotland&apos;s ability to achieve a balance of tradeif left to herself that the supporters of the scheme assume that this subject wouldbe one of the most important to be dealt with by the Scottish Parliament. On theother hand, it seems impossible for a Scottish Parliament, with no control of currency or customs duties, to deal effectively with overseas trade; and any attemptto do so would also encounter severe practical difficulties from the integration of export industries North and South of the Border. A painful conflict might therefore develop between the aspirations of the Scottish Parliament in regard to overseas trade and the practical possibilities. The Northern Ireland parliament has no power in regard to overseas trade.16. The sharing of certain functions between the two Parliaments (in whichthe proposed scheme follows the Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference of 1920,rather than the Government of Northern Ireland Act), does not seem likely towork satisfactorily. It is not clear whether legislation by the Scottish parliament in these fields is to be subject to the approval of the Parliament at Westminsteror whether the two Parliaments are to have parallel jurisdiction. &apos; In either event,conflicts would easily arise.17. The financial arrangements proposed seem to be a rather complicated and cumbersome attempt to have the best of both worlds.   Broadly, their object
appears to be to ensure an allocation of revenue on the most favourable terms to scotland that can be devised; to pay for Scottish services on an English standardor better out of this allocation; and to contribute to imperial services whateverhappens to be left. Even this is to be subject to the &quot; necessary priority for localneeds,&quot; by which is presumably meant that if a case is made out for exceptionalexpenditure, for example, in the Highlands, Scotland shall, if necessary, also be relieved to that extent of what would otherwise be her appropriate contributionto imperial services. If Scotland has financial autonomy, England could claim the same, and it would be argued that England should not contribute to Scotland&apos;supkeep or the maintenance of her unemployed in times of depression. NorthernIreland could also object if any demand were made for money from, the UnitedKingdom pool, to which she contributes, to be made available for financing develop-ment schemes in Scotland when similar schemes are eminently desirable for northern Ireland.18. As regards Scotland&apos;s contribution to imperial services, it would follow,if only the balance of revenue left after meeting her full domestic requirementswere to be available for this purpose, that she would have to accept a; considerable measure of interest from the British Treasury. That Treasury would, forexample, be able to claim a vital say in what constituted a reasonable level ofexpenditure in Scotland on domestic affairs, because upon this level would dependthe contribution made by Scotland to imperial services. The only way in which such a continuing interest by the British Treasury could be avoided would seemto be by having a financial system of a completely different kind from that proposed by the Convention. It might, for example, be argued with some cogencythat the Scottish Parliament should accept an absolute obligation to provide&amp; proportion of the cost of imperial services equal to the Scottish share of thetotal population or of the total taxable income of the United Kingdom. Whatwas left after this contribution had been made would then be at the disposal ofthe Scottish Parliament to spend on Scottish services. If this system had been applied to Northern Ireland before the war she would have had to bear eithercrushingly heavy taxation or a much inferior standard of administration and services to Great Britain or both. Whether Scotland would fare better or worseunder such an arrangement could not be ascertained without full information asto the tax revenue now derived from Scotland and the expenditure in respectof Scotland. It is now proposed that the possibility of eliciting this information should be examined by an impartial committee. Attempts to obtain it weremade before the war. The results were necessarily based in certain respects onhypotheses which could not be proved. They suggested, however, that Scotlandafter meeting the cost of purely Scottish services, was contributing less to services common to the United Kingdom as a whole than the ratio of her population tothe population of the United Kingdom would appear to justify.19. One of the greatest difficulties in reaching a conclusion about the pro-posed scheme is to see how it would work in the economic sphere. It is presumablyintended to leave to United Kingdom administration and to the United kingdom parliament the Governments share in the conduct of international trade. Theindustry and commerce of England and Scotland are, of course, very closely inte-grated and there are many firms who carry on their activities in both countries.If industrial and commercial firms are to be subject to United Kingdom adminis-tration in relation to their foreign trade and to separate Scottish administration in relation to their domestic trade, the danger of their being subject to conflictingpolicies arid possibly to conflicting directions is apparent, particularly if thepolitical balance in the Great Britain and Scottish Parliaments were different.There may also be some danger that English firms, working under the auspices of one major department concerned with overseas as well as domestic trade,would be more favourably placed than Scottish firms dealing with a United King-dom Department in matters of overseas trade and a Scottish Department in con-nection with domestic trade.20. Much of the criticism in recent years of the present Parliamentary andadministrative arrangements in the conduct of Scottish affairs has been directed to the organisation of the nationalised industries; and no doubt the scheme isintended to leave full responsibility for these industries to the new ScottishParliament. It is, however, difficult to see how the organisation of the railway-system in Great Britain under public ownership or of international air services
could be left to completely separate administration and Parliamentary control in Scotland and in England; or how, for example, a nationalised steel industry could profitably be run independently in Scotland and England, since the existingunits in the two countries are interlocked. There is an even greater danger if thepolitical balance of the parties in England and Scotland were to be different. The-situation might well arise in which the Government in one country or anotherwanted to nationalise or denationalise the part of an industry situated in thatcountry, leaving the part of it situated in the other country subject to a differentform of control. It is hardly conceivable that such a situation or even such a risk, could be to the advantage of either Great Britain as a whole, or Scotland,particularly in relation to overseas trade.21. There are many other illustrations which could be given of the difficultyof organising under separate Scottish Parliamentary control the arrangementsfor the administration or supervision of particular industries. In the case ofthe herring industry, for example, the habits of the fish are such that the UnitedKingdom catching power has to be concentrated at one part of the year in Scotlandand at another in England. If the industry as a whole must be regulated, as it now is, by a specially appointed Board, that Board would have to become the instrument not only, as at present, of separate Ministers in both countries but of separate Parliaments and, therefore, conceivably, of separate policies. Even moreformidable difficulties would be encountered in connection with food supply solong at least as current conditions of scarcity continue. It is not apparentlyproposed that the services for which the Minister of Food is now responsibleshould be reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is, however,difficult to see how, in the present state of international affairs, England and scotland could be allowed to bargain separately for overseas purchases involving,as they do, the expenditure of foreign currencies which must presumably remain the concern of the United Kingdom Treasury.22. In the industrial field great difficulties would also be experienced inconnection with such matters as factory building and the allocation of rawmaterials. If responsibility was to rest with different Parliaments in Englandand Wales and in Scotland, complicated arrangements would have to be devised to secure an equitable apportionment of the available resources between firms in each country or, even more difficult, to firms operating in both countries.Further the dangers to Scottish economy of divorcing responsibility for thedefence services from responsibility for industries working for these servicesrequires no emphasis.Conclusion28. The Government of course are anxious to appreciate the reasons whichhave prompted the signing of the Covenant by so many people. But they are fully convinced that the fundamental issues which it raises require much fullerand better informed consideration than it has yet been possible to give them; andthey do not consider that the present critical stage in this country&apos;s affairs is one in which it is possible lightly to embark upon constitutional experiments of whichthe results are unpredictable and might be seriously detrimental to our economy.They have accordingly felt it right to examine in the first place the practicability of obtaining the information required for a fuller study of the whole problem.In the meantime they are resolved, within the framework of the present consti-tution, to continue to see that Scottish interests are fully and adequately lookedafter and that Scottish sentiments and traditions are sympathetically considered and safeguarded.Scottish Office, S.W. 1,11th May, 1950.
