THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;8   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. June 1950SECRET Copy No.CP. (50) 13826th June, 1950CABINETSERETSE KHAMAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations . An important decision has to be taken whether we should adhere to oralter our decision that Seretse Khama and his wife should reside outside the bechuanaland Protectorate for the period during which recognition of him as chief of the Bamangwato has been withheld. This decision should be taken before i leave for my visit to Australia and New Zealand early in July because action may have to be taken one way or the other immediately after my return or possibly even while I am away. Moreover, certain preparations must be put in hand some-time before our decision takes effect.2. There is some reason to hope that Seretse might now accept the situationand leave, quietly without waiting to be expelled: it is less certain that Ruth will leave quietly. We cannot base our plans on the firm assumption of a quiet depar-ture. Their actions, particularly those of Ruth, are unpredictable; and, even ifthey have made up their minds, they are quite capable of suddenly changing them(as has happened before).  We must therefore arrive at a clear decision of policy.3. I have been hoping that it would be possible to allow Seretse and Ruthto remain in the Protectorate (though outside the Bamangwato Reserve). But aftergoing into the question with extreme care and after long discussions with Sir EvelynBaring, I have been compelled to the conclusion that we have no choice but to adhere to our original decision, which I announced to the House on 8th March,1950, in these terms:  &quot; It therefore remained with His Majesty&apos;s Government to settle the issue.They have decided, after most careful consideration of all relevant factors, thatin present circumstances, the High Commissioner must be instructed to with-hold recognition of Seretse as Chief, and that recognition must be withheldfor a period of years. This period must be of such length as experience showsto be necessary for the disappearance of the present tendencies to disruptionwhich threaten the unity and well-being of the tribe. In the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government the period required will certainly not be less than fiveyears, and at the end of it the situation will be reviewed. During this timeSeretse will be required to reside outside the Protectorate and will be unableto revisit it unless special permission should be given.&quot;4. In this and subsequent statements I made it clear that Seretse&apos;s return tothe Protectorate was for the temporary purposes of  _(a) collecting evidence for, and conducting, his law suit; and(b) visiting his wife during her confinement.Both these purposes will in the near future have been achieved.5. The principal reason for adhering to our decision to remove Seretse andRuth is that it would be quite impossible to get the administration of the tribe38922 b
going again or to introduce more representative forms so long as Seretse was in the protectorate. So far we haye set up a system of direct rule under which the powersof the Native Authority are exercised by the District Commissioner. This is atemporary expedient until a proper Native Authority with a Council of leading.- n Africans, can be set up. We have in fact been able with a relatively small policet;force to preserve order in face of several attempts to disturb it. In one case teargas had to be used to cope with a riotous crowd of Seretse&apos;s supporters attemptingforcible restraint on the cattle of one of Tshekedi&apos;s supporters. (For other examples,see Appendix A.) But we have not been able to do more. Collection of taxes hasbecome impossible in Serowe and negligible outside it. The elaborate system of native courts has also practically ceased to function. There is at this moment no possibility of persuading leading men in the tribe to come forward and assume responsibility as part of a Native Authority.6. The principal reason why Seretse&apos;s presence in the Protectorate is liableto obstruct and prevent administration is not the extent and loyalty of his following.He has, of course, followers, and in the capital, Serowe, a large number of the younger men are on his side. But, though he has great power to make mischief,he is very far from being the popular hero that he is represented to be in the british press. Indeed, the Press has been both ignorant and unscrupulous. (Picture Postwent so far as to persuade reluctant tribesmen to doff their hats to Ruth so as tomake a good picture.) The numbers that have turned out to welcome Seretse havenot been large compared with the normal crowd in Serowe. His recent departure from Serowe with Ruth passed without any notice at all. The vernacular news-paper that circulates in the Protectorate also took a line unfavourable to Seretse.(See Appendix B.) Recently the African Advisory Council (which represents the eight tribes of Bechuanaland and other Africans in the Protectorate) unanimouslycondemned the boycott of the kgotla summoned by Sir Evelyn Baring at Seroweas unseemly and disrespectful to the Crown. The Bamangwato on this occasionhad no representatives present, because the activities of Seretse&apos;s supporters had prevented the holding of a tribal meeting to elect them. Indeed, it may broadly besaid that among Africans in general support for Seretse tends to be in directratio to their distance from the scene.7. The reason why Seretse&apos;s presence in the Protectorate makes administrationimpossible is that, so long as he is there, doubt will remain whether the Governmentreally means business and whether he may not at any moment succeed in becomingChief. At the moment it is generally assumed that we mean to exclude him; but his defiance of the Government (which he has been at pains to magnify) has created doubt. Until this doubt is removed no one will come forward to helpadminister the tribe for fear of being treated by Seretse as an enemy. Accordingto reports that I have received, Ruth has fully exploited this fear and has madethreats that when Seretse is installed as Chief it will be the worse for those who areopposing him. The Chief in the Bamangwato Reserve has immense power and canruin his enemies.8. There are in consequence a very large number of Bamangwato who aresitting on the fence waiting to see what happens. They refuse to take sides orexpose themselves. It is largely for this reason that Seretse has been able to inter-fere to a considerable extent with government. His followers have collected illegallevies (theoretically to help Seretse in his fight; in fact to finance his personalexpenditure). They have resorted to him to get his instructions, and it is almost certain that he is behind the campaign to refuse payment of taxes and to boycottkgotlas. His followers are relying on fear. The test whether Seretse is still to be feared will be whether or not we stick to our decision to exclude him.9. Tshekedi, excluded from the Reserve and living in the territory of a neigh-bouring Chief, has a small but very influential and experienced following. I am advised that he realises there is no question of his becoming Chief and that he isnot aiming at this. He has around him, however, the ablest people from theReserve and there are indications that his influence is now reviving. More people from all over the Reserve are going to him in secret to seek his advice. He is con-vinced that Seretse would make a very bad Chief. If by allowing Seretse to remainin the protectorate we made it appear that we were weakening in our decision aboutthe suspension of the chieftainship, we should get the worst of both worlds. We-should stiffen Seretse and his followers in opposition, and encourage him to press
his claim for recognition as Chief. We should also throw Tshekedi and his followers against us: we should have indeed to expect bitter attacks. Thus weshould have no support at all.10. The ill effects of allowing Seretse to remain would extend beyond the bamangwato Reserve. Among Africans in the Union there is considerable opposi-tion to Seretse, reflected in the vernacular press. (See Appendix B.) There is alsoopposition on the part of some (though not all) of the neighbouring tribes in the protectorate. In particular, of the Chiefs of the two most important other tribesone has given refuge to Tshekedi and the other has throughout opposed Seretse&apos;smarriage. The Paramount Chief of Basutoland and her leading advisers haveexpressed very strong criticism of Seretse and asked us to make illegal in Basutolandthe sort of marriage he has contracted. Support from this quarter is all the moreimpressive as our relations with the Chiefs of Basutoland are somewhat strainedthrough an execution of some of them for &quot; ritual &quot; murder. There is also criticism of Seretse in Swaziland, though expressed in a less definite form.11. Broadly speaking, the same arguments apply to the exclusion of Ruthfrom the Protectorate. She has not admittedly the prestige of a claimant to the chieftainship; but she is astute and ruthless and has made it clear that she intends to cause as much mischief as she can. There is also a strong case for removinghusband and wife together and not exposing ourselves to the charge of inhumanlyseparating them. If she remained behind we should be constantly under pressure to let him return to visit her. She has already shown that she is ready to feignillness.12. There are thus conclusive grounds in terms of local administration foradhering to our decision. But I am bound to draw attention to the grave effects onour vital interests in southern Africa which a contrary decision would have. our major concern, in the interests of the African inhabitants of the three Territories,is to preserve the Territories from the Union: this is even more important thanthe case of Seretse. We must also do our utmost to keep the Union solidly in theCommonwealth for strategic, economic and other reasons.13. We have very strong weapons to deter South Africa from taking extremeaction to incorporate the Territories. The Union would be most reluctant to damage and isolate herself by a head-on collision with Britain. She is very conscious of the importance of standing together against the Russian danger. She needs thelabour of the Territories as much as they need the wages earned in the gold mines.These deterrents, however, will only be effective so long as the general mood inthe Union is cool and reasonably rational and so long as the United Party givesno more than formal and reluctant support to the Nationalists&apos; demand for the incorporation of the Territories. If all white opinion in the Union were to becomeboth united and inflamed our deterrents would cease to be effective. We mustrealise that, powerful as they are, their power is limited. If the Union got intoa mood to defy us and the world, there is very little that we could do to hold the territories. Quite apart from force, economic boycott (though it would hurt theUnion) would render us helpless. The Seretse case represents perhaps the one set of circumstances that could unite and inflame all white opinion in the Unionagainst us. It raises the question of mixed marriages, which arouses the most highly-charged emotion and can drive South Africa into completely irrationalattitudes and actions. We cannot ignore this in relation to happenings in one ofthe three Territories as we could in relation to a similar happening in another partof the Colonial Empire, for the Territories are in fact embedded in South Africa,and the Union at any rate regards its ultimate claim to the Territories as assured by United Kingdom legislation. There is overwhelming evidence that if, as it wouldseem to the Union, the United Kingdom had set its official seal upon mixedmarriages in the midst of South Africa by recognising Seretse, there would havebeen an outburst of uncontrollable emotion and anger in the Union, which wouldhave thrown the whole of white opinion behind Dr. Malan. A failure to adhere to our original decision to exclude Seretse and Ruth would have much the same effect. We should be criticised by the whole South African press, including the so-called &quot; liberal&quot; press, (who would feel that we had played into the hands ofthe Nationalists), and by both political parties. Quite apart from the reasons oflocal administration that I have adduced-which I think are in themselves con-clusive it would be completely foolhardy and short-sighted to run this risk for
the sake of a man who has not even succeeded in evoking any significant supportamong the African populations of the Protectorate (outside the bamangwato reserve), the other two Territories, and the Union.14. A great deal will turn on the timing and manner of our exclusion of seretse and Ruth. Our objective must be to secure that they leave quietly. I Wemust, however, as I have said, be prepared for the worst.15. The critical time will cpme with the final settlement of the lawsuit, as this is the remaining purpose for which we allowed Seretse to return. He andeveryone else will expect his exclusion to date from about that moment. It howseems practically certain that the case will be settled out of court. But we shouldhave to allow both Seretse and Tshekedi to tour the Reserve in order to inspectcattle posts; this would be a necessary consequence of their settlement out of court. It should take about two to three weeks from 8th July.(Should, unexpectedly, the legal proceedings between the parties be resumed,there should be time for them to reach a final conclusion before parliament reassembles in October.)16. There would clearly be much to be said for taking decisive action in theParliamentary Recess, if we could do so without it looking as if we had deliberatelyengineered this. On the other hand, we cannot allow too long an interval to occurbetween the end of the case and our action.17. The procedure I propose is that, shortly after the final settlement of thelegal dispute, our Resident Commissioner should see Seretse and discuss thearrangements for his departure. The Resident Commissioner should explainpolitely but clearly that our decision stands. He should go on to say that weshould like to arrange the departure of Seretse and Ruth in such a way as to causethem the least inconvenience. We should be prepared to fix their departure foran agreed date within reasonable limits and to arrange and pay for their flight toEngland. We should also be ready to do our best to arrange accommodation forthem in London for about a month while they are looking for a place to live.We should further make any other preliminary arrangements (about reading forthe Bar, &amp;c.) that would help him. All this should be based on the assumption thatthey are leaving quietly, either without any order being issued, or upon the issueof an expulsion order under Section 2 of the 1907 Proclamation (see paragraph 21below).  If they are, the sooner they go the better.If on the other hand they (or either of them) show that they will not leavequietly, it must at once be made clear to them that we will adhere to, and enforce,our decision. In that case, a deportation order should be served on them. Wewould still pay their air passages and try to fit the actual date of departure to suittheir reasonable convenience: but this must depend upon their general behaviour.We must be ready to use the necessary force to put them aboard an aircraft.18. At the present moment it is impossible to predict the dates on which ourvarious steps will have to be taken. It depends on the progress of the discussions about the lawsuit, on the time taken for the tour of cattle posts, and on other factors. But it looks as if we might not have to take action until the Recess has begun, or indeed has run for some time. For my part I should have greatlypreferred (subject only to avoiding unnecessary risks) to ensure that action is takenwhen I am in the country to justify it, i.e., after my return at the beginning ofSeptember; but the suspension of Seretse&apos;s lawsuit makes it now unlikely thatthis can be achieved.19. We cannot tell whether there will be a great public outcry. But even ifthere were, we could not allow this to weigh against the need to avoid a completecollapse of the administration of the Reserve. If Seretse and Ruth go quietlyI do not think there will be too much of a stir. But if we have to use force, wemust count on a fierce, but perhaps not very long, outburst of criticism. It shouldnot be overlooked that if we left them in the Protectorate they could attract asmuch public attention over here maybe more as if they were in England. Pressmen would be hanging around them eager for stories, and even (as has already occurred) instigating them to create incidents.Though we can be reasonably hopeful that their departure will pass offwithout undue publicity, we ought to have a White Paper ready for publicationat need and I have given instructions for the preparation of a draft which is now
in hand. The White Paper should relate developments since our previous white paper, and set forth our objectives for the development of more representativeinstitutions among the Bamangwato and the reason why Seretse&apos;s exclusion isnecessary for these purposes. We could also in the White Paper take an oppor-tunity to describe the reactions of the vernacular press, which are practicallyunknown here. We cannot decide whether or not to publish the White Paper until we see what it looks like and until we know whether Seretse and Ruth will orwill not leave quietly.20. I have consulted the Law Officers about certain legal points that arise.Their view is set out in Appendix C.  The principal points are these:  (a) Whether our powers under the existing Proclamation No. 15 of 1907 (seeAppendix D), are sufficient to exclude Seretse and Ruth, or whetheramendments should be issued. The answer is that we should rely onthe existing Proclamation. If nevertheless it should be decided thata new Proclamation ought to be issued, certain questions will arise about its contents and timing.(b) Whether we can do anything if Seretse and Ruth were to leave the plane at its first landing place. The answer, as I understand it, is &quot; no.&quot; Powersof deportation appear to be limited to putting the deportee on board aconveyance. If he returns the only remedy seems to be to deport himagain or prosecute him for contravention of the deportation order.I have felt it&apos; advisable to explore this point, but I have no reason to expect that such a situation will arise.21. The question arises whether to issue an order of exclusion even if Seretseand Ruth leave quietly. Two different kinds of order are possible under the proclamation. One is an expulsion order, under Section 2, directed to a person and requiring him to leave; the other is a deportation order, under Section 4, givingauthority for his &quot; apprehension and removal.&quot; The Attorney-General (seeAppendix C) suggests that we should endeavour, if possible, to do without eithertype of order; if necessary we should make an expulsion order, offer to provideSeretse and Ruth with facilities to travel, and obtain from them a signed request for the provision of such facilities; and only in the event of their refusing to signsuch a request and to leave voluntarily should a deportation order be made. I agree with this. I feel, however, that, in order to guard against any renewed allegation-tions of &quot; trickery &quot; they should if they leave quietly be informed in writing thatif they return without permission an order for their exclusion will be madeforthwith.22. I have discussed with Sir Evelyn Baring plans for setting up a new andmore representative native administration in the Bamangwato Reserve. At themoment, as I have said, administration is at a standstill. Our first task will be toget it working again. But we do not wish to restore it exactly as it was before.Without questioning the power and authority of the chieftainship we wish to associate the people, through a central council, more closely with their own govern-ment. We also wish to do what we can to bring the allied or subject tribes more directly into the conduct of the tribe&apos;s affairs. My proposals for this are outlined in Appendix E.23. Briefly the main objectives are (a) to alter the composition of the central council so as to make it more representative; and (b) to draw the subject or alliedtribes (the vast majority of the people) into some share in the administration of theReserve. To achieve this, the proposal is to associate small local councils with theChiefs eight representatives both in the districts and at the central kgotla, and toendeavour to find at least some Chiefs representatives among the allied tribes.24. We can make no progress with this until Seretse has gone. Even then itwill be slow and difficult. We must throughout carry the people with us. our approach must necessarily be tentative and flexible. It may be necessary to exclude from the Reserve one or two leading members of the tribe who are leading theno-tax campaign and who organised the boycott of the last abortive kgotla. (Ifthis were necessary, they would be put in the same position as Tshekedi i.e., theycould reside in the Protectorate and not the Reserve.) There is also the difficult question of the occupant of the Chiefs chair at the central kgotla. At this stageI cannot say more than that it may be necessary to get the tribe to agree to some temporary occupant.38922 c
Conclusions25.   I therefore seek authority to take the following steps:  1. To instruct the Resident Commissioner to approach Seretse shortly after thefinal settlement of the lawsuit and offer to arrange for the journey of theKhama family to England. j.2.   If they leave quietly, without any order being issued, to inform them inwriting that if they return without permission an order for their exclusion&apos;   will be made forthwith.3.   If it appears that they will not leave without an order, to issue an expulsionorder under section 2 of the 1907 Proclamation and to seek to obtain from them a signed request for travel facilities.4. If either or both still refuse to leave, to issue a deportation order undersection 4 of the 1907 Proclamation, and to use such force as may benecessary to enforce it.5. In any event to pay (at United Kingdom expense) their air passage toLondon and, if Seretse wishes, the cost of their accommodation inLondon for about a month.6. Directly Seretse and Ruth have left, to proceed with measures to set up amore representative organisation in the Bamangwato Reserve.7. To prepare a draft White Paper.P. C. G.-W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,26th June, 1950.APPENDIX ADisturbances of the peace on 13th March numbers of Seretse&apos;s followers picketed all the roads andpaths leading to the kgotla enclosure and so prevented the holding of the kgotlasummoned by the High Commissioner. This was a measure of deliberate intimidation-dation though no violence was used.On the night of 14th March a gang of young ruffians surrounded and threatened to burn down the residence of an African doctor, Dr. Molemo, who was suspected of hiding Tshekedi. The police gave protection and prevented any outbreak of violence.Instances of attempts to interfere with the movement of Tshekedi&apos;s cattleoccurred earlier in the year without any breach of the peace, but on 11th April amore serious incident occurred when a crowd of Seretse&apos;s supporters attempted tointerfere forcibly with the movement of cattle and wagons belonging to one ofTshekdfs supporters and co-exiles. The small body of police which reached the scene had to use tear gas to break up the crowd. The attempt was renewed later in the day and a number of arrests had to be made. The ringleaders made state-men ts to the District Commissioner threatening continued resistance to the enforcement of law and order.APPENDIX BTHE VERNACULAR PRESS IN SOUTHERN africa the reactions of the vernacular press printed in southern Africa are of great interest. The only vernacular paper circulating in the Bechuanaland Protectorate(a paper having one African and one European editor) took a line definitelyunfavourable to Seretse.In the Union, three newspapers, mainly in Bantu languages but with a fewEnglish articles, have a circulation of approximately 25,000 each; and no other
vernacular paper can approach this figure. All these three are edited by Africans.In one, no mention has been made of the Seretse affair, either in editorials or in correspondence. In the other two (one of which, the Bantu World, has the largestcirculation of all and is published partly in the language of the bechuanaland and partly in English) Seretse&apos;s marriage and subsequent actions have been strongly condemnedin the editorial columns. In the vernacular paper printed in Zulu, even strongerlanguage has been used against Seretse. On the other hand attacks on the UnitedKingdom Governmenfs treatment of Seretse have appeared in the Communistvernacular paper, in at least one English broadsheet circulating among Africans onthe Rand. Among the many non-Communist vernacular papers in the Union onlya single publication and that with a circulation of little over 2,000 has attackedour policy.APPENDIX copy OF LETTER FROM ATTORNEY-GENERAL TO LEGAL ADVISER,COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICESECRETDear Roberts-Wray, 23rd June, 1950.Thank you for your letter of 22nd June in regard to the proposal that the bechuanaland Proclamation dealing with the deportation of persons from the protectorate should be repealed and replaced by a Proclamation of more comprehensive character.The matter is, of course, entirely one of policy, but I feel bound to say thatI very much dislike the idea of enacting a Proclamation on the lines proposed.I had not seen the Deportation (Aliens) Ordinance, 1949, made in respect of theColony of Kenya and there are certainly features? in it which I do not care for.I should find them the more objectionable if they were applied to British subjects.Thus, I do not like the idea that an Order deporting a British subject from his hometerritory could be made on the ground that the Governor or High Commissionerdoes not like his moral character. I will not, however, go into the matter furtherbecause on the view I take, the powers under the Proclamations which already existare probably sufficient, and if not sufficient could not, I think, be significantlyamplified by a new Proclamation. Perhaps the simplest course will be for me to answer the various questions put by the Colonial Office.(1) Question: Are there adequate powers under Proclamation No. 15 of 1907for the removal of (i) Seretse, (ii) Mrs. Khama, from the Protectorate?Answer: Proclamation No. 15 as amended by Proclamation No. 11 of 1950is in very wide and general terms. Section 2 enables the High Commissioner,on its being shown to his satisfaction that &quot; there are reasonable grounds for believing that any person for the time being living in the Protectorate is a danger to the peace thereof,&quot; to direct the Resident Commissioner to issue an ExpulsionOrder, failure to comply with which constitutes an offence. Section 4 is inwider terms and is the one which would be relied upon here. This enables theHigh Commissioner to instruct the Resident Commissioner to issue an order for the arrest and removal from the Protectorate &quot; to any place without itslimits &quot; of anyone whom &quot;he has reasonable grounds for believing is a danger to the peace thereof.&quot; These powers, assuming them to be within the legislative powers of the High Commissioner under the Order-in-Council, are about aswide as they could be. I do not think that a fresh Proclamation dealing withthe matter with greater particularity would really add to the powers which section 4 purport to give to the High Commissioner and the resident commissioner.(2) Question: Section 4 of the Proclamation provides for removal from the protectorate &quot; to any place Without its limits &quot; of any person whom the HighCommissioner &quot; has reasonable grounds &quot; for believing is &quot; a danger to the peace
thereof,&quot; Presumably the High Commissioner might be called upon to satisfy a. Court that the grounds were &quot; reasonable&apos;&apos;?   ,Answer: Assuming that the High Commissioner acted in good faith, I donot think any Court could canvass the grounds upon which he acted. Thematter is one for the High Commissioner^ belief and the Court cannot substituteits belief for that of the High Commissioner. (See Liversedge v. Anderson, 1942Appeal Cases, page 206, and the subsequent line of cases.) The language ofSection 2 of the Proclamation is a little different to that of Section 4 andthe decision in Liversedge v. Anderson is not so directly in point. I have,however, little doubt that the principle of this line of cases would still applyand that under the terms of the Proclamation the question whether or not there, were reasonable grounds for believing that a particular individual was a danger to the peace is one exclusively within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner.(3) Question: Would the words in Section 4 of the Proclamation &quot; any personwhom be has reasonable grounds for believing is a danger to the peace thereof&quot;be capable of a wide interpretation, e.g., to cover the possibility that one or other of the persons in question, by remaining in the Protectorate, might become a focusfor intrigue against the administration and so make good government impossible?Answer: As indicated above, the Courts would not be entitled to go into the reasons which had led the High Commissioner, assuming he acted in good faith, to.the conclusion that there were reasonable grounds for believing that a particular individual was a danger to the peace or in what sense thatdanger arose. The High Commissioner must not, of course, give the words a wider interpretation than is justified by their context but I think he wouldbe entitled to give, instructions under Section 4 in the case of a person whobecame a focus for intrigue and made good government impossible.(4) Question: To what degree would an order of removal have a continuinglegal effect outside the Protectorate? Can the Resident Commissioner in an order under. Section 4 of the Proclamation name a place to which the person apprehendedis to be removed. Would the order extend only to the first contact of the aeroplaneWith land, or would it in any sense have a continuing effect to the destination (if any)named therein, whether the person is conveyed after one&apos;or more changes by airor sea? Presumably the order would have no effect in any separate jurisdictionwhether in a British Colony or in foreign territory. In other words, has the Protec-torate Administration -or can it acquire by local legislation powers to compel the person to continue his journey by air or sea to the named destination?Answer: In general, neither an Order-in-Council and still more a proclamation made under the Order-in-Council can have extra-territorial effectunless the United Kingdom Statute under which it is made clearly indicates that Parliament intended this result. It may well be, therefore, that the provision in Section 4 enabling the High Commissioner to order the removal of a person&quot; to any place without &quot; the limits of the Protectorate is ultra vires so far as itpurports to authorise detention outside the Protectorate. If this is so, thematter cannot be cured by any amendment. Although there is no case exactlyin point, there is, however, some authority for the view that a State whichpossesses powers of expulsion has also the power to do those things which maybe done in the very act of expulsion if the right to expel is to be exercisedeffectively at all notwithstanding the fact that constraint outside the boundaries of the State or the commission of a trespass outside those boundaries shouldthereby result. (The Attorney-General for Canada v. Caine, 1906 A.C.,&quot;page542, see page 546.)(5) Question: Assuming that the person or persons named in the order ofremoval reached the United Kingdom, whether they made the journey voluntarilyor under compulsion: (He., the show or actual use of force), would they have any grounds lor challenging our action in the. United Kingdom Courts and establishing a claim for damages for illegal removal or for their return at Government expenseto a point just outside the Protectorate boundaries (or, alternatively, to the first point of calk of the&quot; aircraft which brought them out of the Protectorate)?:?      .r,;-:   Answer.- Persons voluntarily making the journey to, the United Kingdomv.. - or elsewhere from Bechuanaland after an order had been made against them under Sections 2 or 4 of the Proclamation would hot, I think, have any right
Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray, K.C.M.G.,Colonial Office,Church House,Great Smith Street, S.W. 1.APPENDIX DBECHU AN ALAND PROTECTORATEPROCLAMATIONBY HIS EXCELLENCY THE HIGH COMMISSIONER(No. 15, 1907.-Dated 3rd June, 1907). (As Amended by Proclamation No. 11 of 1950)Preamble. WHEREAS by the Order in Council of Her late Majesty dated the ninth of May, 1891, the High Commissioner is empowered to providefor the peace and good government of all persons within the limits of the said Order including the prohibition and punishment of actstending to disturb the public peace:38922 to  damages in the United Kingdom Courts. If they did not make the journeyvoluntarily but were in fact detained on a ship or aircraft, it is possible thatthey might have a right of action. I think the safest course would be to make an order under Section 4 providing for the removal of the individual concerned to the nearest available territory to which he could be permitted to land and then to provide facilities for him to come to the United Kingdom volun-voluntarily if he so desired. If this course is not practicable and the order underSection 4 has to provide for removal to the United Kingdom, I cannotguarantee that an action for damages would not lie, but it is quite clear thatno amendment of the Proclamation could cure this doubt and, on the whole,I think it improbable that the British Courts would decide that an action lay.I hope it may turn out that all this is academic. I have no doubt that theColonial authorities will make every possible effort to deal with the matter in away which does not involve compulsion or the making of any formal order ofexpulsion or deportation. If it becomes necessary to make an order, the wisecourse would no doubt be to make one under Section 2, to inform Seretse and mrs. Khama of it, and then to provide them with facilities to travel either to theUnited Kingdom or to any other territory which was prepared to receive them,obtaining a signed request from each of them for the provision of such facilities.Only in the event of their refusing to sign such a request and to leave the territoryvoluntarily should action be taken under Section 4.You will see from all this that as at present advised I am opposed to any amendment of the Proclamations as they exist at present. If, however, there are other reasons which you would like to put to me why you think an amendmentof the Proclamations would give rise to powers operating outside the territory which are not available under the existing Proclamations, I will, of course, considerthe matter further. Having regard to the political implications involved, I wouldhave thought it might well be better to take a risk on the matter. It hardly seemsto me likely that Seretse would abandon his right to the annual payment (and i assume that this can be withdrawn) in the rather speculative hope of obtainingdamages. These are, however, matters of policy on which I cannot express any firm opinion.Yours sincerely,(Signed)        HARTLEY SHAWCROSS.

At present the Chief is represented in the Districts of the Reserve by eight Chiefs Representatives, all ofwhom are Bamangwato related to him. The Administration have in mind thefollowing changes:  (i) A small Council of local headmen, nearly all members of the Allied Tribes,will be attached to each Chiefs Representative. There will be opposi-tion among the Bamangwato but it is hoped that this will be overcome by firmness, patience and persuasion.(ii) For important kgotlas at Serowe called to consider the conduct of tribal,as distinct from local business, the Chiefs Representatives would attendwith members of their Councils. As a result, when important decisions were taken, all districts of the Reserve would be represented, and anumber of the district representatives would be from the Allied Tribes.At present central kgotlas are over-weighted by Serowe Bamangwato.A case in point is the kgotla at which Seretse was accepted, since over,90 per cent, of those present were residents of Serowe, although atleast three-quarters of the inhabitants of the Reserve live outside thecapital town. There are obstacles in the way of implementing this plan but they should not prove to be insuperable,(hi) As soon as possible a start will be made with the selection of some members of the Allied Tribes as Chiefs Representatives. This will bevery difficult. The idea is entirely new to the Africans of the Reserve.Most Bamangwato will strongly oppose the reform; and in the Reservemost of the competent Africans, and almost all those with administra-tive experience in local government, are to be found among the bamangwato and not among the people of the Allied Tribes. Moreover,in the majority of the Districts of the Reserve the Allied Tribes are farfrom homogenous. Up to date they have been prepared to obeyBamangwato sent from Serowe: they will probably at first object toreceiving&apos; orders from a Chiefs Representative drawn from an AlliedTribe other than their own. It will, therefore, be necessary to start ina very modest way. Fortunately there are two Districts in one or bothof which a suitable candidate might be found among the Allied Tribes-men. Fortunately, too, Tshekedi is in favour of this development andhis influence may help us in the future.The prosecution of this reform depends on the willingness of Africans in theReserve to co-operate with the Government. This co-operation will be difficultto achieve in any case. It will be impossible unless Seretse and his wife leave the protectorate.Penalties forcontraventionsof Proclame -tion.
