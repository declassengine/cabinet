THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPRELIMINARY REPORT ON VISIT TO MALAYA AND SINGAPOREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesIntroduction1. I propose, with the Secretary of State for War, to circulate as soon aspossible for the information of the Cabinet, a general report on our visit to malaya. We shall also be bringing forward individual matters in detail to theMalaya Committee.2. Meantime, I wish to let my colleagues have this summary of the matters arising out of my visit on which immediate action is required and is being taken.The Emergency3. The Secretary of State for War and I are completely satisfied withGeneral Briggs&apos;s operational plans. They are based on full co-ordination of themilitary, police ana civil forces. The military forces will clear the peninsula area by area, from south to north: the job of the police and civil administration willbe to establish effective control in each area as it is cleared to enable the militaryforces to move on to the next. Operations under this plan began in Johore on1st June.4. No timed programme can be worked out for &quot; operations &quot; of this kind,and it will be a lengthy task. An indication is that General Briggs (i) does not expect to have cleared the two southernmost States of Johore and Negri Sembilanbefore November of this year, and (ii) he does not contemplate being able to release any troops from Malaya before April 1951 without seriously prejudicinghis own campaign.5. The speed of the plan depends entirely on the capacity of the civil adminis-tration to consolidate behind the military operations: and that in turn is mainlya question of personnel. It is vital to the success of the whole campaign that Malayashould receive, within the next two to three months, the civil reinforcementsneeded, particularly for the Police. The Police calculate, with their present strength,to be able to implement the Briggs Plan in the State of Johore and partly in NegriSembilan: they have no reserves to meet further phases of the Plan.Police Reinforcements6.   The immediate Police requirements are:  (i) 117 officers,(ii) approximately 175 British n.c.os.The officers needed are trained policemen (United Kingdom inspectors orsergeants), of 30-35 years, particularly those with C.I.D. experience. The Federa-tion Government is prepared to offer permanent appointments or contracts. TheColonial Office will seek to recruit from every possible source, but the bulk ofthese men must come from the United Kingdom Police Forces. I am in touchwith the Home Secretary and I hope that there will be no difficulty in meeting this need, which must be regarded as the first priority. The British n.c.os. requiredPrinted for the Cabinet.  June 1950SECRETCopy No.     32CP. (50) 12513th June, 1950CABINET38863
will be recruited through the Crown Agents in the ordinary way. The aboverequirements of officers and n.c.os. will enable the Police Force to meet their obligations under the first half of the Briggs Plan: there will be an additional demand for the second half but this will not be large.7. In addition, General Briggs proposes to build up the Police &quot; junglesquads &quot; into 45 companies, which as a military branch of the Police will be ableto relieve the military forces of internal security duties as the campaign progresses!.He is not asking United Kingdom help on this, but has sought assistance fromthe Service Chiefs in the Far East in recruiting national servicemen (w.os. and in.c.os.), about to take their discharge, for service on contract with the MalayanPolice as Police Lieutenants (platoon leaders) in the &quot; jungle companies.&quot;8. It is most desirable, particularly in view of the large reinforcements from outside, to increase the number of Asian officers in the Federal Police Force. Forthis purpose, a local police officer training college is needed. The federation government are preparing plans for this college as quickly as possible: the commandant of the College and the Chief Instructor will have to be recruited fromthe United Kingdom and I shall seek the assistance of the Home Secretary assoon as firm proposals reach me from Malaya.9. The Federation Government have agreed in principle that a regular police force of about 40,000 men must be maintained after the emergency.Administrative Reinforcements10. The High Commissioner has asked that 25 administrative cadets allotted to Malaya this year should be sent out immediately without taking the usualyear&apos;s training course. This is being arranged. About 15 of these officers were intended to be Chinese-speaking officers and they will be given a three months&apos;intensive course in Cantonese before sailing. I am convinced of the need, both aspart of the Briggs plan and for the future, for closer administrative coverage ofthe country at the &quot; district officer &quot; level, both in Chinese and Malayan areas.Future requirements are being reviewed on this basis; already, in addition to the25 officers mentioned above, 30 others have been asked for by Malaya as immediateappointments.Repatriation of Chinese detainees.11. I found all concerned in Malaya agreed, and I am convinced myself, thatrenewal of the repatriation of Chinese detainees to China is an essential pre-requisite to the success of General Briggs&apos;s plan. The presence of detainees in everincreasing numbers (i) constitutes a most serious security risk,(ii) wastes manpower on guard duties and, above all,(iii) is a serious brake on information, through the Chinese population^ fearof bandits still in the country in detention camps.12. I discussed with the Commissioner-General, the High Commissioner andthe Governor of Singapore, the prospects of resuming this traffic to China, throughordinary commercial channels. A first step might be made early in July, and Ipropose to take up this point immediately with the Foreign Secretary.Information and Propaganda13. There is room for improvement in the Information Services in Malaya,although they are by no means ineffective at present. There is need however for better direction of effort against the Communists in both (a) general propagandawork and (b) direct &quot; psychological warfare &quot; against the bandits. The latter isin its infancy, although a start has now been made by the appointment of a public relations Officer to General Briggs&apos;s staff and of a &quot; propaganda section &quot; of theC.I.D., which works in close co-operation with him.14.   I propose(a) to investigate immediately the possibility of securing an anti-communist propaganda expert for Malaya, whose appointment would be welcomed by the Federation Government;(b) to see what additional financial assistance can be given to the MalayanFilm Unit, since all concerned locally agree that films are the most effective medium;
(c) to pursue with the B.B.C. a suggestion that they post a permanent repre-sentative in Malaya, with a view to correcting the misleadingimpressions of the situation in Malaya sometimes given to the worldby foreign correspondents who seldom move from Singapore.15. There is little doubt that the most effective line of anti-communist propaganda among the Chinese in Malaya is to play up the bad conditions oftheir relatives in China under the Communist regime. A certain amount of news of this kind is filtering through privately and is having a great effect: but it cannotbe used in official propaganda in view of the present directive under which thelocal Information Officers work. I propose to re-examine this problem.Financial and Economic16. I found among all concerned in Malaya, from the High Commissionerdownwards, a keen appreciation of the need for developing the resources of thecountry and improving the standard of living, as a long-term counter to Com-communism. Despite the emergency, the Federation Government is being imaginativeand farsighted. A draft development plan has been prepared for consideration bythe Councils of the States and Settlements, and it is hoped will have reached the stage of approval by the central Legislative Council in July. A major feature ofthis plan is a scheme for the establishment of a Rural Development authority which, though not exclusively for the Malay section of the community, is aimed at developing the economic potential of the rural areas which are predominantlyMalay.17. I am convinced that, if these plans are not to be jeopardised (and it is tomy mind essential that we should be ready to put them into operation as soon asthe emergency is ended, if not earlier), the Federation must have additional financialassistance from the United Kingdom. The  3 million contribution for 1950 fromthe Exchequer towards the cost of the emergency was based on an estimate madein August 1949 that the emergency might end during 1950, and is clearly inadequate.The Federation is in fact rapidly running into a serious financial crisis. I have discussed the whole question with the High Commissioner who will be putting thefinancial situation in detail before me by despatch very shortly; he thoroughlyappreciates the need for counterbalancing any increased contribution from HisMajesty&apos;s Government by the maximum possible increase in local taxation. It willbe necessary to clear the Federation^ request very quickly when the High Com-missioner&apos;s despatch is received and, if the principle of further help is then accepted,I shall probably have to ask for a supplementary estimate during the present sessionof the House.J. G.Colonial Office, S.WA.nth June, 1950.
