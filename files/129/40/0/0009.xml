THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS   BRIT&amp;NNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT   /printed for the Cabinet.   May 1950SECRETCopy No. 22CP. (50) 10911th May, 1950CABINETA NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY scheme memorandum by the Lord Privy SealIt was agreed at the Cabinet meeting on 4th May (CM. (50) 28th Conclusions,,Minute 6) that further consideration should be given to this subject and I hopethat the following notes may be helpful in that respect.1. In The King&apos;s Speech, it was forecast that adequate water supplies shouldbe a public responsibility and, as the Secretary of State for Scotland points out,this is not necessarily the same as nationalisation as we understand it in the caseof coal, electricity, &amp;c.2. The need is obvious, especially in rural areas, where, in addition to meeting present urgent needs, better water supplies are essential for development.If it is acceptably dealt with, it may be a most popular proposal, but not otherwise.3. This means, I suggest, that when we go forward we must do so with a carefully prepared scheme. Such a scheme should be one, if it could possibly be devised, that will enlist goodwill and co-operation in progressively 4. I share the view of the Minister of Health that whatever organisaion may be created to have charge of the general direction and development of thescheme should be directly responsible to the Minister, perhaps in the form of aNational Water Supplies Commission, with the utmost possible freedom fromDepartmental procedure.5. We may accept that there are some 50 to 60 main water supply areas,as indicated in the surveys provided by the Minister of Health, and it is alsoevident that the multiplicity of water undertakings (1,200, as mentioned by theMinister) clearly calls for amalgamation in some form.6. It is also, I think, certain that the provision of adequate water supplies in many rural areas could not in itself be an economical proposition and that,therefore, we must look for some national evening out of charges to meet theneeds of consumers.7. There are, apparently, two separate problems, although closely related to one another. The first is the mapping out of the water supply areas, whetherby catchment arrangements or by tapping underground sources of water; thesecond is machinery for distribution.8. I question the wisdom of presenting the large local authorities with ascheme prepared in advance. We have to remember that large cities, for exampleManchester, Sheffield., Derby, and others, in some cases separately and in somecases in co-operation, have become responsible for vast water schemes and successful systems of supply. At the same time, it is, no doubt, true that theirpipe-lines often pass through areas that are very inadequately supplied.(i) providing supplies of water; and(ii) securing their distribution where the needs are revealed.38714
9. I feel convinced that the wise method of approach is to take these majorauthorities into consultation with us, on the basis that the Government intend topromote a national water supply scheme and that we are anxious to make use oftheir services and experience in the elaboration of a satisfactory scheme.10. It would probably not be necessary for the proposals to be preceded byanything like the Land Drainage Commission which preceded the Land DrainageActs which I introduced in 1930, and which involved the obliteration of a vastnumber of small drainage and other authorities, some of a very ancient character.11. The subject is so vast and so important and contains such possibilitiesof real popular appeal, that I do not think the joint consultations such as I suggestneed occupy many months, but I do think it is desirable that the County councils association and the Association of Municipal Authorities, with major bodies likethe Metropolitan Water Board, should be approached with a view to securing their goodwill and co-operation.12. It appears to me that two organisations might be required under theCommission : first, a central Water Procurement Authority; and second, a Water Distribution Authority.The first would clearly be a national body, and the second perhaps in the formof a central water distribution board, with subordinate district bodies, in theexecution of whose duties would be incorporated the major existing public water undertakings, which themselves would absorb a large number of minor ones.A.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W. 1,11 th May, 1950.
