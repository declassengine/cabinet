(50) 116 /23rd May, 1950 /CABINETCOUNCIL OF EUROPEJoint Meeting of Representatives of the Committee of Ministers and theStanding Committee of the Consultative Assembly, London, 18th May, 1950Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs submit herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a short account of thejoint meeting of representatives of the Committee of Ministers and the StandingCommittee of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, which tookplace in the Foreign Office on 18th May. The Agenda and a summary of conclu-sions drawn up by the Secretariat-General are annexed (Annexes I and II).2.   The decisions were briefly as follows: - -(i) Constitution of a &quot; Joint Committee &quot;The representatives of the two organs of the Council agreed to recommend to the Committee of Ministers and the Consultative Assembly respectively theestablishment of a joint organisation to be known as the &quot; Joint Committee.&quot;This would normally consist of twelve members, five of whom would be repre-sentatives of the Committee of Ministers, and seven representatives of the consultative Assembly. It would, however, be open to the Committee ofMinisters at their discretion to increase the number of their representatives onthe Joint Committee by up to two members. The seven representatives ofthe Consultative Assembly would always include the President of the Consulta-tive Assembly, who would be the permanent President of the Joint Committee.Apart from this, both organs of the Council are to be free to select their repre-sentatives on the Joint Committee in any way they please. Three representa-tives of the Committee of Ministers, and five representatives of the consultative assembly, are to form a quorum. Meetings of the Joint Committee are to be convened by its Chairman and shall take place &quot; as often as is necessary.&quot;The Joint Committee is not to take decisions by way of vote.The terms of reference of the Joint Committee are set out in Section B of annex II to this paper. The concluding proviso that proposals for the inclu-sion of items put forward by representatives of the Committee of ministers should not be regarded as binding on the Government, of which these represen-tatives are members was inserted at. my request.(ii) Other BusinessHaving agreed on their recommendations in regard to the constitution and functions of the Joint Committee, the meeting decided that they would regard themselves as discharging, until the next Session of the Consultative Assembly,the functions eventually to be assumed by the New Committee. This wouldenable them to take into consideration the further items figuring on the Agenda.These were dealt with as follows:  Item 2.   Representation of the Committee of Ministers in the consultative assembly (Article 27 of the Statute).This question has been left in suspense since the first Session of theCommittee of Ministers last August, at which it proved impossible to38765 B
secure unaniiriity. It has been referred for an opinion to the Assembly,which has not so far expressed any views. It was therefore agreed that itwould be premature for the meeting to discuss the question.Item 3.   Reports by the Committee of Ministers to the Consultative Assembly(Article 19 of the Statute).Under Article 19 of the Statute the Committee of Ministers is expectedto &quot; furnish the Assembly with statements of its activities, accompaniedby appropriate documentation.&quot; These statements are intended to be asummary of the action taken by the Committee of Ministers betweenSessions and will form a considerable part of the material for theAssembly&apos;s debates.The representatives of the Committee of Ministers took note of theimportance attached by the representatives of the Assembly to these reports and in particular of the request put forward by M. Mollet that thereports should not be exclusively factual, but should give some indication of the reasons prompting various decisions taken by the Committee ofMinisters. This may present certain dangers, as the proceedings of theCommittee of Ministers are secret, and our special position may wellrequire that such secrecy be preserved.   We shall have to be careful here.Item 4.   Preparations for the forthcoming Ordinary Session of the consultative assembly.There was some discussion of the Agenda for the forthcoming Sessionof the Consultative Assembly. As, however, the reports to be submittedby the various working parties of experts appointed by the Committee ofMinisters and the Committees of the Assembly are not yet ready, thediscussion was not very conclusive.3. The atmosphere of the meeting was extremely friendly and conciliatory.There was no real difficulty over, any major issue, and the crucial point that theproposed joint organisation should not take decisions by way of vote, to which weattached great importance, was accepted by the Assembly representatives withoutdemur.4.   In general the results of the meeting can be regarded as satisfactory.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd May, 1950
