THIS  DOCUMENT  IS   THE  PROPERTY  OP  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1950Copy No. 09CABINETPOINTS RATIONINGMemorandum by the Minister of food at the Cabinefs meeting on 6th April (CM. (50) 20th Conclusions, Minute 1)I was invited to submit a further report in a month&apos;s time on the working of the restricted points scheme. I have delayed my report in order that I might be fully informed about the operation of the new arrangements, and the reactions of thepublic to them, but the pressure of opinion in favour of abolition of pointsrationing impels me once more to urge this course upon my colleagues.2. I have received many complaints from both consumers and traders and,indeed, the critical reaction to the restricted scheme has been so widespread that Ithink it probable that many of my colleagues have been made directly aware of thegeneral dissatisfaction with the new arrangements.3. The main cause of this is the reduction made in the consumer&apos;s pointsfrom 24 to 16 to allow for the goods removed from the scheme. The effect is different for every consumer and every shop according to the proportion theconsumer formerly bought, or the shop formerly sold, of the goods now excluded.The consumer who commonly spent most of her points on biscuits and syrup andfew on canned meat or canned beans now finds her ability to buy biscuits and syrupdrastically reduced. A great many consumers are or believe themselves to be affected in this way. Certain groups of people, such as vegetarians and Jews, whonever bought canned meat with their points, feel the change with particular force.The new arrangements also work to the severe disadvantage of small families and persons living alone.The change in the pattern of consumers&apos; purchasing is affecting a great manyretailers. Grocers with a big trade in canned meat and canned beans now find their supply of such things as biscuits inadequate to meet the concentration of points demand on these commodities; while certain multiple stores who specialisein biscuits and do not stock canned meats find the demand for their biscuitsreduced. We have, therefore, a, situation where simultaneously some shops are suffering from shortage and others are over-stocked. This particular difficulty,it is true, would sort itself out in time, but not before a great deal of irritationhad been generated.4. There is nothing I can do in the short term to cure the newly createdmal-distribution of supplies between one type of shop and another. This wouldhave to work itself out over a period of time, during which we should have to face a rising volume of complaint. Nor can I deal effectively with the othercomplaints made by consumers. The restricted scheme is too narrow andtoo inflexible. I cannot give the consumer more points to spend. I cannotgreatly adjust the points value of any individual commodity. Now that thereare so few of them each has come to have too important a share in balancingthe overall budget of the scheme. The fact is that the points scheme can no longermake a tolerable approach to meeting the varying requirements of individualfamilies and the different tastes of different parts of the country.38726SECRETCP.

5. I have reached the conclusion that to continue the scheme any longerwould bring into disrepute: not only points rationing itself but the whole machineryof food rationing. As I said in CP. (50) 59 of 1st April, there will be certainshortages if points rationing is abolished, but, given the continuance of the unitvoucher system of distribution for the scarce items, I am satisfied that the riskof antagonising the public by continuing this source of irritation and frustrationis far greater than could arise out of its abolition.6. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that points rationing can nowbe brought to an end. ,      j:M. W.Ministry of Food, S. W. 1,15th May, 1950.
