THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(50) 129 COPY NO,   3^16TH JUNE, 1953CABINETSTATEMENT TO THE HOUSE OF commons on VISIT TO MALAYANote by the Secretary of State for the colonies circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the text ofa statement which I propose to make to the House on Monday, 19thJune, on my recent visit to Malaya and Singapore.J.G.Colonial Office, S.W.1,16TH JUNE, 1950.STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE OF commons the House will appreciate that I must confine myself to the salient impressions which I bring back from my tour of Malaya and singapore.     I am indebted to all those responsible for the admirable way in which it was arranged.     I was able to meet and talk with people from every section of the community, to see the situation for myself in many different parts of the country, and to discuss with the leaders, official and unofficial, their present and future problems.The first object of the Secretary of State for War and myself wasto see what more could be done towards ending the emergency.     We dis-cussed fully with General Briggs, and the civil and military authorities,the plan of operations on which General Briggs has now embarked.     Itwould not be in the public interest for me to give details of this plan,

uwhich involves complete co-ordination between the Army, the  Police andthe civil administration.     But we are convinced it is a realistic and effective plan and our confidence in General Briggs is shared through-out Malaya.     I am not going to say how long the plan will take to succeed.I must warn the House not to expect quick and spectacular results:   the aim is steady and deliberate progress, consolidating the gains at every stage - and that is the right way.     Having seen the difficulties of terrainand communications for myself, I do not underestimate the task:   on theother hand, I know it is a task that we can face squarely and confidently.In saying that, I am encouraged by the undoubted fact that thevast majority of the people in Malaya, of every community, are opposedto the Communists.     We have their good-will in this joint battle, towhich they are making a great contribution.     The terrorist movementhas no roots in any legitimate national aspirations - I want to make thatclear - and indeed the Malays themselves have sent thousands of men intothe security forces to defend their towns and villages.I do not ignore the fact that threats and intimidation make certain sections of the community fearful to withhold aid from the terrorists or to supply information to the authorities.     It is vital inthis campaign to cut the terrorists1 channels of supply and communica-tion and to improve our own sources of intelligence.     That is verylargely a problem of providing protection for the civilian population andof bringing scattered communities within the orbit of administration, by such measures as the settlement schemes which are now under way.It is one of the main objectives of the Briggs plan to create the con-ditions in which effective action to that end will become increasinglyoos sible.Man-power requirements for the police and c.ivil administrationhave been reassessed in the light of the Briggs plan, and urgent steps arenow being taken to recruit in the United Kingdom nearly 300 police

officers and N.C.O&apos;s. within the next few months, as well as additionaladministrative officers.I found in the administrations of Malaya and Singapore, as wellas among the people everywhere, not only a determination to end theemergency as soon as possible, but also a keen appreciation of the needfor developing the resources of the country, for improving the social services and standard of living, and for steady political and constitutional progress.     Despite the emergency, plans for social and economic development are being laid which are imaginative and far-sighted.     Inparticular, I welcome the schemes for meeting the vastly increased demands for education both in the Federation and in Singapore, and forthe economic development of the rural areas of Malaya.     The Federationof Malaya put to me a request for further financial assistance towards theemergency, in order that those plans should not be hampered.     Thatrequest is being considered urgently and sympathetically by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.In the political sphere, I found on every hand the warmestfriendship towards Great Britain and a firm desire that the association between the peooles of Britain and Malaya should be maintained and strengthened.     I found also, in the work of the Communities liason committee on constitutional and political problems, in the Trade Unions,in the Police Force, and in every aspect of everyday life, a most encouraging spirit of co-operation between the various communities.It is for the peoples of Malaya, in their progress towards self-government within the Commonwealth, to build up for themselves a democracy whichis firmly rooted in agreement and common loyalty among the communities and there is good hope that the main lines of constitutional advance in thefuture will increasingly evolve from such agreement.

I should like to pay tribute to the planters and miners, and all those responsible for the remarkable economic recovery of Malayasince the war:   and to acknowledge the great contribution they aremaking, despite difficulties and dangers, to the economic strength ofthe Commonwealth.    As an old trade unionist, I was also greatly encouraby the talks I had with Trade Union representatives in Malaya and singapore.     They reaffirmed to me their unqualified support of theGovernment in the campaign against the terrorists;   and made plaintheir recognition of the responsible part which they had to play in the democratic development of their country.I was concerned to find in some quarters that the clear andunequivocal meaning of the statement made by the Prime Minister tothe House last March about Great Britain&apos;s intentions in Malaya hadnot been fully appreciated.     I took every opportunity of assuring thepeople of Malaya that we should be at their side not only in winning theemergency but also in building the Malaya of the future.In conclusion, I should like to express my gratitude for thekindness and hospitality with which I was received everywhere in malaya and my admiration for all those who are so courageously and resolutelycarrying on with their daily tasks and keeping the economic wheels of thecountry turning.
