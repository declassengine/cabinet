IS DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY OP  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT-- --  -r-Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 132\9th June, 1950CABINETOFFICES OF PROFIT UNDER THE CROWNNote by the Prime Minister1. Last year I circulated a note (CP. (49) 167) drawing attention to the need to consult the Law Officers before appointing Members of Parliament to committees or public bodies, where there was any risk that such appointment involved dis-qualification through infringement of the law relating to the holding of offices of profit under the Crown.2. Some recent difficulties have suggested that sufficient attention is not being paid to this matter, and I must ask my colleagues to exercise particular care toavoid any appointment which might place a Member of Parliament in jeopardy.The law relating to offices of profit under the Crown is at present being examined by a Committee under the chairmanship of the Solicitor-General; and it is undesirable that indemnification Bills covering specific cases should have to bebrought before Parliament and debated while the general subject is underinvestigation.3. Members of the Northern Ireland Senate and House of Commons are subject to the same disqualifications as Members of the United Kingdom House ofCommons, and accordingly Ministers should exercise similar care in connectionwith the appointment of Members of the Northern Ireland Senate cr House ofCommons to committees and public bodies. It may sometimes be necessary to enquire whether a person resident in Northern Ireland, suggested for an appoint-ment, is a Senator or a Member in the Northern Ireland Parliament.4. As I mentioned in my previous note, it is very useful to secure the servicesof Members of Parliament on committees: but the possible legal difficulties mustbe borne in mind and carefully scrutinised in each case.C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,\9th June, 1950.38895
