(50) 6th Conclusions, Minute 4)my colleagues agreed that for the time being I should take no steps towards theestablishment of the Iron and Steel Corporation.2.   Section 11 (1) of the Act provides that &quot;. . . . all the securities of the companies .... shall on the first day ofJanuary, nineteen hundred and fifty one, or such date later, but not more than twelve months later, than the date aforesaid, as the Minister may by ordersubstitute for the date aforesaid, vest in the Corporation . . . .&quot;In the absence of a Ministerial order postponing the date of transfer, the securities will therefore automatically vest in the Corporation on 1st January, 1951,which means that well before that date the Corporation must have been formallyappointed and a number of preparatory steps taken.3. If we intend to adhere to a transfer on 1st January, 1951, or shortlythereafter, an early decision to that effect is imperative. Annex A outlines in some detail the legal and administrative factors involved, and Annex B reproduces for convenience of reference recent Ministerial statements in Parliament.4.   Briefly Annex A shows that-1(a) There must be a clear period of at least six months before the generaldate of transfer in which to appoint members of the Corporation and arrange for transfer.  Adherence to a date for transfer early in 1951means that a decision to proceed must be taken before the end of June. 1950 and an early announcement to this effect would be inevitable.(b) We must in any event make some formal public statement of our intentions before the end of September 1950.(c) We could not defer a decision beyond the end of June 1951 without further legislation.id) Postponement of transfer after 1st January, 1951, leads progressively topractical difficulties, though these can, no doubt, be overcome.5. One question about the Government^ intentions has already been askedin Parliament. Others are likely to be asked and a debate could arise on theMinistry of Supply Estimates for 1950-51, which include an item for  50,000 for expenses under the Iron and Steel Act. The Government are likely to be pressed to indicate their policy before the Summer recess.6.   In any general decision which my colleagues may reach about the date for transfer, I must ask for latitude to settle the precise date in consultation with38735 B
the Treasury and Bank. of. England to ensure that the financial machine for dealingwith Iron and Steel Stock does not become overloaded (cf. paragraph 4 of annex A).7.   The points for decision are:  (a) Do we adhere to a transfer on 1st January, 1951, or shortly thereafter?(b) If not, should we fix a date of transfer now?(c) At what stage and in what form do we make a public announcement?recommendations. To make the date of transfer 1st January, 1951, or thereabouts has thepolitical advantage of demonstrating that we are standing boldly by our policy.Conversely, a declaration that we intend to postpone the date of transfer mayraise fears amongst our supporters that we are running away, or at any rateweakening in our purpose. This might, however, to some extent&apos;be offset by the wording of the statement, which would make it clear beyond doubt that we were determined to proceed at the first practical moment.9. On the other hand, to transfer on 1st January, 1951, having set up theCorporation on 1st October, 1950, has the political disadvantage that it might beheld by many to be unseemly, in view of the prospect of an early election and asthe Act provides us with a year&apos;s latitude, to adhere to this time-table. But more serious, it would be impossible to set up the sort of Corporation we have in mind.Leading men in the iron and steel industry, or men of the required calibre from outside it, would not throw up their present jobs and accept membership of a corporation while there was a real risk that the Iron and Steel Act might be repealed within a few weeks of their appointment. This reluctance to serve islikely to apply to those who are sympathetic to our cause as well as to those whooppose it, and also to those individuals who make up the important Steel Houseorganisation.If, nevertheless, we persisted and set up a Corporation consisting of the best; men we could persuade to serve, it would be confronted with passive resistance oreven complete non-co-operation by the directors and managements of the industry.True, the Corporation as the sole shareholder has the power at the annual meetingsof the companies to replace the boards by their own nominees, but this would leadto the most damaging strife and the organisation of the nationalised industry as envisaged by the Act would break down completely. Moreover, the members ofthe Corporation will be appointed for a number of years and cannot, during thisperiod, be replaced by better qualified individuals. It would obviously be most fortunate if the industry and the Government were saddled with a makeshiftCorporation for a long period, particularly during the formative years of the new organisation. &apos;It seems to me that this difficulty is so formidable that we must decide on atemporary postponement of the formation of the Corporation. If this view is accepted, I do not think it is possible to decide now how long the postponementshould be, as this must depend on the development of the political situation. nor do I think it necessary to make any pronouncement at the moment about post-ponement, which technically could wait till September.G. R. S.Ministry of Supply, W.C.2,17th May, 1950.
ANNEX a legal and Administrative Considerations affecting theDate of Transfer1. The statutory provisions of the Iron and Steel Act, 1949, bearing on thegeneral date of transfer are:  (a) Appointment of the members of the Iron and Steel Corporation cannotbe made before 1st October, 1950 (Section 1 (3)).(b) The general date of transfer will be 1st January, 1951, unless postponedby order of the Minister (and not subject to any Parliamentary approval,either negative or affirmative) to a date not later than 1st January, 1952(Section 11 (1)).(c) A stockholders&apos; representative for each of the companies must be appointedat least two months before the date of transfer and at least fourteen days&apos; notice of a meeting to make the appointment must be given(Paragraphs 1 and 7 of the Fifth Schedule). .2.   In addition, the following administrative considerations must be noted:-(a) When a firm Government decision is reached to proceed with arrange-ments for operating the Act, the Minister^ first task will be to selectpotential members of the Corporation. Although they cannot be formally appointed before 1st October, 1950, they would, if necessary,constitute an informal organising committee pending that date. It will,however, take time to complete discussions with individuals and settleterms of appointment and at least two months should be allowed forthis. One month should then be available for the potential members to select staff and to give preliminary corporate consideration to the tasksfacing them; and from that point, at least three months will be requiredin which the Corporation can make arrangements with the Bank ofEngland and the Third Schedule companies for effecting the transfer and issuing the necessary instructions with adequate notice. (It would,in fact, be preferable to allow rather more than three months.) Thus,when a firm Government decision is reached to proceed with imple-mentation of the Act, the general date of transfer must fall at least six months thereafter.(b) A period of at least three months&apos; public notice is required of the precisedate (which should doubtless be agreed with the Corporation) on whichthe general transfer will take place. This period is essential for (a) thecompanies to arrange meetings for the appointment of stockholders&apos;representatives which must be called not later than two and a halfmonths before the general date of transfer; (b) the Treasury, Bank ofEngland, Stock Exchange and the Third Schedule Companies to makethe necessary arrangements connected with the transfer of securitieson the general date of transfer. Three months&apos; notice would, in practice,mean cutting matters very fine.(c) As the Act stands, with 1st January, 1951, as the general date of transfer,the appointment of the stockholders&apos; representatives must be startedearly in October 1950 at the very latest, and must be completed by theend of that month. If the general date of transfer is to be postponedby Ministerial order beyond 1st January, 1951, a public statement tothat effect will have to be made before the end of September 1950,and the postponing order must be made before 31st December, 1950.3.   In short, these statutory and administrative considerations mean:  (a) After a firm Government decision to proceed with the Act is taken, atleast six months must elapse before the general date of transfer.(b) At least three months&apos; public notice of the general date of transfer mustbe given.(c) The Government must make some public statement of their intentions not later than the end of September 1950.38735 B 2
(d) In practice, it will be highly desirable to make some public statement ofthe Government&apos;s intentions when.a decision to proceed is taken, other-wise rumours that the Government are making positive moves will almost certainly circulate as a result of discussions the Minister will immediately put in hand with potential;members of the Corporation,and these will give rise to questions or debate in Parliament.; 4. As regards the actual date for the transfer, the stock markets, and investorsgenerally, prefer the first interest payment of a new stock to be for a precise six-monthly period; it is therefore highly desirable that the date of transfer shouldbe fixed in relation to the interest dates contemplated for the Iron and Steel Stock.There are certain periods of the year when by reason of heavy interest payments on Government or Nationalisation stocks, or for other reasons, the Bank of Englandand the joint stock banks are hard pressed, and from this aspect the following isa list of pairs of dates in order of inconvenience for the transfer of the iron andsteel industry, i.e., the first are the most inconvenient, and the subsequent onesprogressively less so:  1st June - 1st December.1st January - 1st July. *1st April* - 1st October.1st May - 1st November.15th Mav   .15th November.15th April* - 15th October.15th January - 15th July.*15th February   15th August.15th June   15th December.15th March   15th September.1st March   1st September.: 1st February   1st August.* Sunday in 1951If possible the date for transfer should be selected from the lower ratherthan the upper half of the list.5. The effect of these considerations is that unless the Government reach a firm decision by the end of June 1950 to implement the Act (and preferably make an announcement at that time) a general date of transfer on 1st January, 1951, orshortly thereafter will be impracticable. At the other end of the scale, the most convenient dates for transfer would be in August or September 1951, or on15th December, 1951. A firm Government decision must be taken at least sixmonths before the date selected for transfer, which means that if no such decision has been reached by June 1951, further legislation would be necessary to defer thetransfer beyond 1st January, 1952 the latest date now permitted under the Actas it stands.6. Other considerations affecting the timetable for the transfer which shouldbe borne in mind are (i) The compensation to holders of securities would be fixed by referenceto Stock Exchange quotations early in 1945 or in October 1948 and,notwithstanding the magnetism of those values, the market prices ofthe affected shares before and since the Election have been at premiumsor discounts of up to 20 per cent, on the take-over prices. The longerthe general date of transfer is delayed, the more unreal may the take-over prices, based on 1945 or 1948 quotations, seem to be.(ii) There are about 100 unquoted securities whose value has to be agreed by negotiation or, failing agreement, by arbitration. It is highly desirable to get as many of the values as possible settled by the generaldate of transfer, thus facilitating the prompt issue of compensationstock, but little progress can be made until the companies are convincedthat the Act will be implemented. The negotiations are likely to bemore difficult than in previous nationalisation cases where compensa-tion has been related to market values and they will take time. Ifthere is an interval of only three months between public announcementand transfer the bulk of the unquoted cases are likely to remainunsettled at the date of transfer with the possibility of a situation
arising similar,to that in the case of Gas, where, by reason of a changein the value of gilt-edged, compensation stock, when it came.to beissued, did not have a   for   value with the settled compensationfigures. (This represents, an added argument for a public statementof the Governments intentions being made as soon as a decision toproceed is reached.)(hi.) The current Development Plan for the Steel Industry, which will havecost some  300 million When completed in 1952-53, is now being largely1 : financed from the accumulated reserves and trading profits of theindividual companies, supplemented by loans from the Finance Cor-poration for Industry Limited (F.C.I.) and short-term bank loans.With the Act on the statute book, further monies for developmentcould probably not. be raised on the market and the banks may benervous about incurring additional commitments. It appears that. certain companies may have serious difficulty in making definitearrangements for the additional finance which will be needed to covercommitments they should be undertaking during 1950. In 1951 it isprobable that a larger number of companies will find&apos; their liquid- resources drying up. F.C.I. considers itself already too deeply involvedin steel, and in the absence of a firm public statement by the Govern-ment about their intentions, which would reassure the banks, specialmeans for providing cash for completion of the Development Plan may; be necessary, otherwise development expenditure may be held up.Whatever the date of transfer, a substantial public issue by the Cor-poration of Iron and Steel Stock will be urgently needed.(iv) The longer the transfer is delayed the more awkward may become the;    operation of those provisions of the Act providing for disclaimer ofunusual types of contracts and agreements which have not receivedthe approval of. the Minister of Supply. Relatively little difficulty hasbeen encountered about these cases in the past, but there is now sometendency for cases to be submitted to the Minister for approval whichhave strong justification from the normal commercial standpoint ofthe companies concerned, but which may involve some embarrassment to the Minister in giving or withholding formal approval or to theCorporation in inheriting their results.(v) As the current Development Plan is reaching maturity, considerationought to be given to the next stages. It might be unsound to assume that the industry will proceed as energetically as hitherto with entirely new schemes.ANNEX BRecent Ministerial Statements about the Iron and Steel Act&quot; The Government have therefore decided not to make any approaches, formalor informal, inviting individuals to become members of the Corporation, until we have emerged into the calmer atmosphere that will follow the election of thenew Parliament. I think that right hon. and hon. Members on both sides ofthe House will agree that the success of the nationalised industry will depend to a considerable extent on the calibre of the men serving on the Corporation, andthat it would be folly to rush our selection of these people unnecessarily.&quot;(Minister of Supply, Hansard, 16.11.49, Col. 2047)&quot; The right hon. Gentleman asked me a question with regard to the positionof the Iron and Steel Act. That Act is on the Statute Book. The Corporationcannot be appointed until 1st October, 1950. The earliest date for vesting is1st January, 1951. There is nothing to be done in the matter immediately, butthat statute is on the Statute Book and our purpose is to give effect to Acts passedby Parliament.&quot;(Prime Minister, Hansard, 6.3.50, Col. 66)
&quot; This comes under the proposition of the Leader of file Opposition that weare to take the line that nothing must be done about steel in any circumstancesuntil another General Election has taken place, in order that the steel industryshall be put into a position of security and certainty. That seems to me to be aquaint idea. Who knows how long this Parliament will last? At one point i thought that the Leader of the Opposition believed it might be lasting for sometime. I thought he was a little optimistic. He did not say it, but he began to get into that realm. I suppose that that would be plus the nine months which hesuggested as an addition, and which would leave the industry in a state of uncertainty for quite a long time. There are arguments against that sort of thing.&quot;(Lord President, Hansard 7.3.50, Col. 172)&quot; We have heard from the right hon. Gentleman tha&apos; they do not expect usto abandon our principles and convictions about this matter. It surely cannot bebecause they want us to postpone the setting up of the Corporation or the vestingof the securities, because these things cannot take place until 1st October and1st January at the earliest and, according to the Bill, need not take place until along time afterwards.&quot;(Minister of Supply, Hansard, 9.3.50, Col. 492)&quot; I think the country will in due course judge between the sense of responsi-bility evinced by the Government in the Gracious Speech and the irresponsibilityand the factious manoeuvring in the putting down of these amendments, because there is not the slightest need to have put this Amendment on the Paper. the dates at which the Act comes into operation are a long way ahead. Many oppor-tunities could have been taken, but what the right hon. Gentleman has done isto select a particular occasion which he knows is the equivalent of a Motion of censure, and I understand he proposes to press that to a Division.&quot;(Prime Minister, Hansard, 9.3.50, Col. 591)
