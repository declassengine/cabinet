&apos;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(50) 130 COPY NO. 3^16TH JUNE, 1950CABINETSTATEMENT TO THE HOUSE OF commons on VISIT TO TROOPS IN THE FAR EASTNotw by the Secretary of State for WarI circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the text of a statement which I propose to make to the House on Tuesday,20th June, on the subject of my recent visit to troops in the far east.J.S.War Office, S.W.1,16TH JUNE, 1950.STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONSMr. Speaker - With your permission and that of the House, I desireto make a statement on my recent visit to the troops in Malaya and hong Kong.The House may rest assured that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare taking, and will take, the military measures which prove necessaryto the suppression of the rising in Malaya.     Substantial reinforcementsof land and air forces are arriving and will arrive in Mialaya.I wish to emphasise, however, that the problem is notexclusively a military one.     General Briggs has put into operation aphased programme under which the efforts of the Army, the police and the Civil Administration are being carefully co-ordinated.     One of

the main objects of this programme is to secure that, when the army has restored law and order, adequate forces of the police and civil administration are available to ensure that there is no reversion tobanditry.General Briggs has recently issued a statement warningpublic opinion in the clearest possible terms that this systematicprogramme can have no quick or sudden results.     From their verynature these operations must take a considerable time before theyshow their full fruits.I am glad to be able to tell the House that I found all units ofthe British Army in Malaya showing a most determined spirit.The strain of conducting these most toilsome operations is not alight one, but it is being borne with admirable cheerfulness.     I madea practice of asking each of the National Servicemen with whom Ispoke whether he preferred to do his period of National Service inGreat Britain or in Malaya.     Out of several dozen, all except tworeplied that they preferred to serve in Malaya.I cannot give details of the casualties of all kinds suffered by our Forces, since this information would be of service to the enemy.But the British Army, including Gurkhas, has suffered 15V fatalcasualties since the emergency in Malaya began two years ago.     Itis a bitter thing that any British soldiers have lost their lives as aresult of this rising. ,   It is evidence, however, of the skill and carewith watch the Army has undertaken its constant and arduous patrollingoperations that fatal casualties have been kept down to this figure.I have no doubt that Far Eastern Command is today a well-found force: in respect of weapons, stores and equipment.     Neverthe-less new needs for equipment and new suggestions for weapons aremade from time to time in operations of this sort, and we at the War

Office are doing out utmost to see that these needs and suggestionsare quickly met.     For example, it has been possible in the last fewdays to place an order for a new automatic weapon, the American M2Carbine, which will, it is thought, be of service to the jungle patrols.These weapons should reach Malaya within a matter of weeks.The health of the troops is excellent.     The medicalauthorities assure me that, taking one thing with another, the sick-ness rate was below, rather than above, that of troops in the UnitedKingdom.Amongst many factors affecting the welfare of the tro*ps Icame to the conclusion that the provision of adequate numbers of married quarters took the highest priority of all.     Excellent progress is being made with the provision of these quarters in Singapore and in malaya.     The troops see rapid and extensive building going on andmarried men are aware that, by the first half of 1951, the back of theproblem should be broken.     For various and comprehensible reasonsprogress at Hong Kong has so far not been so rapid;   but we are now taking urgent steps to overcome the very real building problems which arise in that congested area.Finally, it is possible to speak with confidence of the resultof the operations in Malaya for the following reason.     In February, 1948,the Malayan Communist Party decided to undertake an armed uprising.This rising is in no sense a national movement for independencesupported by the people of Malaya.     On the contrary, over much of malaya it has been possible for the authorities to arm the civilpopulation on the largest scale without fear of the arms passing intothe hands of the Communists.     This is surely the acid test of where

the sympathies of the majority of the population lie.     Britishtroops serving in Malaya, their relatives and the nation as awhole may therefore rest assured that we are in no sense attempting to suppress a national movement of the Malayan people seekingindependence.     On the contrary, we are aiding the great majorityof the people of Malaya in preventing a small, but well-armed and well-organised, minority of Communists from seizing power intheir country.
