THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  June 1950SECRET Copy No.CP. (50) 131\9th June, 1950CABINETPENSIONS FOR WIDOWS OF JUDGES AND CERTAIN OTHERJUDICIAL OFFICERSNote by the Lord chancellor circulate herewith a memorandum (L.P. (50) 36) which the Home Secretary,the Secretary of State for Scotland and I brought before the Lord presidents committee on 16th June. This advocates a scheme of pensions for the widows of judges and certain other judicial officers on the lines of the scheme already in force for the widows of Civil Servants.2. The scheme has the support of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on theconditions set out in the memorandum.3. Opinions in the Lord Presidents Committee were divided as to the wisdom of introducing legislation for this purpose at the present time (L.P. (50) 8th Meeting,Minute 1). The subject being in my opinion of very great importance in keepingup the standard of the judiciary, I desire the opinion of the Cabinet upon it.4.   I ask (1) for approval of the scheme in principle;(2) for authority to proceed as set out in the memorandum with a view to legislation.J.House of Lords, S.W. 1,19th June, 1950.38893B
SECRET[L.P. (50) 3625% May, 1950]CABINET__Lord Presidents CommitteePENSIONS FOR WIDOWS OF JUDGES AND CERTAIN OTHERJUDICIAL OFFICERSMemorandum by the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for scotland in the Lord Chancellors memorandum for this Committee on judicial strength(L.P. (50) 12), he referred to the desire among the Judges for a scheme of pensions for their widows. Such a scheme framed on Civil Service lines was worked out by our three Departments in consultation with the Treasury. It is explained anddescribed in some detail (with examples) in the note annexed to this memorandum.2. Here, it is enough to give one example. A Judge whose salary was  2,000a year and who would under the existing law get a pension of  1,333, would underthe proposed scheme have his pension reduced to  1,000. If he retired as a bachelorhe would, in addition, receive a lump sum of  2,000. If he were married when heretired he would forego  1,000 out of his lump sum and in return his wife, if shesurvived him, would get a pension of  333. If he died in harness, a death gratuitywould be due to his estate and if he left a widow she would, in return for a deduction from this gratuity, be entitled to a pension. The pension would be one-third of theamount of the pension to which he would be entitled if he had then retired on theground of ill-health.3. The scheme has, like the Civil Service scheme, been worked out with the help of the Government Actuary, and we are advised that it throws half the coston the Judge and half on the State; but the cost to the State would for many yearsbe small. Payment of lump sums would not increase the total cost of pensions,although it would bring forward a part of that cost to an earlier date. As regardsthe widow&apos;s pension, the Judge&apos;s contribution would be recovered from his lump sum on retirement, while the liability of the State would not arise unless and until hedied leaving a widow. Judges now holding office would have an option whether toaccept the scheme or not.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is in sympathy with the scheme and isprepared to support it on condition that its introduction involves no commitment toincrease judicial salaries, and that the Judges agree to its going forward on thatunderstanding.5. In order to get such an agreement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer would approve of our telling the Judges (a) that there can be no legislation in present circumstances to increase judicialsalaries, and certainly not this Session;(by.that when financial conditions permit, the Government will review judicialsalaries generally.6. We regret very: much that nothing more favourable than this can be saidto the Judges, particularly to the lower-paid Judges, but if we have authority to tell them even so little as this, we have no reason to think that they would not agreeto the scheme for widows&apos; pensions going forward without prejudice to the questionof an increase in judicial salaries.
7. The scheme is intended primarily to cover judicial officers paid from theExchequer, but, subject to consultation with local authorities, it would be desirableto extend it to a few judicial officers paid from local funds: in particular provincialstipendiaries in England and Wales whose pension provisions were equated to those for London stipendiaries by the Justices of the Peace Act, 1949..8. It would be necessary, when introducing the requisite Bill, to inform Par-liament that it was being brought forward, with the concurrence of the Judges, onthe conditions mentioned in paragraph 5 (a) and (b) above. Members would thenbe less likely to hamper the scheme for widows&apos; pensions by pressing for concurrentprovision for increased salaries.We ask (1) for approval of the scheme in principle;(2) for authority to circulate to Judges particulars of the scheme, and to askfor their agreement to the Bill going forward without prejudice to thequestion of an increase in judicial salaries, on the conditions mentionedin paragraph 5 (a) and (b); and(3) if that agreement is forthcoming, for authority to bring the Bill before theLegislation Committee with a view to its introduction this Session.J. :.&quot;J. C. E.H. McN.25th May, 1950.&apos; -annex note on the Proposed Pension Scheme for the Widows of Judges andother Judicial Officers1. The proposed scheme would do for the Judges in one Bill what has beendone for the Civil Service in three Superannuation Acts, one passed in 1909, one in 1935 and one in 1949, but with certain modifications. It is necessary, therefore,to say briefly what has been done for the Civil Service, to mention the modifications,and to give examples of how the proposed scheme would work out.Civil Servants before 19092. Before the Act of 1909, the maximum pension of a Civil Servant wastwo-thirds of the annual salary he was earning when he retired (or, if he waspromoted during his last three years, two-thirds of his average salary during thosethree years). Thus, if during his last three years his salary was  1,500 a year, his pension would be  1,000 a year.Civil Servants after 19353. Under the Act of 1909, the maximum pension of a Civil Servant was to be one-half instead of two-thirds of his salary (or in other words his pension was reduced by one-quarter), but he was to get, on retirement, a lump sum, over and above his pension, called an &quot; additional allowance.&quot; Under the Act of 1935 the pension was to be calculated by reference to the average salary over the three years immediately preceding retirement, instead of to the actual salary on retirement,and the additional allowance was increased. Thus, after 1935, the maximumpension is one-half of average salary and the maximum additional allowance isthree times this reduced pension.4. Thus, taking the example given above, the Civil Servant earning  1,500a year during the last three years of his service and entitled to a maximum pension,would get, instead of a pension of  1,000 a year, a pension of  750 and a lump sum of  2,250. .38893 b 2
5. If he died in harness, after not less than five years&apos; service, his estate wouldbe credited with a lump sum called a &quot;death gratuity,&quot; equal to the additional allowance which would have been paid to him if he retired then, subject to theminimum of one year&apos;s average salary.6. On each occasion Civil Servants then in office were given an option toaccept the new scheme or not. By 1949 nearly all Civil Servants were governed by the system described in paragraph 3. It should be noted that the principle of&quot; averaging &quot;introduced in 1935 is not relevant for the purpose of this note, isincethe judicial officers concerned receive fixed salaries.,7.  The new scheme was calculated to cost the State no more than the oldscheme. : ---u.^:-:&apos;1- &apos;. ^ &apos;y: m*!iF .::-r&apos;::::w.        &apos;--y&amp;m ^-&quot;ii:]-civil Servants&apos; Widows8. Until 1949, the widow of a Civil Servant got no pension. Any benefit she might derive from her husband&apos;s &quot; Death Gratuity &quot; or &quot; Additional Allowance &quot;would only be as a beneficiary under his will or intestacy.9. The Superannuation Act of 1949 introduced for Civil Servants a schemefor providing pensions for widows under which half the cost was to fall on marriedCivil Servants and half on the State, but it was so framed that in the early yearslittle or none of the cost would fall on the State, the amount of the annualcontributions of the Civil Servants being in the aggregate probably larger than theaggregate amount of the pensions payable to widows.10. Civil Servants then in office were given an option whether to accept thescheme or not.11. Under the scheme, a Civil Servant contributes towards the widow&apos;pension, either- v(a) by foregoing one-third of his &quot; additional allowance &quot; (or a portion ofhis &quot; death gratuity &quot;), or(b) by foregoing I  per cent, of his salary every year.In return, if he dies after retirement leaving a widow, she gets a pension equal toone-third of his pension or if he dies in harness leaving a widow, she gets a pensionequal to one-third of the pension which her husband had earned by the date of his death.     ;12. There are certain provisions which are irrelevant for the purpose of this note, whereby -(a) the contributions of the Civil Servant out of salary may have to be supple-mented out of his lump sum in certain cases;ib) certain dependants of the Civil Servant may benefit instead of or inaddition to the widow;-   (c) contributions out of salary may have to be refunded to the Civil Servantin certain circumstances.Scheme for Judges and Judicial Officers13. Judges and Metropolitan Magistrates and most other Judicial Officerssuch as Sheriffs Substitute, Masters and Registrars, are outside the Civil ServiceScheme, and are entitled to receive a pension, but no &quot; additional allowance&quot;when they retire, and are entitled to no gratuity if they die in harness. There is no provision of any sort for their widows.14. Under the proposed scheme, which would be optional for existing office-holders, the pension would be reduced by one-quarter (as under the scheme of1909 for Civil Servants) but they would be entitled on retirement to an &quot; additional allowance,&quot; or on death in harness to a &quot;death gratuity &quot; equal to the &quot; additional allowance &quot; which would be payable on retirement on medical grounds at that time(with a minimum of one year&apos;s salary).15. The maximum &quot;additional allowance &quot; for a bachelor Judge would be asum equal to twice the amount of the reduced pension; In this respect the Judgewould differ from the Civil Servant, whose lump sum is three times the amount
of his pension. The reason is that the usual retiring age for a Judge is seventy-two,while for a Civil Servant it is sixty-five, andj his expectation of life at the retiringage being seven years less, the smaller lump sum is said to be actuarially as valuablefor him as the larger sum for the Civil Servant.16. Thus, the Judge whose salary is  2,000 and who would be entitled, underthe existing law, to a maximum pension of  1,333, would under the proposed scheme, have this pension reduced to  1,000, but his maximum lump sum would,if he retired as a bachelor be  2,000. -17. The Judge who retired as a married man, would under the scheme, pay,as a contribution to the cost of his widOw&apos;s pension, a lump sum equal to theamount of his own pension. This he would do by foregoing half of his lump sumon retirement. In return his wife, if she survived him, would receive a pension equalto one-third of her husband&apos;s pension.18. Thus the Judge whose pension is to be  1,000 would receive on retirementa lump sum of  1,000 and his wife would receive a pension of  333 if she survivedhim.19. The Judge whose wife died during his service would pay a contribution in respect of the period before his wife&apos;s death, during which he had the &quot;insurancecover &quot; provided by the scheme. That contribution would be the same proportionof the full contribution as the period before his wifeV death was of his totalservice.20. Thus the Judge whose pension is to be  1,000 arid whose wife diedexactly half way through his service, would receive on retirement a lump sum of 1,500.21. If the Judge died in harness leaving a widow, his contribution to hiswidow&apos;s pension would be made from his &quot; death gratuity &quot; and his widow would get, at his death, a pension equal to one-third of the pension to which he wouldhave been entitled if he had retired from ill-health.22. If a Judge had earned a pension of  1,000 when he died, leaving a widow, 1,000 would be deducted from his &quot; death gratuity &quot; and his widow would receive a pension of  333.23. If, owing to shorter service, the Judge had earned a smaller pension whenhe died, there would be a proportionate reduction both in his contribution and inhis widow&apos;s pension.24. Some examples are given below of how the scheme would work out inparticular cases.25. This scheme is intended to apply to all Judges in England, Scotland andNorthern Ireland, and to all other Judicial Officers who are outside the scope ofthe Superannuation Act, 1949.26.   The provisions of the proposed Bill may be summarised as follows:  Provide (1) for a pension less by one-quarter than the pension to which the office-holderwould be entitled under the existing law;(2) for an &quot; additional allowance &quot; equal to twice the amount of the reducedpension, payable on retirement;(3) for a &quot; death gratuity &quot; payable on death in harness, of one year&apos;s salaryor the amount of the &quot;additional allowance&quot; earned at the date of death, whichever is the greater;(4) in the case of a. married man, for a deduction from his &quot;additional allow-ance &quot; or &quot; death gratuity &quot; of an amount equal to his pension, if his wife is alive at the date of his retirement or death, and if she is not,a deduction of amount proportional to the period of his service before his wife&apos;s death;(5) for a pension for the widow equal to one-third of the pension which the husband had earned at the date of his retirement or death in harness;(6) for an option for existing holders to retain their existing rights.;.
