CP. (50) 13728th June, 1950CABINETSOAP RATIONINGMemorandum by the Minister of food. There has been a substantial improvement in our supplies of oils and fatsfor making soap during recent months, and I have been considering the possibilityof freeing soap from the ration in line with our general policy of lifting controls which are no longer essential and which are in themselves irksome to the public.I am now satisfied that this improvement in supplies is here to stay-and that I can safely recommend the de-rationing of soap on 10th September.2. There have been discussions with soap manufacturers and with repre-sentatives of the distributive trades, who are strongly of the opinion that soap canbe de-rationed provided there is enough to meet 90 per cent, of pre-war demand(the present ration is equivalent to 80 per cent.). They hold this view becausesoap substitutes, which provide an additional 30 per cent, of detergents, more thanbridge the gap between present and pre-war usage and are expected to continueto satisfy any demand over 90 per cent, of soap. These substitutes are already being accepted largely on their merits.3. This view is borne out by consumer surveys which have been carried outby my Department and by the manufacturers. These reveal that the present soapration is not being taken up fully in some places, although in others, principallyhard water districts, there is still a demand for more soap.4. My recommendation, however, is based on the provision of a supply ofsoap equal to the pre-war quantity. My latest review of the raw material position has made it clear that this quantity of soap can be provided and indeed, can beincreased to 110 per cent, of pre-war if necessary. Moreover, our present stocksof material will permit the building up of buffer stocks to provide shops with anadditional 25 per cent, of soap to meet any rush of buying that may occur at the outset of de-rationing.5. In brief, soap and soap substitutes will be available to the extent of 140per cent, of the pre-war volume, and for the first sixteen weeks after the date of de-rationing up to 165 per cent.6. My first instinct was to increase the soap ration as an interim step, and tode-ration at a later date, and I asked my Department to consider this proposal very carefully. On examination, however, it is clear that in order to get sufficient supplies available in the shops, the earliest date on which an increase in the soap ration couldbe made would be 13th August, and that this would involve postponing de-rationinguntil 31st December at the earliest. Apart from the undesirable delay if we adoptedthis course, there is also the consideration that an increase in the ration would onlyemphasise the mal-distribution of soap. Some areas would still get less than they need, while others would get more, and in such circumstances stocks would be38936THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

likely to ace imulate locally, leading to inevitable criticism of the delay in de-rationing. I am therefore convinced that de-rationing on 10th September is theproper course to take, as this is the only way of ensuring that the varying needsC C    of different households and different areas can be fully met.^ 1*7. Manufacturers will require at least two months to produce additional supplies of soap and distribute them to wholesalers and retailers. I propose, there-fore, that the announcement of the de-rationing of soap should be made as soon aspossible.8. It will be possible for me to make further staff economies as a result of de-rationing soap, and I expect to be able to dispense with about 400 people at a saving of about  140,000 a year.M.
