NEW HEBRIDESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations and the Minister of state . A proposal, reproduced in the annex to this memorandum, has beenreceived from the Australian Government that they should take over the UnitedKingdom responsibilities in the Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides.In the following paragraphs we set out the background to this proposal, and recommend its acceptance in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government. We invitethe Cabinet to endorse the recommendations contained in the two final paragraphs of the memorandum.general. The New Hebrides are a chain of about 80 islands, 550 miles long and 5,700square miles in area lying about 1,400 miles to the east of the Australian mainland.The main production is copra, of which about 23,000 tons are produced annually,all of which is at present exported to France. Cocoa, coffee and timber are pro-duced on a small scale.3. According to latest estimates the population consists of 330 british nationals (nearly all Australian), 950 French, 45,000 natives (Melanesians) and 1,760Indo-Chinese coolies.A dministration4. In 1906 the British and French Governments established a Condominiumover the group by a Convention which, after operating unsatisfactorily for 8 years,was replaced by the present Protocol in 1914. Under the terms of this Protocolthe Group forms a region of joint influence, each Power retaining sovereignty over its own nationals and financing its own administration, while certain joint services,e.g., public works and public health, are administered by the Condominium Govern-ment and financed from local taxation. The Group is divided into districts whereFrench and British Agents operate jointly, while the Condominium Services arestaffed by British and French officers on a basis agreed locally. Should the condominium be unable to raise the necessary finance locally the MetropolitanGovernments are required to contribute jointly to balance the Condominiumbudget and this was in fact done in the years 1932 to 1936.5. Since its inception, the working of the Condominium has proved unsatis-factory. The French Government has continually pursued a policy designed to benefit, often exclusively; its own nationals, especially its planters, who have beenassisted with finance and by the importation of Asiatic labour, while the british interests has steadily waned, partly owing to the shortage of labour, which caused a number of British planters to sell their estates between the two wars. Further,the funds made available by the United Kingdom Government to the british administration have been on a strictly limited basis. (The Condominium does not qualify for assistance under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts.) But the38924 &apos; this  DOCUMENT  is   THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;8   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1950SECRET Copy.No.    32CP. (50) 13626th June, 1950CABINET
real reason for the unsatisfactory working of the Condominium is to be found inthe very different policies pursued by the two Powers in the administration of thearea.Jvjfj     Previous Attempted Solutions6. The Imperial Conference of 1923 decided, in view of the increasingdifficulties of joint administration, to open negotiations in due course with theFrench Government with a view to partition, but in 1926 the French Governmentsharply rejected this proposal. In 1926 a Commission of Enquiry, consisting ofan Englishman, an Australian and a New Zealander, was appointed to reporton the deteriorating position of the British planters, many of whom were sellingtheir estates to the French. The Commission advised that only the importationof Chinese labour would enable the British planters to carry on, but this recom-mendation, though acceptable to Australia and New Zealand, was rejected bythe United Kingdom Government, which made the counter-suggestion that theAustralian Government might take over the British responsibility. This invitationthe Australian Government refused on the grounds that it would provide no solution to the difficulties being experienced.7. British withdrawal, subject to certain guarantees and, if possible, territorialor financial compensation, was approved by the Imperial Conference of 1930 asthe only available solution, but the worsening financial position of the Condo-minium, which precluded any possibility of obtaining any compensation from theFrench Government, led the United Kingdom Government in 1932 to decide to postpone making any approach to the French Government first until 1934 andthen again until 1939.8. The question was reopened by the Australian Government at the ImperialConference in 1937 when they indicated that they were now prepared to take overthe United Kingdom responsibility in the group. This offer commended itself tothe then Colonial and Dominions Secretaries, but no action was taken at the timebecause a general European colonial settlement was then also under consideration,and the British share in New Hebrides might have been a useful bargaining counterin the event of concessions being required from the French Government.9. During the war the New Hebrides became an important base in operations against the Japanese, and the Australian Government proclaimed their specialstrategic interest in the group on several occasions.Post-war developments10. Since the war the group has become prosperous financially owing to thehigh price of copra and the wealth brought to the islands by Allied troops.Differences between the British and French authorities for the reasons given inparagraph 5 above, and the cramping effect of the 1914 Protocol, particularlyin such matters as those referred to in the next paragraph, have impeded progress with the result that the Condominium administration has been increasingly unableto handle effectively the greater responsibility now devolving on Colonial powers for the advancement of native peoples. Neither the European nor native popula-tions are associated in the government of the group through representativeinstitutions, nor is such association possible under the existing Protocol. Verylittle has been done by the Condominium Government to promote the socialadvancement of the native population and the possibility of international criticism of the present state of affairs cannot be overlooked.11. In 1947 the then Colonial Secretary directed that an attempt should bemade to revise the L914 Protocol in order to remedy its more glaring deficiencies,in particular with regard to the status of the natives, the labour regulations and theabsence of any declared policy of political progress. The proposed revisions havenow been sent to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific for his comments(the Governments of Australia and New Zealand being kept informed) with aview to discussions with the French in due course. The High Commissioner^comments have not yet been received, but he has previously expressed the view,with which we are in agreement, that^ though it may be possible to &quot; whitewash &quot;the Protocol, this will not make any joint administration a satisfactory proposition.12. In 1949 the French Government outlined proposals for an Anglo-FrenchDevelopment Plan to be financed jointly by the two Powers, and it is clear that
should the British responsibility be retained some such plan will have to be imple-mehted at a cost estimated at perhaps  200,000 to the United Kingdom, in additionto the annual cost of the British services (about  50,000) directly borne by theUnited Kingdom taxpayer. It is apparent that compared to his outlay in otherparts of the Colonial Empire, the United Kingdom taxpayer obtains a very poorreturn in the New Hebrides: United Kingdom interests derive virtually no benefit from the expenditure and the benefits secured by the natives are not very great.Recent A ustralian Proposals13. At the Colombo Conference in January 1950, Mr. Spender, theAustralian Minister for External Affairs, proposed to the then Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations that Australia should take over the British responsi-bility and asked that Australia should be associated in any discussions with theFrench Government on the revision of the Protocol. The reasons given for theseproposals were the Australian strategic interest in the group and the desire to putinto effect a plan for the development of the land (some 40,000 acres) owned bythe Australian Government. Mr. Spender&apos;s letter is reproduced in the appendix to this memorandum.Possible courses of action14. It is evident, even apart from the present Australian proposals, thatpositive action must now be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to remedy thepresent unsatisfactory state of Condominium. The alternatives appearto be as follows: -(1) To continue on the present basis, but subject to a fundamental revision ofthe Protocol. The agreement of the French Government would, ofcourse, have to be obtained and if this course is adopted additionalf expenditure on a development plan on the lines adopted in other colonial territories can hardly be avoided. Although the BritishGovernment would probably be required to contribute pari passu withthe French, the principal advantages of development would probablyaccrue to the French planters. The difficulties in preparing, agreeingand carrying out such a plan would be considerable. In any case a revision of the Protocol would not remove the great practical difficultiesof operating the Condominium.(2) To re-examine the possibility of a partition of the group. It is most unlikely that this proposal would be acceptable to the French Govern-ment. They would in any case claim the major islands, which havebeen principally developed by French nationals and which contain theonly harbours in the group.(3) To terminate the Condominium and transfer the entire responsibility tothe French Government. Though this would provide a solution tothe present administrative difficulties, it would probably not be accept-able to the Australian Government for strategic reasons and it wouldbe opposed by Australian residents and missions. Tt would also belikely to arouse political criticism in this country. Above all, any transfer of territory to a foreign country, based on the ground ofcontiguity of other territory belonging to that country, would constitute a dangerous precedent because it could be quoted against us in otherconnections.(4) To accept the proposals recently put forward by the Australian Govern-ment-In view of the fact that the New Hebrides lie within theAustralian defence area, that the Commonwealth interest in the group is almost exclusively Australian, and that for geographical reasons theAustralian Government are in a better position than the UnitedKingdom to administer the group and recruit the personnel required,we favour the acceptance of these proposals. The Chiefs of Staffconsider that from the point of view of defence there is no objectionto the proposed transfer of responsibility. The High Commissionerfor the Western Pacific has said that in view of the very primitive stage of development of the native population, it would be impossible forthem to form an opinion on the question of transfer even if it were practicable to consult them on the matter; it is not, in any case, thoughtthat they would raise any objection. For this reason, and in the absence38924 b 2
of any specific pledges made to the native inhabitants, it is not thoughtthat the proposed transfer would seriously&apos;prejudice the UnitedKingdom Governments position vis-a-vis the South African Govern-ment in the South African High Commission territories. There are notthe same general political objections, domestically or internationally,to a transfer of responsibility in respect of a territory from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom to His Majesty V Government in another Commonwealth country as exist to a transfer of responsibility to a foreign country. It is true that the Australian Government would; -be faced with great difficulty, as we have been and are, in operatingthe Condominium, but they are nevertheless anxious to relieve us ofa difficult burden and we should, of course, let them know frankly whatthe present position is and give them all the help that we can in any future discussions with the French.15. In our opinion the principal difficulties in accepting the AustralianGovernmenfs proposal are:(1) The Attitude of the French Government.-The French have from time totime complained that United Kingdom interests in the New Hebridesare so few that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not appear to take muchinterest in the islands and are not prepared to do much to develop them.Nevertheless, the French might well, take the line that if the UnitedKingdom were to abandon its share in the Condominium, France shouldtake over the whole of the administration. They would be able to point to the preponderance of French interests in the islands in justification of such a proposal. Against this, the argument of the general Australianinterest in the area and of Australian responsibility for the defence ofthe islands could be advanced. An agreement with the French wouldbe required substituting Australia for the United Kingdom for the pur-poses of the Condominium Agreement. A request to the French toamend the Condominium Agreement in this sense would give them anopportunity to propose other amendments or possibly the terminationof the Agreement. In any case, full consultations with the FrenchGovernment would be necessary before the Australian proposal couldbe finally accepted.(2) The International Aspects. There is a danger that any proposal to makea major change in the administration of the New Hebrides might focusinternational attention on the islands and lead to pressure for an inter-national solution to the problem. The New Hebrides are non-self-governing territories for the purpose of Article 73 (e) of the united nations Charter, under which His Majesty&apos;s Government submit tech-nical information on such territories to the United Nations. It wouldbe unfortunate if international attention were to be focused on theNew Hebrides Protocol, which is a very archaic instrument.Although these considerations should be borne in mind, they neednot be considered over-riding. The importance of the former can onlybe assesesd after discussions with the French have been instituted.Recommendations16.   We therefore recommend (1) that the Australian Governmenfs proposals should be accepted in principle;(2) that in informing the Australian Government of this decision we shouldmake it clear to them that no change in the Condominium, which isbased on a Protocol jointly signed with the French Government andHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, can be made without negotiating a new agreement with the French Governmentwhich would give the latter an opportunity to propose other amendmentsor even the termination of the agreement ;(3) that the Australian Government should be invited to discuss their proposalsconfidentially with us and that we should apprise them fully of thepresent position in the Condominium, of the British commitments forwhich we should require; them to become responsible, and of our viewson how the weaknesses of the existing form of government might be-  reduced ; - v&apos;
(4) that at the same time we should enquire of the Australian government whether they see any objection to our making an early confidentialapproach to the French Government to ascertain their reactions, with aview to possible eventual tripartite discussions.17. If the above recommendations are agreed it would also be desirable forthe New Zealand Government to be informed about them. This could either bedone by the United Kingdom Government or the Australian Government.J. G.P. C. G.-W. *&apos;K. G. Y.26th June, 1950.annex copy OF LETTER FROM AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR EXTERNALAFFAIRSColombo,My dear Noel-Baker, 14th January, 1950You will remember that I raised with you the other day the question of theNew Hebrides and mentioned that the Australian Government would be interestedin taking over the United Kingdom share in the Condominium.As you are probably aware, the Australian Government has title to a good dealof land in the New Hebrides (I do not know the exact extent of it, but I believe it isin the vicinity of 40,000 acres), and our desire to put into effect a plan for develop-ment of this land, coupled with&quot; our close interest in the New Hebrides from a strategic point of view, lead me to try to ascertain what the views of the UnitedKingdom Government might be on the proposition that British administration under the Condominium protocol should become the responsibility of the AustralianDepartment of External Territories.The idea is of course not a new one. Successive Australian Governments havebeen interested in it and I believe it was tentatively discussed with the UnitedKingdom Government about fifteen years ago, at which time your Governmentwas thought to be not unfavourably disposed to withdrawing from the Condominiumin favour of Australia. You will recollect that in November of last year youinstructed your High Commissioner at Canberra to inform the Australian Govern-ment that the United Kingdom Government had under consideration revision ofthe New Hebrides protocol in order to bring it into line with the international obligations undertaken by the British and French Governments during recent yearsand to make it a more workable basis for joint administration. The High Com-missioner was instructed to ask whether Australia was agreeable. The reply of the then Prime Minister concurred in the proposal to discuss the Condominium protocolwith the French Government but suggested that it might be useful for the UnitedKingdom, New Zealand and Australian Governments to consider whether it was worth while exploring with the French Government some more drastic solution,such as the entire elimination of the joint administration structure.I do not know how far any talks with the French Government contemplatingrevision of the protocol may have gone. I believe your High Commissioner at canberra intimated that we would be informed of the detailed proposals for revisionas soon as they were completed and before they were put to the French. We shall,of course, be very interested in seeing them. In the meantime, however, I should be grateful if on your return to London you would discuss informally with your colleagues, and particularly the Secretary of State for the Colonies, my suggestion of Australian participation.in the administration of the New Hebrides. I should like to put my suggestion in the form of three propositions:  (a) That whether the Condominium is to be maintained in existing or revisedform, or is to be replaced by some other form of administration, theAustralian Government should assume the responsibility hitherto borneby the United Kingdom Government;
(b) That the Australian Government should be directly associated in any dis-cussions with the French Government for revision of the protocol;(c) That the discussions with the French Government should not be confinedmerely to ways of revising the protocol, but should also explore other possible means by which the New Hebrides might be administered in a workable fashion without detriment to the interests of either adminis-tering Government.(One possible course that has occurred to us is that the area might be divided alongan agreed line and the two portions administered separtely.)I shall look forward to receiving from you in due course the reactions of yourCabinet colleagues.Yours sincerely,P. C. SPENDER.
