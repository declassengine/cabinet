/ 210BIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(50) 150 COPY NO. T 2-30TH JUNE, 1950* CABINETSCOTTISH affairs memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. In accordance with the arrangements made when my previous papers on Scottish Affairs (C. P. (50) 101 and C. P. (50) 107) were discussed on 15th and 18thMay (CM. (50) 31st Conclusions, Minute 4(1) and CM. (50) 32nd Cpnclusions,Minute 8(l)) I met representatives of the Scottish National Assembly in Glasgowon 17th June.   I was accompanied by my Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretaries.The deputation was headed by Councillor Robert Gray, one of the Vice-Chairmen of the so-called &quot;Commissioners&quot;.   It included only three of theother fourteen &quot;Commissioners&quot;, along with three other representatives of themovement.2. The deputation stressed the fact that they were seeking, notseparation from England, but a Scottish Parliament for domestic affairs;and they referred to Northern Ireland and other Darts of the commonwealth in which domestic Parliaments are operating without difficulty.    They pressedme to say what action the Government would take following the report of theproposed committee of enquiry into financial and economic relationships between the two countries, but emphasised that its findings would in no wayinfluence their own views as to the need for a Scottish Parliament.This need, they claimed, had been recognised in the past by leading membersof the Labour Party.    So far, the deputation said, the &quot;Covenant&quot; movement hadnot sought to make the home rule issue a political one;   but if the government did not accede to their representations they would be forced to take politicalaction.3. The deputation added tnat while they had been very glad to meet me itwas still their wish to be received by the Prime Minister.4. I made it clear to the deputation that it was impossible to anticipate the outcome of the enquiry into financial and economic relationships, but Iassured them that the findings of the  Committee would be published.    I did notcomment otherwise on their representations but I undertook to report what theyhad said to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.5. At the close of the meeting the deputation handed me copies of the questionnaire which is appended to this memorandum as Appendix I,    It is evidentlytheir intention to press the Government and all Scottish Members of Parliament to answer the questions contained in it.   If it becomes necessary to make a statement on the subject, I suggest that we should adhere to the line which we havealready taken in Parliament, namely that the issues involved are much toocomplicated to be dealt with by way either of simple questions and answers ofthe kind contained in the questionnaire, or of a plebiscite;   and that any proposalfor constitutional change in this country falls to be considered and settled bythe normal processes of Parliamentary democracy.

6. In Appendix II is a copy of a Question by Mr. Grimond which is down for answer on Tuesday, 4th July, about my meeting with the deputation on1 &apos;&apos;th June, together with a copy of the Answer that I am proposing to give.H.McN.Scottish Office, S. W. 1, ,30TH JUNE, 1950.
