el si[THIS DOOUMBKT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT)S E ORE TG. P. (50)  107 COPY NO.16TH MAY,  1950CABINETSCOTTISH affairs memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland at their meeting on 15th May (CM. (50) 31stConclusions, Minute k(2)) the Cabinet invited me to submit amemorandum indicating the composition of the Committee pro-posed in my memorandum of 11th May,  1950 (CP. (50)  101) toexamine the practicability of producing a return of Scottishrevenue and expenditure and an economic balance sheet forScotland.Plainly any committee appointed to carry out this enquiry should consist of members of high standing and obviousimpartiality.      Equally they should be capable of moving withease and familiarity in the subject matter which the committeewill have to handle.Lord Macmillan tempts me as a Chairman.      He wouldbe well received and would deal fairly and thoroughly with the issues involved,      I realise that his health (and perhaps hisage - he is seventy-seven) may prevent him from accepting theappointment.      In that event consideration might be&apos; given toLord Catto, formerly Governor of the Bank of England, a Scotwho has great experience of banking, commerce and public administration.      A third possibility might be Lord Patrick,an outstanding Judge of the Court of Session.As regards members, I think we ought to have four or five persons with special experience of financial and economic matters.      I would suggest the following from Scotland:-Mr. A.K.   Oairncross, formerly economic adviser to theBoard of Trade,  recently appointedProfessor of Applied Economics inthe University of Glasgow;Sir John M. Erskine, General Manager of the CommercialC.3.E. , Bank of Scotland,  and Chairman ofthe  Scottish Savings Committee;    andSir John v.   Imrie,      City Chamberlain of Edinburgh.n  &apos;o  t?From England I would suggest:-Mr.  W.F.,  Crick, a Director of the Midland Bank andChairman of the recent Committee onForm of Government Accounts:    andSir Horace Hamilton, formerly Permanent Under-Secretary o:G. C. B. , &apos; State for Scotland;    also has exten-sive knowledge of the work of the boards of Inland Revenue and of customs and Excise,  of the Board ofTrade and of the Treasury. .

In additions I would suggest the inclusion of agood trade unionist from ScotlandMr.  J. T.  Byrne, Clyde District Secretary of the confederation of Shipbuilding and engineering Unions, andan industrialist chosen in consultation with theFederation of British Industries.The Committee should consist of a Chairman pluseight members, making it, apart from the Chairman, fourScots and four English^      The Treasury, I suggest,  should find another English representative with, for preference,wide experience in governmental finance.      A woman might perhaps be found for this vacancy.I think that a Committee composed on these lines would be regarded in Scotland as both authoritative and impartial and that its findings would command respect.II. McN.Scottish Office,  S.W.116TH MAY,  1950.
