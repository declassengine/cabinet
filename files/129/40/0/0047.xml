HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 14730TH JUNE, 1950COPY NO.CABINETFISH: ENCOURAGEMENT OF SALESMemorandum by the Minister of food at their meeting on 27th June (C.M.(50) 39th Conclusions,Minute 2(3)), the Cabinet invited me, after consultation with theMinisters concerned with public services, to submit proposals for increasing the consumption of fish in this country.2. In the short time available, my Department has consulted the Ministry of Health and the War Office and has considered sugges-tions that the Ministry of Food should encourage the. sale of fish by undertaking an advertising campaign and by trying, on behalf of thetrade, to stimulate sales to the Services and to State hospitals.3.     Advertising CampaignAt various times during the past ten years when the Ministryof Food controlled fish prices and was responsible for distribution,it engaged in publicity to press sales of fish.     Many other foods werescarce and the view taken - and I think quite rightly - was that in thesecircumstances it was the business of the Government to point out theuseful and nourishing substitute in fish, and that it was being sold at&apos;controlled prices and fairly distributed.&quot;When freedom was restored to the trade, the question was raised whether the Ministry should continue this form of publicity.Campaigns of this kind by the Ministry of Food have now a much more limited value than they had, but what also was in question was whetherit was now appropriate to expend public money on assisting privatetraders in their business.     This was no new principle;   it had, forexample, come up before on fruits and vegetables.     There is indeedno reason why, if the Government undertakes such tasks as these, itshould stop at fish.     If fish, why not other foods or any other productwhich the producers are having difficulty in selling?This policy was stated at a meeting on 26th January ofrepresentatives of the Ministry of Food and the Fisheries departments and of representatives of the leading Associations of Producers andDistributors (including fish friers) of white fish.     The Ministry&apos;sargument was accepted without criticism, and the delegates agreedthat each section of the industry should prepare a statement of itsviews on publicity.     At a further meeting, on 10th May, the represen-tative of the British Trawlers1 Federation, which conducted a large and very successful publicity campaign between the wars, said that theFederation was working on plans for another campaign.     If it were accepted, the Federation would consult with various sections of thetrade with a view to co-ordinated action.

It seems to me to be clearly right in principle that this is a responsibility which the industry can be expected to take, and are apparently ready to take.     Certainly in practice they would be moreskilled:   they alone have the means to ensure that their performancewill be related to the needs of the various sections of the trade and intune with their propaganda.I feel that the stimulation of fish consumption by advertisingis a long term matter, and it has of course been recommended as a function of the proposed Commission.4.     Consumption of fresh fish by the services the Army rationing scale for troops stationed at homeprovides for a consumption of b  V6 ozs.   offish per head per headper week, filleted weight;   this is exclusive of herrings, kippers,bloaters and canned fish.     The average civilian consumption for allfish, other than canned fish, is now 7 to 8 ozs. per week, filletedweight.     In addition troops obtain a certain quantity of fish throughN.A.A.F.I. canteens.     Each unit also receives a cash allowance(5-fd. per head per day) for expenditure on food;   very little of this is spent on fish;   it goes mostly on manufactured meats, pickles andsauces.Fried fish is the most popular form of fish in the Army, andthe War Office point out that consumption is therefore governed tosome extent by the allowance of fat.     On the other hand, even if thefat allowance were unlimited, it is doubtful whether fish consumption would be substantially increased.     Certainly it is the case that fatsupplies are not now responsible for holding back sales of fried fishto civilians;   for some time past fish friers have not taken up their full fat allocation.     The War Office go on to point out that extra fishcould be eaten only at the expense of other foods, and that the dietmight become unbalanced.     It seems doubtful whether the troops would stand for much more fish, a view which is borne out by the low expend-iture on fish out of the cash allowance.In view of the opinion of the War Office, and of the fact thatthe Army&apos;s present consumption of fish compares very favourably withthat of the general public, it does not seem that increased consumption in the Army can make any material contribution to the off take of whitefish.     I think that to try to force more fish on to soldiers than they are ready to accept would be bad policy and might serve the industry ill inthe long term.     To give National Service soldiers a surfeit of fish might prejudice their consumption of fish when they return to civilian life.5.     The HospitalsThe Ministry of Health have agreed to ask their DieticianAdvisers who visit hospitals to draw the attention of the hospitalstaffs to the present abundant supplies of fish and to encourage-2-

increased consumption. They consider that this approach will prove more effective than, for example, the issue of a circular.6. My Department will, of course, continue to mention fishas part of its general food advice service.     I fear, however, thatthere is little more that my Department can do to increase consump-tion, and that it must be left to the trade to improve the quality oftheir product and to make its purchase by the public a more attractive proposition.M.W.Ministry of Food, S.W.1,30TH JUNE, 1950.
