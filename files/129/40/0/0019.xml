(2Lo^d , i/t/s. (8-this  document  is  the  property  op  his  britannic   majesty&apos;s   governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1950SECRET Copy No. 3 2C.P. (50) 11926th May, 1950CABINETCANADIAN WHEAT AND FLOURMemorandum by Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations, and the Minister of food. On 15th May the Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of Food(CP. (50) 98) and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (50)102) on the line to be taken by the United Kingdom representatives in the dis-cussions with Mr. C. D. Howe, the Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce, whowas then about to arrive in this country to discuss the future purchase of canadian wheat and flour by the United Kingdom. The Cabinefs decision (CM. (50)31st Conclusions, Minute 1) was that the negotiations should be confined to pro-posed purchases of wheat and flour, that the United Kingdom Government shouldbe prepared to agree to buy all their dollar wheat requirements in 1950-51 (104million bushels) in Canada, that negotiations as to price should commence at theminimum price under the International Wheat Agreement, but the negotiatorsshould be free to go above this minimum, and that the price eventually agreed should be regarded as meeting any Canadian claims under clause 2 (b) of theexisting Wheat Contract. We now circulate, for the information of our colleagues,,the following account of the negotiations that have taken place.2. It soon became clear in the course of our discussions that the Canadiansdid not want to negotiate on prices now, but were anxious to have an assurance that we would buy a fixed quantity (they said they hoped for about i20 million bushels, i.e., 3,215,000 tons) from Canada in 1950-51, for which we should paywhatever might be the ruling price under the International Wheat Agreement atthe time of shipment.3. We explained that we could not enter into a binding commitment onquantity unless there was to be an equally definite understanding on the price to bepaid. The Canadians, moreover, took the view that the price of wheat sold underthe International Wheat Agreement in 1950-51 was likely to be at or near themaximum permitted under the Agreement, whereas our view was that the exportsurplus of wheat in North America was likely to be so large in relation to thedemand that the price ought to be nearer the minimum than the maximum.4. In the light of the wide difference of view between the two sides on theprice question, and our unwillingness to enter into any commitment without adefinite agreement on prices, the Canadians abandoned their request for a definitecommitment on the part of the United Kingdom to buy a fixed quantity of wheat and flour, and concentrated on obtaining the best assurances possible as to thequantity we would be likely to take from them. They appeared to recognise theforce of the charges that might be made by the United States of unfair discrimina-tion and of a contravention of the spirit of the International Wheat Agreement ifthe United Kingdom undertook in advance to buy Canadian wheat in preference to United States wheat whatever their relative prices might be.5.   We were ready to meet Canada&apos;s desire for an assurance of our intentions,provided it was expressed in such a way as to make clear that we could only buyCanadian wheat and flour if they were offered at fully competitive prices, and we38792:
finally reached a solution in the form of an agreed record of the outcome of our discussions and an agreed announcement to be made by both Governments. the texts of the record and the proposed announcement are appended to thismemorandum.6. It will be seen that we have entered into no quantitative commitment.to buy Canadian wheat or flour, but have, in effect, expressed the hope that Canadawill offer us wheat and flour on such competitive terms that we shall be able tojustify on commercial grounds the taking of all the dollar wheat and flour we requirein 1950-51 from Canada.7. We hope the Canadian Government will accept these arrangements, whichwe believe are satisfactory to the United Kingdom; but we recognise that they may find difficulty in doing so, especially in accepting our proposal (which we regard as an essential part of the whole settlement) for the final liquidation of any Canadianclaims under clause 2 (b) the &quot; have regard to &quot; clause of the existing contract.For the present we can only await the Canadian Cabinefs reply, which we expectwill be given soon after Whitsuntide.R. S. C.26th May, 1950.P. C. G.-W.M. W.APPENDIXUNITED KINGDOM/CANADIAN WHEAT TALKS, MAY  1950Agreed Record of a Meeting in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Room in theHouse of Commons at 2-30 p.m. on Monday, 22nd May, 1950Present:United KingdomChancellor of the Exchequer (in the chair).Secretary of State for commonwealth relations.Minister of State for Economic Affairs.Minister of Food.:Sir Percivale Liesching.Sir Henry Wilson Smith.Sir Frank Lee.Mr. A. E. Feavearyear.CanadaMr. C. D. Howe.Mr. L. B. Pearson.Mr. L. D. Wilgress.Mr. Norman A. Robertson.Mr. M. W. Mackenzie.Mr. G. A. Mclvor.Secretary: Mr. F. Hollins.1. The meeting considered the following three questions in the light of thediscussions that had taken place since Friday, 19th May:  (a) The quantity of wheat to be bought by the United Kingdom from canadian  the crop year 1950-51.(b) The proportion of the quantity at (a) which the United Kingdom wouldtake in the form of flour.(c) The final settlement of any questions still outstanding under clause 2 (b)(the &quot; have regard to &quot; clause) of the United Kingdom/Canada contract of 1946.2.   The Conclusions reached on these three subjects were as follows:  (a) The United Kingdom an 1 Canadian Governments would both make agreedannouncements on the results of the conversations in the terms of the
statement at Annex A. The United Kingdom Government would haveno objection to Mr. Howe stating publicly on his return to Canada,if he considered it desirable, that he thought it reasonable to assume that in 1950-51 Canada would be able to sell to the United kingdom at competitive International Wheat Agreement prices somewherebetween 100-120 million bushels of wheat. This quantity would includethe carry-over of 12-5 million bushels bought under the terms of thefour-year Contract. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would also beprepared to make a public statement to the effect that the UnitedKingdom Government hoped that they would be able to meet their requirements for dollar wheat from their traditional market in Canadawithin the International Wheat Agreement, and that this should bepossible provided that such wheat could be purchased on terms as to price, quality and position not less favourable than those obtained byany other buyer in the dollar market whether in the United States ofAmerica or in Canada.(b) As part of its purchases of Canadian wheat in the crop year 1950-51the United Kingdom would agree to take 300,000 tons of flour, pro-vided that it could be purchased on terms not less favourable as to price and quality than those obtained by any other buyer of flour inthe dollar market, whether in the United States or Canada. TheUnited Kingdom representatives made it clear that the purchase of300,000 tons in 1950-51 would be without prejudice to a possible lowerscale of purchase in 1951-52.(c) The United Kingdom Government was anxious not to be represented as having given assurances regarding wheat purchases in 1950-51 inreturn for the waiver of a claim by Canada under the &quot; have regard to &quot;clause. The United Kingdom expected to make large purchases ofwheat from Canada in any event. Nevertheless, in the context of these discussions, the United Kingdom representatives felt that it would be reasonable that all obligations under the &quot; have regard to &quot; clause mightbe considered to have been taken care of. Mr. Howe said that this wasa matter which could only be settled by the Canadian Cabinet on his return.3. It was agreed that final confirmation of the results of these discussions andthe issue of the proposed statements referred to above should be deferred until theCanadian Government had had time to consider the matters under discussion inthe light of the report which Mr. Howe would be making to them.ANNEX a canadian WheatMr. C. D. Howe, Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce, has helddiscussions in London with United Kingdom Ministers on the subject of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s wheat requirements in the crop year 1950-51 within the framework ofthe International Wheat Agreement.Both Governments have now reviewed the results of those talks. They are agreed that the International Wheat Agreement removes the need for a contract to replace the existing Anglo-Canadian Wheat Agreement which expires at the endof next month.The United Kingdom Government has made it clear that, out of its total wheatimport requirements in 1950-51, it expects to buy a large proportion in Canadawhich, quite apart from the special contractual arrangements for the past fouryears, is, and it is hoped will remain, the traditional source of supply for the UnitedKingdom. The Canadian Government, for its part, is satisfied that Canadian wheatgrowers will continue to find in the United Kingdom a market for a very substantial part of their exportable wheat.London, 23rd May, 1950.
