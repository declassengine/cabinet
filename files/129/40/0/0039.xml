&quot; 1        piHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y &apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 139 COPY NO.   OqC26TH JUNE, 1950CABINETPROPOSAL TO RE-ESTABLISH A WHALING BASEON DECEPTION ISLANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies at their meeting on 20th June (E.P.C.(50) 1 6th Meeting,Minute 2) the Economic Policy Committee gave some consideration tothe extent to which it might be desirable for United Kingdom Depart-ments to buy Colonial products at prices which in the initial stageswere slightly higher than the world price.2. A particular case on which a decision is urgently desirednow arises in connection with the Falkland Islands.3. Briefly it is politically important to strengthen our claims in the Antarctic and to do all that we can to rebut the Argentine claims.Deception Island, where there are already both British and Argentinemeteorological bases, is regarded as the key to the Antarctic part ofthe Falkland Islands Dependencies.     Our position and legal title wouldbe greatly strengthened if the British land-based whaling station which existed, until some years before the war could be re-established there.United Whalers and the Colonial Development Corporation are preparedto undertake this at a cost of about  1^ million if they can be given along-term contract to buy their whale oil at an assured price.4. They ask that the Ministry of Food should enter into a six-year contract with the Colonial Development Corporation beginning with the whaling season after next and continuing for five yearsthereafter.     Under this contract the Ministry of Food would under-take to buy annually up to a maximum of 10,000 tons of whale oil fromthe output of the land station on Deception Island at a minimum price of 75 per ton (in bulk ex ship at United Kingdom ports) for the first three years and  70 per ton for the second three years.     Should themarket price, i.e. the price the Ministry would be paying for whale oil to other producers, be below this minimum price in any year, themaximum quantity which the Ministry of Food were obliged to buywould be reduced in proportion the following year.5. A contract on these lines is the minimum that the companies would require.     On commercial grounds the Ministry of Food wouldnot feel justified in accepting such a proposal.     They would at themost be prepared to enter into a contract under which the output of thestation would be bought each year at a price the same as that paid forwhale oil to other producers,     They take this view because they believethat during the period of the contract whale oil prices will fall below their present level.     This year the Ministry of Food have been able to

buy at  80 a ton, while some foreign countries are paying rather morethan this.     But this level of prices may not be maintained.     TheMinistry estimate that, while in the initial two years of the contractthe market price is likely to be at or above the minimum, by the fifth and sixth years it might fall as low as  50.     If this happened,a contract on the terms proposed would involve a loss of  425,000.On the other hand, if the price of whale oil were to remain near itspresent level the contract would show no loss at all.6. It is obviously difficult to forecast the course of prices for years ahead.     Expectations of a decline in the world prices of oils and fats have been so often falsified in recent years that they may wellbe falsified again.     Nevertheless the Minister of Food feels, and I agree, that the contract goes too far beyond the bounds of commercialjustification for him to enter into it without reference to his colleagues.7. I therefore ask my colleagues to authorise him to enter intothe contract, the justification for any non-commercial element in it being the political advantages which it will bring.     It will also havethe advantage of assuring us of an additional sterling source ofsupply.     From the accounting angle, I understand that if the position was explained to the Comptroller and Auditor General and, ifnecessary, the Public Accounts Committee, difficulties need not beexpected.8. I regret the late submission of this paper but the companies have stated that if a whole whaling season is not to be lost, they s \ould be informed of the decision by the end of June at the latest.J.G.Colonial Office, S.W.1,26TH JUNE, 1950.
