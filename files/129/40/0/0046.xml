&quot; /IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(5Q).146 COPY NO. 12-1ST JULY, 1950CABINETWHITE FISH INDUSTRY - SHORT-TERM REMEDIESMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for scotland at the Cabinefs meeting on 27th June (CM. (50) 39thConclusions, Minute 2) we were invited to submit, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Food, proposalsfor short-term measures to assist the white fish industry, forconsideration before 4th July.2. Short-term measures to assist the industry were considered by acommittee of officials, whose report was circulated to the production committee under cover of P. C. (50) 64 dated 20th June.   This committeereached the conclusion that the only practicable immediate short-termmeasure which   could ease the present difficulties of the white fish industry was the payment of a subsidy, and the arguments for and against this course are set out in their report.3. We have re-examined the question and regret that we are unableto find any alternative short-term measures which could be speedily appliedand which would bring relief to the white fish catchers.    We are thereforeagreed that i f immediate aid to the industry is to be given it must takethe form of a subsidy to the inshore fishermen and the owners of near and middle water trawlers in order to maintain the supplies of the betterclasses of fish brought in by these catchers.   Any subsidy should be on thelines of the scheme set out in Annex B of the official committee&apos;s report,with the important exception that a subsidy should not be paid to theowners of distant water trawlers (trawlers over 140 feet in length).4. The present difficulties of the industry are largely due to the over supply of distant water fish, to which British and foreign catcherscontribute.   The British distant water trawler owners are makingsubstantial losses and it is clear that they cannot do so indefinitely.They are contemplating the introduction of a scheme for laying up a proportion of their fleet and restricting the catches of the remainder inorder to bring supply more into balance with demand.   We believe that action on these lines is necessary and that foreign catchers should, in theirown interests, co-operate in applying similar restrictions on their exportsto this country.    We therefore propose that this question should be raised inO.E.E.C, as a matter of urgency.5. These short-term measures are intended to help the industry duringthe interval which must necessarily occur before the White Fish industry board which the Production Committee agreed should be set up can take fully effective action.h&apos;.McN.
