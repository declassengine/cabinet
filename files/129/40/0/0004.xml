(50) 11th Conclusions,Minute 5)  the Cabinet -(l)    Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to.arrange for a committee of EstablishmentOfficers of the Departments primarily concerned to examine the question of the recognition ofstaff associations and to frame proposals for early consideration by Ministers.(2)    Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a Committeeof Ministers to consider the proposals of theofficial committee to be appointed under conclusion (1) above,  and to make recommendations to the Cabinet.The report by the committee of officials is at annex I tothis memorandum.    The Committee of Ministers appointed by thePrime Minister under Conclusion (2)  consisted of myself as chairman,  the Minister of Labour,  the Minister of Health,the Minister of Supply and the Postmaster-General.2. The effect of the report at Annex I is that in industry generally,  the industrial civil service,  in the fire service and in the health service,  the Staff Sides generallysettle who shall negotiate with the employers on their behalf,and  the question of recognition by the employers does notarise.    In the non-industrial civil service and in the police service,  on the other hand,  it is the employers who decidewith whom they will negotiate, there being no necessaryconnection between recognition of an Association (which isolder than Whitleylsm.)  and membership of a Staff Side.    Inthe non-industrial service in particular the decisions aboutrecognition are taken on the basis of well defined principlesaccepted by the Staff Side and based on the theory that inthe last resort it is for the management to decide,  in thelight of the wishes of the staff as reflected in the relativesizes of membership, which Associations represent the staffin such a way as to make it reasonable to enter into bindingagreement with them.    The reasons for these differingarrangements are largely historical and in general the differingarrangements are working well,3. The Committee appointed by the Prime Minister meton 11th May.    So far as concerns the general question of recognition, we accept the fact of,  and justification for,the differing arrangements about recognition in differingfields and we consider that no change is necessary.    As forthe particular Post Office problem,  the Postmaster-General has,CP. (50)  IQh.COPY NO. I A-I- 12TH MAY.  1950CABINET

on further consideration, found it possible to revert in substance to the policy recommended in CP. (1+9)  2hl (Revise)and approved by the Cabinet on 15th December (0.1,(1+9)  72ndConclusions, Minute 1+).    Accordingly, he desires,  in replyto a Parliamentary Question, to make a statement which, subjectto verbal amendments, will be based on the operativeparagraphs (5 and 6) of Appendix &apos;E&apos;  to CP. (1+9)  2hl (Revise).At the same time, he proposes to announce his decision - notto recognise - in respect of the main breakaway Post Officeassociation, the Engineering Officers&apos;  (Telecommunications)Association.    In this way Parliamentary discussion both ofthe principle and of its application will be limited to one occasion.    A draft of the proposed statement, in which weconcur,  is at Annex II to this memorandum,1+. The Committee authorised me to report on their behalfto the Cabinet on the outcome of the discussion.    I invitemy colleagues(l)    To take note of the report by officials at annex I, and to agree that no change Is necessaryin the arrangements in different fields aboutrecognition of staff associations..

2nd May, 1950ANNEX IRECOGNITION OB1 STAFF ASSOCIATIONSREPORT BY COMMITTEE OF officials.     We were asked to examine the question of recognition of staff associations and to frame proposals for the consideration of Ministers..&amp;*      This request arose from the consideration by Ministers of thepostmaster General1s.proposals to meet the difficult problem of recognition at present facing him in the Post Office.   We understandthat our examination is to cover not only the Civil Service but suchforms of State employment as, for example, the Health Service; andwe also understand that one of the considerations in mind in remittingthis question to us was that, with the establishment and developmentof Y/hitleyism in the Civil Service over the last quarter of a century, it might be that the time had come for a re-examination ofthe relationship between Whitleyism and the individual Staff Associations,3e     We begin by setting out the present position in industry generally,in the industrial Civil Service, in the non-industrial Civil Service,in the Health Service, the Fire Service and the police Services.THE PRESENT POSITIONINDUSTRYA-.      Industry generally is not familiar with the problem of recognitionin the form in which it at present faces the postmaster General.    in industry, as in the Civil Service, the employer has no say in the composition of the Trade Union side of the Industrial Council, WorksCommittee or other negotiating body with which he deals on matters affecting his employees as a whole.    These bodies are set up by theworkers as represented by the Unions who happened to be dominant atthe time when the establishment first came into being.    Any subsequentchanges in the composition of the Trade Union Side of the Council etc,is entirely a matter for the existing Trade Union Side.    It is entirely1

up to them to say whether or not they are willing from time to time toallow another Union to be co-opted.   The position in this respect isidentical with that in the Civil Service where the composition of both national and departmental Staff Sides can only be varied with the consentof the existing Associations represented on these &quot;bodies.5.     But in industry the right of the existing Unions to control the composition of the Trade Union Side of the Industrial Council etc.carries with it in practice the right also to settle the Unions withwhich the employer may negotiate on pay and matters affecting thedifferent groups of workers in his employment.    The employer will onlynegotiate with a Union represented on the Trade Union Side and bycontrolling the Unions represented on this body the Trade Union Side ineffect settle the Unions with whom the employer may negotiate,6,     Cases have arisen where Unions not represented on the Trade Union Sidehave secured membership among a considerable section of the workers in aparticular employment and have pressed for the right to conduct negotiations.The employer1s reply is that he will only negotiate vri.th the Unions represented on the Trade Union Side,   An Association which - is not so represented has theright, under Order 1305, to report a trade dispute,  e.g. on a wages issue, tothe Ministry of Labour.    But the Ministry would not refer the case to theNational Arbitration Tribunal if adequate negotiating machinery existedto settle the dispute, even though it was machinery in which other Unionsparticipated.    This right of report under Order 1305 does not include aright to report a claim for recognition.   And the Ministry of Labour have in any case invariably refused to allow a claim for recognition to go to theNational Arbitration Tribunal on the ground that reognition has no precisesignificance and is not therefore arbitrable.7.      On occasion,  of course,  the Trade Union Side agree to a variation in their composition and admit another Union to the Trade Union side and thus to the right of conducting negotiations with the employer onbehalf of its members.    Furthermore., if demarcation disputes between Unions

arise, the machinery of the Disputes Committee of the Trade Union councils available to deal with them.   Where necessary it will give a decisionon the question whether a Union is entitled to organise a particular class or group of work people.   While this might assist in the settlement of thequestion whether a particular Trade Union should be entitled to negotiate with an employer on terms and conditions of employment for the group orclass of work people concerned, it would not necessarily do so if the rightof representation was not exclusive.3.      Thus, in industry,  there is no question of an employer by an act of recognition enabling a Union to conduct negotiations with him.    insofar as there is a parallel act, that act is one exercised by the Trade Union Sidewho, by settling the composition of this body, also settle which unions have the right to negotiate with the employer.    Trade Union Sides in reaching their decisions on these matters are governed by no accepted and-published principles and difficulties are settled not in the light ofobjective formulae but by bargaining, persuasion, and, in the last resort,expediency as judged by the Trade Union Side.THE INDUSTRIAL CIVIL SERVICE9,     Practice in the industrial Civil Service follows closely that in industry generally.    The Trade Union Side of the Industrial Council etc.is determined by the Unions represented on the Trade Union Side andthe Department only negotiates with the Unions on this.body.    If a union not represented on the Trade Union Side claims the right to conduct negotiations, it is referred by the Department to the Trade union side and there the matter usually rests.    The point has never yet beenreached where the Minister has felt constrained to authorise the conductof negotiations -with a Union not represented on the existing Trade union side.    Thanks to the good sense of the Unions this question has remained entirelyhypothetical up to now and there is no case at the present time for raising the issue as to what action the Minister might have to take.

THE NON-INDOSTRIM. CIVIL SERVICE10.    In the non-industrial Civil Service in sharp contrast with outsideindustry and with the industrial Civil Service, there is no necessaryconnection between recognition and membership of a Whitley Council.   Themanagement decide which Associations shall be recognised as competent tonegotiate on questions affecting solely the staff which they representand which shall not.    The Staff Side themselves decide which Associationsshall be included on the Staff Side and which not.Association and Whitleyism1.1.   Recognised Associations are older than Whitley Councils and whenWhitley Councils were introduced the Government of the day gave a pledgethat recognised Associations would retain the right of direct consultation on matters affecting their members alone.   From time to time this pledgeis invoked by Associations.    In other words,  &quot;Whitleyism superseded nothing&quot;.Meaning of Recognition12, -Official recognition of an Association is a very significant act.It alone confers upon an Association the right to discuss with themanagement the conditions of service of its members; to enter into agreements on matters concerning them; and to go to arbitration ona dispute within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement.    But significantas it is as between the Association and the Department, official recognitionconfers no right to a seat on the appropriate Whitley Council: in other words recognition by the Department does not carry with it the corollary of recognition by the Staff Side.Basis of Granting of Recognition13a    In the non-industrial Civil Service as a whole recognition has hithertodepended solely on numerical strength of the membership in a grade.    Thatis, to be recognised an Association must have enough members in the gradeor grades it claims to represent to enable it to enter into binding agreements on their behalf.   What constitutes &quot;enough&quot; members has not been precisely    :A

laid down but the Post Office has announced (in the Listowel formula) that itwill consider a claim for recognition if the Association making the requestshows that it has in membership at least l+QFfi of the organised staffof a grade.    This has been widely quoted as constituting a ruleautomatically entitling an Association to recognition when it reaches4-O/c of the organised members of the grade concerned; whereas it shouldbe clear from the terms of the Listowel formula that in the Post Office AO^is merely a prerequisite for the claim to receive consideration in whichfactors other than that of numerical strength could be taken into account.Make-up of Staff Sides14*    The constitution of Departmental Whitley Councils provides thatthe Staff Side shall be chosen by &quot;the Associations or groups ofAssociations having members employed in the Department&quot;.    Staff Sidesare in fact composed of representatives of the main recognised Associationsbut they need not, and do not, necessarily include all the relevant recognisedAssociations.    Conversely they have now and then included Associations notofficially recognised.15.   Whitley machinery is, therefore, in the non-industrial Civil Service,both complementary and supplementary to that offered by the recognisedUnions.    The decision whether a -particular claim affecting a sectionof the staff should be handled through Whitley machinery or directthrough the Association concerned rests on convenience and practice and not on any principle.    The last ten years have seen a tremendousadvance in the strength of Whitleyism in the Civil Service, and inpractice to-day all matters concerning the Service as a whole - forexample,  such matters as the political activities of civil servants,general wages policy, the five-day week - are handled on the national whitley Council.    In the reconstruction period many questions -affectingsectional interests were dealt with on the Council, but it is moreusual for such matters to be dealt with by the Associations individually:the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council leaves it - and mustleave it - to individual Associations to pursue their purely sectional

interests should they so prefer.   But normally no negotations are enteredinto with individual Associations on natters which have been, or are &quot;being,discussed on the Whitley Council.16.    Thus, though Whitleyism in the non-industrial Civil Service is,and must be, based on the existence of the Staff Associations, thoseStaff Association do not own their being ot&quot; their power to theexistence or to the &quot;recognition&quot; of the Staff Sides of the WhitleyCouncils.    If Whitlyism were to cease to-morrow, the negotiation machinery in the Civil Service, though severely handicapped on matters of general interest, would not break down.THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE17.    In the National Health Service the field is covered by ten WhitleyCouncils, each dealing with a particular category of staff, for example,nurses, professional staff, clerical and administrative staff, etc.The Staff Side of the Councils was chosen by the professional associations and Unions themselves after a meeting of all the Associations and Unionsknown to be interested, who were summoned by the Health Departments at the outset.   All negotiations about pay and other conditions of service are dealt with on these Councils and there are no separate negotiations with theindividual Associations or Unions.    In other words, these Whitley Councils arenot strictly comparable with the Civil Service National Whitley Councilbut are more in the nature of groups of Associations which, as manyof them overlap, could not function efficiently apart from the Councilsthrough whom they must work.It has hitherto been the invariable practice, as in industry, thatthe admission of new Associations to the Staff Side should be decided by the Staff Side itself without interference from the employing side.In a few instances, some &quot;dUTl culrb4ee-Jaa3!e.^xisen owing to the exclusion of Associations from the Staff Side,  and the position of theMedical practitioners Union in relation to the Medical whitley council is at present under consideration.    But, apart from this case, it hasnot so far been necessary to give serious consideration to the recognitionfor negotiating purposes of an Association unpresent on the Whitley Council

THE FIRE SERVICE18.    In the Fire Service, conditions are negotiated on a national joint Council: the composition of the Employees&apos; Side was settled byagreement among the Unions concerned; it operates through separateCommittees for officers and junior ranks, of which the Employees&apos; Sidewere similarly settled.POLICE19.    Trade Union membership as such is forbidden to the Police by thePolice Act, 1919/ the only Staff Association a Regular policeman belowthe rank of superintendent may join being the Police Federation, with whom all negotiations are undertaken,COMMENTGENERAL20.   From the discription above of the present position it is clearthat no common principles govern the procedure for settling which staff representatives shall be deemed to be the appropriate bodies to negotiate on behalf of their members.    There are no common principles as betweenindustry and the Civil Service as a whole and no common principles asbetween the industrial Civil Service on the one hand and the non-industrial civil Service on the other,.    In industry generally, in the industrial CivilService, in the Pire Service and in the Health Service it is true to say thatthe Staff Sides largely settle who shall negotiate with the employerson their behalf.    In the non-industrial Civil Service and in the Police Service,on the other hand, it is the employers who decide with whom they will negotiate.In the non-industrial Service in particular those decisions a.re taken on the basis of well-defined principles accepted by the Staff Side and basedon the theory that in the last resort it is for the management to decide,in the- light of the wishes of the Staff as reflected in the relative sizes of membership, which Associations represent the staff in such a way as to makeit reasonable to enter into binding agreements vd.th them..

21,    The reasons underlying the differences between the arrangementsoperating in the various Services etc. are largely historical.    Eachsystem has developed from different beginnings and at different stages of social history.    Each is at a different stage of its development.To. go fully into the story would be in effect to recapitulate the taleof the development of Trade Unionism in the country,22,   But whatever the history or causes of the present divergencies of practice, it is clear that in general the different arrangements are working well. Naturally there are strains, as their always will bein living and developing systems.   Not unnaturally, there are certainunresolved logical problems - as yet merely hypothetical.    But the arrangementwork well because they are each accepted as fair, reasonable and even -in spite of their differences - as obviously &quot;right&quot;, by the greatmajority of the poeople concerned.   Nevertheless, there has been materialgrowth in the stature and status of the Trade Unions in recent yearsand the problem of recognising break-away Unions involves even greater difficulties under present conditions than it did in the past.    No doubtthere will be further development as time goes on and as the need is felt fromtime to time to adapt the arrangements to new and changing circumstances.It is not unlikely that they will tend to develop more and more in the same lines, partly because of the general tendency to unification of practice to-day; partly because of the growing integration in the Civil Service asbetween the industrial and non-industrual sides; and partly, perhaps, becauseof the frequent contact between those responsible for the working of thevarious arrangements, contacts which will inevitably produce some crossfertilisation of ideas.23,   Meanwhile, in general,, it is only in one section of one part of thefield, namely, in the post Office section of the non-industrial Civil Service,that there are any serious practical difficulties to-day.    These difficulties are however, of vital importance to the Post Office, involving the threatenedbreak-away of no less than four separate groups from three of the major

Post Office Unions - two from the Post Office Engineering Union, one fromthe Union of Post Offices Workers, and one from the Federation of P0stOffice Supervising Officers.    These Associations represent engineers andmanipulative staff who, although designated &quot;non-industrial&quot; for CivilService purposes, are in many respects much more akin to industrial staffboth within and outside the Civil Service than they are to other non-industrial staff within the Civil Service.24.   As regards the non-industrial Civil Service, any attempt formally to merge the recognition of Associations into the Whitley machinery would undoubtedly provoke serious and violent opposition inside and outsidethe Service.    While it might be welcomed by the Associations which at presenthave seats on the Whitley Councils, it would certainly be resisted byall Associations not in this position and would be represented as an act of abdication on the part of the management, and the sacrificing .ifthe interests of the individual to the interests of the big and powerfulwell-established Associations.   At the same time the change would be viewedwith serious misgivings by the Official Sides of Departments who, whilefully subscribing to the x^rinciple that it is for the staff themselves todecide who shall represent the, would not necessarily agree that the StaffSides of the Whitley Council were always the same thing as the staff.Fundamentally and in the last resort the question of true representativenesshas to be faced.    Ultimately there must be some criteria of representativeness.Ultimately there must be some judge to apply those criteria.    It would bedifficult in present circumstances to persuade the non-industrial CivilService that in the last resort this judge could be other than the Head ofthe Department.25.    It might be argued that the retention of the ultimate decision in thehands of the management encourages the growth of breakaway Unions.    In fact,outside the Post Office,  the tendency is not for breakaway Associations todevelop- but rather for small Associations to go down in favour of the bigger-ones,  either voluntarily (by merger) or involuntarily (though lack of members).

Thus, more and more, in practice official recognition and membership of the whitley Councils are tending, de facto, to coincide.   And, given the continuanceof the present responsible management of the National Staff Side,  this tendency is, in our view, a good thing..CONCLUSION26.    Our conclusion is therefore that though there are differences -in some respects very startling differences - between the arrangementsgoverning the recognition of Staff Associations and Trade Unions in thevarious spheres which we have reviewed, the arrangements work wellin practice and in general achieve the desired object of producing bodies with whom the employers can do business, accepted and acceptable to both sides, thatis to the generality of the staff concerned as well as to the employers.That being so, in general we would deprecate any attempt to imposeuniform arrangements at this stage.    The arrangements have grown and developed gradually and naturally in relation to the various environmentsand, in our view,  should, be left to develop gradually.    There is no reasonto suppose that more uniform arrangements forced through by the managementwould work as well as, let alone better than, those which have grown up,as it were, organically.    Our main proposal for the consideration ofMinisters is,  therefore, that no attempt should be made at thisstage to change the current practice - outside the Post Office.27.   As for the Post Office, its current problem must clearly be tackled.This problem seems to us to resolve itself into the question whether thestaff of the post Office, consisting predominantly of manipulative and engineering grades, should continue to be treated in this matter of recognition and its relation to WhitIcyism strictly on the lines at presentfollowed for non-industrial staff in the Civil Service (i.e. no direct connexionbetween &quot;recognition&quot; and Whitleyism), or whether changing conditionscall for a modification of the present arrangements in the directionof aligning them more closely with those in formce for industrial staffwithint and without the Civil Service - i.e. a more or less direction connexionbetween &quot;recognition&quot; and representation on the Staff or Trade Union Sideof Joint Councils.

In view of present day conditions in the Trade Union movement, ofthe quasi-industrial nature of the Post Office, and of the extremeley high degree to which staff consultation has been developed in that Department, itseems to us impracticable for the Postmaster General to recognise a breakawayunion without some consultation with his Whitley Councils.    But we thinkthat there is no need to take the revoluntionary and, in our view, unjustiedstep of placing decisions as to recognition solely in the hands of the StaffSides of the Post Office Whitley Councils.    Both the proposals which havebeen before the Cabinet, while modifying the existing practice, recognisethat ultimately the decision is for the Postmaster General to take.The difference between the proposal accepted by the Cabinet on15th December, 1949 and that before them on 16th March, 1950 is,essentially,  that the. earlier proposal, unlike the later one, makes noexplicit provision for consultation with the Departmental Whitley Councilson a claim for recognition of a hitherto unrecognised Association and no reference to the possibility of attempting, if necessary, to reach asettlement through the mediation of some outside &quot;arbitrator&quot;.    The earlierproposal confined itself to stating the factors which the PostmasterGeneral would take into account in deciding -particular cases.    (the operative words are:    &quot;In deciding any particular case it is necessary totake account of such factors as the degree to which the new association isrepresentative of the staff concerned, how far the grade or grades inrespect of which recognition is claimed can prc-perly be regarded as a groupfrom the point of view of staff organisation and discussions, and generally the position of the grade or grades in question in relation to other grades in the same organisation.  &apos;It may also be necessary to take into accountwider questions such as the effect on the general working relationships inthe Post Office.&quot;)    The later proposal, while the ultimate decision was still to rest \dth the Minister, provided that all possible steps should first be taken to reach an agreed settlement, in the first place through the Departm11

Whitley Councils and later perhaps by some form of &quot;arbitration&quot;.    Thuseverything possible would be done to avoid the.far-reaching schisms withinthe Staff Side (with all their consequent effects on management and service)which would follow were a decision imposed by the Postmaster General againstthe wishes of the Staff Sides and without any consultation with them.    only if these steps failed to produce a solution acceptable to the Staff sides and to the Postmaster General would he impose a settlement of his own.The choice between these proposals is a nice one,  depending, on theone hand on the estimate of the success likely to attend the discussions withthe Staff Sides and any reference to outside advisors and, on the other,on the extent of the political and other opposition to the procedure.   Butwe recommend that in the event of a decision to adoiot the latter of thesetwo proposals, any public statement made should make it plain that thefinal decision must continue to rest with the Minister.May, 1950T. 116 2-501 2

ANNEX IIRECOGNITION OF STAFF ASSOCIATIONS IN THE POST OFFICEDraft statement by the Postmaster general questions of recognition in the Post Office are not in my judgment suitable for settlement by reference to any automaticformula.     Each case must be considered individually, and in any arrangement which may be made it will be one of my principal objectivesto ensure that the interests of the staff are safeguarded.In deciding any particular case it is necessary to take accountof such factors as the degree to which the new association is representativeof the staff concerned, how far the grade or grades in respect of -whichrecognition is claimed can properly be regarded as a separate entity fromthe point of view of staff organisation and discussions, and generally the position of the grade or grades in question in relation to othergrades in the same organisation.     It is essential also to take into accountwider questions,  such as the effect of a change in representation on thegeneral working relationships in the Post Office.In the light of these considerations I am refusing recognition to the Engineering Officers (Telecamaunications) Association.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.12TH MAY, 1950
