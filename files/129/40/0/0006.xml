THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY  OP  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;8   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1950CP. (50) 10612th May, 1950CABINETGAS INDUSTRY WAGE CLAIMNote by the Minister of Fuel and PowerFollowing the Cabinefs discussion of 24th April (CM. (50) 24th Conclusions,Minute3), I am reporting on the results of the further discussion of this claimby the National Joint Industrial Council for the Gas Industry on 26th April.The most important decisions were as follows : 1. LabourersA national wage structure for gas labourers is to be established. Thefollowing standard rates of pay for adult labourers were agreed, to take effect from 16th April :-Per Hourd.i4-1-Metropolitan area       ...      ...      ...      ......      2   6^Provincial Grade A    ...      ............      2 &apos; 4 Provincial Grade B    ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      2   3The equivalent weekly rates are  5 11s. lOd. in the Metropolitan area and 5 4s Od. and  4 19s. Od. in Zones A and B.The rates covered by Zones A and B are therefore fractionally less than theUnion&apos;s claim, which was  5 5s. Od. and  5 0s. Od. per week respectively.2. Higher-paid WorkersIt was agreed that scheduled rates for the higher-paid workers should besettled as early as practicable by the Area Gas Industrial Councils and thatthese should be back-dated to 16th April.When the Cabinet discussed on 24th April the important question of therates for the higher-paid workers, they agreed (Conclusion (1)) that the gas council should be pressed to delay as long as practicable the discussion ofconsequential increases in the rates of pay of higher grades, and to keep thefield of such increases as narrow as possible, so as to lessen repercussions elsewhere,and that they should make it explicitly clear that any increases which might ultimately be granted to the higher grades would not operate retrospectively fromthe date when the claim was conceded in respect of the manual workers.The Gas Council were informed at once of the Governments views. But theyexplained that, while they appreciated that any increases even for labourersshould be kept as low as possible, they were committed by their agreement of13th April (reported in CP. (50) 71, paragraph 4 (v)) to back-dating not onlythe increases for labourers&apos; rate but any increases subsequently agreed for higher-paid workers.I explained the position to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Ex-chequer and the Minister of Labour, and, in view of the specific pledge which theCouncil had already accepted on 13th April, and the objection to direct Govern -ment intervention in wage negotiations, we did not feel that it was possible topress the Gas Council any further on the question of back-dating.secret Copy No-  3238721
My colleagues may, however, like to see the annexed note of what ColonelSmith, Deputy Chairman of the Gas Council, said to the Unions at the meetingof the National Joint Industrial Council on 26th April. From this, it will be seenthat he did, in fact, put strongly the point that the Gas Council, as a public authority, felt bound to pay full regard to the Governments wage policy, and thathepressed the Unions for reconsideration of the principle of back-dating the new rates for higher paid workers. The Unions strongly rejected this plea, and the gas Council had to honour their commitment. But I think we can feel that theCouncil did their best to give effect to the Governments wishes.The Gas Council&apos;s handling of the press has also been excellent. Their pressstatement, which referred only to the rates for lower-paid workers, attracted verylittle attention, and there does not seem to have been any suggestion in the press that the industry is not conforming with the Governmenfs wage policy.When the Cabinet considered this matter on 24th April, they hoped that thediscussion of consequential increases in pay for the higher-paid workers would be delayed as long as practicable. Now that the increases have to be back-dated, i assume that the Cabinet would wish the discussions to be completed quickly. Ifthis is the Cabinets view, I will so inform the Gas Council., iV-^; ,;v.; S ....... S    P- J- N.-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,12a May, 1950!ANNEXStatement made by Colonel H. C. Smith from the Chaik at the Meeting ofthe National Joint Industrial Council on 26th April, 1950The representatives of the Gas Council have had two meetings since theNational Joint Industrial Council&apos;s last meeting. They have given very carefulconsideration to the case that was put up by the Workers&apos; side. The desirabilityof establishing a national wages structure was agreed at the last meeting of theJoint Council. We have since, examined the whole position in that light and wedo not go back on any of the points which we made at the last meeting. Sixpoints were mutually agreed at that meeting and, as a result, the meeting was adjourned until to-day. I ought to say this, and I am sure you will accept it,the Gas Council is now in a very different position from that occupied by theformer Federation of Gas Employers. It is perhaps taking us some little time torealise this and to appreciate it properly. While we are still free agents and arestill responsible for negotiating terms and conditions of employment with theappropriate Trades Unions, at the same time we have now a more definiteresponsibility to the public than we had before. It is true that as servants ofthe gas industry we always had indirect responsibility to the public, but this responsibility was through boards of directors of companies or committees of municipal gas undertakings. In the case of companies we had to keep an eye onthe shareholders&apos; interests; shareholders who had provided capital for running the gas undertakings and who expected a dividend on their holdings. The positionis now completely changed, and our responsibility to the public is a much more direct one. We are now a public authority, responsible to the public through theMinister of Fuel and Power, and we have got to have more regard than we did inthe past as independent owners of gas undertakings to Government national policy. We have discussed this on this Joint Council on more than one occasion.-I know that on your side you have had the same point in mind the whole time.What I think we are both trying to do is to see that the workers in the gas industry are dealt with fairly while at the same time we are both playing our part in
assisting whatever Government may be in power to carry on the business ofGovernment in these very difficult times in tlie way that they think is right. Thatis the sort of atmosphere in which both sides of this Joint Council have to work.It is an atmosphere which we perhaps have not really had to consider in the past.If it were not for the present economic state of the country you might accuse us of being a bit mean, of trying to beat you down and of adopting a cheese-paringpolicy in the way we have considered your claim and in the proposals we are goingto put to you, but I think you will accept the spirit in which we are approaching the problem. We are not trying to beat you down. We are trying to reply to your claim for a national wage structure and to meet the case of the lowest paidworker as well as we possibly can while, at the same time, not making it possiblefor anyone to say &quot; here is a nationalised industry which is not supporting theGovernment policy of wage restraint and is granting a flat rate increase to all workers in the industry contrary to that policy.&quot; This has been in the minds ofboth sides of this Council since you made your claim and right throughout theconsideration of this problem.What the Gas Council are prepared to agree and, no doubt, you will want totake these suggestions away and consider them, is that there should be establishednational standard rates of pay for labourers of twenty-one years of age and over,that these standard rates of pay should be covered by two Provincial gradeswhich we will call Grade A, and Grade B, and that there should be, in addition,a rate for the Metropolitan area which would be a plus rate on top of Grade A.We are prepared to agree to a Metropolitan rate of 2s. Qd. an hour, a ProvincialGrade A rate of 2s. 4td. per hour and a Provincial Grade B rate of 2s. 3d. perhour.* We agree that the Area Joint Industrial Councils should determine thegrading of undertakings into either Provincial A or Provincial B grades. Thereare many differential rates which exist in the industry, all of which were originallybased on the rates of pay to labourers. These rates apply to work carrying a higherdegree of skill than that of labourers, and to work of a particularly onerous nature.It was agreed at our last meeting that no alteration should be made in thesedifferential rates until they had been examined on either an area or a national basis and that, as the result of such examination, schedule rates should be agreed for these various jobs and published. We feel that as we are establishing anational wage scale we should endeavour to determine the principle of these rates on a national basis. .With regard to these differential rates, please do not think that we are tryingin any way to get out of the bargain which we made with you at the last meeting,which was that all rates to be agreed should be back-dated to 16th April. but during this last fortnight we have been considering this problem and we aredoubting the wisdom of this back-dating : again looking at the problem from thenational point of view and from the angle of both sides who are doing their best to support the Governments wage restraint policy. There is no question about it that at our last meeting we did agree that all rates to be finally agreed should bedated back to 16th April. This was one of the conditions on which you agreedto deferment. We are not trying to get out of this but we do ask you very seriouslyto consider whether this is not calculated to give the appearance of the industryattempting to evade this policy of wage restraint. We appreciate that there arearguments both for and against this back-dating, and all I can ask you to dois to give this question your very serious consideration and if, after consideringit, you can agree with us that it might be wiser not to date the differentialincreases back to 16th April we shall feel that we are doing something that is right and proper.I now would like to refer to the question of what we have always called&quot; better conditions.&quot; Where employees are at present receiving a rate of pay which is in excess of the recognised grade rate for their job in their undertakingwe feel that this excess should be absorbed in any increase which they may receiveconsequent upon the adoption of the new schedule rates. We should make a reallyserious attempt to get rid of these odd better conditions. If we are going to estab-lish a national wages structure let us have a wages structure which is a realnational wages structure and not one which gives some people for certain reasonsadvantages for which no real justification exists other than the fact that some-one in the past has granted this special increase before we were organised aswe are to-day.* Note.-The figures finally agreed are, of course, those given in the covering memorandum.
Finally, I must ask the Trade Unions to exercise more restraint in approach-ing areas in regard to additional concessions, such as provision of protectiveclothing, time off with pay for works&apos; outings, extravagant welfare facilities, &amp;c.Claims in connection with these and other matters are continually being madeby the Trades Unions. You put up very good cases for them. You plead forthem very strongly. You suggest that they are trifles and that they do not costanything, but if you can persuade some Boards to extend the concessions which some Undertakings have given to the whole of the Area the cost is far from triflingand can be very considerable. jjIf there are any questions which you would like to ask at this stage I shallbe very pleased to answer them and, if not, you will probably like to retire toconsider our proposals.1, Grosvenor Place, London, S.W. 1.26th April, 1950.
