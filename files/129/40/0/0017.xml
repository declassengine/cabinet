(50) 11726th May, 1950CABINET33rd Session of the International Labour Conference, June-July 1950&quot; EQUAL REMUNERATION FOR MEN AND WOMEN WORKERS FORWORK OF EQUAL VALUE&quot;Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service. One of the main items on the Agenda of the 33rd Session of the Inter-national Labour Conference, which opens on 7th June, is the question of equal pay, or, as it is expressed for this purpose, &quot; equal remuneration for men andwomen workers for work of equal value.&quot; This item is to be considered underthe I.L.O.&apos;s &quot; double discussion procedure,&quot; which means that the conference will be called upon to decide on this occasion whether the question of equal pay is suitable for international regulation by means of one or more InternationalLabour Conventions or Recommendations, and will be invited to agree on certain conclusions as to the principles on which such regulations should be framed. Onthe basis of the conclusions reached by the Conference further texts would bedrawn up for the second discussion in 1951, when any international regulations would finally be adopted. In accordance with the usual practice, the InternationalLabour Office have, on the basis of replies furnished by Governments to a questionnaire, circulated a report for the use of delegates to this year&apos;s Conference.This report contains a set of &quot; proposed conclusions &quot; which are reproduced in annex I to this paper.2. The United Kingdom Government delegates to the coming session of theInternational Labour Conference will need to be fully briefed on this extremelycomplex and controversial subject and in particular on the attitude they shouldtake towards the conclusions proposed by the International Labour Office. Thereport of the International Labour Office and the proposed conclusions have been carefully examined by a working party of officials of the Treasury, the ForeignOffice, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Scottish Office andthe Ministry of Labour and National Service, and, following this exmination, thepresent paper sets out a line of policy on the basis of which, subject to the con-currence of my colleagues, I would propose to instruct the United KingdomGovernment delegates.3. The Government^ attitude to the question of equal pay has remainedas explained by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer in a statement made inParliament on 11th June, 1947. This statement, which is reproduced in Annex II,was made after consideration of the report of the Royal Commission appointed in 1944 &quot; to examine the existing relationship between the remuneration of men andwomen in the public services, in industry and in other fields of employment ; toconsider the social, economic and financial implications of the claim of equal pay for equal work ; and to report.&quot; The Royal Commission^ report, which was published in 1946, contained a large volume of factual information concerning the relationship between the remuneration of men and women. Perhaps, however,its most notable feature was its exposure of the difficulty of precisely denning whatis meant by &quot; equal pay &quot; and consequently the difficulty of assessing the precise38791 &quot; b
social, economic, and financial implications which would be involved in its introduction. ......4. Apart from the fact that they contemplate action going considerablybeyond what the Government on the basis of its previously stated attitude wouldbe prepared to take, the &quot; proposed conclusions &quot; drawn up by the InternationalLabour Office are open to two main objections (a) they embody a definition of &quot; equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value &quot; by reference to &quot; job content &quot; whichis inappropriate as a basis for international regulations ;(b) the obligations which, on the basis of this definition, it is proposed to placeon Governments are more far-reaching than any which could beaccepted consistently with the general system of wage and salarydetermination in this country.5. The crux of the matter lies in the question of definition. The detailedobjections to a definition on the basis of &quot; job content &quot; (together with other possible definitions previously put forward and rejected by the International LabourOffice) are set out in Annex III. The fundamental objection in my view is that action based upon such a definition would involve the revision of existing wage and salary structures on the basis of a formula which appears not to be amenable to precise definition. Even if it could be generally and objectively applied, it wouldbe calculated to introduce an undesirable rigidity into the various wage and salarystructures, and it would unduly limit the flexibility of approach which is essential tothe operation of collective negotiation.6. On the other hand, I consider that it would be undesirable for the UnitedKingdom Government delegation to the Conference to adopt a purely negative attitude in this matter. Such an attitude, on a question which remains a matterof considerable political importance in this country, might reasonably be held to constitute a retreat from the position taken up by the Goverment on and since11th June, 1947. Equal pay has the official support of the T.U.C., and my Depart-ment have already recieved representations from a number of the leading women&apos;organisations, urging that the Government should support a Convention on thesubject. Moreover, the principle of &quot; equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value &quot; not only is embodied in the Constitution of theInternational Labour Organisation, and has been the subject of consideration withinthe Organisation for a number of years, but is a matter which has also receivedconsiderable attention in the United Nations, more particularly in the Economicand Social Council, where it has been used as a vehicle for political propagandaon the part of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The question of equal pay is one which is fully within the competence of the I.L.O. I consider, therefore, that,quite apart from considerations of domestic policy, it is of importance that theUnited Kingdom delegation should play their part in ensuring that the conclusions reached by the International Labour Conference are not so indeterminate Or sounrealistic as to invite further action by the United Nations, action which is likely tobe governed by political rather than by purely social considerations.7. It appears to me that the International Labour Conference might, with thesupport and if necessary the initiative of the United Kingdom Government, devoteitself as a first step to the establishment of the principle which appears to lie atthe root of the campaign for &quot; equal pay,&quot; namely the principle that difference of sex as such should not be taken into account in the determination of wages and salaries. Such a principle, if adopted and applied, would allow all relevant con-siderations to be taken into account in the determination of wages and salaries,but the sex of the worker as such would be disregarded. Action on the basis of sucha principle would not involve the regrading of jobs in accordance with any&quot;objective&quot; criterion of &quot;equal value.&quot; Non-discrimination on the basis of sexcould not, in fact, be regarded as a definition of &quot; equal remuneration for men andwomen workers for work of equal value &quot; but it would undoubtedly constitute animportant step forward.8. The following &quot;Conclusions&quot; might be drawn up on the basis suggestedin the preceding paragraph:  (1) Remuneration to be regarded as including all the benefits and advantages,whether in cash or kind, accruing to the worker in return for work done.
(2)   In furtherance of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value measures should be taken to promotei (       the establishment of rates of remuneration without discrimination basedon sex.  Such measures should be appropriate to the procedures for,,.;.;(,       fixing rates of remuneration which are in force in the country concerned.(3)   Appropriate action should be taken, as soon as practicable, after consulta-tion with the workers&apos; organisations concerned, to ensure to allemployees of the Government rates of remuneration determined inaccordance with the principle set out in paragraph 2.. 7(4)   Appropriate action should be taken to bring these provisions to the noticeof all wage and salary fixing authorities and employers&apos; and workers&apos;, ,        organisations concerned.It will be observed that Conclusion (2) sets out the general principle that &quot; measures should be taken to promote the establishment of rates of remuneration without!&apos;discrimination based on sex&quot; and that &quot;such measures should be appropriate tothe procedures for fixing rates of remuneration which are in force in the country concerned.&quot; Conclusions (3) and (4) provide for two distinct consequential obliga-tions in respect of (a) employees of the Government and (b) other workers.); 9. Paragraph 8 (4) above covers (i) those industries (including nationalised industries), services and professions which are entirely free to determine theirown rates of remuneration and (ii) those industries, services and professions wherethe Government is charged with some form of responsibility in regard to wages and salaries. Into class (ii) fall the industries covered by Wages Councils whose orders are subject to confirmation by the Minister of Labour and National Service. this class also includes teachers and National Health Service employees. In the caseof teachers in England and Wale.&apos;, the Minister of Education is empowered to makeRemuneration Orders on the basis of scales submitted by the Burnham Committee;in Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland makes regulations prescribingscales after consideration of recommendations made by the National Joint Council.In the case of the National Health Service the Minister of Health and the Secretaryof State for Scotland hold ultimate responsibility for scales of remuneration,although in practice remuneration is usually settled by Whitley Council agreements and not by Ministerial regulation. As regards such cases, it is important that anyobligations which the Government may assume under international regulations should not be such as to involve as a consequence any undesirable departure fromthe practice currently adopted by the Ministers concerned in carrying out their responsibilities in this field. For instance, it is not the normal practice to refuseconfirmation of Wages Councils Orders except on purely technical grounds. Simi-larly, I understand that the Minister of Education would regard it as important that he should not be put in a position which might involve him in action calculated to hamper the Burnham Committees in carrying out, as responsible independentbodies the functions required of them by the Education Act, 1944.10. In the light of these considerations, before any international regulationsare finally adopted, it will be necessary to determine the nature and extent of any action which it would be proper to take in this country in pursuance of an obligationto bring the provisions of the regulations to the notice of wage fixing authorities.For the purpose of the discussion at the coming session of the International LabourConference, I would propose that the delegation should press for a provisional textin the guarded terms set out in paragraph 8 (4).11. It is estimated that the additional cost (in Great Britain) of introducingequal pay immediately in the Civil Service, the Local Government Service, theNational Health Service and the Teaching Profession would be of the order of 35 million (This is made up as follows: Civil Service  10 million, Local Govern-ment  4 million, Teachers  15 million, National Health Service  6 million). this estimate includes a small element for increases which would have to be given to women in grades in which no males are employed in sympathy with the increases which would be given to women in mixed grades.12. If international regulations were to be finally adopted at the 1951 sessionof the International Labour Conference, we should need to define our attitude tothem before the end of 1952. I have no doubt that my colleagues will agree that,in the light of the estimates set out in the foregoing paragraph and the general economic circumstances of the country, we are unlikely to be able to implement in38791 b 2
1952 the principles in the conclusions set out in paragraph 8. If the Conferenceadopts a Convention, which is an instrument legally binding on States who ratifyit, we cannot forecast when we shall be in a position to ratify. On the other hand,a Recommendation, unlike a Convention, is not a legally binding instrument and itis possible for a State Member to accept a Recommendation with any reservationswhich it thinks fit. It would, therefore, be possible to envisage the acceptance inprinciple of a Recommendation on the lines suggested, with a reservation if necessary on particular details and also as to the timing of its implementation. A furtheradvanta ge of a Recommendation would be that it would enable our delegation toaccept, if necessary, additions and modifications to the text proposed which mightbe essential to securing the necessary support. I would, therefore, propose that our delegation should aim at the adoption of conclusions which would form the basisof a Recommendation along the lines set out in paragraph 8.13. While I have hopes that we may be able to obtain considerable support for this line of approach, we certainly cannot exclude the possibility that the Con-ference will wish to go further in the direction of regulations based upon someobjective definition of &quot; equal remuneration for men and women workers for workof equal value.&quot; This is the more likely owing to the fact that a previous Recom-mendation adopted by the I.L.O. (the Transition from War to Peace Recommenda-tions (1944) already embodies a definition on the basis of &quot;job content.&quot; In this event, I would propose that the delegation should do everything possible to securethat any such material should be relegated to a separate instrument, and that, while they should make what contribution they can to the discussions, should not subscribe to conclusions reached on such a basis.Summary of Conclusions14. (1) The &quot; conclusions &quot;proposed by the International Labour Office to formthe basis of international regulations, based upon a definition of equal pay determined by &quot; job content,&quot; are unacceptable and should not be supported.  (ParagraphsA, 5 and 13.)(2) It would, however, be undesirable for the United Kingdom government delegates to the coming session of the International Labour Con-ference to adopt a purely negative attitude.  (Paragraph 6.)(3) The United Kingdom Government delegates should support and, ifnecessary, initiate alternative conclusions based on the principle thatdifference of sex as such should not be taken into account in the determination of wages and salaries.  (Paragraph 7.)Conclusions which might be drawn up on this basis are set out inParagraph 8.(4) The United Kingdom Government delegates should aim to secure thatthese conclusions are regarded as the basis for a recommendation and not a Convention. A Recommendation would enable theGovernment to enter any necessary reservations on particular details,and also on the timing of its implementation.G.A.I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1.26th May, 1950.
ANNEX I proposed conclusions in the light of the Governments&apos; replies to the questionnaire submitted by theOffice on equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value,the following points are proposed as a basis for discussion by the 33rd Session ofthe International Labour Conference, June 1950:-I. Form of the International Regulations1.   The international regulations to take the form of (a) a   Convention   and   a   Recommendation   establishing   supplementaryprovision; or(b) a Recommendation.(Decision might be deferred until after discussion of II, general principles, below.)II. General Principles2. For the purpose of international regulation, the term &quot; remuneration &quot;to be defined as including wage or salary rates as well as the various bonuses orother allowances in cash or in kind, the seniority provisions and the system of wagepayment established by the wage provisions covering the men and women workers concerned.3. The phrase &quot; equal remuneration for men and women workers for workof equal value &quot; to be defined as meaning that remuneration rates shall be estab-lished on the basis of job content, no discrimination being made on the basis of thesex of the worker.4. Each Member to undertake to ensure, by means appropriate to procedures for fixing rates of remuneration which are in force in the country, the applicationof the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value or to satisfy itself that this principle is applied.5. Provision to be made that effect to the international regulation might begiven by (a) laws or regulations;(b) collective agreements between employers and workers; or(c) a combination of laws or regulations and collective agreements between employers and workers.6. Appropriate measures to be taken to ensure co-operation of the competentpublic authorities with the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned for thepurpose of applying the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value for men and women workers.III. Methods of Application7. Appropriate action to be taken, after consultation with the workers or with representatives of the workers&apos; organisations concerned to ensure the applica-tion of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for workof equal value to all employees of central Government departments or agencies and to encourage its application to employees of State, provincial or local govern-ment departments or agencies, where these have jurisdiction over rates of remuneration.8.   Appropriate action to be taken, after consultation with the representativesof the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned, to ensure, as rapidly aspracticable, the application of the principle of equal remuneration for men andwomen workers for work of equal value in all occupations, other than those38791 B 3
mentioned in paragraph 7, in which remuneration rates are subject to statutory regulations or public control, particularly as regards:  id) The establishment of minimum of other wage rates in industries and services where such rates are fixed under public authority;ib) industries and undertakings operated under public ownership or control; and(c) work executed under the terms of public contracts.9. (1) Where suitable to established procedures for wage fixing, provisions to be made by legal enactment for the general application of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for .work of equal value.(2) Provision to be made, however, that national laws and regulations might make specific exceptions to the scope of such legal enactment.(3) Provision to be made that the competent public authority should take all necessary and appropriate measures tp ensure that employers and workers aregiven full information as to such legal requirements, and, where appropriate, advice on their application.10. When full and immediate implementation of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal valueshould not prove feasible in the fields covered by paragraphs 7, 8 or 9, appro-priate provisions to be made or caused to be made for its gradual application, by such measures as:  id) Decreasing the differentials between men&apos;s and women&apos;s wage or salaryrates for work of equal value;ib) providing equal increments for men and women workers performing workof equal value where a system of increments is in force.11. (1) In order to facilitate the determination of wage rates in accordancewith the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, each member, in close co-operation with the representatives of theemployers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned, to undertake or cause to beundertaken, where necessary, the establishment of methods for evaluating jobcontent, whether by job analysis or by other procedures, with a view to providing a classification of jobs based on their various requirements, without regard to thesex of the worker.(2) Differential rates between men and women workers which correspond to differences in job content as so determined to be considered as being in accordancewith the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value.12. In order to facilitate the application of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, appropriate action to betaken to raise, where, necessary, the productive efficiency and capacity of women and to limit the effects of the factors accounting for the relatively low level of the remuneration of women workers, by such measures as id) Ensuring that workers of both sexes have equal or equivalent facilitiesfor vocational guidance or employment counselling, vocational training and placement;ib) taking appropriate measures to encourage women to use facilities for vocational guidance or employment counselling, vocational training andplacement;(c) providing welfare and social services which meet the needs of women workers, particularly those with family responsibilities, and which arefinanced from public funds and7 or from industrial welfare fundscovering all workers; and Id) promoting, without prejudice to the provisions of the international labour conventions and Recommendations and national laws and regulationsconcerning the employment of women, equality of men and women workers as regards access to the various occupations and posts.13. In view of the importance of appraising objectively the position of theproblem in the country concerned- -id) every effort to be made to promote public understanding the equity andusefulness of the principle, of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value; and (b)) such investigations as may be desirable to be undertaken with a view to ensuring the application of the principle.
ANNEX IIEqual Pay(Government Policy)The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Daltori): His Majesty&apos;s government desire to thank the members of the Royal Commission on Equal Pay for theirvaluable report. This Royal Commission was not asked to make recommendations.Their terms of reference I quote were &quot; To examine the existing relationship between the remuneration of menand women in the public service, in industry, and in other fields of employ-ment,&quot; and&quot; To consider the social, economic, and financial implications of the claim of equal pay for equal work.&quot;The Government are, of course, primarily concerned with the problem of equal pay for equal work within the field of public employment, and especially in thenon-industrial Civil Service, the local Government service, and the teaching profes-sion, but, in the Government^ view, there could be no question of confining equal pay to these occupations. Its introduction in industry and in other professionswould inevitably follow.As a broad affirmation of a general principle, the Government accept, asregards their own employees, the justice of the claim that there should be no difference in payment for the same work in respect of sex. But such acceptanceleaves unsettled many difficult questions of interpretation. It also leaves open thevery important practical question of when effect should be given to this principle,and over what range of cases. The Government are definitely of the opinion thatthis principle cannot be applied at the present time. In making proposals toParliament for incurring additional expenditure and for extending the social ser-vices, the Government must be the judge of priorities.In the light of the Royal Commission^ Report, the estimated cost of theimmediate introduction of equal pay in the public services alone would be morethan  24 million a year that is to say  10 million for the Civil Service,  11 million for teachers, and  3^ million for other local Government staffs. Of this total, some 16 million would fall on the Exchequer, and the rest upon the rates. The cost of equal pay for teachers would gradually rise by a further  6 million a year. Whenthe National Health Service comes into force, the Exchequer will take over the costnot only of the local Government nurses, for whom equal pay would cost  2,750,000out of the  3^ million already mentioned, but also of the voluntary hospital nurses,for whom it would cost a further  5 million a year.The cost of equal pay for all these public services would, therefore, be about 35 million a year, of which at least  8 million would fall on local authorities. Thiswould be equivalent to an average rate of about 6d. in the  , and a good deal more in the poorer areas. In addition, the cost of equal pay for women in the armed forces would be between  3 million and  6 million a year. Moreover, if the pay of unmarried women were raised to equality with that of married men, a married man with a family would be left in a relatively worse economic position than anyother section of the community, and there would undoubtedly be claims, whichmight soon be of universal application for a system of occupational family ailow-ances. The cost of these might well reach a very high figure.This heavy burden on the Exchequer and local rates would be increased, asequal pay extended to the industrial employees of the Crown and of the localauthorities. At the same time the new public boards and the whole body ofoccupations and trades in private industry would also have to face heavy expendi-ture on equal pay, with the result of a further increase in production costs, withoutany assurance of a compensating increase in production.The Government do not consider that this is the time when it would be in thenational interest for these additional burdens to be undertaken. With the authorityof Parliament, the Government are now pressing forward with important develop-ments of the social services and with plans for redistributing more justly the purchasing power of the people. Family allowances have been introduced, aNational Health Service is being established, new schemes of national insurance and public assistance are being brought into effect. The Government are proudof these achievements, but their cost is substantial, and some limit must be set to
the rate at which new projects, involving fresh expenditure, can be undertaken.One of the principal factors, fixing this limit is the rate at which production ex-pands. So long as there is no corresponding increase in output, any step which addsto the total of money incomes is wholly inflationary in its consequences, and thustends to cancel through higher prices the gains already conferred.The introduction of equal pay in the services for which local authorities areresponsible would also necessitate re-examination of the relation between national and local finance, and so might postpone the much-needed reforms in this field which the Ministers of Health and Education are now discussing with the repre-sentatives of the local authorities.This then, in the view of the Government, is not the time to introduce equalnay in the public service. This question should be further examined at a later date,in the light of the development of social policy and of the economic and financial circumstances of the country.- ANNEX-IIISome Possible Interpretations1. Three possible interpretations of what constitutes &quot; Equal remuneration formen and women workers for work of equal value &quot; have been put forward by theInternational Labour Office, namely:  (1) remuneration based upon the relative job performance of men and women of work of comparable character ;(2) remuneration based on the value defined with reference to costs of pro-duction or overall value to the employer ; and(3) wage rates based on job content without regard to sex.The International Labour Office argued against definition (1) on the grounds that &quot; such procedures require a general evaluation of the performance of one particular group of workers as compared with another, and no objective rule hasbeen found for precision in such evaluation.&quot; Definition (2) was rejected by theOffice on the grounds (a) that it is impracticable to determine quantitatively thevarious elements in &quot; overall value,&quot; and (b) that current practice has successfullydisregarded such &quot; intangibles.&quot; The Office accordingly now proposes definition (3).2. Considered as a provision in international regulations, definition (1) is less objectionable from our point of view than the other two definitions. It isthe narrowest of the three definitions since it can be construed as being confined to work upon which women are employed which is identical or closely related tomen&apos;s work. At the same time, the process of evaluating the relative job per-formance of the two groups is bound to be uncertain, imprecise and difficult, moreparticularly in the case of &quot; comparable &quot; as opposed to identicaljobs.3. We can endorse the Office&apos;s objections to definition (2) on the ground thatthe long-term effects upon costs of production of special overheads and differential&quot; overall value &quot; of female labour cannot be reliably assessed. In any case, a definition on those lines is (as the Royal Commission recognised) so far from whatis normally intended by &quot; equal pay &quot; that it would appear useless to contemplateit as a possible basis for international regulations.4. Definition (3) is the one now advocated by the International Labour Officeand appears to be open to the following objections (1) it is wide enough to involve a re-assessment of the remuneration paid to each individual man or woman member of the working population ;(2) the &quot; job content &quot; criterion is, apparently, intended to cut across the wagestructures of individual industries and services without regard to existing arrangements for the determination of wages and salaries ;(3) it is, in any case, most unlikely that any system of job measurement and valuation could be devised which would be universally applicable to allemployments ;(4) even if the &quot; job content&quot; criterion were to be applied separately in each industry or service or (more reasonably) over certain groups of jobswithin each industry or service, it appears highly questionable whether,
except in the few cases where scientific job analysis is already the basisof wage fixing, it would be possible to ensure that any.,&quot; objective &quot;criterion of the kind suggested was applied without qualification. Theviews of the Royal Commission on Equal Pay on this point are worthy of note:  &quot;Nor do we doubt that there is room for an extended applica-tion of the principle of job-content in the pricing of tasks whichare very fairly similar without being identical. At the same time there are difficulties about a wide extension of the principle whichare not always appreciated. It might, for instance, be found thatone job &apos; contains &apos; twice as much physical Strength as another, halfas much natural aptitude, three-quarters as much experience, andone and a quarter times as much disagreeableness. Is the weight to be assigned to each of these factors to be decided a priori bysome kind of inner light? Is there not rather entailed a referenceto the underlying conditions, in respect of each factor, of generalsupply and demand? And once these old friends or enemies arere-admitted into our particular problem, we seem to be back verymuch where we were. Thus it would seem that the policy of scientific regrading . . . might in certain cases result in larger and perhaps juster incomes for specially well-qualified women, and perhaps stimulate their supply . . . ; but that over a larger range itwould be more likely in practice to confirm the concentration ofthe higher grade work in the hands of the men.&quot;5. Underlying the detailed criticism of the above definitions is the basicobjection that they all involve prescribing to some extent and in accordance witha set formula the criteria to be adopted in determining wage differentials. It is highly questionable whether the methods of determining such differentials can properly be prescribed in this way by international regulations. The followingquotation from the Royal Commission^ Report is apposite. Speaking of a defini-tion on the basis of job content, the Commission expressed the view that such asystem &quot; would operate on balance to increase the rigidity and stratification of our industrial structure and to hinder the community in making the best possible useof the capacities of those of its women members who are prepared to renderindustrial service.&quot; In fact it appears more than doubtful whether employers orworkers generally would necessarily be prepared for the future to disregard allelements entering into the determination of wages which might be held to be inconsistent with &quot; objective &quot; formulae of this nature.
