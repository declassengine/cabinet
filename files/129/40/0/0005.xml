THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)SBC RETC. P. (50)  105 COPY NO.)       11TH MAY,  .1950CABINETFARM PRICE REVIEW,  1950Future Minimum Prices for Livestock and Livestock ProductsMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department._the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State for scotland as we stated in paragraph 10 of CP. (50) 45 of 21stMarch, the Agriculture Act, 1947, obliges us to fix andannounce some time during 1950 guaranteed minimum prices forfat stock, milk and eggs for 1952/53 and 1953/54.      With theapproval of the Cabinet, and by agreement with the Farmers&apos;Unions, consideration of the subject was deferred when therecent price review discussions were taking place, on theunderstanding that decisions would be reached by the end ofMay.2. Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1947, also deals withthe provision of assured markets.      Hitherto there has been no limit to the quantities of the scheduled products to whichthe guaranteed prices have applied.      In the Labour Party&apos;selection manifesto &quot;Let Us Win Through Together&quot; it was statedwithout qualification that &quot;There are and will be assuredmarkets at guaranteed prices for as much of the main products of our farms as our farmers can produce&quot;.      This presumablyrepresented our policy for at least the next five years.3. The Minister of Food considers, however, that theproduction of milk and eggs is nearing the point at whichconsumers will not want to buy more - even at the presentsubsidised prices - and he fears that his Department may haveto shoulder a heavy financial liability in 1952/53 and 1953/54unless steps are taken to set limits to the future commitments of the Government in respect of these two commodities.4. It is necessary to reach a decision now since theAct not only requires guaranteed minimum prices to be fixed for livestock and livestock products from two to four years in advance, but specifically prohibits any subsequent action(in regard to the period covered by those prices) which wouldhave the effect of producing less beneficial results for the producer.      If therefore it is considered necessary to setlimits to the Government&apos;s commitments for 1952/53 and 1953/54by restricting the size of the assured market, or in any other-way, an announcement of the Government&apos;s decisions must bemade concurrently with the fixing- of the minimum prices them-selves.5. We have accordingly considered, in consultation withthe Minister of Food and the Treasury, whether any quantitativelimits should be set to the amounts of milk and eggs for whicha market must be assured at not less than the guaranteed,minimum price.      Apart from the serious political difficultyunder existing conditions of reconciling any such limitationwith the statement in the Labour Party&apos;s election manifestoquoted in paragraph 2 above, there would be considerable

practical difficulty in devising a satisfactory arrangement.Actual quantitative limitations on the amount of producepurchased under the guarantee would be impracticable as theywould involve fixing individual sales quotas (which would prevent the expansion of low cost producers at the expenseof high cost), and any surplus would either have to be wastedor sold in competition   with the guaranteed quantity.6. A system under which the whole of the produceoffered by producers was purchased, but at a price which fell as the volume of produce offered increased, would be feasible, though difficult, for milk, and under existingmarketing arrangements virtually unworkable for eggs.      Anysuch system, however,  is bound to be complicated and diffi-cult to embody now in a minimum price Order which would not become effective for another two years, and the objects of limiting the Exchequer!s liability and leaving scope for adiscouraging price to prevent excess production could equallybe achieved by fixing minimum prices sufficiently low.      Areport on this subject of an inter-departmental working party of officials of the Agriculture Departments, the Ministry of food and the Treasury is annexed (Appendix II).7.    &apos; We recommend, therefore, that no attempt should bemade at this stage to set a quantitative limit to the amountof milk or eggs to be purchased at guaranteed prices in1952/53&apos; and 1953/54,  and that our officials should be instructed in their negotiations with the farmers to aim atfixing minimum prices low enough to allow for possible falls in farm costs due to lower feedingstuffs prices, increased supplies of feedingstuffs,  greater efficiency and other causes, and to leave scope for applying any measure of pricediscouragement necessary to secure that we do not call fortha greater volume of these commodities than will be requiredin&quot;the national interest.      At the same time these minimum prices must not be so low and discouraging as to jeopardise the attainment of the production targets set for 1952 andtheir maintenance in subsequent years.8. Purchased foods account for over half the currentcost of egg production, and a fall in feedingstuffs pricesof up to 50 per cent in the course of the next four years,although perhaps unlikely, is not beyond the bounds of possibility.      We do not see any prospect of substantial reductions in other costs,  of which the chief is labour(30 per cent).      Purchased foods account for about one quarter of the current cost of milk production, but thereis scope for a reduction in costs through better use ofgrassland, and it has to be recognised that present milkprices include an appreciable incentive element to getproduction up to the target figure in view of the high priority which has always been given to milk production.Accordingly for both milk and eggs we propose that the negotiators should aim at settling the minimum prices for1953/54 at some 30 - 35 per cent below current actual prices.If our colleagues are prepared to face the risk of a short-fall in egg production below the 1952 target we should beready to aim&quot; at a minimum price for eggs at about 38 percent&apos; below the current actual price.9. For fat stock, there  seems little question that forthe period up to the end of March, 1954, we shall need tomaintain the momentum of production of beef, mutton, porkand bacon set by our present targets. We therefore suggestthat negotiations on the minimum price for fat cattle andfat sheep should be on the basis of keeping these minimum prices at the levels already fixed (for minimum prices) for

1950/51 and 1951/52 (which are some 12 and 1? per cent respectively below current actual prices).      For pigs,where purchased foods account for nearly two-thirds of thecost of production, the minimum price might be some 25 - 30per cent below the current actual price.10. It has been agreed that wool shall be added to the list of products covered by Part  I of the Agriculture Act,provided that satisfactory arrangements are made for collec-tive marketing.      Proposals for a marketing scheme for woolhave been submitted to us by the Farmers&apos; Unions of theUnited Kingdom, and we expect that this will come into opera-tion in time to apply to the 1950 clip.      It is therefore desirable to include in the discussions with the Farmers&apos;Unions the minimum prices to be fixed for wool up to 1953/54-The price -paid to farmers for wool has gone up much less thanthat of other agricultural commodities (the index figure forwool for 1949 was only 159 compared with 231-g- for allcommodities and 229 for livestock and livestock products),and in the interests of securing the desired expansion ofour sheep population we consider that in order to giveconfidence to the breeders of sheep, where the price of woolis an important considerations there should be no great fallin present price levels.      We accordingly propose that theminimum prices should be fixed at a level of some 10 per centbelow the current actual price to farmers.      The Governmentare at present making a profit on the sale of home-producedwool and the proposed minimum price is some 30 per cent belowthe average realised price for the 1949 clip after deducting-all expenses.      This would afford a substantial margin tocover any probable decline in world prices, and in any event the sum involved,  if the Exchequer guarantee had to be invoked, would be relatively small.11. Details of the actual and minimum prices for thecurrent year and of the suggested minimum prices for 1952/53and 1953/54 are given in Appendix I.12. The results of the discussions with the Unionswill;, of course, be reported to our colleagues before minimum prices are finally fixed and announced.SUMMARY(i)    Minimum prices for fat stock, milk and eggs in1952/53 and 1953/54 must be fixed in the near future after discussion with the Farmers&apos; Unions.      Concurrently we mustsettle any other factors that would affect the farmers&apos; returnsuch as, if necessary,, the amount of the assured market.(ii)    For political and administrative reasons it is recommended that no quantitative limits on the assured market should be set in the period up to 1953/54.(iii)    To lessen the risk of unduly heavy Exchequercommitments arising from guaranteed prices for milk and eggs,production  of which is expanding most rapidly, minimum prices of these products should be about 30 - 35 per centbelow current actual prices,  or possibly rather lower foreggs.

(iv)    For fat cattle and sheep our negotiators should seek the agreement of the Unions to minimum prices at or about the levels already fixed (for minimum prices) for1951/52 and for pigs a little higher.(v)    In anticipation that wool will be  shortly addedto the list of guaranteed price commodities and. to encouragesheep breeding, minimum prices for wool might be fixed at about 10 per cent below current prices to farmers and 30per cent below the net prices realised by the Government.J.

APPENDIX ii report OF AN INT.SRDEPARTMENTAL WORKING party on THE QUANTITATIVE LIMITATION OF ASSURED MARKETS1,     We were asked to examine and to report on the methods by which quantitative limitations could be set to the government&apos;s commitment to pay guaranteed prices for milk and eggs,2.      Limitation of the quantity covered by the Government&apos;sguarantee is impracticable for the following reasons:-(i)    the limit could not in practice apply to production but only to sales throughauthorised channels.    The problem of disposing of the surplus seems insoluble.It could only be wasted or sold in competition with the guaranteed quantity.(ii)    individual quotas would have to be fixed,and such a system would prevent theexpansion of low cost producers at theexpense of the high cost producers.(iii)    the total effect would be restrictive and politically undesirable.We have therefore confined ourselves to methods of limitingfinancial liabilities,Effect of minimum price and financial limitations3,     We are very doubtful whether tho fixing of minimum prices at any practicable level would of itself effectively discourageproduction.    The actual prices negotiated year by year at the february review have so far been so much higher than theminima that farmers now have little reason for basing the scale of their operations on the minima.    It is our view that evenif the minimum prices were buttressed by some form of quantitativlimitation,  farmers would, on the whole, still regard them asopen to substantial improvement when the actual prices came tobe negotiated.    For the majority of farmers, therefore, thedisincentive to excess production will only become effectivewhen actual prices are fixed and we cannot expect thatadjustments of the minima will &quot;be of much value in preventing the development of surpluses.4.      The fixing of definite limitations to the Exchequerguarantees would, however, leave room for the Government todecide, when actual prices come to he negotiated, the extentto which any reduction in retail prices resulting from increased sales off farms should be reflected in lower farm prices or borne by taxpayers.    Such limitations are meansof limiting the financial commitment of the Government, and,in the view of the Working Party, this should be emphasizedin Government announcements both so that it may be understoodthat there is no question of deliberate Government limitation to the volume of efficient production.and so that the highercosts producers can be given fair warning that the Governmenthas provided effective means of reducing the financial support given to their operations.-

5.      Having regard to these considerations, we suggest thatthe following principles should apply to any measures taken for limiting the Governments financial commitments in fulfilment of the promise of assured markets(i) they must allow room for manoeuvre so that whenactual prices are fixed, they can he fixed at a level that would discourage undesired production;(ii)    they should not deter low cost producers fromexpanding in competition with high cost producers;(iii)    they should be as simple as possible to make themintelligible to the general body of producers;(iv)    they should be equitable as between individuals and regions.Possible Methods of applying: limitations6,      We have applied these principles in considering three alternative methods.(i)    minimum prices fixed now and related by a formula to output in the previous year, so that ifproduction exceeds a certain figure in 1951/52the minimum for 1952/53 falls automatically andso on;(ii)    an income determined by the minimum price&quot;&quot;&quot; multiplied by the desired output.    Actualprices would be fixed to equal or exceed this,(iii)    a two tier price structure with two minimum prices,  one a high one for the required output;the other a low one for the surplus  output.7.      The first method involves fixing a series of minimaaccording to output instead of a single minimum price foreach commodity.    As the minimum price applicable to eachyear must be known at the time of the appropriate FebruaryReview, such a system must be based on the previous year&apos;output.    It is quite feasible both for milk and eggs.    It hasthe advantage over a low minimum price fixed now that theminimum being linked to output would not appear to be so low and might be more acceptable to the farmers.    Its effect ismuch the same as a low minimum price;  it would allow a lowactual price to be fixed when the time came,  if necessary.It would not protect the Exchequer against any excessiveproduction due for example to favourable weather conditions,during the year to which it relates.8.      The fixed income method would mean that actual prices could only be provisionally fixed at the time of the FebruaryReview,  as the total output would not be known until the endof the year.    In practice any disincentive applied in theactual price might be delayed until the final settlement.This method could, however, be put on a monthly basis to avoid this weakness,    A slight abnormality in the weather might affect monthly output considerably while not affectingyearly or even seasonal output.    Monthly quotas fixed so far ahead might involve substantial injustice to individualfarmers in different parts of the country.    The minimumfixed income method is unlikely to&apos; be acceptable to theNational Farmers Unions since the farming community as a whole

might derive no benefit from additional production.Individual farmers would, however, get an additional returnfor their additional production.9.      The third method involves a return in principle to thepre-war method of pooling milk receipts.    It has the samedrawback as the previous method in that the actual prices are not known in advance.    As a price is paid for the excess output the objections to monthly quotas would bemuch less.    There would have to be separate quotas for thedifferent regions.10.    The two methods described in paragraphs 8 and .9 arenot feasible for eggs.    There is no administrative machinein existence for making the complex payments involved.    Theyare feasible for milk but not in our view desirable sincethe advantages to be gained from these systems could be gained equally well by the more intelligible method of fixing very low minimum prices.    This latter method isquite legal under the Argiculture Act.11.    In our view therefore the problem can best be solved byfixing minimum prices low enough to allow for possible falls in farm costs due to lower feeding stuff   prices and/orgreater efficiency or for a fall in retail prices due toan increase in sales off farms.    This method isadministratively simple but it does depend for its effecton the minima being low.    Should it not be possible to agreesuch minimum prices with the National Farmers Unions, andshould the Government be unwilling to fix these priceswithout agreement, as it has every right to, then the other methods of limiting the Exchequer guarantees would have tobe re-examined.12.    The other devices mentioned may be of use in fixingactual prices to protect the Treasury against an unforeseensurplus.    It is important that further consideration shouldbe given to this problem before the next Price Review.28th April, 1950
