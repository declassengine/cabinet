(50) 13th Conclusions,Minute 7), I was invited to submit, after consultation with the Home Secretary,the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Health, a memorandum on the problems arising from the immigration into this country of coloured people from british colonial territories.(b) In this paper the word &quot; colonial&quot; refers collectively to all the Colonies,Protectorates and Trust Territories administered under the Colonial Office.General background. The community of colonial people and their families in this country isestimated to number from 20,000 to 30,000. For the most part these persons live in Liverpool, Cardiff and Manchester, on Tyneside and in the East End of London:there are smaller groups in other centres, notably in Birmingham, Leeds, Hulland Bolton. Although they tend to congregate together and to prefer their ownsociety, the great majority look on themselves as residents of the United Kingdomand have no intention of returning to their Colonies of origin.Pre-war Position2. Before the 1914-18 war, few coloured people of colonial origin lived here.During that war many colonials served in the Merchant Navy and later settleddown in this country. Some were able to remain in. sea-going employment, but upto the beginning of the 1939 war, there was a steady fall in the demand for colonialfiremen, and the majority had to find employment ashore. This was not easyowing to prevalent unemployment, and there were racial difficulties which led tooccasional riots.  -Developments during the war. On the outbreak of the 1939 war, coloured colonials were recruited inthe Colonies and were brought over to this country for war service. Others cameover voluntarily.  The main developments were-(a) A group of 1,200 British Honduranians were brought here to fell timberin Scotland. Of these only 700 accepted repatriation. Most of the resthave settled down in Scotland and the North of England. :(b) About 1,000 West Indian technicians and trainees were recruited for service in war factories on Merseyside and in Lancashire. (Mr. L. Constantinewas employed by the Ministry of Labour as a Welfare Officer to look after this group of men during their war service.)(c) 10,000 West Indians were recruited for service in the Royal Air Force, to;serve in Britain as ground crews.  When the war ended, approximately8,000 of these men were repatriated, and  the rest took  their:.. discharge here.     ,      ,38743&apos; to
id) Some thousands of men were either recruited or enlisted in the merchant navy. Large numbers of them were engaged to fill casual vacanciesand not all of them were based on United Kingdom ports. With thereturn to normal conditions the demand for the services of colouredcolonial seamen has been much reduced.4. All the men recruited under special schemes were eligible for repatriation;but, though persistent efforts were made to induce as many of them as possibleto return home, a good many preferred to remain in this country. Some of these have not settled down satisfactorily and are unemployed from time to time.5. Another reinforcement of the colonial population came from stowaways,chiefly fom the West Indies and West Africa. Before the war, the number of coloured stowaways was not large, and most were refused permission to landbecause they could not satisfy Immigration Officers by producing passports that theywere British or British-protected persons. From 1941 onwards, however, thenumber increased. At about the same time it was being represented to the Govern-ment that the treatment of coloured protected persons was out of keeping with thecircumstances of the times and the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as regardscolonial peoples, and that it contrasted unfavourably with the fact that theseprotected persons were treated by British Consulates in foreign territories in thesame way as British subjects, and were also subject to the same war-time disciplineas United Kingdom seamen. In 1942, therefore, the special restrictions as to registration, &amp;c, of coloured seamen from the Protectorates were abolished and coloured persons coming here as seamen for discharge, as passengers, or as stow-aways were not refused admission for lack of documentary evidence as to their national status. They had at that time no difficulty in finding employment here.Developments since the War6. Since 1945 there has been a substantial increase in the number of colouredpersons arriving in the United Kingdom. They comprise fare-paying passengers and stowaways, mainly from the West Indies and West Africa, and coloured seamensigned on in overseas ports who take their discharge here in the hope of findingregular sea employment. The causes of the influx are complex: in the case ofthe West Indies it appears to be due to unemployment and under-employment inthat area; and the presumption that the labour shortage here was so acute that employment could easily be found: in the case of West Africa, the higher standardof living and social services here appear to be the main attraction.7. A large number of the immigrant workers who have arrived here since thewar comprise West Indians who served in the Royal Air Force during the war and used their gratuities to pay their passages back to the United Kingdom. They arenot handicapped by language difficulties and have a much better understanding ofBritish ways of life than the average West African. There are no statistics avail-able but it is understood that approximately 2,000 migrant workers have arrived from the West Indies, chiefly from Jamaica, since 1945, mostly in large partiestravelling in troopships at cheap rates. In 1949, the number of such arrivalsdropped considerably. This was due partly to shipping difficulties and partly to thefact that fewer men could now afford the cost of passages. Nevertheless untilunemployment in Jamaica is reduced there is bound to be a desire among many persons there to seek work overseas.8. In response to representations from the colonies themselves, my predecessors-cessor set up a Departmental Committee in 1948 to advise whether there was anyscope in the United Kingdom for the introduction under official auspices of surpluscolonial labour. It was not found possible to promote any schemes which wouldgive substantial help to the colonies, but two small groups of people have been recruited from St. Helena and Barbados.9. Since the war there have been three occasions upon which disturbancesbetween groups of coloured persons and others have called for special police actionto restore law and order. These were at Liverpool from 31st July to 2nd August,1948, at Deptford on 18th July, 1949, and at an industrial hostel near Birminghamfrom 6th to 8th August, 1949. Isolated disturbances occur from time to timeinvolving individual Coloured men, and the police in the areas with aggregationsof coloured persons keep a special watch for any incidents likely to provoke ageneral disturbance.
The present situation10. It is among the new voluntary arrivals and persons who came here forwar service and did not return that the main problems of housing, employment and relief of distress now arise.11. In view of the continuing influx, an inter-Departmental meeting was heldat the Home Office on 18th February, 1949, to consider what action could be takenby the Government Departments concerned, namely the Colonial Office, the HomeOffice, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Health the Ministry of transport and the National Assistance Board. It was decided to concentrate action underthe following heads: -(a) To press Colonial Governments to reduce the flow at the source by making it known that jobs and accommodation in the United Kingdom are not too easily found, by not issuing passports to persons who cannot pay their passages or are obviously of the type who do not welcome regular employment, and by imposing greater controls at the ports to preventstowing away.(b) To stiffen up immigration practice at United Kingdom ports by a returnto the pre-1942 practice of requiring all arrivals from any destinationto produce satisfactory evidence of British nationality.(c) To set up a working party of representatives of the Government Depart-ments concerned to tackle the problem of those colonials already hereby dispersal, by finding employment and accommodation, and by arranging for voluntary repatriation of the misfits.Action Taken12.   Action so far taken under these heads is briefly as follows:-(a) (i) In general Colonial Governments have made it their practice to warnpotential immigrants of conditions in the United Kingdom and to refusepassports in proper cases. My predecessor sent a despatch to the governors of the Colonies suggesting ways and means of preventingstowing away in colonial ports, it is too early yet to say how farColonial Governments will be able to take effective measures,(ii) Many stowaways from West Africa have produced British TravelCertificates. These documents are issued by the British authorities in west African territories only for travel between those territories, but,as they certify the holder&apos;s nationality, Immigration Officers in theUnited Kingdom have had no option but to accept them. I am seeing whether these Certificates can be changed into documents merelycertifying identity and place of residence, without any reference to national status: if this can be done it should reduce substantially thenumber of stowaways from West Africa who are admitted here.(b) (i) On 19th September, 1949, the Home Office issued revised instructionsto Immigration Officers enabling them to refuse leave to land to personswho cannot provide satisfactory evidence that they are British subjectsor British protected persons. This was in effect a return to the pre-1942practice, and as a result there has been a slight decline in the numberof stowaways given leave to land,(ii) I have sent a despatch to all maritime Colonies recommending the intro-duction of a standard certificate of nationality and identity for allcolonial seamen and the verification of these men&apos;s nationality beforethe document is issued. If this standard document is brought into use it will reduce the possibility of aliens entering the United Kingdom as british subjects with forged or improperly issued certificates.(c) The inter-Departmental working party began work in May 1949.   Thequestions With which it is mainly concerned are:--(i) Accommodation-The stowaways and migrant workers have settled inthe main centres of colonial population and have thus aggravated the. poor conditions under which coloured people are living. An addeddifficulty is that, in places such as Liverpool and Cardiff, there is ageneral lack of employment.   Many of the men are unmarried and38743 3 2
:, are not eligible for housing by local authorities..; ;Ther.e,.,. is,,., some-i    prejudice on the part of landladies and others against accommodatingcoloured people.(ii) Employment.-This prejudice is exacerbated in areas where there is substantial general unemployment or in establishments where whitewomen are employed.The principal obstacle, however, is the attitude of some of the: coloured colonials themselves and their undisciplined behaviour whenthey secure employment. This applies to the men who are new to thiscountry and not to the second generation. Nevertheless, the problem ofunemployment is comparatively small. A special enquiry undertaken by the Ministry of Labour last July showed that in the main centresthere were about 1,200 men out of work. The majority of these werein Liverpool (540), London (East End) (278), Wales (mainly Cardiff)(101) and Manchester (129). Of this total of 1,200 nearly 500 were menwho represented themselves as seamen.There is a constant turnover of men, and except in Liverpool, andto some extent Cardiff, the total of unemployed does hot represent astatic figure of men who are unable to obtain work. For example,while there were 137 coloured colonial unemployed in Manchester inNovember, the Ministry of Labour had placed 262 in employment inthe previous six months, 82 had obtained seagoing employment and56 had found work by their own efforts. At Stepney, where there is a relatively large coloured colonial community, 203 men had been foundemployment in the month ended 6th February this year.The Ministry of Labour are trying to transfer men in areas suchas Liverpool and London to areas in the country where there are acutelabour shortages. In spite of accommodation difficulties some successhas already been achieved with the help of the National Service HostelsCorporation.The most difficult problem is that of seamen, genuine or otherwise,who cannot get seagoing employment and who are often neither suitablefor, nor willing to take, shore employment away from the ports.(iii) Repatriation-Destitute or incapacitated persons who would otherwise be likely to become a continual charge on public funds can now be repatriated to their colonies at public expense. The cost of repatriationis met by the National Assistance Board if it can be established that thecost cannot be met from any other source. Before men are sent home,enquiries are made in the colonies to see if the next-of-kin can meet thewhole or part of the cost.There are some individuals who are outside the scope of the presentrepatriation arrangements. Generally these are able-bodied men for whom work can be found by the Ministry of Labour. Men in this category are only offered repatriation when they are likely to become a continual charge on public funds and it is clearly in the public interest that they should be sent home. Some difficulty has been caused byshipowners who engage colonial seamen in foreign or Dominion portswithout a repatriation clause in the articles of agreement. In general,it is not possible to exercise control over the recruitment of these men inforeign ships, but a despatch is being sent to Colonial Governments tosee if any effective measures can be taken locally to obtain this control.A bigger difficulty arises from the fact that a number of colonial seamenon arrival in the United Kingdom have forfeited or voluntarily waivedtheir repatriation rights. These men are usually paid off here, but, as there is no shortage of labour in the shipping industry, it has not beenpossible for more than a handful of them to be absorbed in seagoingemployment. The Ministry of Transport and the shipping industry haverecently reminded overseas representatives and the Masters of shipsrespectively to see that in all cases where colonial seamen are signed onthere should be a repatriation clause in the articles of agreement, so thaton arrival in this country the men may be repatriated at the expenseof the shipping company concerned. No British coloured person can,however, be compelled to accept repatriation if he does not wish to go,and in many cases men recruited in this way decide to stay and trytheir luck.
(iv) Colour discrimination. As already mentioned, there is a certain amountof prejudice in this country against coloured people; for example,reluctance on the part of landladies to accept them as lodgers, andother manifestations on the part of private employers and workers andin social activities. This prejudice is not, however, capable of beingovercome by direct legislative or administrative action. The Informa-tion Department of the Colonial Office is carrying out a planned pro-gramme of work designed to make the British public better informed about the Colonies and their peoples and to promote mutual under-standing. Apart from this, the best service which the Colonial OfficeOffice and other Departments of Government can render in this fieldis to grapple with the administrative problems in connection with the immigration, residence and employment of the relatively small group of coloured people who have not yet been absorbed into the normallife and work of the country, to see that they have their fair share ofthe amenities and opportunities available to the community in general,and to stimulate voluntary interest and service on their behalf.Future Action13. My Department has been under some pressure from Parliamentary andpublic sources to take special action in the way of setting up clubs and providingwelfare officers to attend to the special needs of these people. It would, however,be a wrong policy to treat the colonial residents as a class apart from the community in general, though it must be recognised that they do need special guidance. Apartfrom the settled colonial community only some three or four thousand persons are involved, and by careful and continual attention to their needs I am confident thatthe problem can be kept within bounds without resort to any drastic measures.There are, however, certain lines of action which my Department can follow toprevent the problem from growing in size and getting out of hand. These linesare generally as follows:  (i) Pressure will be maintained on Colonial Governments to take all possible measures to prevent the embarkation of stowaways in Colonial ports.It will not be possible for any action to be taken to control theirembarkation in foreign ports, apart from pressure on shipping companies.(ii) The Colonial Office will, in consultation with Colonial Governments,continue to discourage the migration of unskilled workers from theWest Indies, and to reduce the opportunities for aliens to obtainirregular documents which might gain them entry to the United King-dom. Colonial Governments will be kept fully informed of thedifficulties which men may expect to find on arrival in this countryand will be asked to make them widely known among the public.(iii) Efforts will continue to be made in consultation with voluntary organisa-tions and local authorities to deal effectively with the social welfare ofnew additions to the colonial communities in the United Kingdom,particularly in regard to housing and social amenities. With this object in view, I propose to consult with non-official voluntary organisationssuch as the British Council of Churches and the National Council of social Service.(iv) The Colonial Office will continue to co-operate with the Ministry ofLabour in their efforts to reduce by dispersal the number of unemployedcolonials living in areas where work is not readily available.J.
