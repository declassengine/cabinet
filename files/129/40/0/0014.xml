(50) 11419th May, 1950CABINETCONVERSATIONS WITH Mr. ACHESON ON 9th and 10th MAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the following account of myrecent conversations with the United States Secretary of State. Mr. Acheson andI met to discuss matters of common United Kingdom and United States interest on 9th and 10th May. I attach a copy of the agenda for our talks (Annex A).General       &apos;2: We first considered a paper, which had been prepared by our officials,giving a general assessment of our common position and stating our common world-wide objectives. I attach a copy of this paper at Annex B.3. In discussing this paper Mr. Acheson stressed the seriousness of thesituation as the Americans saw it. The Soviet Union had considerably widenedthe gap in armed preparedness between itself and the West. As a result we might find the Soviet Union entering, upon more and more provocative and adventurouspolicies in the next three or four years. Unless the West could build up sufficient strength to deter the Soviet Union from such policies, we should be faced with avery dangerous situation some time between the end of 1952 and the beginningof 1954, when the Soviet Union might embark upon courses of action which weshould either have to accept or fight with insufficient forces at our disposal. Hethought the two main tasks of the West were to get the Medium-Term Plan whichhad been put forward by the Atlantic Defence Ministers properly started, and tobuild up a stable and rationalised Western economy which would be capable of supporting both the military effort&apos;and the high standards of living to which theWest was accustomed.4. I agreed generally with Mr. Acheson&apos;s analysis and pointed out that theUnited Kingdom, being nearer to the Continent, was even more aware than theUnited States of the dangers arising from a great preponderance of military power in the hands of any one continental State. I also pointed out that it seemed likely that the Russians would for the time being concentrate particularly on Germanyand South-East Asia. They would probably act by trying to promote civil warin the two areas, thereby placing the maximum strain on the West on two widelyseparate fronts, while themselves nominally taking no part in the disturbances.To meet this threat I was entirely in agreement that the West must build up a systemof strength. This system could not be based on Western Europe alone or on theBritish Commonwealth together with Western Europe. The only hope lay in thebuilding&apos;up of a whole Atlantic community whose productive capacity, fightingability, inventive power and morale was greater than that of Russia. The United38748 B
Kingdom was ready to play an active part within any such system, but could onlycarry the major burden it bore on behalf of the West if the continued and successful operation of the sterling area could be assured.5. -While agreeing with Mr. Acheson on the urgent need to build up sufficientmilitary strength to deter the Russians from any adventurous policies, I said that ourpresent defence budget of  780 millions a year was about all this country couldstand. The whole question must be looked at against the background of our balance of payments situation, and we could not find more money for defence bycalling upon the people of this country for further sacrifices. Until we could earnmore from our exports we were therefore hampered in our efforts to do more for common Atlantic defence.Anglo-American Relations6. There was a general discussion on Items 3, 4 and 5 of the agenda in which mr. Acheson made the following important points:  (a) The United States and the United Kingdom should work in the closest possible relations in every field and should have constant consultationto ensure common action.(b) It had always been the policy of the United States Administration tosupport sterling and the stability of the sterling system, althoughoccasionally sections of American public opinion might seem to throwsome doubt on this.(c) There were bound to be differences on specific economic items such as theEuropean Payments Union, Britain&apos;s sterling oil policy and othermatters. These were under consideration by the appropriate bodies andour main objective should be to see that these differences of opinion on specific problems did not prejudice our wider interest of close co-opera-tion before the world.7. Mr. Acheson said that he appreciated the United Kingdom&apos;s economic difficulties. What was needed in the West was to find some broad economic basis which would allow of the diversion of man-power to the military effort togetherwith the maintenance of the economic life of each individual Atlantic country.He repeated the statement made by Dr. Jessup (which I have already reported tomy colleagues in paragraph 6 of C.P. (50) 92) about the intention of the UnitedStates Administration to find a means of supporting European countries after theend of the European Recovery Programme. In the United States the president had appointed Mr. Gordon Gray to examine what could be done in all depart-ments so that American internal economic policies could be adjusted to the widerneeds of the Western system. He was also examining how the investment programme could be used to serve the general objective and to strengthen other areas. It was hoped that by the summer a Commission could be set up toco-ordinate the recommendations by Mr. Gray and put them before the american public as steps necessary in the general Western interest. American public opinion would, however, only be prepared to accept these internal policies if it felt thatany sacrifices which the United States were called upon to make were merely a partof a wider programme designed to improve. Atlantic defence and that similarsacrifices were being accepted by the European countries. It was not possible nowto go to the American people and persuade them to adopt lower tariffs on purelyintellectual grounds. Action in Europe must be undertaken to increase both pro-duction and productivity. If this action were taken it might be possible to maintainthe standard of living and increase the defence effort and at the same time persuade the American public to take similar steps to help the European countries in their efforts., 8- This led Mr. Acheson to a discussion on the French proposal for thefuture development of European-Western Hemisphere economic relations on thebasis of an association between the O.E.E.C. on the one hand and the UnitedStates and Canada on the other.9. I pointed out that in our view it was premature to take a decision of thiskind at the present juncture. The underlying motive for the French proposal was clearly French unwillingness the see Western Germany associated in any way withthe Atlantic Treaty.  On the other hand, although at the moment it would be
highly undesirable to take any step which would point to the possibility of anysuch German association, if Germany was one day to become an equal partnerin the Western system it was clear that there must be a wider organisation than a purely European one into which she could fit. We therefore felt that no steps should be taken now which might prejudice future developments. What wasnecessary now was that a study should be made of how to implement Article 2of the Atlantic Treaty. The question of the place which the O.E.E.C. and theCouncil of Europe would take in the general structure could be dealt with in thecourse of this study. What we wished to avoid was the setting up of two bodies,one with an O.E.E.C. trend and another with an Atlantic orientation. For thetime being, of course, the European Powers were ready to give ail the informationnecessary to the Americans to assist them in their task of studying post-1952developments, and the Americans could seek any aid they wished from the O.E.E.C.But we could not agree to the inception of any organic relation between theUnited States and Canada on the one hand and the O.E.E.C. on the other:10. Mr. Acheson said that he thought the British view seemed justifiable andthe matter might be dealt with along these lines in the tripartite conversations.11. Before ending the general discussion, Mr. Acheson also raised thequestion of East-West trade and stressed that the problem should be raised fromthe technical to the Ministerial level, since the decisions to be taken were reallypolitical ones. It was agreed that officials should prepare memoranda for con-sideration. It emerged that negotiations on this subject were proceeding normallyin Paris between representatives of the United States and the Western european countries concerned, and Mr. Acheson was content to allow these negotiations to continue without further Ministerial talks at this stage.12. I particularly drew Mr. Acheson&apos;s attention to the paper prepared by officials on &quot; Continued Consultation on and Co-ordination of Policy,&quot; which I attach as Annex C. Mr. Acheson, while agreeing entirely with the general content of the paper, pointed out that it was impossible for him to give any publicapproval to anything so specific as the recommendations made in this document.Provided, however, that the paper did not become public property he thought itmight serve as a general code of conduct to be observed by both sides in theirdealings with each other.North Atlantic Treaty Machinery13. Mr. Acheson and I discussed the proposals which had emerged from theofficial meetings. In the course of discussion it emerged that the Americans thought this machinery would consist of some kind of continuing group composed of deputies to the Ministers of the North Atlantic Council. The group should beheaded by a Chairman, who was also the deputy of his country, who would bea man of some stature and who would be able to give drive and direction to thenew organisation. The Americans favoured Europe as the locality for the new organisation.14. I said that the machinery proposed by* officials seemed broadly satis-factory. I felt that the leading figure of the new organisation should be an american, but stressed that his appointment should be by the Council and thathis powers to take action, as indeed those of the new group as a whole, would flow from the Council. With regard to a directive for the new organisation, I felt it was premature to draw up any such document until (a) we had agreed on the precise form of machinery to be set up; and(b) the Atlantic Council had examined the various reports before it andsettled what action it wished to take on them.15. Mr. Acheson and I agreed that the question of machinery should befurther looked at by our officials in order to make it quite clear that the new body to be set up was merely a projection of the Council and drew all its powers fromthe Council. We also agreed that the question of a directive should be left over until the Council meeting.Germany16. Mr. Acheson and I both agreed on the great importance to be attachedto the winning of Germany to the West, which would be a major defeat for the38748 b 2
Russians. I pointed out that in order to achieve success in this field the western powers should be prepared to move fast and generously should the Germans show themselves willing to co-operate peacefully in the development of a western european community by their actions in the O.E.E.C arid the Council of Europe.We were both agreed on the desirability of avoiding any talk about the rearmamentof the Germans. Mr. Acheson suggested that if Germany showed willingness tobe a law-abiding member of the Western community, one of the first steps to betaken might be to bring about a change in the conception of the Occupation Forces.These could become less of a police force to ensure good behaviour, and be regardedmore as outposts of the general Western defence system. The German contributionto occupation costs could then be presented in the light of a contribution to theWestern defence system as a whole.Relations with the Soviet Union17. There was a short discussion on the paper attached as Annex D, preparedby officials along the lines already reported in paragraph 8 of CP. (50) 92.Mr. Acheson and I accepted the paper as a guiding document for action in the fields not covered.Middle East General18. Mr. Acheson and I reviewed the discussions on the Middle East whichhad taken place between officials. Mr. Acheson noted and reaffirmed our generalagreement on policy and objectives in the Middle East.Persia19. It was noted that Persia is a particularly vulnerable country. There wasagreement on the following steps: -(a) The desirability of securing the passage of the supplemental oil agreement,which will give Persia substantial benefits which she requires for theexecution of the Seven-Year Plan.ib) The desirability of a loan to Persia from the Export-Import Bank, whichis now in prospect.(c) Constant pressure upon Persia to make further social and economicreforms.id) A statement about Persia by our two Governments in due course.Saudi Arabia20. It was agreed that discussion should continue between our two delegationsabout the boundary dispute between Saudi Arabia and some of the Persian GulfStatesIsrael and the Arab States21. There was agreement on the desirability of an early statement by the americans and ourselyes, in which the French might join, containing:  id) A statement by the two (or three) Governments of firm opposition to anyattack by one Middle East State against another. This ought tocontribute to removing the fears of both Israel and of the Arab Statesthat each would be attacked by the other, and ought also to havea stabilising effect between Saudi Arabia and the Hashemites.ib) A statement of a common policy about the supply of arms to Middle Eastcountries on the basis of assurances that they had no intention of attacking any of their neighbours.22. There was approval of the general lines of a statement in this sense whichhad been prepared on the official level. It was agreed that the two delegationsshould work out the details together as soon as possible.Indian Sub-Continent23. &quot;Mr; Actiesoii,.ahcl.I.&apos;agreed.&apos;that there-.was no^obl^m to be discussed in connection withthe Indian Sub-Cdntinent. There was a close harmony ofUnited Kingdom and United States views.
South-East Asia - &apos; - &quot;&apos;&apos;24. The same applied to South-East Asia, and in fact the subject was notraised in the bipartite Ministerial talks. :        ,China... . *25. In accordance with the Cabinefs decision of 24th April (CM. (50) 24thConclusions, Minute 5), I took the opportunity to review with Mr. Acheson therelations of both our Governments with China. The ground had already been covered by officials in the paper attached as Annex E. I explained that we ourselvesfelt that it was essential to keep a foot in the door in case things should work outfavourably, though we were assailed by many doubts as to the possible outcome.Mr. Acheson stated that nothing had happened to change the present policy ofthe United States and that the solution to such important problems as Chineserepresentation in the United Nations, Nationalist bombing and pressure to guarantee the integrity of Formosa was not yet clear. In brief, it became apparentfrom my talks with Mr. Acheson that the United States Administration, owingin part to pressure and attacks from the Republicans, have no positive or indeedany policy towards China at all.26. It was, however, generally agreed that the two countries should continue for the time being to follow their respective present policies, but that it was essential for the two Governments to keep in close touch and not allow differences in China to affect any other of their policies.Japan.27. I explained to Mr. Acheson that our position in regard to the question ofa Japanese Peace Treaty was growing more and more awkward because we werebeing constantly reproached by various interests who asked what the position was, and everyone knew that we were in very close touch with the United States.Mr. Acheson stated that the dilemma in which the United States Governmentfound themselves on the question of security still existed and remained unresolved.The State Department, however, had been thinking of two possible alternatives,namely:  (a) A Treaty containing the fewest possible enforcement provisions, accom-panied by a separate instrument in which as many of the Far eastern commission countries as possible would enter into a treaty with one another and also with Japan; in the first instance to prevent aggression and in the second to protect Japan against aggression. In the latter case, Japan would undertake to give military facilities in her terri-tories in return for protection.(b) An intermediate stage in which the controls of occupation would beremoved and sovereignty returned to Japanj which would have inter-national relations with other Powers. But S.CA.P. and the occupationwould remain in order to protect Japan. (The United States service authorities preferred this alternative.)Mr. Acheson was anxious that what he told me should not receive a widecirculation.28. Here again, as over China, it is unsatisfactory to note that the UnitedStates Government are still without any definite policy.. * .......Colonial Questions29. I took the opportunity of stressing to Mr. Acheson how important itwas that the Americans should not undermine our position in the Colonial field.Britain was making a big contribution to the common cause and it would be fatalif this contribution were lessened by the loss of Colonies by the Western european powers, since they were an essential part of the foundation of European economicexistence. What was needed was constant exchange of views and sympathetic consideration by the Americans of our policies. Otherwise we would find ourselvesbeing dragged along in the wake of vociferous but irresponsible members of theUnited Nations.
Foreign Office, SWA,19th May, 1950.30. Mr. Acheson said that he entirely agreed with this point of view andthat he saw from the report of discussions between officials that it was nowproposed that we should have the closest consultation before United Nationsmeetings so as to be able to present a united front. He was ready to agree to this.31. It was noted with satisfaction that progress towards closer agreementover the approach to colonial and, in particular, African problems had been made.It was agreed that there should be further talks between officials, probably at thebeginning of June.E.

ANNEX B[MIN/uk us/P/36th May, 1950]MINISTERIAL TALKS:  UNITED KINGDOM/UNITED STATESReview and Agreement on Common World-wide Objectives in the Light of assessment of the Current World-wide situation the preparatory discussions between officials of the three Governments resultin the,following analysis of the current world-wide situation:-A. General situation. The balance of military power in the last twelve months has shifted in favourof the Soviet Union, and the present situation is one of increasing danger. their possession of the atomic bomb is of cardinal importance, but will not of itselfbecome a direct military factor until the Russians acquire a stockpile. The Sovietsare trying out weak spots in the Western position throughout the world, and havinggot possession of the atomic weapon and strengthened armaments generally, theymay feel inclined to take greater risks than hitherto.2. But the strength of the Soviet position should not be overestimated. Itsuffers from certain fundamental weaknesses, namely, the relationship of suspicionand fear between ruler and ruled, the similar relationship with Satellite Govern-ments and peoples, the problem of Stalin&apos;s succession, and the fact that the systemdepends on &quot; dynamic advance &quot; and is liable to be endangered by any majorcheck.3. Among the factors which can be counted to the credit of the West overthe past year are: id) economic recovery in Western Europe; (b) the defectionof Tito; (c) the success in Berlin; id) the signature of the North Atlantic Treaty;ie) the holding of the position in Western Germany; (f) the fact that there has been no economic slump. Finally it should be remembered that the Russians usuallymove with great caution in foreign affairs.4. The defection of Tito may, in the general balance sheet, in the Americanview, largely offset the Soviet victory in China. This view is not shared by theFrench and United Kingdom representatives.5. It is not thought likely that, apart from a miscalculation, the Soviets willlaunch a war for the next few years. The really dangerous point would come whenthey feel they are strong enough to deliver a decisive aerial attack.9.   Japan. MIN/uk us/P/14.   .10.   South-East Asia especially Indo-China.

^-Particular Situations10. Germany. The holding of the situation in Berlin and the establishment ofthe German Federal Republic constituted important gains for the West in a vitalarea of the struggle. The Soviet Government have, however, also made great efforts in recent months to consolidate the Communist position in Eastern Germanyand to keep up the pressure on the Western Powers, particularly in Berlin. To retain the initiative in Germany the Western Powers must continue to pursue energeticallythe policy agreed upon in Paris in November 1949 of promoting the closer associa-tion of the German Federal Republic with the West and of developing the prestige and authority of the Federal Government as the only representative Governmentin Germany. It is our aim to work for the integration of Germany in the european community.11. Meanwhile it would be a mistake to consider the German problem simplyas a factor in the relations between the Soviet Union and the Western Powers. TheGerman problem must also be considered on its own merits against a Europeanbackground and account must be taken of the relations to be established between germany and other European Powers.12. South-East Asia. Since the end of the war the dominant theme in thegreater part of South-East Asia has been nationalism and desire for freedom from colonial tutelage. The Communists have been to some extent successful in turningthis to their advantage, for example, by assuming leadership of the nationalistmovement in Indo-China. Measures already taken and still in process of institutionto satisfy the aspirations of the peoples of South-East Asia for political freedomhave, however, had varying, but on the whole encouraging, degrees of success inallaying but not in averting the danger that the area might make common causewith the Communists against the Western world. There thus remains the danger that the area, which is of great importance to the nations of the free worldstrategically, politically and economically, may yet be lost as a result of internalrevolts by supporters of international communism, within the borders of the various countries. The fact that China is at present under Communist control encouragedthese local Communists, tends to maintain the masses in a neutral or vacillatingattitude, and makes the retention of a free South-East Asia more difficult but evenmore necessary.6. Since the industrial potential of the Soviet Union is considerably less thanthat of the West, it is unlikely that they will court a major war, but since they are becoming more confident of protecting the Soviet Union from attack, they may,even in the immediate future, adopt increasingly aggressive policies at keyperipheral points such as Iran which the West would be obliged to accept or to counter with force, and they may be inclined now generally to take greater risksthan hitherto in areas where they think the West may be likely to acquiesce in a soviet advance.7. Germany is the central point of the struggle between East and west and is so regarded by the Soviets. If the Soviets lose the struggle for Germnythey may lose the initiative generally, and the principle of &quot; dynamic advance &quot;may come into play against them. Equally, the peaceful association of western germany with the Western Powers is essential to the latter, and to any effectivebuild-up of Western Europe which is of urgent importance.8. South-East Asia, including Burma, Indo-China and Malaya, is a weakspot in the Western position. So also is Iran. Potentially dangerous situations in varying degree exist also in the Philippines, Korea and the Indian sub-continent.In Greece the situation is greatly improved, but the strategic position of Greece is such that it must be kept under constant watch and it is vital that our control shouldbe maintained.9. The situation requires a determined effort by the Western countries to regain and maintain the initiative and to build up a position of strength through themaximum deployment of their joint resources to the end that peace may be preserved.
C. Broad Common Objectives13. In the light of the above assessment it appeared to the representatives ofthe three Governments in the preparatory discussions that the following should bethe broad common world-wide objectives:(a) The Western Powers must do their utmost to prevent further Sovietadvances in the world, by armed aggression, indirect aggression, orsubversion, which would strengthen the Soviet position in contrast tothe West. . -(b) Continuing economic progress and development is essential to the holding of the Western position.(c) The West must create a framework in which the maximum industrial andmilitary strength Can be deployed. This can only be done by the combined resources of the North Atlantic Treaty Powers acting so faras possible in co-operation with all other free nations.(d) This involves the building of economic strength necessary to support the requisite increased defence effort and at the same time to permitimprovement in standards of living, which in turn means, among neededsteps, increased productivity, better use of available man-power and,where possible, the development of freer trade and convertibility ofcurrencies.(e) The North Atlantic Treaty must therefore be strengthened through thedevelopment of common planning for defence, co-ordination of policies,and concerted action for the implementation of those policies.(/) The United States, United Kingdom and France, in working for their common purpose, should exercise their influence in such a manner asto take into account the aspirations of all the peoples of the free worldwhose best interests lie in close association with them and with each,other.(g) The West should regain and retain the psychological initiative, which meansbuilding faith in freedom into a dynamic force rather than something which is taken for granted, and increasing public understanding of the* nature, methods and danger of the forces by which it is threatened.(h) The efforts of the Western Nations should be directed towards reducing the risks of war and establishing the conditions of a lasting peaceful settle-ment. This requires the development of adequate strength andconsequently the combination of their efforts for building up thatstrength.(/) With the above objectives in mind and in the light of their obligations as members of the United Nations there should be close understanding and co-operation between the United States and the United Kingdom.It should be their aim, in their common interests and for the commonpurposes outlined above, to assist and strengthen each other.(/) It is in the interests of the two Governments that the position of France,as the leading Continental Power of Western Europe, should be strengthened.ANNEX C[MIN/uk us/P/56th May, 1950]MINISTERIAL TALKS:   UNITED KINGDOM/UNITED  STATESContinued Consultation on and Co-ordination of policy. It is the common purpose of the two countries to build up the strengthand closer unity of the non-Communist world.2. In working towards this purpose special burdens and responsibilities fall upon the United States and the United Kingdom. They would bear the principalbrunt of action in the event of war, and they have common interests not onlyin the Atlantic area but throughout the world.
3. If they work at cross purposes the effect to build up the strength of thenon-Communist world will be endangered, if not paralysed.4. In the light of these special responsibilities it is particularly desirable that,;in the light of their obligations as members of the United Nations and of their other associations, there should be continuous consultation and close co-ordinationof policy between them.5. It is, of course, recognised that the development of closer consultation withother like-minded Governments is desirable, and that opportunity should be takento develop the practice, which already takes place in a wide field.6. It is further recognised that the close relationship between the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom should assist closer United Kingdom relationswith Western Europe, and foster the development of closer relations between all members of the Atlantic Community.7. It will be of advantage if as a result of the present discussions commonobjectives can be identified both in geographical areas and in functional fields.An attempt should be made to bridge such divergencies of view as may be foundto exist. If there are points on which it is impossible for the time being to reach agreement, it should be the aim to limit as far as possible both the area of disagree-ment and the effect of such disagreement on other questions.8. If such a body of common objectives can be worked out, it would be ofadvantage to arrange for periodical reviews of them as a whole. One suggestionis that this might be done in one of the two capitals between the Foreign Secre-tary and the Ambassador of the other at intervals of perhaps two months.9. It should be an essential principle in the co-ordination of policy that it is contrary to the policy of either Government to injure the other or take advantageof the other. On the contrary, it should be their parallel and respective aim,within their agreed objectives, to strengthen and improve each other&apos;s position bylending each other all proper and possible support. This principle has already been recognised on both sides in a particular area, namely, the Middle East, and there-fore would not constitute a new departure.10. One field in which divergent attitudes might result in weakening of eachother&apos;s position in face of Communist attacks is the approach to colonial ques-tions. Further discussion and consultation is desirable with the aim of avoidingmisunderstandings and divergencies both in general approach and in discussions in the United Nations. In this general category of questions the problem of africa should receive special consideration.11. As regards the United Nations, it is highly desirable to avoid divergenciesat Lake Success and in general (subject always to special cases) to avoid situa-tions arising in which one country finds itself in the position of opposing or votingagainst the other. There might be advantage in extending the practice of consulta-tion prior to important meetings of the United Nations.12. Consultation in the specialised agencies of the United Nations mightbe further developed, and delegations attending technical conferences, e.g., onradio frequencies, might be briefed more fully in the light of general commonobjectives.13. In the strategic field it is noted with approval by both sides that theprinciple of close direct consultation is already established and is being put intoeffect.14. United Kingdom representatives suggest that the question of exchanges of security information, and certain questions concerning Atomic Energy, may requirediscussion later in the talks.15. Increased co-Ordination on information policies is desirable and shouldbe further discussed. There may be scope for some additional machinery forthis purpose.16. In the co-ordination of policy constant day-by-day exchanges of viewplay an important part. This is particularly valuable before policies are finallyformulated. Constant contact between officials at appropriate levels is animportant factor.
17. The appointment of officers specially qualified in particular fields tothe respective Embassies has proved a valuable experiment which might be con-tinued or developed with advantage.18. Consultation and co-ordination between American and British repre-sentatives in the field, as well as in Washington and London, is important and mightbe further developed where appropriate. In some areas representatives in the fieldhave already been given a general directive in this sense. This might be further developed.19. Consideration should be given to the question of assuring that appro-priate procedures exist in each Government for bringing to the attention of otherdepartments and agencies the practice of consultation and the general policyconsiderations which should be kept in mind even in technical matters.20.  The economic aspects of co-operation are dealt with in other papers.:   ANNEX D1MIN/TRI/P/46th May, 1950.1MINISTERIAL TALKS: UNITED KINGDOM/UNITED STATES/FRANCERelations with the Soviet Union1. It is agreed that there is no prospect that negotiations with the Soviets atpresent would lead to any general settlement. The right course for the West is,therefore, to continue to build up situations of strength.2. Nevertheless, the door should not be closed and the Three Powers shouldbe prepared to examine the situation again if for any reason it should appear thatsuch negotiations would be of advantage to the West.3.   Negotiations might take one of two forms (a) general negotiation covering all basic subjects at issue, or(b) particular negotiations such as might arise, for example, in connexion withthe question of all-German elections.It is generally felt that on the whole (b) would offer less opportunity for the Sovietsto place the West at a psychological disadvantage and would avoid the risk ofdisappointment and lowering of morale in the West in the probable event of failure.4. The Security Council would probably be the only practicable forum forgeneral discussions, though the Council of Foreign Ministers offers a possible alternative.5. If it should become necessary to enter into such negotiations, the following conditions would be desirable (a) that the West should enter upon them on the basis of some new positionof strength and that therefore our combined efforts now should bedirected to building up this needed strength;(b) that they should be careful to ensure that the discussions covered such issues as suited them and should prepare concrete proposals which the soviets would have the onus&apos; of accepting or rejecting.6. It should be agreed between the Three Powers that none of them willnegotiate with the Soviet Union on matters of common interest unless the other two agree on the need for such a step and participate in the negotiations, and pre-pared positions are worked out in advance.(i) Mr. Lie&apos;s proposal for a special meeting of the Security Council7. This proposal is recognised to be stillborn until the problem of Chineserepresentation has been solved. Once this question is settled it will be difficult for
the three Governments to refuse an invitation to attend such a meeting, howeverpoor the prospects of success. The question of the Agenda would have to be care-fully considered. Any discussion of basic issues would have little chance of success,while public opinion might not understand if discussion were limited to minorspecific problems. If there were to be a meeting of any kind it would be best for it to take place in New York before the meeting of the General Assembly in theautumn. Despite these considerations, factors of United Nations prestige and effectiveness which would need to be taken into account might make a meetingadvisable.(ii) The Problem of Chinese Representation in the United Nations8. Serious problems will arise from the continued absence of the Soviets fromthe United Nations up to or even during the meeting of the General Assembly.The chief of these will arise when the question of new membership is considered.The Powers will be faced with the following alternatives (a) to vote for their own nominees, e.g., Ceylon, Italy, &amp;c, and to reject Sovietnominees;(b) to accept both their own and Soviet nominees;(c) to avoid action on the question;id) as a last resort to reject both their own and Soviet nominees.The drawbacks to these four courses of action are obvious. Course (a) might resultin actual wthdrawal from the United Nations of the Soviet, and satellite States.Course (b) might encourage the Soviets to feel that the Western Powers are readyto go to any lengths to keep them in the United Nations and would also involveour waiving principles on which we have repeatedly stood. Courses (c) and (d)would be extremely difficult to explain to countries such as Ceylon and Italy, whoseapplications have been outstanding for a long time.9. Both the United States and France are confronted by special difficultiesin either voting for the admission of the Chinese People&apos;s Government to theUnited Nations or in recognising the Chinese People&apos;s Government. The UnitedStates is against any form of recognition of or concession to the Chinese Communistsat this time but does not intend to influence other countries to vote against seatingthe Representatives of the Chinese People&apos;s Government and will not use its vetoif a majority is found in favour of admitting them to the Security Council.10. The French Government are also in a difficult position, since Mao TseTung has formally recognised Ho Chi Minh and any move which could be construedby French and Indo-Chinese public opinion as condoning this situation might havea disastrous effect.11. The three Governments will keep the matter under consideration and.should the present situation continue until around 1st August, will arrange for it to be examined jointly by their representatives in New York, as a part of thepreparation for the next General Assembly of the United Nations.(iii) The attitude to be adopted towards the Soviet Union and the Satellite states is a problem common to the three Governments12. The attitude to be adopted towards the Soviet Union and the SatelliteStates is a problem common to the three Governments.13. Diplomatic relations should be maintained with the Satellite States aslong as is feasible, i.e., as long as conditions are not intolerable, in order to maintainas much contact as possible and to show the peoples of those countries that theWestern Powers have not abandoned them. It would also enable advantage tobe taken of any situation similar to that created by Tito&apos;s expulsion from theCominform.14. The three Governments should keep in constant consultation concerningthe general situation in and general attitude to be adopted towards the satellitecountries. The forum for this consultation should be determined. If any one ofthe Governments is considering any major form of retaliation, such as restriction on travel for satellite missions, the three Governments should consult and if possiblearrange for all three to take similar action. This would apply also to any special measures affecting Soviet missions.
15. The three Governments should co-ordinate their propaganda and con-concentrate in particular on the point that the peoples of these countries have not been written off as members of the European community. It might be possible formention of this to be made in the Council of Europe from time to time.Suitable use should be made of the United Nations forum to keep before theworld the issues that these countries are being deprived of their independence, andtheir peoples of their fundamental human rights.(iv) Exiles16. Although exiles and political refugees from satellite countries should beused with caution, opportunities exist for their judicious use. The United States,United Kingdom and France should consult with a view to co-ordinating theirattitudes on this problem.(v) Yugoslavia17. It is essential to the interests of the Western Powers that the Soviet union should not succeed in its campaign against the Titoist movement. There is at present no hard evidence that the Soviet Union is taking special measures to overthrowhim by force, but the question of furnishing him with various military supplies hithe event of an attack is under consideration and should be made the subject of active consultation in the event that a serious situation threatens.18. The economic stability of the country is the weak point and attention is drawn to the importance of rendering sufficient financial assistance to enable the yugoslav economy to withstand Soviet pressure. The International Bank loanis an important element. The three Governments should keep in touch in regardto the possibility of financial aid.ANNEX E[MIN/uk us/P/1:6th May, 1950]MINISTERIAL TALKS:   UNITED  KINGDOM/UNITED  STATESChinaThe purpose of the joint discussions was to review the China situation. the specific objective was to ascertain whether it would be possible to narrow downsuch differences in approach as existed between us with a view to concerting amore closely unified and vigorous policy as suggested by Mr. Acheson.2. Our common aim was to ensure that China should not be irrevocablylost to the Soviet camp, and in consequence of such a loss, indefinitely alienatedfrom the West.3. While we are in agreement on fundamentals it is mutually appreciated that our immediate tactics diverge widely in regard to this important area. Thisprevents the two countries from attaining that unity of action which in general it is their object to attain.4. The United Kingdom approach to the China problem briefly summarisedwas as follows:  Recognition was accorded because this was considered as the correct course in accordance with International Law. A policy of seeking to establish diplomatic relations and of keeping a foot in the door was being pursued because by so doing it was hoped to derive the advantage for the West of being in a positionto exert at any rate some moderating influence on future developments in China.If the West disembarrassed itself of China, the field would be left exclusively tothe Russians. As regards the Chinese Communist Party, it was considered that theKremlin faction were; probably so far on top, but that it was too early to speak oftheir having achieved any 100 per cent, victory.   The situation in China could
still develop in a number of different directions. The possible developments-were:-&apos; . - &apos;      - &apos;(1) complete Russian domination;(2) on Titoist lines;(3) a drift towards war lordism and internal dissension;(4) the: emergence of an independent China as a powerful Communist state in her own right.But developments in any of the above directions could be expected only to takea definite shape over a period of years. At this stage there was probably littlethat the Western Powers could do. But by a complete severance of all relationswith China, they would lose out to the Russians by default. The main underlyingfactor in the United Kingdom recognition policy was essentially to avoid any suchcomplete severance, and was by no means exclusively motivated by the desire toprotect our commercial interests in China. Even when the decision to recognise the Central People&apos;s Government was taken, there were already few illusions onthis latter score.The United Kingdom was fully aware of the danger of the emergence of anactively hostile Communist China in SEA. The broad conclusion reached was thatwhile the outlook is dark, the policy of recognition and of seeking to keep afoothold in China was right, although difficult, at times painful, and by no means certain of success.5. The United States approach to the China problem briefly summarisedwas as follows:  The basic American hope and belief was that a fundamental conflict betweenthe interests of the U.S.S.R. and China would ultimately emerge, partly becauseof China&apos;s nationalism and xenophobic tendencies, partly because of divergentpulls, particularly in the bordering territories of Manchuria, Sinkiang and perhapsNorth China. International Law does not impose a duty to recognise.The United States Government were not at present considering recognition,nor were they likely to do so in any immediate future. The essence of recognitionwas regarded as the exchange of representatives and a sine qua non of such an exchange was the provision of minimum facilities and courtesies. There was no indication that the Peking regime intended to provide these. The United StatesGovernment would, in all probability, continue to maintain diplomatic relationswith, and to give economic aid to, the Nationalist Government as long as they maintained their position in Formosa. It was not necessarily the intention even inthe event of the loss of Formosa, and the probable extinction of the ChineseNationalist Government, to enter at that stage into relations with Peking. Theyenvisaged the possibility in such a case of the absence of all relations with China,possibly for some considerable period. Furthermore, United States policyenvisaged no punitive measures against the Chinese people, but the Americanestimate of the situation inclined them to the opinion that China&apos;s ties to Moscowhad been tightened as a result of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the apparent dominancein Peking of the Kremlin wing of the Chinese Communist Party. As long asPeking&apos;s attitude to American officials, nationals and interests remained hostile,an Ambassador in China would be a symbol of humiliation rather than beaconof light. The threat of a hostile China, in SEA and the danger of a ChinesePan-Asian movement, probably designed also to include Japan, and concentrating on a build-up of an East /West division, was fully appreciated. The United StatesGovernment attached importance to an effective embargo on the import intoChina of such strategic materials as would lead to an accretion of her militarypotential. American military advisers assessed highly the strategic importance of formosa, although it was appreciated that the maintenance for any length of timeof Formosa&apos;s present status was improbable.Joint Summary of Conclusions7.   The following is a rough balance sheet of the points of agreement on theone hand and points of disagreement on the other.Points of agreement it was agreed (1) That in our China policies we clearly have the same objective and thatwhile for the time being China might appear to be lost, this was not
necessarily irrevocably the case. The aim was to prevent the alienationof China from the West and her domination by the Soviet Union.(2) That we should attempt to stop such imports into China as would leadto an accretion of the military potential of the Central People&apos;sGovernment.(3) That while we would continue to pursue our respective and somewhatdivergent policies, we would whenever possible concert our tactics and information policy so as to advance our common aim and to reduceany risk of mutual recrimination.(4) That in the development of the situation in the Far East and South-east asia arising out of the Communist successes in China, time was not onour side. Our opponents were not static. Neither the Russians northe Chinese were likely to wait. They would derive full benefit fromthe absence on our side of a clear and agreed policy for the future.; . (5) That closer and more frequent consultation on a higher policy level between us would be advantageous; that consideration should be given to improving the machinery consultation and more particularly that our respective Ambassadors be briefed more frequently and fully on Chinapolicy and developments generally in the Far East for periodicexchanges of view with the respective Secretaries of State.Points of Disagreement(1) China Recognition Policy(a) The United Kingdom had recognised the Central People&apos;s Governmentand considered a policy of establishing diplomatic relations and attempting to keep a foothold in China, though difficult and by no means certain to achieve any immediate successes, nevertheless might lead to long-term benefits for the West.(b) The United States had not recognised Peking nor did they envisage anysuch recognition for some considerable time to come. They continued to recognise the Nationalist Government in Formosa.(2) Chinese Representation in the United Nations*(a) The United Kingdom was in favour of admitting Chinese Communistrepresentatives as soon as possible and would vote in favour of such admission onbodies which are considered competent to take such a decision as soon as it was clear that a majority for such a vote was available on that body. (These bodies are the General Assembly, Security Council, Economic and Social Council,Trusteeship Council, each Specialised Agency and the Economic Commission forAsia and the Far East.) On such bodies the decision should be a collective one and until a majority (including the United Kingdom) was in favour, the UnitedKingdom delegates would abstain in any vote aimed at bringing about a change-over in Chinese representation.(b) The United States would continue to vote against any proposal to unseatthe Chinese Nationalist representatives but would accept a majority decision.3. Attitude to Nationalists in Formosa(a) The United Kingdom considered that offensive measures from bases inFormosa against the Chinese mainland, such as the blockade or air raids, wouldnot seriously weaken the Central People&apos;s Government. They would merelyserve to alienate the Chinese from the West since they considered such measures as backed and inspired by the Americans and to some extent, the &quot; Imperialists &quot;generally. Such measures, when taken in combination with the supply of military assistance to Formosa, were merely likely to lead the Chinese Communists to seekSoviet military assistance to redress the balance. They may already have contributed to the recent flow of such Soviet assistance. Continued resistancefrom Formosa against the mainland might merely weaken the joint aim in China.The question of any steps by the United Kingdom to break the blockade is notat present under active consideration. Nevertheless the United Kingdom regard the continuance of the situation arising from the blockade as profoundly unsatis-factory.* This question is also dealt with in the Tripartite Ministerial Paper covering Items 6 and 8of the Tripartite Agenda (MIN/TRI/P/4).
i\(b) The United States assessed more highly the strategic importance of formosa.They considered the permanent maintenance of the present status in Formosaas improbable, but they would not do anything to hasten the transition. As regardsthe Nationalists&apos; blockade of the China coast, the American position was that thisblockade was enforced by the Nationalists without United States help and served to multiply Communist economic and administrative difficulties. The americans would not wish to take any steps to terminate the blockade. They considered it a debatable point whether Nationalist blockade and offensive measures fromFormosa against the mainland had, in fact, substantially contributed to theChinese Communists seeking Soviet military assistance in China.4. Information Policy(a) The United Kingdom China policy (aimed at trying to achieve somewhatmore normal relations with that country) debarred them from using propagandaaimed directly against China, although as far as South-East Asia went, the UnitedKingdom were prepared to make it plain that they opposed communism.(b) The United States, in their China information policy, were not debarredby similar considerations from direct criticism of the Chinese communist regime.5. Commercial interests in China(a) The United Kingdom favoured the retention, if at all possible, of a com-mercial foothold in China.(b) The United States were inclined to doubt that normal trade on any sub-stantial scale with China would be possible under present conditions.
