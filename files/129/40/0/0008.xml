DESERTERS

MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE

My colleagues will know that there has, over the last few years, been much agitation in Parliament and in the press for a general amnesty for deserters from the armed forces, particularly for men who deserted during the war. Mainly as a result of public anxiety about crimes of violence, this pressure has recently increased. I think the time has come for the question to be considered by the Cabinet.

2. For all practical purposes it is necessary to consider only men who deserted since September 1939. There are at present nominally about 19,500 such men- 1,300 from the Navy, 13,800 from the Army and 4,400 from the R.A.F. It is estimated that about 5,000 of these deserted since the end of 1945 and the remaining 14,500 before that date, mainly during the war. Of the total, however, some 10,500 had home addresses in the Irish Republic before they joined the forces and have probably found their way back to their former homes. A number deserted abroad. The total includes a considerable number of multiple desertions, that is to say men who have deserted more than once after rejoining under assumed names. Some of the men may well have died or been killed during the war. Taking all these factors into account, I am doubtful whether there are more than 7,000 or 8,8000 deserters at large in this country at the present time. The actual total may well be much less.

3. The total number outstanding has been reduced by about 5,000 since the end of the war. In January, 1947, my predecessor, with the approval of the Cabinet (C.M. (47) 10th Conclusions, Minute 1), appealed to all these men to surrender and promised them lenient treatment if they did so before the end of March 1947. Only some 2,500 men took advantage of this offer. Since then the figures have declined slowly; recoveries by surrender or arrest have been almost counterbalanced by fresh desertions, which at present continue at the rate of about 200 a month.

4. Over the six months to the end of February 1950 the total of desertions from all three Services averaged 211 a month (Navy 11; Army 157; R.A.F. 43). Of these 134 were regulars and 77 were National Service men. The total is about the same as in 1938, but when allowance is made for the much larger numbers now in the Forces, the present rate compares favourably with the pre-war one. While it is difficult to generalise, it appears that a fairly high proportion (estimated at possibly 60 per cent.) of current desertions arise from domestic difficulties of one kind and another.

5. The majority of men who desert in peace time are recovered or surrender fairly soon after they absent themselves; there appears, however, to be a substantial hard core of long outstanding deserters which is only very slowly being reduced. 

6. Although the period of the original offer of leniency has long since passed, deserters who are arrested or surrender are not harshly treated. The more serious cases are dealt with by Courts Martial and, from a recent analysis, the 38733


average sentence awarded is a little over six months, while the average sentenceserved, after the customary remissions on review and for good conduct, is littlemore than 2-\ months&apos; detention. In addition a substantial number of cases are dealt with summarily, that is to say, by the man&apos;s Commanding Officer without a formal Court Martial, and in the great majority of such cases the maximumsentence would be 28 days&apos; detention. The severity of the sentences, awarded byCburts -Martial has befen persistently misrepresented, and I intend in any case to make sure that the true facts are widely known. Since, however, the punish-ment is so lenient, T, do riot consider that any further steps, short of a generalaiUUestyi can be &amp;keii! &quot;which would have any real effect on the problem even if,ori geheraTg^ justified. &quot;:  ;7. The nature of the deserter problem is often misrepresented by those whoadvocate an amnesty. The number of men concerned is much smaller than it is often represented to be. Criminal statistics and the advice of the police authori-ties both show that deserters are not for the most part engaged in crime. Indeed,it seems probable that most of them have somehow managed to re-establish them-selves in normal civilian occupations. The problem does not entail muchadditional work for the police forces. Since those who surrender are lightlypunished, there appears to be little or nothing in the argument that men arebeing, forced into criminal activities through fear of the consequences of surrender;indeed it appears that, for the most part, those deserters who are discovered tobe engaged in crime had criminal records before they enlisted. It is unlikely,in fact, that the majority of the men who appear to have managed to subsist forseveral years without resort to crime will now: be driven to crime by the absenceof an amnesty; it is alsb unlikely that the minority who are criminals would takethe risk of reporting themselves or would change their way of life if an amnestywere now offered. ;&apos;&quot;The Case for an A mnesty- 8.. iThe main argument put forward by those who advocate an amnesty isthat the arrest and punishment of deserters who have been outstanding for manyyears is troublesome and. unpopular, and serves no useful purpose. Such men areUseless to the Services;indeed, when recovered, they are a liability. It is argued that some at least of these men had strong compassionate reasons for deserting;and even where they did hot, many years of anxiety away from their homes and families can. be regarded as having atoned for their offences. It is also relevantthat the Ministry of Labour (as I have recently discovered) do not attempt to trace or punish men. who fail to register for service under the National service acts, once they have reached the upper age of call-up, which is now 26.9. It can also be argued that the right deterrent to desertion is rapidpunishment, and that an amnesty for men who have succeeded in escaping, this and remaining at large for several years would probably not have much effectorithe^ate dfvd^ertidn either now or in future.( The Case against an Amnesty10. The objections to a general amnesty are powerful. Desertion is a graveoffence, particularly in war-time, and any action which suggests that it is not soregarded may have serious repercussions.-&apos; 11. ; There&apos;jis a clear preponderance of opinion among our professionaladvisers&apos;that an amnesty might well increase the current rate of desertion; andmore&apos; impor&apos;tarit;rperhaps; that it would probably encourage desertion in a futureemergency by suggesting that men need only remain at large long enough to escape the consequences. Ah; amnesty would, in this view, be inopportune at the presenttime while the emergency&apos;&apos; continues and with it the liability to recall to thecolours Of -war-time&quot;; National Service men.; Our professional advisers also stressthat the present moment is particularly inopportune to condone desertion, becausewithin a few weeks the National Service men will be entering the TerritorialArmy and other Reserve Services : an amnesty to deserters is a: very poor exampletoaman iw^hq wants; to. avoid his; reserve service, and: it will be difficult to persuademagistrates or the.public.to take a serious view of the Territorial who evades hisfew;day&apos;s camp, wHenthe* more serious offence of desertion in war-time is condonedarid unpunished.
12. It is, moreover, cogently argued that an amnesty would be unfair to thosewho have already surrendered aiid been punished and unfair to those who served,and are serving, loyally. Moreover, since it would have to be limited in itsappli- &apos;.cation to those who deserted before a fixed date, it would not only be unfair asbetween men who deserted before and after that date but also illogical since,in general, war-time, desertion is a more serious offence than desertion in peacetime. Nor would its illogicality end here : desertion, particularly in war.time, isa more serious and dangerous offence than most civil crimes, but the ordinarycriminal is never relieved, through lapse of time, of punishment. Further, it isfundamentally bad from the national point of view that anything should be done to condone or encourage a disinclination to accept the duties that;must accompany /the privileges of life in a free democracy. ,&apos;13.   It must be recognised, too, that whatever effective date were chosen &quot;for ran amnesty, it is probable that, in a few years time, the Government would be under further pressure to advance the date and possibly to widen the scope of anyamnesty now granted. i    ., Public Opinion &apos;14. Criticism of current policy is, from time to time, highly vocal, but itwould be a mistake to think that opinion in Parliament and among the publicis solidly in favour of an amnesty.  Many would oppose it strongly.   ;        ;Practice Abroad ;,\-^^       &apos;;;.!.; ,y    .15.   In other countries the practice varies.   South Africa,,;Australia and,Canada have, in effect, granted an amnesty to war-time deserters.   The practice in New Zealand and in the United States is the same as our own.Recommendations16. I have discussed this matter exhaustively with my Service colleagues and with our professional advisers.  There is a difference of opinion in both eases., 17. The First Lord of the Admiralty opposes the grant of an amnesty on principle. In his view desertion in war is one of the most&apos; serious of militaryoffences and, to excuse, much less to pardon, those men who ran away from.service with the armed forces when the fight was on would be unfair to, the very much larger number who did their duty, and would be greatly resented by them. Hepoints out that the Government made a gesture intended to help the deserter who .desired to make a clean start some three years ago. The response was poor; butthat does not, in the First Lord&apos;s opinion, justify another&apos;attempt with an offer of easier terms. If past experience is any guide the response to this would bepoor also and the Government would gain no credit. .. &apos;   &apos;  &quot;18. In this view the First Lord is supported by all three Chiefs of Staff andby two of the Principal Personnel Officers. They stress the militarydisadvantagesof an amnesty as outlined above and, in particular, the probable adverse effects ofsuch a step on Service discipline. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff inparticular is most anxious about the effect of an amnesty on the;,&quot;Territorial Armyduring a critical period which is now approaching in tnat.Army&apos;s lifer-n ..19.   On the other hand, my own opinion, which is shared by the secretaries of State for War and Air and by the Air Member for Personnel, is that thebalance of advantage lies in offering now a limited form of amnesty on the lines :described below to men (other than those serving on regular engagements) whodeserted before 1st January, 1947. We do not think that such a step need have, anyill effects on Service discipline.   We doubt whether it would, be resented by;. the..Services.&apos;;. We are impressed by the humanitarian arguments in favour of such:,an.amnesty. We feel too that the present, policy is.- making. Ji ttle qt&apos; np, impression.on this vexed problem- and that, in default of any change, it will epntinueindefinitely to be a source of embarrassment.    :j,i\ ^ &apos;   n ,,  v20.   The form of amnesty we would propose would be similar to that offered in 1922 in respect of non-regulars who deserted during the &apos;1914^18 warl;. rWe1would also propose to follow that precedent by extending the offer duly tomenguilty: of desertion: alone; and not of ether serious offences as&apos; well!   Precise
details remain to be worked out; but, broadly, such, men would be invited to report,within six or twelve months, to the nearest police station or to their Services either in person or in writing, and would be required to sign a form of confession.They would then be discharged. No other action would be taken against them;but they would not, of course, be entitled to any of the normal release benefits.21. We do not consider that such an amnesty can be extended tq men whodeserted fr.pm normal regular engagements, many of whicli would still he currenteven if they had not deserted- Such inert entered the Services of their own freewill and; in: iieserting, b;roke engagements the terms of which they had acceptedquite, voluntarily.22. We have selected 1st January, 1947, as the operative date because men called up after then have been required tp serve for. definite fixed periods. It is,of cpurse, illogical, as is any pther date, but -we think it is tlie least open to objection pf any date which could be ioup^-Conclusion23. I invite the Cabinet to decide whether an amnesty in the form outlined above-should now be offered. If the answer is yes, I wpuld propose to make anearly announcement in the House as soon as details of the precise form of amnestyto be offered have been worked out.E.
