(50) 123\6thJune, 1950.CABINETCOMMONWEALTH CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE ON economic development IN SOUTH AND SOUTH-EAST ASIA: SYDNEY,MAY 1950Memorandum by the Paymaster-general  arrived in Sydney on 8th May, and was there joined by Mr. Malcolm Macdonald. The team of officials from London included Mr. R. W. B. Clarke,Treasury, Mr. R. H. Scott, Foreign Office, Mr. J. Thomson, commonwealth relations Office, Mr. G. Bowen, Board of Trade, and Mr. A. G. T. Chaplin,Colonial Office. These were reinforced by Dr. Benham, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald&apos;economic adviser; Mr. D. F. Crichton, who acted as Information Officer for the delegation; and Miss E. Hinder, United Kingdom representative on the united nations organisation at Bangkok. Mr. H. Smedley, from the Office of the UnitedKingdom High Comissioner in New Zealand, acted as Secretary of the Delega-tion. The United Kingdom High Commissioner in Australia, Mr. E. J. Williams,and his staff gave us great help, before, during and after the Conference, and Iwould particularly mention the work of Mr. H. A. Twist, who organised the officeof our Delegation at Sydney admirably.2. There was an intensive series of meetings between officials from 11th to14th May, to prepare the agenda and basic papers for the Conference. TheConference began on 15th May; the Australians had intended it to end on19th May, and so it did. This left the way clear for a trip to Canberra, whereI was able to have useful discussions with the Governor-General and withAustralian Ministers, and where the officials were able to make useful contact withtheir opposite numbers in the Australian Departments. I regard this as having been one of the most fruitful results of the trip, for United Kingdom Ministers and leading officials have been all too rarely seen in Australia in recent years. Theopportunity for informal discussion was much welcomed by the Australians. Iwas able also to pay a short visit to New Zealand, where I received a very warmwelcome. I had useful discussions both with Mr. Holland and with Mr. Fraser,the Leader of the Opposition. At an official luncheon given by the Prime minister was able to explain satisfactorily the reason for the delay in advising theNew Zealand Government of His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision to end petrol rationing, and to express their regret at any embarrassment which had been causedthereby. I hope it will be possible in the next few years for Ministers and leadingofficials to visit Australia and New Zealand much more frequently; these countriesdo not openly complain of being neglected but they feel very isolated.3. The Australian Government proved good hosts. The Conference arrange-ments, particularly the Secretariat, were first-class and excellent office accommoda-tion and lavish hospitality were provided for us. Hotel accommodation was gooddespite the acute lack of hotel facilities and indeed of personal service of allkinds-in Australia. I regret that I am unable to make the same comment on themanner in which Mr. Spender discharged his duties as Chairman, or as Delegate.He seemed to confuse far too often the function of Chairman of the conference with that of being Australian Delegate at the Conference., Indeed, on the experience38854 B
of this Conference, I could not recommend that any future Commonwealth meeting should take place in Australia under the cegis of the Department for external affairs, and with this I am sure all other Delegations present would agree.*.* fThe Business of the Conference4: The Conference was, in my view, constructive in temper, and was an effective follow-up to Colombo. Much difficulty was caused by the ill-digestedproposals submitted by the Australian Delegation (summarised in telegram No. 106from the United Kingdom High Commissioner). It was apparent from discussion that little serious thought had been given to these proposals, which were apparentlydesigned for political and publicity purposes rather than as a workable course ofaction, but the Australian Delegation continued to insist upon them, and indeedat the last moment Mr. Spender returned to them even though he had previouslyannounced that he had abandoned them. We had the advantage of entering theConference with a well-thought-out plan of campaign, which I had been able toexplain to the heads of the other Delegations prior to the opening of Conference,and as soon as our proposals were explained and understood, the Australians were left in a minority of one! or, rather, of two, for Pakistan considered (probablyerroneously) that some aid for Pakistan might be forthcoming if the Australian pro-posals were accepted. We got full and continuous support from Canada, India and ceylon, and somewhat less vocal, but no less real, support from New Zealand.5. In the end, the Conference accepted the whole of our long-term plan of campaign, and accepted the gist of the most sensible element in the Australian pro-posals the Commonwealth Technical Assistance Scheme in a greatly modifiedform, which should tackle this problem in a workmanlike manner. I think it canfairly be said that all the Delegations accepted the Australian sense of urgency anddesire to get on with the job quickly and worked hard to express this in realisticterms while at the same time accepting our view that a radical attack was needed on the whole problem of development, and that the main task of the Conference wasto see how best this could be launched. The result was a combination of views,rather than a compromise, and I think that all Delegations were well satisfied with it.6. The report and recommendations of the Commonwealth consultative committee are appended, and my comments in the next paragraph follow the pattern of the report. I can recommend acceptance of the report and of its recom-mendations without reserve.7. The recommendations in Sections I, II, III, IV, VI, VII and VIII are recom-mendations to Governments and action cannot proceed until these have beenapproved; the approach to non-Commonwealth Governments in Section V, how-ever, flows directly from decisions already taken by Governments following the colombo Conference, and the approaches are therefore being made at once without waiting for endorsement by all the Governments.A. Development Programme (Part I of the Report)This is the plan of campaign outlined in our brief. Each country in the area willprepare a development programme covering the next six years, in accordance witha questionnaire which has been agreed. These are to be submitted by 1st Sep-tember for examination and incorporation in a report which, it is hoped, will setout South and South-East Asia&apos;s needs and resources as authoritatively as the Parisreport of September 1947 set out Western Europe&apos;s needs and resources. In theCommonwealth, India, Pakistan and Ceylon will submit programmes direct toAustralia for circulation to the other participating countries. The Malayan andBorneo territories will forward their programmes through His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom. The Delegation had previously been uncertain whether India, Pakistan and Ceylon would be technically able to do this job by 1st September, but discussions at the Conference suggested that India and Ceylonwere well ahead with the work, and were envisaging no particular difficulty;Pakistan is not so well equipped technically and may need help.B. Technical Assistance (Part II of the Report)It is difficult to overstress the importance which is attached to this in Asia.India, Pakistan and Ceylon are obviously feeling acutely their lack of men withskills of all kinds. This is a problem to which we have given too little attention.
The United Kingdom is in fact providing technical assistance facilities on a massivescale-4,500 Asians are being educated at our universities and technical colleges,and much technical assistance is being provided by private companies.  A growingamount of technical assistance is being given by the United States and by united nations Agencies. But the problem of organisation is novel and difficult and thereare gaps in the existing schemes.  The idea is to set up a sort of clearing house atColombo a Commonwealth Technical Assistance Scheme.  This would show thecountries needing technical assistance how to get it, and financial facilities havebeen provided to supplement the existing schemes if necessary.  The conference agreed to recommend that Governments should provide facilities for technical assistance up to a maximum of  8 millions spread over three years. (The maximumUnited Kingdom contribution over the period will be  2 - 8 millions; Australia^ willbe the same; India promised  750,000 and all the other Delegations are recom-mending that their Governments should contribute something.)  It is not proposedthat a fund as such should be set up: the &quot; bureau &quot; to be set up at Colombo will seek to meet needs through existing channels, including United Nations channels,and only if these prove inadequate will the &quot; bureau &quot; try to arrange for supple-mentary technical assistance.   Such assistance will usually be arranged directbetween the country needing the assistance and the country providing it (any expenditure incurred being credited to the latter&apos;s share of the financial liability for the scheme), but it may happen that a Commonwealth country may, as partof its contribution, finance facilities for technical assistance arranged between two other countries.  British Colonies will be able to benefit from these arrangements,and the recommendations in the report seem to me sound in principle.   Detailswill be worked out in September on the basis of a report by a meeting of officialswhich the Government of Ceylon are expected to summon at Colombo aroundmid-July to consider the implementation of these plans.   I must emphasise theimportance and ugency of technical assistance; it is a field in which we shouldbe able to give considerable help (which will sooner or later yield contracts for britain), but at present we lack the organisation needed to count what we are doing,assess our position, and implement positive Governmental policies.Although only Commonwealth countries are at this stage being asked to con-tribute towards the Commonwealth Technical Assistance Scheme there is no reason why applications for assistance from the larger non-Commonwealth countries inthe area Burma, Siam, Indonesia, and the three Associate States of Indo-China should not be made to the &quot; bureau &quot; in Colombo once it has been established.The question of any contribution by these or other countries to the Scheme canbe deferred until after September.C. Priority Economic Requirements (Part III of the Report)This item relates to the Australian proposals for a relief fund and for credits to the non-Commonwealth countries of South-East Asia, especially Indonesia.Indeed, it appears that their real objective was to get Commonwealth cover for australian credits to Indonesia, so that they could appear to their Parliament to becarrying out not merely Australian but Commonwealth policy. In the end, this problem of emergency action was postponed until September; it is not yet clear whether the Australians intend to give a credit to Indonesia or not. It is unfortunate that the question whether a genuine case existed for emergency action was neverreally examined; a proper investigation was made impossible by the concentration of attention upon the unrealistic Australian proposals.D. Commodity Agreements (Part IV of the Report)The Asian Members of the Commonwealth, especially Ceylon, laid great stress on the need for stable and assured markets at reasonable prices if they wereto be in a position to carry out an orderly development programme. But there were no definite considered proposals to ensure these conditions, and the recommenda-transactions adopted by the Conference do no more than emphasise the importance ofthis subject to the countries of the area. The critical factor is the maintenance ofa high level of demand for their products in North America, and this will need tobe powerfully stressed in the September report.E.  Programmes for non-Commonwealth countries (Part V of the Report)It was agreed at the meeting that non-Commonwealth countries in the area should be informed of our proceedings and invited to participate in drawing updevelopmental programmes if they so desire. It was unfortunately not possible to38854       &quot; b 2
specify which non-Commonwealth countries should be so approached. This wason account of the reluctance of the Indian and other Delegations to include thethree Associate States of Indo-China. Mr. Malcolm MacDonald addressed themeeting on the importance of including these States and on the serious results whichmight flow from pointedly excluding them from our plans. - At a subsequent privatemeeting between Mr. Spender, the Indian Delegate (Mr. Ramaswami Mudaliar)jMr. Malcolm MacDonald and myself, Mr. Mudaiiar, while recognising the validity of the points made by Mr. MacDonald, insisted on the need for him to consult pandit nehru before he could commit himself. At subsequent meetings between officials,the Pakistani and Ceylon Delegations also made it plain that they were reluctant to see any reference made to the three Associate States of Indo-China in our report.It was therefore left that the Australian Government would make these approaches to non-Commonwealth countries after consultation with other commonwealth countries. I foresee no difficulty over the issue of invitations to Burma, Siam andIndonesia, but it may be that the invitations to the three Associate States of Indo-China will have to be made in the names of only some of the commonwealth countries represented at Sydney, Our main anxiety was to ensure that all thesecountries were given an opportunity to participate as soon as possible. There wasno discussion on the possible participation of other non-Commonwealth countries such as the Philippines, Dutch New Guinea or Portuguese Timor. My own feeling is that invitations should issue as soon as possible to Burma, Siam, Indonesia andthe three Associate States of Indo-China, but that we can leave for later considera-tion after the September meeting the question of the possible participation by other non-Commonwealth countries and territories in the area such as Dutch new guinea, Portuguese Timor or independent States such as Nepal.It is proposed that the Commonwealth countries should offer assistance to non-Commonwealth countries in drawing up the developmental programmes, andin this connection I promised that at least two officials would be made availablefor this purpose. It is probable that India, and possibly Australia, will eachprovide one, and it may be convenient for these officials to meet in singapore and plan their work, using Singapore as a convenient base of operations.F. Approach to the United States, France and Holland (Part VI of the Report)We are left in the lead in advising the appropriate moment for a formal jointapproach to the United States. All Delegations agreed that assistance from theUnited States was indispensable to the success of the development programme.As regards approaches to France and Holland, there was no specific resolution bythe Conference, but it was left to individual Commonwealth countries to keep non-Commonwealth countries interested in the area informed of the proceedings atSydney through diplomatic channels. In fact, both the French and NetherlandsMinisters at Canberra showed keen interest in the Conference and were told inoutline what had passed. I think that it would be appropriate if, perhaps throughthe French and Netherlands Embassies in London, these Governments were informed more fully of the proceedings at Sydney and of the recommendations made there.G. Organisation (Part VII of the Report)We were successful in carrying out our instructions not to establish a new commonwealth organisation at this stage, except for technical assistance (as insection B above). But the question will arise strongly as soon as the programmes are submitted. There is a wide range of view, extending from Australia^ wish toset up. permanent (and rather grandiose) Commonwealth machinery as quickly aspossible, to Canada&apos;s unwillingness to have any permanent Commonwealthmachinery at all. This problem will have to be faced in the course of the nextfew months with the additional complication about the relationship between,theCommonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries in the area. These difficultmatters cannot be settled yet, but in my view it is most important to develop a firm policy before the next round.H. Future Meetings (Part Vfll of the Report)There was general agreement that it would serve the convenience of everyoneif the next series of meetings in September-October were held in London, and inaccordance with the discretion given to me I tendered a formal invitation to this
effect. These will be most important meetings, the layout of which will require tobe decided early. The general view at Sydney was that the commonwealth countries should meet before the non-Commonwealth countries appear. At these meetings, it will of course be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to say how much we shall be prepared to contribute, by release of sterling balances or other-wise, and to define pur attitude towards the colonies.8. The Conference recommendations are broadly in line with what we had hoped. But this is only the first stage of a process which will gather momentum,and we shall need to be equally prepared for the next round in September.The Delegations9. It may be useful to my colleagues to have some impression of the nature and quality of the Delegations, and their attitude.Australia. I have already implied that their political approach, and theirmethod of handling the business from the chair, were most disappointing. Theyrevealed remarkable immaturity and unreliability in Mr. Spender and I under-stand that the same applied to his officials. They certainly handicapped themselvesunnecessarily by failing to select any official to lead for them at officials&apos; meetings,and by virtually confining their effective Delegation to representatives of theDepartment of External Affairs. They were alone in this; in most Delegations the major weight was on the economic and financial side, and in every Delegationexcept that of Australia there was strong evidence that policies had been worked out reconciling the interests of all Departments. I am afraid I must describe theAustralian performance on the floor of the Conference at Ministerial and at officiallevels as having been lamentable.Canada. Mr. Mayhew, their Minister of Fisheries, is a shy and quiet man,but he spoke on occasion with great sincerity and effect, and he was entirely reliableat the moments of stress. As usual, the Canadians had a very strong team of officials and our Delegation worked very closely with them. Canada has little directeconomic interest in South and South-East Asia, but the Canadians seem to be considering giving assistance provided that the United States is reasonablyin step, that a sound and convincing programme is worked out, and that theyare not forced by the growth of new Commonwealth institutions to enteran exclusive Commonwealth bloc which would be dealing direct with the UnitedStates. They were well satisfied with the Conference.Ceylon. Mr. Jayawardene as usual played a distinguished part, ably supportedby his officials; the fact that he had produced an admirable paper on development,closely akin to ours, was of great importance. It now appears that Colombo willbe the seat of any continuing organisation that may be set up, and that Ceylonwill derive considerable advantage from being the smallest and youngest Memberof the Commonwealth, and intends to make the most of this advantage by workingvery closely with us.India. The Indian Delegation, comprising Mr. Ramaswami Mudaliar andthree very good officials, was a source of great strength throughout. They didnot come to Sydney with any positive line, and at the outset were not unsympa-thetic to the Australian proposals. But they were the quickest to see the force ofour approach, and then gave consistent and powerful support. Our delegation was very impressed by their quality, and in particular by their repeated demandfor realism and ruthless exposure of muddle-headedness.New Zealand. Mr. Doidge was a good colleague, very ready to follow ourlead. But New Zealand itself is facing financial difficulties, and he therefore feltunwilling to intervene strongly. His leading official, Mr. Reid, made a goodcontribution as Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Technical Assistance.Pakistan. The Pakistan Delegation was disappointing; they appeared all thetime to be confused about what was going on, and their main purpose was to place the needs of Pakistan before the Conference.10. I felt that in general the strength of the Delegations and their general attitude were most encouraging. Their friendliness to the Linked Kingdom, andthe readiness to accept a lead from the United Kingdom were strikingly apparent;there seemed to be a genuine appreciation of our financial situation no onementioned the sterling balances throughout and their willingness to follow ourlead must be attributed to their confidence in our good sense, rather than to any
fear of economic pressure by us. The counterpart of this was that in the difficult problem of curbing Mr. Spender&apos;s indiscretions, no leader of any other delegation was willing to come forward; once the lead had been taken, however, they all gavestrong support.11. Such differences of opinion as there were at Sydney were fortunatelyconfined to the economic field. There was no attempt to interpret the meeting as the preliminary to a defence pact or as springing primarily from anti-Communistmotives, although I was pleased to note that it was the Indian Delegate who firstreferred to the Communist menace in realistic terms. But it was the general sense of the meeting that, although our developmental plans will undoubtedly contributenot only to combating the spread of Communism and perhaps indirectly to strengthening our defences, nevertheless, the case for economic development restedon its own merits.M. of G.Office of the Paymaster-General, S.W. 1,10th June, 1950.

CC/SY/Rep. 1/Rev. 1REPORT OF BRITISH COMMONWEALTH CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE,SYDNEY, 19th MAY, 1950IntroductionThe Conference of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers at Colombo inJanuary 1950 recommended the establishment of a Consultative Committee,membership of which would be open to all Commonwealth Governments whichwished to participate. The Committee had the following terms of reference-Hf(i) to receive from Governments an indication of the action which theyconsider it feasible to take in response to the recommendations inSection A of the Resolutions passed by that Conference ;(ii) to approach the Governments of countries outside the Commonwealthinterested in South and South-East Asia with a view to enlisting theircollaboration ;(iii) to examine the methods of co-ordinating development activities in Southand South-East Asia, in association with international and regional organisations concerned with the object of raising the level of pro-duction and the standard of living in the Area ;(iv) to examine the desirability of promoting international commodity agree-ments for basic products, which would benefit the Area and could be recommended for consideration under the Havana Charter ;(v) to consider, whether the economic development of under-developed countries of the Area would be assisted by the drawing up of aco-ordinated plan of development and by the establishment of special machinery;(vi) to make recommendations to Governments.2. The Consultative Committee met at Sydney from 15th to 19th May, 1950,under the Chairmanship of the Hon. P. C. Spender, K.C., M.P., Australian Ministerfor External Affairs. Besides Australia there were represented Canada, Ceylon,India, New Zealand, Pakistan and the United Kingdom.3.   The work of the Committee was in eight parts, as follows:  I. Preparation of a development programme.II. Technical assistance.III. Priority economic requirements.IV. Commodity Agreements.V. Relations with non-Commonwealth Governments in the Area in thepreparation of the development programme.VI. Approach to United States of America and other countries interested inthe Area.VII. Organisation.VIII. Future schedule of meetings.4. Agreement was reached on a course of action, which is outlined in thisReport, and recommendations are made to Governments accordingly.Part I. Preparation of Development programme . All Delegates agreed that the economic development of South and South-East Asia (referred to later in this Report as &quot; the Area&quot;) was politically and economically a matter of prime importance, that it was urgent to make a starton it as speedily as possible and that the scale of the problem was such that it was unlikely that the Commonwealth would be able from its own resources effectively to carry out this development.2. It was agreed that a report should be prepared setting out the need for development, the development programmes of the countries in the Area whichmight be expected to be completed over a period of six years ending 30th June, 1957,
and the need for external assistance in order to carry out these programmes. Itwas agreed that a first and indispensable step was for each participating countryin the Area to prepare a realistic and comprehensive statement of its economicsituation and development programme. This statement would be submitted by each country to the Committee through the Australian Government before 1st September, 1950, in accordance with a questionnaire agreed by the Committeeand attached to this Report.  (Appendix &quot; A &quot;).3. In the preparation of their statements, it would be left to the countriesthemselves-(i) to initiate and state their own plan of development;(ii) to determine the priority of projects;(hi) to state the amount of assistance which they needed.The individual programmes would subsequently be examined by the Committeein order to clarify them and permit their assembly into a single report, but it shouldbe made clear that each individual country would determine its programme ofdevelopment to be included in the report and indicate the amount and type of aid which it required.4. The following general considerations were raised by Delegates and agreed (i) the programme should be for a six-year period ending 30th June, 1957.No project should be included in the submissions in the first instancewhich was not expected to be completed within that time;(ii) It was likely that the main limiting factors upon the programmes wouldbe the inadequacy of external finance, internal finance and technical knowledge and facilities. The need of assistance under any or all ofthese three headings would be revealed in the programmes submitted.(iii) the programme should be strictly realistic in character, taking into account the limits which exist upon the rate of development of an under-developed country;(iv) it would be necessary for the plans of development of under-developed countries to provide a reasonable balance between industry and agriculture;(v) emphasis was laid upon the importance of maintaining a stable income to producers from the exports of primary products from the Area andit was agreed that failure of demand outside the Area for its primary products would seriously prejudice development.5. It was agreed that, when the programmes had been submitted by theindividual countries showing the most that they could do by their own efforts, thenext stage would be the preparation of the report by the Committee. It wouldbe necessary for the report to provide an authoritative and convincing statement,endorsed by the Governments concerned, of the needs and resources of the Area.Commonwealth countries would then consider the position revealed by the report and would decide how much they would be able to contribute in finance, technical assistance and otherwise in order to meet the deficiencies indicated in the programmes.6. It would be necessary also to consider how the facilities of the united nations and its Regional Commissions and Specialised Agencies could be usedincreasingly and more effectively in order to help meet the deficiencies and soenable the programmes to be carried out. It was agreed that whatever assistance was forthcoming from Commonwealth countries should be supplemental to anyaid available from the sources indicated above which had the same objective, andshould not duplicate existing machinery.7. The position of the International Bank was regarded by Delegates asbeing of great importance in this connection, especially as its existing constitution and methods of operation had made it difficult for countries within the Area tosatisfy their financial requirements from it. Governments had already agreed in the Colombo Resolutions to support as high a priority as possible in the variousSpecialised Agencies for the needs of the Area, and Delegates agreed that informalconsultation should take place as appropriate in order to further this objective.
8. It was agreed that, before deciding whether a request for assistance shouldbe made to the United States and other countries interested in the Area, thepossibilities of solving the problem by self-help and mutual help within the Com-commonwealth and within the Area and by use of the United Nations and its regional commissions and Specialised Agencies should be expored and decisions taken.9. Great importance was attached by all Delegates to the preparation of these programmes and of the report according to a definite time-table which all Delegatesagreed to recommend to their Governments. It was decided that the programmesmust be submitted by the countries by 1st September and that meetings shouldsubsequently take place in order that an approach to the United States could bemade before the middle of November (see Part VIII of the Report). The speed of this time-table was necessary both because of the political need to set in motiona broad and imaginative plan for mastering the economic problems of the area and also because of the United States legislative situation. Delegates recognisedthat, if it was impossible to get an assistance programme into the United States legis-lative programme for 1951, it would be unlikely that aid would be forthcomingbefore 1953.10. It was agreed that an approach should be made to the non-Common-wealth countries in the Area to invite them to associate themselves with themembers of the Committee in a programme for the Area. Considerations involvedin this are dealt with in Part V of this Report.Part II. Technical Assistance1. Consideration was given to the role of technical assistance in the economic development of the Area. It was agreed that there was a serious lack of techniciansand the means of training in the Area, and further agreed that the supply oftechnicians in itself would not greatly increase production and standards of living in the Area unless accompanied by financial assistance where required, suppliesof capital goods, and social development, particularly in the realm of health and education in the broadest sense. Taking into account all relevant factors, theCommittee agreed that there was urgent need for additional technical assistancesupplementary to that provided by the United Nations and its Regional Corn-missions, Specialised Agencies and by individual countries, and that theCommonwealth should endeavour to the extent of its resources to supply thissupplementary assistance.2.- It was agreed, therefore, to recommend to Governments:-(i) that a Commonwealth Technical Assistance Scheme should be establishedimmediately, on the basis set out in Appendix &quot; B &quot; to this Export;(ii) that the Scheme should be organised to provide assistance up to amaximum value of  8 million sterling over the three years commencing1st July, 1950;(iii) that each member Government should indicate as soon as possible the share of technical assistance which it would contribute towards theScheme;(iv) that contributions under the Scheme by member Governments should,at the option of each contributing Government, comprise the provision in kind of the services of technical personnel to applicant countries,the training of personnel in their own countries, the payment of thecost of equipment and of any other costs, either in their own currencyor in any other currency;(v) that assistance provided under the Scheme should be arranged on a bilateral basis by agreement between applicant countries and contri-buting countries in respect of each application for assistance, and thatthe terms and conditions upon which such assistance should be affordedshould, in every case, be solely a matter for the Governments concerned;(vi) that Governments should, as soon as possible and from time to time, make available to the organisation referred to in Part VII of this Report andto any other co-operating country which desired it, statements of the availability of technical assistance, with the fullest particularspracticable.
(vii) that Governments should use their best offices to ensure that countries of the Area receive their fair share of all assistance available from thethe United Nations;its Regional Commissions&apos; and Specialised Agencies&apos;schemes and extended schemes for technical assistance and from allother sources. Assistance granted by member countries under theCommonwealth Scheme would be supplementary to assistance avail-able from other sources;(viii) that Governments should facilitate and encourage the release of experts,technicians and other personnel of their own countries for service underthe Scheme, and make available to the utmost extent facilities for thetraining of personnel from applicant countries;(ix) that Governments should at the appropriate time make suitable arrange-ments to organise, supervise or co-ordinate activities in their own countries in relation to the Scheme and to maintain liaison with theorganisation referred to in Part VII of this Report and with otherco-operating countries:(x) that Governments should give due attention to publicity for the activitiesunder the Scheme and use their best endeavours to encourage warmpublic support for the programme within their own countries.Part III. Priority Economic Requirements1. The information before the Committee about the economic position and needs of the non-Commonwealth countries in the Area was necessarily incomplete.Indeed a purpose of the plan of campaign outlined in Part I of this Report is tofind out what the needs of the countries of the Area really are with as much pre-cision as practicable. Some of the countries of the Area are already receivingassistance in some form from the Commonwealth, the United State of America, theUnited Nations, its Regional Commissions and Specialised Agencies or other sources. Nevertheless emergency needs may exist or may come to the notice of a commonwealth Government at any time.2. It was felt that priority economic requirements are likely to be predominantly-nantly in the sphere of technical equipment and essential consumer goods. Theseneeds might be met either by the provision of credit facilities or by supplies of thegoods needed to meet the emergency. It was agreed that it would be necessary forcountries seeking such emergency aid to demonstrate the high priority of their requirements and that they could not finance them from their own resources orthe other sources of assistance they were already receiving. It was also agreed that,in considering the grant of such assistance, Commonwealth countries would haveto take account of their existing commitments and obligations, including those toother countries within the Area.3. It was decided that the manner in which Commonwealth countries might best assist countries in the Area to meet emergency needs was a question whichwould require detailed and expert investigation and that it should be considered further as an urgent matter at a meeting of the Committee in London in the autumn of 1950 (see Part VIII of this Report).4. It was considered that if, in the meantime, a request for emergency assis-tance in the form of credit or other supplies from any country in the Area, includ-ing non-Commonwealth countries, were received by a Commonwealth Government,that Government, if it were satisfied that the assistance was required to meet anemergency need, would consider the request sympathetically, having regard to its existing commitments. The Government so approached would judge for itselfwhether, in the light of the particular circumstances, it would be desirable to bringother Commonwealth Governments into consultation in considering the request forsuch emergency aid.5.   It was agreed, therefore, to recommend to Governments (i) that, at the meeting of the Committee in London in the Autumn of 1950,the question of the provision of emergency aid to the countries of theArea should be given as high a priority as possible on the Agenda;
Part IV. Commodity Agreements1. Having considered the recommendation B (iv) of the Colombo Conferenceon commodity agreements (see paragraph 1 of the Introduction to this Report) theCommittee concluded that a stable income to the producers from the export of their primary products was essential to the economic well-being of the countries of theArea and that all possible steps should be taken to maintain, and where possible to expand, the markets for these products overseas and particularly in the dollar area.It was agreed that only after adequate investigation, commodity by commodity,could it be determined whether international commodity agreements in conformitywith the terms of the Havana Charter would contribute to this aim of enabling theindividual countries of the Area to stabilise incomes of producers from exports of primary products and to maintain such exports at a high and expanding level.2. Most of the commodities of major interest to the Area are already receivingattention from, or are being kept under review by, inter-governmental organisations;and it is open to any Government having an interest in a particular commoditywhich might justifiably be examined with a view to establishing an international commodity agreement, to request the Secretary-General of the United Nations toset up a study group. It was recommended, however, that the commonwealth governments should keep the matter under review. Individual commonwealth countries with an interest in a particular commodity may wish to report progress on any discussions directed towards setting up an international commodityagreement.3. Bilateral commodity arrangements are primarily a matter for considera-tion by individual countries in the light of their own needs and circumstances. Theinformation provided in connection with a country&apos;s development programme may give useful indications of the possibility of bilateral arrangements.4.   It was agreed, therefore, to recommend to Governments (i) that Commonwealth Governments, recognising the necessity for thecountries of the Area to stabilise incomes of producers from the exportsof their products and to maintain such exports at a high and expandinglevel, should take such measures as are open to them to promote this aim;(ii) that the individual Commonwealth Governments in the Area should keep under review, commodity by commodity, the extent to which inter-national commodity agreements, in conformity with the Havana Charter,or other commodity arrangements might contribute to the economicwell-being of the Area;(iii) that Commonwealth Governments might usefully exchange information,through channels most convenient to them for this purpose, about any proposals, relevant to the two preceding recommendations, which theyhave in mind for the promotion of international commodity agreementsor other arrangements for the marketing of their products.Part V. Relations with Non-Commonwealth Countries in the Area in thePreparation of the Development programme . All Delegates agreed that it was desirable to associate non-commonwealth countries in the Area with the preparation of a report in the Autumn of 1950 onthe lines indicated in Part I of the Report. It had been the intention of the ColomboConference that the action to be taken under its Resolutions should refer to&quot; South and South-East Asia&quot; and should not deal with the commonwealth countries in the Area alone. It was fully recognised that the non-Commonwealth(ii) that, pending further consideration in the Autumn of 1950 of the questionof the provision of emergency aid, individual Commonwealth Govern-ments should consider sympathetically, having regard to their existing commitments, any requests for emergency aid which they might receive from a country of the Area, consulting other members of the Common-wealth as might seem appropriate in each particular case.
countries could make a substantial contribution to the development of the area as a whole, and it was agreed that in any approach to them emphasis should belaid upon this as well as upon their own needs.2. The Committee was aware that this decision presented certain difficulties,both of organisation and of technique. It was recognised that the non-Common-wealth countries in the Area might find some difficulty in producing programmes of the same technical standard as those which would be submitted by theCommonwealth countries which had much more experience in this kind of work.It was agreed that the time-table for preparation of the report for possible presenta-tion to the United States was so urgent that the work should not be delayedbecause of any difficuly which non-Commonwealth countries might have insubmitting their programmes in time in comprehensive form. It was considered,however, that these countries would be able to provide sufficient information tobe fitted in with the programmes of the Commonwealth countries to enable a reasonably reliable assessment of the total needs of the Area to be made.3. It was agreed that the Governments of the non-Commonwealth countriesin the Area should be approached by the Australian Government on behalf of themembers of the Committee, the Australian Government acting in consultation withother Commonwealth Governments before the issue of any invitations.4. These Governments, if they accepted the invitation to participate, wouldthen be given the questionnaire referred to in Part I of this Report and would be offered friendly help by the Commonwealth in the work of submitting a programme by 1st September. It was agreed that there would not be time to set up an organisation to provide this help, but certain of the Delegates offered to recommend to their Governments to release a few officials familiar with programming to visit the capitals concerned and to give what help was possible. It was thought that four or five officials of this kind would be sufficient for this purpose and the UnitedKingdom Delegate offered to make the resources of the Commissioner-General for south-East Asia&apos;s organisation at Singapore (reinforced from London) availableto help with this work. Other Delegates likewise offered to help in this way.5. It was agreed that, in this element of the work, discussions should takeplace as necessary between the Commonwealth countries through the normal channels. It was agreed that the urgency was such that there was no time to awaitsetting up of a new organisation, although it was agreed that this might besubsequently necessary.6. It was agreed that the non-Commonwealth countries should not be broughtinto the process of preparing a report until a relatively late stage. The programmes of the non-Commonwealth countries would be sent before 1st September to theAustralian Government, which would circulate them to the other members of theCommittee.7. It was agreed that continuing consideration should be given to relationswith international organisations in the Area. It was agreed that the australian government should (i) inform E.C.A.F.E. of the desire of the Commonwealth Governments totake advantage of information on the economic situation in South andSouth-East Asia which E.C.A.F.E. has assembled; and(ii) invite the Executive Secretary to assist in providing information availableto him when so requested by Commonwealth Governments or theirrepresentatives.Part VI. Approach to United States and other Countries Interested inthe Area1. The Committee discussed the possible timing of a joint approach to theUnited States Government, enlisting their support for a programme of economic development in the Area.
2. It was agreed that this was a matter of great delicacy in a rapidly changingsituation and that it was impossible at present to lay down a firm time-table.3. The United Kingdom Delegate expressed the view that it would be unwise to make a formal joint approach until the report, on development had been prepared and there was a clear picture of the situation to put to the United States Govern-ment.  The Delegates recognised, however, that the situation was a very fluid one and that action at an earlier stage might be desirable in certain circumstances.III4. Governments would maintain informal contacts with the United; StatesGovernment on these matters in the manner which they considered most appropriate and the United Kingdom Government would advise the other Governments of thebest opportunity, in their opinion, for a formal joint approach.5. Consideration was given also to the possible association of France and holland with the development programme. It was agreed that no formal jointapproach should be made to these countries at present.Part VII. organisation. In order to implement the new Common vvealth Technical AssistanceScheme (see Part II of this Report) it was agreed that some new organisation wouldbe necessary. It was therefore decided to recommend the establishment of aBureau, which would have its offices in Colombo. The terms of reference of the bureau in the field of technical assistance would be (i) to receive statements of requirements for technical assistance within theArea and to attempt to match them with availabilities in member countries;(ii) to enter into close relationships with the United Nations, its regional commissions and Specialised Agencies with a view to informingcountries in the Area of the resources of the United Nations in thefield of technical assistance and assisting them in pressing theirapplications;(iii) to examine the obstacles, including considerations of expense, which nowimpede the flow of experts to underdeveloped countries and the place-ment of students and technicians from such countries in industries and educational and technical institutions abroad, and to make recom-mendations to the Committee on this problem.2. Although it was agreed that the proposed organisation would not be ableto assist immediately in drawing up the programme for economic development, itwas recognised that in all probability, at a later stage, there would be responsi-bilities in connection with the programme which would have to be assumed bysome continuing organisation of officials. It was suggested that these responsi-bilities might also be assumed by the Bureau to be established to deal with technical assistance. It would be for the proposed meeting of the Committee in the autumn of 1950 to define the terms of reference of the Bureau in this further field.3. There was agreement on the necessity for setting up at once some organisa-tion to assist in meeting the needs of countries in the area for technical assistance.On the other hand, it was felt that there were strong reasons for not determining the exact nature of the Bureau without awaiting further developments. It was highly important that skilled and sympathetic personnel should be obtained for thenew posts to be created, and it might take a little time to secure the services of themost suitable candidates. It was further recognised that at the next meetingof the Committee in the Autumn of 1950 other countries might be added to its membership. For this reason also it would be difficult to decide on the organisa-tion of the Bureau at this meeting of the Committee. It was therefore agreed thatit should be left to the next meeting of the Committee to decide on the constitutionof the Bureau.4. In recognition, however, of the urgent need for immediate action it wasagreed that a standing committee of the Committee should be established. Govern-ments are recommended to nominate without delay either officials or other persons
to serve as their representatives on the standing committee. The base of opera-tions of the standing committee would be in Colombo. From there members or their representatives could visit, upon request, co-operating Governments toassist them in exploring and defining their needs. The terms of reference of thestanding committee would be-(i) to exercise until the next meeting of the Committee the functions proposed for the Bureau in the field of technical assistance;(ii) to recommend to Governments further administrative arrangements whichit might be either necessary or desirable to institute before the next meeting of the Committee;(iii) to make recommendations to the Committee at its next meeting concerningthe most appropriate constitution for the Bureau.5. The Chairman of the standing committee may be authorised by it toarrange for the necessary clerical staff and for the recruitment of any special officerswhich may be found to be necessary for the operation of the programme.6. The Ceylon Delegation has agreed to recommend to its Government thatit make advances to meet common costs. These advances would be repayable inagreed proportions in accordance with arrangements to be made at the meetingof the Committee in the Autumn of 1950.7. The Committee, therefore, makes the following recommendations to governments (i) that a Bureau be established at the next meeting of the Committee toexercise the functions outlined in paragraphs 1-3 of Part VII of thisReport, and(ii) that a standing committee be established to exercise the functions outlined in paragraph 4 of Part VII of this Report, and that the first meeting ofthe standing committee be convened by the Government of Ceylon totake place not later than 15th July, 1950.Part VIIL-Schedule of Future Meetings1. It was agreed that a series of meetings should take place in London inthe Autumn of 1950.2. It was agreed that the first stage should be a meeting of officials to examinethe programmes which had been submitted by the Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries in the Area and such other matters as might be referredto them, and to prepare a draft report on the development programmes. Thismeeting would take place early in September.3. The meeting of officials would be followed by a meeting of representativesof Governments which would consider, amongst other items (i) priority economic requirements of the countries of the Area (see Part iii of this Report);(ii) the report on the development programmes (see Part I of this Report);(iii) assistance from Commonwealth countries;(iv) the most effective use of the resources of the United Nations, its regional commissions and Specialised Agencies;(v) the question of approaches to the United States and other Governmentsinterested in the Area (see Part VI of this Report);(vi) the constitution and functions of the Bureau (see Part VII of this Report).4. It was contemplated that in the first instance there should be a meetingof Commonwealth representatives alone. There would then be a meeting including representatives of non-Commonwealth countries participating in the programme.The arrangements for the series of meetings would be the subject of prior consulta-tion amongst Commonwealth Governments, possibly through their High Com-misioners in London.
5. The meeting of Government representatives would be expected to begintowards the end of September in order that everything should be ready for an approach to the United States if this should prove desirable before the middle ofNovember.Extract of recommendations i. Preparation of Development PlanIt was agreed that a report should be prepared setting out the need for development, the development programmes of the countries in the Area whichmight be expected to be completed over a period of six years ending 30th June, 1957,and the need for external assistance in order to carry out these programmes- Itwas agreed that a first and indispensable step would be for each participatingcountry in the Area to prepare a realistic and comprehensive statement of its economic situation and development programme. This statement would be sub-mitted by each country to the Committee through the Australian government before 1st September, 1950, in accordance with a questionnaire agreed by theCommittee and attached to this Report (Appendix &quot; A &quot;).It was agreed that these individual programmes would be examined by theCommittee in order to clarify them and permit their assembly into a single report which would provide an authoritative and convincing statement, endorsed by theGovernments concerned, of the needs and resources of the Area. commonwealth countries would then consider the position revealed by the report and would decide how much they would be able to contribute in finance, technical assistance and otherwise in order to meet the deficiencies indicated in the programmes.It was agreed that whatever assistance was forthcoming from commonwealth countries be supplemental to any aid available from the United Nations, its regional commissions and its Specialised Agencies which had the same objective and shouldnot duplicate existing machinery.Great importance was attached to the preparation of the programmes and thereport according to the agreed time-table (paragraph 9). (Summary of maindecisions only in Part I of this Report.)II. Technical AssistanceIt was agreed to recommend to Governments (i) that a Commonwealth Technical Assistance Scheme should be establishedimmediately, on the basis set out in Appendix &quot; B &quot; to this Report;(ii) that the Scheme should be organised to provide assistance up to amaximum value of  8 million sterling over the three years commencing1st July, 1950;(iii) that each member Government should indicate as soon as possible the share of technical assistance which it would contribute towards thescheme;(iv) that contributions under the Scheme by member Governments should, atthe option of each contributing Government, comprise the provision in kind of the services of technical personnel to applicant countries, thetraining of personnel in their own countries, the payment of the costof equipment and of any other costs, either in their own currency or inany other currency.(v) that assistance provided under the Scheme should be arranged on a bilateral basis by agreement between applicant countries and contribution-ing countries in respect of each application for assistance, and that theterms and conditions upon which such assistance should be affordedshould, in every case, be solely a matter for the Governments concerned;(vi) that Governments should, as soon as possible and from time to time,make available to the organisation referred to in Part VII of this report and to any other co-operating country which desired it, statements ofthe availability of technical assistance, with the fullest particulars&quot;&quot;   practicable;
(vii) that Governments should use their best offices to ensure that countries ofthe Area receive their fair share of all assistance available from united nations, its Regional Commissions&apos; and Specialised Agencies&apos; schemes and extended schemes for technical assistance and from all other sources.Assistance granted by member countries under the CommonwealthScheme would be supplementary to assistance available from other;c &quot;       .. sources;(viii) that Governments should facilitate and encourage the release of experts,technicians and other personnel of their own countries for service underthe Scheme, and make available to the utmost extent facilities for thetraining of personnel from applicant countries;(ix) that Governments should at the appropriate time make suitable arrange-ments to organise, supervise or co-ordinate activities in their own countries in relation to the Scheme and to maintain liaison with theorganisation referred to in Part VII of this Report and with other co-operating countries;- (x) that Governments should give due attention to publicity for the activitiesunder the Scheme and use their best endeavours to encourage warmpublic support for the programme within their own countries. (Part ii of this Report, paragraph 2.)III. Priority Economic RequirementsIt was agreed to recommend to Governments (i) that, at the meeting of the Committee in London in the Autumn of 1950,the question of the provision of emergency aid to the countries of theArea should be given as high a priority as possible on the Agenda;(ii) that pending further consideration in the Autumn of 1950 of the questionof the provision of emergency aid, individual Commonwealth Govern-ments should consider sympathetically, having regard to their existing commitments, any requests for emergency aid which they might receive from a country of the Area consulting other members of the Common-wealth as might seem appropriate in each particular case. (Part iii of this Report, paragraph 5.)IV. Commodity AgreementsIt was agreed to recommend to Governments (i) that Commonwealth Governments, recognising the necessity for countries of the Area to stabilise the income of producers from the exports of their products and to maintain such exports at a high and expanding level,should take such measures as are open to them to promote this aim;(ii) that the individual Commonwealth Governments in the Area should keep under review, commodity by commodity, the extent to which inter-national commodity agreements, in conformity with the HavanaCharter, or other commodity arrangements might contribute to theeconomic well-being of the Area;(iii) that Commonwealth Governments might usefully exchange information,through channels most convenient to them for this purpose, about any proposals, relevant to the two preceding recommendations, which theyhave in mind for the promotion of international commodity agreementsor other arrangements for the marketing of their products. (Part iv of this Report, paragraph 4.)V.- Relations with Non-Commonwealth Countries in the Area in Preparationof the Development ProgrammeIt was agreed that it was desirable to associate non-Commonwealth countriesin the Area with the preparation of a report in the Autumn of 1950 on the lines indicated in Part 1. of this Report. It was fully recognised that such countries could make a substantial contribution to the development of the area as a whole, and it was agreed that in any approach to them emphasis should belaid upon this as well as upon their own needs. It was agreed that the Governmentsof these countries should be approached by the Australian Government onbehalf of the members of the Committee, the Australian Government acting in
consultation with other Commonwealth Governments before the issue of anyinvitations. The non-Commonwealth Governments, if they accepted the invitation to participate, would then be given the questionnaire referred to in Part I of thisReport and would be offered friendly help by the Commonwealth in the work ofsubmitting a programme by 1st September.It was agreed that the non-Commonwealth countries should not be brought intothe process of preparing a report until a relatively late stage. The programmes ofthe non-Commonwealth countries would be sent before 2nd September to theAustralian Government, which would circulate them to the other members of theCommittee.It was agreed that continuing consideration should be given to relations with international organisations in the Area. It was agreed that the Australian Govern-ment should (i) inform E.C.A.F.E. of the desire of the Commonwealth Governments to takeadvantage of information on the economic situation in South andSouth-East Asia which E.C.A.F.E. has assembled; and(ii) invite the Executive Secretary to assist in providing information availableto him when so requested by Commonwealth Governments or theirrepresentatives.(Summary of Part V of this Report.)VI. Approach to United States and other Countries interested in the AreaGovernments would maintain informal contacts with the United States Govern-ment, in connection with the programme of economic development in the Area, inthe manner which they considered most appropriate and the United KingdomGovernment would advise the other Governments of the best opportunity, in theiropinion, for a formal joint approach to the United States Government to enlist their support. It was agreed that no formal joint approach should be made to france or Holland at present. (Summary of Part VI of this Report.)VII. OrganisationIt was agreed to recommend to Governments (i) that a Bureau be established at the next meeting of the Committee toexercise the functions outlined in paragraphs 1-3 of Part VII of thisReport;(ii) that a standing committee be established to exercise the functions outlined in paragraph 4 of Part VII of this Report and that the first meeting ofthe standing committee be convened by the Government of Ceylon totake place not later than 15th July, 1950. (Part VII of this Report,paragraph 7.)VIII.-Schedule of Future MeetingsIt was agreed that a series of meetings should take place in London in theAutumn of 1950. The first stage should be a meeting of officials of commonwealth countries early in September to examine the programmes submitted by the Common-wealth and non-Commonwealth countries in the Area and such other matters as might be referred to them, and to prepare a draft report on the development pro-gramme. The meeting of officials&apos; would be followed towards the end of Septemberby a meeting of representatives of Governments which would consider, amongst other items, the matters listed in paragraph 3 of Part VIII of this Report. Itwas contemplated that in the first instance there should be a meeting of Common-wealth representatives alone; there would then be a meeting including representa-tives of non-Commonwealth countries participating in the programme. (Summaryof Part VIII of this Report.)CC/SY/2/15, Rev. 1Final Communique for British Commonwealth Consultative committee at the invitation of the Australian Government, a meeting of the BritishCommonwealth Consultative Committee was held in Sydney between 15th and19th May, 1950, and was attended by the representatives of the Governments of
Australia, Canada, Ceylon, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and the United Kingdom.The Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Honourable P. C. Spender, theAustralian Minister for External Affairs, considered ways in which they mightassist in the development of the countries of South and South-East Asia inco-operation with other interested Governments. This was the important taskentrusted to them by the Commonwealth Meeting on Foreign Affairs held inColombo in January 1950, which recommended that steps should be taken urgentlyto raise living standards and promote social welfare amongst the peoples of Southand South-East Asia, thus enabling this area with its vast potential resources to play an increasing part in fostering human well-being and furthering world prosperity.2. In pursuance of the objectives of the Colombo Conference, the committee decided that the most effective method of tackling the vast and intricate problemsfacing the peoples of South and South-East Asia and of meeting their urgent needfor economic development would be to start immediately a programme based onaction by the Commonwealth Governments which have participated in thediscussions.3. The Committee emphasised the importance of keeping the urgent economicrequirements of the area under continuous review. Action to meet these require-ments is already being taken by Commonwealth Governments, and the Committeewould welcome further action which individual Commonwealth Governments mightbe able to take. In addition recommendations are being made to Governments asfollows:  (1) Development should proceed by progressive stages under a plan covering aperiod of six years taking account of the needs and resources of individual countries. To this end, a realistic and comprehensive state-ment of its economic situation and development programme should beprepared by each country by 1st September, 1950.(2) These statements of the various countries should be considered at meetingsof Governments in London in September 1950. A comprehensivereport would then be prepared setting out the needs and resources of countries in the area. The object would be the introduction with theleast possible delay of comprehensive plans for a development pro-gramme of gathering momentum based on all the resources which canbe mobilised by the countries concerned and other countries interestedin the area.(3) A Commonwealth technical assistance scheme for the area should beinaugurated within the next few months to organise technical assistance between Governments. The aggregate of assistance involved would be 8,000,000 sterling over a period of three years. A CommonwealthBureau should be set up at Colombo to co-ordinate the work. Whileit is recognised that there is already a considerable flow of technical assistance through private and governmental channels to the area andthat valuable assistance has already been received from the united nations, the Specialised Agencies and their regional organisations, it isconsidered that their existing resources in the area require to be supple-mented immediately.(4) A formal approach should be made to Governments of non-commonwealth countries in South and South-East Asia informing them of theCommittee&apos;s deliberations and of the course of action now contem-plated. These Governments should be informed that their full associa-tion in the enterprise would be welcomed by the commonwealth governments.4. These discussions at Sydney have shown that in the four months since the colombo meeting much thought and study have been given by commonwealth governments to means by which the Colombo resolutions can be translated intoa constructive plan to deal with the many complex economic problems with whichthe countries of South and South-East Asia are now faced. All Delegations came to Sydney impressed with a sense of the urgency of the task before them, fully aware that a great co-operative effort was called for by all countries which have theinterests of the people of the area at heart and determined that all efforts should beinspired by the principles of self-help and mutual help, of friendship and equalityamong the countries.\5th-\9th May, 1950.
APPENDIX &quot;A&quot;QUESTIONNAIRE   ON   DEVELOPMENTPart I. The Need for development . The purpose of this section of the report would be to bring out, in very general terms, the need for development. Each country should submit a shortdescriptive statement of the state of Development, together with a brief description of the economic dislocation and damage caused by the war, and post-war disturb-ances, and the extent to which that dislocation and damage is now rectified.2. It will be necessary to have a number of specific statistical factors, both inorder to illustrate a summary of the state of Development and also in order topermit calculations to be made making comparison with the state of development in more highly developed countries. A list of relevant specific facts is at Table D.Much of this information has already been made available, e.g., for E.C.A.F.E.,so that the answering of parts of the questionnaire may consist of little more thana revision (or reproduction) of figures already prepared. It would not be expectedthat each country would be able to answer all the questions, but the more that can be answered, the better. Countries should complete this table only to theextent to which statistics are readily available.Part II. The Development Programmes of the Individual Countries3. A description is required of the development plans of each country, presented as a six-year programme, beginning in July 195.1. Although presented as a six-year programme, it should not be assumed that all the work will be completed within six years nor that the completion of the programme satisfies all the needs. when general figures are given, these should be assessed on the assumption that the rateof investment will continue after the six-year period ; but only those projects whichWill be completed within six years should be listed. Thus, it would be desirable tostate the point which would be reached by 1957, if the programme were carried through, in the specified fields indciated in Table D, and thus show the advance-ment of the state of development by that time, both in increased productivity and inthe increased standard of living of the peoples.4. The programme should show the relative priority attaching to each line ofdevelopment, the objective of the programme in each country being to satisfy the most urgent economic needs within the six-year period.5. The programme should take the widest possible view of development. Itshould not be confined to &quot; projects &quot; but should cover all aspects of economic development, including capital work, maintenance, and work carried out andfinanced by private enterprise (local and foreign) as well as work done by Govern-ment and nationalised agencies in economists phraseology, &quot; gross investment.&quot;It is recognised that Governments may find it difficult to assess private investment in countries which are based mainly on an agricultural economy, but any estimateof such investment which can be given will be of great value. It may be that countries will find it possible to give a total figure for private investment only, but where practicable it would be of advantage if such a figure could be divided into six partsas follows: -(i) Agriculture. ;.(ii) Transport and Communications.(iii) Fuel and Power.(iv) Mining (other than coal).(v) Industry.(vi) Social capital (housing, hospitals, schools, &amp;c).6. Under each of these heads, there should be a description of the developmentenvisaged, with a list and brief description of the main projects ; the object of eachsuch project and a note on the way in which it is intended that each should fit intothe general development programme. A &quot; project&quot; is understood to be a specific
scheme of economic or special development carried out as a whole. The scale ofthe present development effort should be emphasised. Multi-purpose projects shouldbe dealt with under &quot; agriculture &quot; unless there are special reasons for showing them under another heading.7. A description should be given of the way in which the programme as awhole will improve the long-term balance of payments of the country, and thegeneral volume of trade between South and South-East Asia and the rest of theworld. It is clearly undesirable that development plans should be undertaken duringthe period when external assistance is available that will become a burden whenthe aid ceases and some indication should be given of how continuing commitmentswill be financed after aid ceases.8. The programme should be realistic, in that it must be within the capacityof the country to carry out, given internal political stability and foreign assistance.It will greatly enhance the quality of the programme (and thus its value for thepurpose of securing the objectives of the report) if clear evidence is presented on thispoint, e.g., the speed with which projects can be completed in the conditions of thecountry, the adequacy of transport facilities, the availability of workers with thenecessary degree of skill, the availability of technicians, the adequacy, of living conditions for the workers, &amp;c. The programme should show that the rate ofdevelopment contemplated is realistic and feasible in the political, economic and social conditions ruling in the country.9. It is important to get a clear idea of what would be the effect upon thedevelopment programme of failure to obtain the assistance which is required.10. A description should be given of the administrative machinery by whichthe programme is carried out, e.g., is there a Government Department responsiblefor development? Does this Departments scope of activity extend to other government-controlled services, such as the railways? Is there a development programme covering both Government-financed and privately-financed investment?Is there machinery for co-ordination of all forms of development planning? Howare the priorities determined? If there is no organisation in existence at present,is there an intention to set up one and if so, of what kind?11. Statistical material about the Development Programme should be pro-vided in three classifications (which will, of course, overlap) and the illustrative formset out in Tables A and B are designed to cover each of these.Developmental Commodities (Table A)An estimate of total consumption and required imports in 1951-52 andin the programme period 1951-52 to 1956-57 of steel, non-ferrous metals, pig-iron, timber, cement, fertiliser, machinery and vehicles, coal and oil.This should not refer solely to requirements directly limited to Govern-ment Development Programmes, but should cover the whole economy.Each country might add such other suitable developmental commodities whichare of particular importance to its plan.Cost of Development by Public Authorities (Table B)An analysis of the total investment for the same periods, being the totalcost of expenditure on all forms of capital development work undertaken by public Authorities. Particulars should also be given of important individual projects showing the nature of the project, source of finance, date begun or tobe begun, expenditure up to year 1951, expenditure still remaining and estimated completion date.Part III. Adequacy of Commonwealth Resources12. If the development programme is drawn up on a realistic physical basis in the sense indicated in paragraph 8, the limitations upon its effective executionare:  (i) External Finance.(ii) Internal Finance.(iii) Resources of technical expertise.
13. It should be assumed for this purpose that supplies of commodities areavailable to the extent required for each country&apos;s development programme pro-vided that the internal financial resources are available to permit the programme to go forward and that the external financial resources are available to permit thenecessary imports to be purchased.External Finance14. It is necessary to draw up an estimate of the balance of payments for1951-52 on the assumption that the development programme proceeds as in Part II.It is necessary to divide this balance of payments between dollar (United Statesand Canada) and non-dollar sources.15. Actual figures should be shown for the year 1949; an estimate for1950-51; an estimate for 1951-52. The estimate for 1950-5.1 should be on a &quot; fore-cast &quot; basis related to the present external financial resources of the country, with no new United States aid. The estimate for 1951-52 assumes that assistance willbe available from 1st July, 1951.16. An indication should be given of the likely course of the balance of pay-ments after 1951-52. For example, will the amount of required food imports riseor fall, and if so, by how much and over what period of time? Will increasingresources become available for export?17. For purely statistical purposes in the provision of these estimates it shouldbe assumed that prices remain at the level of 1st July, 1950.18. The resources known or forecast to be available for financing the current account deficit in 1951-52, e.g., loans from the International Bank and private investment, should be specified.19.   A form is set out in Table C.Internal Finance20. In some countries the provision of internal finance for the development programme may present even more serious difficulty than the provision of externalfinance.21. An account should therefore be given of the internal financial position ofthe country and of the extent to which it is considered that internal financial resources will be available, either by taxation or by local borrowing to meet theinternal element in the cost of development as indicated in Table B. This should include information about the revenue and expenditure of both central and pro-vincial authorities together with particulars of public debt.22. The extent of detail of this account should depend upon the position ofthe individual country. If external assistance is required in order to meet part ofthe internal cost of development, a detailed review is necessary of the budgetaryposition, measures to combat inflation, the extent of savings and especially themethods or mobilising them, &quot;&amp;c. If, on the other hand, it is felt that internalfinance will be available up to the required extent, all that is necessary is to show the sources from which the internal finance is drawn, in a manner matching the particulars about internal cost given in Table B.23. Producer countries which are desirous of entering commodity agreementswithin the scope of the Havana Charter may wish to mention the commodities inrespect of which such agreements are desired, giving particulars. In any event,it would be valuable if all countries which are heavily dependent on the export of afew primary products could state their production and export surplus and have a passage in their report showing the importance of the price and demand for these products to their economy.Availability of Technical Expertise24. A statement is required setting out the extent to which the country&apos;sown resources of technical expertise ranging from highly-qualified specialists andadministrators to foremen in factories and construction projects, and teachers foragricultural education services-are sufficient for the execution of the programme,and of other technical facilities such as Pilot plants which may be needed. Par-ticular emphasis will, of course, be placed upon facilities for training the country&apos;s
own nationals for this work. It is desirable to express the needs for technical assistance in quantitative form and to indicate both the sort of assistance whichis required and its timing. This is a field in which resources are very scarce, evenin the United States, and if practical action is to be taken, it will probably benecesssary to organise training programmes over a considerable period of years in all parts of the world.Assistance within the Commonwealth25. The replies to this questionnaire will indicate the amount and nature ofassistance which the various countries will need in order to carry out their develop-ment programmes. All members of the Consultative Committee, whether putting forward development programmes or not, should consider the amount of assistance which they will be able to give, either to help to finance the balance of paymentsdeficit resulting from the development programme, or in .the provision of financeto help to meet the internal finance parts of the programme, or in the provisionof technical assistance. The Committee should examine the possibility of solvingthese problems within the Commonwealth before asking others to contribute.26. It is desirable also that the assistance given to each other by Common-wealth members and non-Commonwealth countries in this area since the end ofthe war should be placed on record, and members of the Committee should submitmemoranda indicating the assistance which they have given to other Common-wealth members in this area and to other countries in this area during the last fiveyears, in a form which would enable this to be presented as part of the report.This should include (i) Facilities for financing of balance of payments deficits;(ii) Inter-Governmental loans and grants;(iii) Subscriptions, e.g., U.N.R.R.A. for use in South-East Asia;(iv) Special allocations of scarce commodities:(v) Special efforts to produce scarce commodities.27. The purpose of collecting this information is to place on record the very substantial amount of intra-Commonwealth co-operation which has taken place to deal with the critical political and economic situation following the end of thewar in the Far East.Use of United Nations Agencies28. Countries should specify those requirements of external finance, internalfinance, and technical expertise which they could hope to secure through themachinery of United Nations and the specialised agencies.

Technical assistance will include the following services:  (a) Training of personnel from the region in&quot; more highly developed countries where suitable instruction is available;(b) Provision of experts by more highly developed countries to assist in planning, development or reconstruction in countries in the region in theoperation of agricultural, industrial governmental or other activities andin the training of personnel;(c) The provision of equipment necessary for the effective application of other forms of technical assistance;(d) The establishment, equipment, extension or endowment of training orother institutions in countries in the region.2. Technical assistance will be granted on a bilateral basis, with the under-standing that this basis includes the possibility of joint schemes where two ormore applicant countries or two or more contributing countries are involved.3. The negotiation of the terms and conditions upon which technical assistance is afforded by one country to another shall be determined by agreement between those countries.4. Such agreement may provide terms of service, salary, allowances or other conditions for experts, and technicians lent by one country to another and of personnel being trained and the proportion, if any, of the cost of the whole service to be provided by the recipient country.5. All applications for technical assistance under the Commonwealth scheme will, in the first instance, be registered with the Bureau by the applicant countryand all assistance granted by contributing countries by way of technical assistance will in like manner be registered by the Bureau.6. Every member of the Commonwealth Consultative Committee will immediately, supply to the Bureau a statement of the type of technical assistance which it can make available, with the fullest possible detail of the terms andconditions on which such assistance can be made available. Each member willcontinue from time to time and throughout the period during which the Bureau isoperating, to supplement and correct such information.
7. It is a basic principle of technical assistance under the CommonwealthScheme that it shall be in all cases, supplementary to assistance available under anynational, international or other programme operating in the region.8. It will be the duty of the Bureau to establish liaison immediately withthe United Nations and the specialised agencies, with the United States and with.all other organisations or countries not members of the Commonwealth consultative committee which are presently affording technical assistance within the regionor which may do so in the future.9. On receipt of a request from any member, the Bureau will provide all information available in respect of technical assistance schemes whether within theCommonwealth or outside and in respect of United Nations, specialised agencies and the United States and other national schemes and will undertake to assistapplicant member countries to present their claims, to document them and topress them, if possible, to a successful Conclusion.10. Upon the request of any member country that an application for technical assistance should be considered, the Bureau will place that application before theCommittee, together with all relevant information, including, a statement of the availability of technical assistance from other sources and the status of any applica-tion, to any of those sources, or, alternatively,11. In respect of an application for technical assistance, the Bureau shall,as soon as necessary preliminary discussions with the applicant country have beencompleted, supply a copy of the application, together with all relevant information with regard to availability of resources, at the discretion of the Bureau or at therequest of the applicant country either (a) to all Members;(b) to one or more Members as nominated by the applicant country; or(c) to such Members as have indicated the availability of the types of technical assistance appropriate to the application.12. On receipt of every application for assistance each Member Governmentwill endeavour to indicate at the earliest possible moment the assistance which itcan supply in respect of the whole or any part of an application. Each Govern-ment which is able to supply any part of assistance required will forthwith advise the applicant country and the Bureau.13. The Bureau will employ such experts, technical advisers and other staff asit may consider necessary for the efficient carrying out of its functions.14. At any time on the request of a Member, the Bureau will endeavourto supply to that member, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Bureau and the member, the services of experts, technical advisers and others, where it is satisfied that such services cannot be obtained at the appro-priate time from other sources and are necessary for the efficient fulfilment of anyof the functions of the Bureau. The Bureau will organise the establishment of fieldmissions to advise and assist any Member Governments on their request, wherethe Bureau is satisfied that sach missions are necessary. As the occasion requires,the members of these field missions will be supplied by Member countries astechnical assistants or may be engaged by the Bureau.15. The Bureau will examine and investigate all obstacles or difficulties thatreduce or prevent the availability of technical assistance, and shall use its best endeavours to remove or ameliorate any obstacles or difficulties. In particular,the Bureau may, in agreement with Member countries, establish a model set ofterms of service for experts lent to applicant countries and a model set of conditionsupon which personnel from applicant countries can be trained in other countries.16. The Bureau shall provide publicity for the activities under the technical assistance Scheme, and establish and maintain public relations throughout thearea.
