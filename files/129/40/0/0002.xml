(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HI3 BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (50)  102H     11TH MAY,  1950CABINETCOPY NO.CANADIAN WHEAT AND FLOURMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations&apos;InP.(50)93 the Minister of Pood has set outthe line which he recommends should be followed in the initial stages of our negotiations with the Canadian Minisfor Trade and Commerce next week.      The guiding principlebehind his recommendations is that our course of action should, subject to our obligations under the InternationalterWheat Agreementbedetermined by our need to buy wheat onthe most advantageous terms wherever we choose.2. There are two aspects to our wheat purchases.The first relates to the quantities and price of our futurepurchases wherever they may be made.      On this I appreciate the prime importance from the point of view of our dollarbalance of payments of pursuing the policy which the Ministerof Pood recommends.3. The second aspect relates to the &quot;have regard to&quot;clause (see Appendix A to CP. (50)  98).      Whatever may bethe rights and wrongs of the argument about the original intention of the &quot;have rep;ard to&quot; clause, the fact remainsit0 neQJtime of the negotiations within December, 1that we might have that we did acknowledge the Canadians;obligation flowing from that clause which should be settled in the present talks.      This is made plain in the text of the agreed public announcement issued at the time, which is quoted in paragraph 2 of Appendix C to CP. (50) 98.      The argumentwitn the Canadians whether or not there is any outstandingobligation to he settled will turn on the comparison betweenthe price 01 2 (Canadian)charge paid for Canadian wheat in thcontract3or bushel plus 6 cents carrying------  -  ---- last two years of theana the world price prevailing during that period.I quite see that, this is an argument on which there are two points 01 view.      But since devaluation we have been payingCanada only 8 cents per busheland: more than the I.W. A.  maximum,ve know that the&quot;Canadians.. for their part, feel very strongly that we still owe them something in respect of the&quot;have regard to&quot; clause which we must liquidate in the comingtalks.      This Canadian attitude is one which must be takenfully into account in our proposed plan of campaign.1+, The indication which we propose to give Mr.  Howeabout the big reduction in the quantity of Canadian wheat tobe purchased by us in the next crop year will, in itself,come as a severe shock to the Canadians.      That shock will be greatly intensified if,  at the same time, we take the with the Canadians that we owe them nothing by way ofmerit under the &quot;have regard to&quot; clause,  on which they come to London expecting to secure some concession,strongly that if we take up a completely negative line&quot;have regard toon quantity, we and his team atclause immediately aftershall estrange and&apos; indeed the outset of discussionslinesettle-willI feel3 on the breaking the newsantagonise Mr.  Howewhich will in any

event be exceedingly difficult.      The Minister of Food contem-plates that a compromise might be reached with the Canadianson their &quot;have regard to&quot; claims (paragraph 15(f) of cp. (50) 98).      I think it important, for the reasons given above, that we should not, in the opening stages, appear tobe unwilling to consider any compromise at all.5. Mr. Howe is one of the most influential ministers in the Canadian Government and. fundamentally well disposed to the United Kingdom.      By virtue of his influence and ofhis position as Minister for Trade and Commerce, he has it inhis power to promote or damage our export drive, the successof which is inevitably dependent to a substantial extent onthe active goodwill of the Canadian Government.      We havealready had plenty of evidence of the concern which Canadianshave shown at the effect on their economy of our successivelyreduced programmes of imports from Canada.      It will moreoverbe difficult for the Canadians to understand why it isnecessary for vis to make further cuts, this time in our wheatimports, when our earnings of dollars generally, and partiC&quot;particularly of Canadian dollars, have recently shown such substan-tial improvement, and when our accounts, leaving aside E. R. P.Aid and the Canadian credit, for the first time, show afavourable balance.      A recent example of Canadian thinkingin this matter is contained in Mr.  Howe&apos;s letter to theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in Ottawa on being told thatthere was a possibility of our making purchases of timber inRussia.      He then wrote &quot;We in Canada cannot be happy about this deliberate movement away from the Canadian market, whichhas served Britain well in time of need,  in favour of a country which is carrying on a cold war against Britain and canada&quot;.      However difficult it may be for us to accept theCanadian arguments on this subject, we cannot afford to risk the loss of goodwill which blindness to their existence would entail in our economic relations generally, and our exportdrive in particular.      I say nothing here of the effect on our political relations generally:    but the point is a very important one.6. The present paper by the Minister of Pood relates to wheat purchases.      This is, however,  only one&apos; of the manyCanadian exports in respect of which, we have been obliged to cut our purchases in recent years.      These affect everyProvince throughout Canada.      We have at different times cutdown on bacon and eggs, whose production is spread whereverthere is farming, on timber from the east and west coasts,on apples from the Maritimes and British Columbia, on canned salmon from British Columbia.      This is not an exhaustivelist.      The effect of our import restrictions is felt through-out Canada and in the nature of things creates political difficulties 3?or the Canadian authorities.      We have found itnecessary in the past to take into account those difficulties.For example, my colleagues will remember the serious threat to our good relations with Canada which arose last autumn from our proposal, necessitated by the great dollar difficulties oflast year, to eliminate or reduce our purchases of Canadiantimber, pulp, newsprint, bacon, eggs and canned salmon.Messages were exchanged between the Prime Minister and thePrime Minister of Canada, and between the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Canadian Minister of Finance, followingwhich we found it desirable to ease the situation by agreeing to the purchase of bacon, canned salmon,  and soft wood, tothe value of $25 millions Canadian.

7* This policy of what might be termed selectiveeasements was deliberately adopted in order not to alienatethe goodwill of Canada which has stood us in such goodstead, both politically and economically, in the past.It seems to me vital that in our negotiations withMr.  Howe on wheat we should bear in mind, from the start,the paramount importance of our own wider interests andthat we should be ready, if the need arises, to suggestfurther judicious concessions which, though not costingus a great many dollars, preserve goodwill towards usthroughout Canada and are thus of assistance to us in our export drive.P. C. G. -W.Commonwealth Relations Office,S, W. 1 ,11TH MAY, 1950.
