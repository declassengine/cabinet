THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1950SECRET Copy No.CP. (50) 14530th June, 1950CABINETNATIONALISATION OF PUBLIC WATER supplies memorandum by the Minister of HealthIntroduction1. At the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 4th May (CM. (50) 28th Conclusions,Minute 6), I was invited to supply a map indicating the areas into which the country would be divided if public water supplies were nationalised; an indication of theway in which the areas might be organised (i) under the Ministry of Health and(ii) by means of joint local authority boards; and a statement of the financial effects of a joint board structure.2. The attached map of England and Wales shows the country divided into53 areas with common interests which could, I consider, be satisfactorily adminis-tered by permanent full-time staff working at suitable local centres. Also attachedis a diagram of some of the principal sources of supplies and trunk mains in atypical industrial area, the West Riding of Yorkshire.3. The general picture provided by this diagram is one of unplanned andunco-ordinated development. In the past the development of the catchment areasof the Pennines by the larger towns was haphazard in the sense that the developersrarely took account of any requirements but their own. The results are trunkmains crossing one another or running near one another from the impoundingreservoirs to the towns, with little or no regard to the requirements of the inter-vening areas; large mains running across miles of country to provide bulk supplies,but ignoring the needs of intervening towns taking supplies from other distantsources; undertakings buying water from neighbours and selling water to others,who, in their turn, are passing water on to other districts; onerous agreements forbulk supplies; and hard bargains with mill owners in respect of compensation waterwhich prevent the full use of expensive works constructed by the undertakings. Itis clear that nothing short of a major operation will cure the present ills here and elsewhere in the country. I propose that in the West Riding the operation shouldbe a reduction of the 94 existing undertakings to 5 water areas.Organisation under a Central Water Department4. For the country as a whole, I propose that the water areas should be controlled and administered by senior engineering, administrative and financialofficers who would be largely drawn from the ranks of the existing water under-takings and would be civil servants. The offices, depots, &amp;c, would be at convenientcentres, usually in buildings and on land transferred from the existing undertakings.This local staff would be responsible for the full day-to-day working of their areas,including such matters as the design and execution of straightforward works(e.g., pumping stations or service reservoirs); extensions of water mains; main-tenance, repairs and renewals; water treatment; agreements with consumers;38942 b
contracts for works; payment of staff and other local staff questions; and collectionof rates and charges, which Would often be done by local authorities on an agencybasis. They would work to annual budgets of expenditure approved by Head-quarters. The Headquarters staff would also be responsible for general waterpolicy, including questions such as the design and execution of major works (e.g.,impounding reservoirs); central purchase of plant and materials; the obtaining! ofnew powers; the co-ordination of resources and supplies; relations with other government Departments; and the general guidance and oversight of the work ofthe local staffs.5. At present it is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the staffingrequirements of the water areas. There would have to be senior engineering,administrative and financial officers who would need qualified assistants, as well asclerks, typists and other junior staff. The numbers in each grade must depend onthe size of the areas the Metropolitan Area, for example, which is by far thelargest, would obviously have to have a much larger staff than the small areas,mainly rural in character, on the Welsh border. The salaries of the chief officers would be graded according to the size and population of the areas and the conse-quent degree of responsibility carried by the officers. The salaries for the variousgrades would be the appropriate Civil Service rate for the job, although it may benecessary, because of higher rates being paid now, to pay a few engineers personalsalaries in excess of the Civil Service scale or otherwise to compensate them. Inthe larger areas, it would be necessary as now to have small district offices, withjunior technical staff and workmen who could deal with complaints, breakdownsand routine engineering matters such as maintenance of pipe-lines and machinery,pumping operations and prevention of waste. There is no doubt that the drasticamalgamations proposed would release a large number of experienced officers for service elsewhere, and I do not foresee any difficulty in manning the local offices, or that my proposals would add to the number of full-time staff now employed bywater undertakings.Organisation under Joint Boards(i) General6. I have given further careful thought to the possibility of reorganising thesystem of water supply administration in such a way as to leave some major role to local authorities, through joint boards, but I have reluctantly been forced to theconclusion that such a reorganisation is not feasible because of technical and other difficulties. If a system of joint boards were brought into operation, the organisation would, in most respects, be similar to that of the water areas I have proposed,except that the officials would be responsible to boards of some twenty to thirty-five or forty members, with their various committees, instead of being answerabledirect to the central Department. I have much doubt, for the reasons explainedbelow, whether it would be possible to divide the country into as few joint boardsas fifty-three. Subject to this consideration, I should expect the staffing patternto be much as I have outlined. The individual boards would he likely to requirestaffs at least as large as those of area offices working as branches of a central department indeed, it is to be expected that with frequent board and committteemeetings, the preparation of documents for those meetings, the correspondence with constituent authorities and the routine work of a large joint board office, withsome thirty or forty members to satisfy, the staff of such an office would be larger than that of a branch office of the central water Department. If, as I think, therewould have to be a good many more than fifty-three joint boards, the total staff wouldbe much more than under nationalisation on a civil service basis. Salaries paid by large water undertakers are usually higher than in the civil service. I should, there-fore, expect the total salary bill to be a-good deal higher if large joint boards wereformed than if a Civil Service organisation was adopted, even if it were possibleto limit the number of boards to fifty-three.(ii) Under Existing Legislation7. I am satisfied that it would not be feasible to produce a similar scheme ofamalgamations by the formation of local authority joint boards under the pro-cedure of the Water Acts. It can be taken without question that in none of theareas would ail the authorities agree that a board should be formed. That being so, it would be necessary for me to take the initiative in every instance. This would
ISOentail a close investigation of the financial circumstances of the areas, and compli-cated proposals for differential rating, since it would be unfair to force a localauthority into a joint board if by doing so the financial burden of some of theareas concerned would be substantially increased without corresponding benefit,as is so often the case when local expenditure is pooled within narrow limits. Mydraft Order and the objections would have to be considered at a local inquiry, withcounsel and expert technical and financial witnesses; if opposition was pursuedafter the Order was made the Order would be considered by a Joint Select Com-mittee of both Houses, again with counsel and expert witnesses; if the Committeeshould decide that part of the area ought to be excluded from the board, that part would have to be added to another board, with the probability that the modifica-tion would set into operation a similar chain of preliminary consideration, objec-tions, local inquiry and special Parliamentary procedure. It can be safely assumed that each of the fifty-three Orders, even if the Joint Committees accepted them without serious modification, would take much more time than a private Billopposed in both Houses and would be at least as expensive. If Orders were seriouslymodified as the result of the special Parliamentary procedure, there might be noend to the time and expenditure that would be necessary before the last Order was disposed of and the country was ultimately divided into a rational number of water undertakings.(iii) Under New Legislation8. The procedure would be less expensive and take much less time if I wereempowered to form joint boards by simple Order, after a local inquiry. Procedureon these lines, although lengthy and costly, since experience has shown that important local inquiries invariably last several days, and that every interested partyengages counsel and expert witnesses, might enable me in time to reduce the numberof water undertakings to reasonable proportions. I feel, however, that it must betaken for granted that Parliament would not accept such a drastic departure fromthe Water and Public Health Acts, and so dispense with the present appeal toParliament if any of the proposed constituent authorities of a joint board objectto my order.9. The procedure could be much shortened by providing in a public general act for the division of the country into a number of joint boards of local authorities,and by defining the areas of each joint board in the Act itself. The Act wouldprovide for the vesting of works belonging to specific statutory water companies inthe appropriate boards with compensation to the companies, and for the transferof specific local authority undertakings to the boards, who would not compensatethe councils concerned, but would take over all outstanding debt and otherliabilities as well as the assets. The automatic transfer of non-statutory companies would not be feasible in many instances the boards would not wish to acquirethem but provision could be made for transfer by agreement or compulsorilyby means of orders made by the Minister of Health. It would not be possible ina public general Act to determine the exact representation for each board, or tosettle precisely the complicated financial adjustments that would be necessarybetween the boards and the local authorities. The Act would provide for the representation to be determined by simple Order made by the Minister of Health;and for such questions as compensation to officers, transfers of properties andfinancial adjustments to follow the familiar pattern of recent general Acts.10. This last procedure would be less costly and take much less time than theother courses I have outlined. I must point out, however, that a Bill of this character could not be expected to have an easy passage through Parliament. Ithas rightly been stressed that the large local authorities are proud of the under-takings that they have built up over the past century, and that they would notwelcome nationalisation of those undertakings. There is no reason to believe thatthey would be less likely to resent compulsory transfer of their undertakings tojoint boards, or that they would willingly agree to the sinking of their identity injoint boards, particularly if the larger authorities, with the important works, found themselves in a minority when the boards were formed.(iv) Defects of Joint Board Organisation11. If the country were divided between joint boards with areas similar tothose I propose, the larger authorities would usually find themselves in a minority38942 &quot; &quot; b 2
whether representation was based on rateable value (the usual course) or onpopulation. In the Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool areas, for example, where these Corporations would contribute by far the most valuable of the boardsphysical assets, since they own the major sources of supply, these Town Councilswould elect less than 50 per cent, of the members of their respective boards. I Inthe Bolton area, the discrepancy is even more marked there the four county boroughs of Bolton, Bury, Oldham and Rochdale, together, could elect only just over 40 per cent, of the membership of a joint board.12. In areas such as Norfolk and Suffolk, where the major problems are thesupplies that must be afforded to large and thinly populated rural areas, the county boroughs would not only be in a minority; they would also be worse off financially.At present, they have no responsibility for the expense of supplying the rural areas.If joint boards were formed, Norwich would have to bear nearly one-third andGreat Yarmouth nearly one-eighth of the expenditure of the Norfolk area,including, of course, their shares of the cost of the schemes for providing water inthe 15 thinly-populated rural districts. In Suffolk, Ipswich would have to bearas much as two-fifths of the expenses of a joint board that would include 11 largerural districts with very scattered populations. The non-county boroughs and urban and rural districts would naturally contribute their share of the expenseof supplying the county boroughs, but the additional capital expenditure on this score would be small in comparison with the cost of bringing supplies to the rural areas. The water undertakings in each of the county boroughs are now self-supporting. At a rough but conservative estimate it is probable that the ruralschemes, if costs (after allowing for Exchequer and County Council grants underthe Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Act, 1944) were spread over each of thetwo suggested Water Areas, would add about Is. 6d. in the   to the Norwich,Yarmouth and Ipswich rates. These are by no means isolated examples. In themore rural parts of the country, it is bound to be the case that the provision ofsupplies in the rural areas will predominate in the activities of the joint boards and, as the cost of supplying rural areas in proportion to population or rateable value is generally very much greater than in the urban areas it must follow thatthere will be a sharp rise in the rates of the urban parts of these joint board areas.If, however, the country were looked at as a unit, the total cost of rural supplies would not be a large part of the total water supply bill and the spreading of costsover the whole country, which nationalisation would make possible, would not result in any marked increase in the urban rates.13. For these reasons, I should expect at least as much opposition from the urban areas to rationalisation by means of joint boards as to outright nationalisa-tion. The rural districts would be likely to gain by the spread of expenses, if joint boards were formed. Whether this factor would outweigh their objections to theloss of their undertakings is difficult to judge, but if financial gain were, in fact,their only criterion it must be stressed that they would gain considerably moreby nationalisation, since deficits could be spread over the whole country. I shouldalso expect pressure for radical alterations of the suggested areas and, in the result,a considerable increase of the number of areas, even if the broad principles were accepted.14. It is probable that there would be sustained opposition in both houses to a Bill setting up joint boards throughout the country, and, indeed, that opposition might be more persistent and more difficult to controvert than opposition to proposals to nationalise water supplies. The Bill would have to set out in detailall the undertakings to be included in each joint board area. Even if the broad principles were acceptable, it would be open to all water undertakers to lobbyMembers and Peers, to produce evidence to show that their undertakings werebeing attached to the wrong combination, or that combinations were too large andshould be divided, or that the undertakers would lose so heavily that they shouldbe compensated. 1 here would, in effect, be full scope for an exhaustive examination in both Houses of the-circumstances of each of the proposed combinations, andthe effects on every undertaking proposed to be included in that combination,and it is difficult to envisage how such a close scrutiny of the proposals could be avoided. With nationalisation, opposition would necessarily be confined to basic principles, of which many have been settled, or at least endorsed, by previouslegislation.
15. One further question that must be emphasised when drawing a com-parison between the two systems is the control and integration of the sources ofsupply. If joint boards were formed, the sources must be vested in the boards,even if they are capable of serving much larger areas. Two cases in point areManchester&apos;s Haweswater source and the Derwent Valley reservoirs. The former,when fully developed, will be capable of serving the larger part of Lancashire formany years to come. It is very desirable that it should be used as widely aspossible, so that new works elsewhere can be postponed; with full co-ordinationof supplies, there should be a new large main connecting the trunk main withLiverpooFs system, to enable Liverpool water to be used in other parts of SouthLancashire, in Cheshire and in Wales, and Liverpool to make up the deficiency withManchester water. The principal partners in the Derwent Valley Joint Board arethe Sheffield, Leicester, Derby and Nottingham Town Councils. Recent surveysof the areas have indicated that, in order to meet very large new demands aseconomically as possible, Derby and Nottingham should leave the Board and develop new local sources and that the Board&apos;s resources should be reallocatedbetween the other partners. There are many other examples of the need forco-ordination and re-distribution of sources of supply.16. If the principle is accepted that the distributors as well as the producers of water ought to participate in the management and control of the sources andtrunk mains, it would be difficult to avoid being forced into the impossible positionof having to form joint boards for areas that would be unmanageable, because oftheir size and population, or of having to arrange for certain authorities to berepresented on a number of boards.17. The outstanding examples are Manchester and Liverpool. Manchester,the principal authority in Area No. 15 on the map, own large sources in AreasNos. 2 and 4 and large trunk mains passing through Areas 4, 7 and 12, frorii which supplies are given to undertakings in those Areas. These supplies should beextended to other undertakings. As explained in paragraph 15 above, there shouldalso be much closer interconnection between the Manchester and Liverpool systemsto facilitate supplies to Lancashire, Cheshire and parts of Wales. Liverpool (AreaNo. 11) already have community of interest, because of their Alwen reservoir andtrunk mains, with Water Areas Nos. 19, 20 and 23 on the &quot;map. If Manchester, asis desirable, afforded large new supplies for the Liverpool system, the community of interest would extend from Cumberland throughout Westmorland, lancashire and Cheshire to Montgomery and Denbigh, through Areas Nos. 2, 4, 7, 11, 12,15, 18, 19, 20 and 23. Under a joint board organisation, the larger authorities at least in all these areas would have reasonable claims to a direct say in the manage-ment of the sources of supply serving their district; and since a joint board for thewhole of these large and populous areas would hardly be manageable these claimscould be met only by placing some individual authorities on two or more boards.There are other examples where community of interest in sources and trunk mainsis not confined to the limits of one proposed Water Area. Cases in point areBirmingham (Area 30 with Areas 29, 24 and 31 bulk supplies are now afforded to parts of the two latter Areas); Newport (Area 40 with Area 38); Torquay andPaignton (Area 47 with Area 46); and Coventry (Area 31 with Area 34).18. It would not be feasible to centralise sources of supply and to leave theresponsibility for the distribution of supplies only with joint boards of localauthorities. In many areas, particularly those with underground sources of supply,the sources and distribution mains could not be separated. In most areas, it wouldbe almost impossible to separate responsibility for the trunk mains, treatmentworks, pumping, &amp;c, from the distribution of the water. Even if it were physicallypossible, the division of functions would be uneconomic. The apportionment of assets and liabilities would give rise to protracted and expensive negotiations with many references to arbitration; claims for compensation for severance would bedifficult to resist; it would be wasteful of man-power since the distributors would still have to employ engineers and skilled and unskilled workmen to look after their mains, pumps, service reservoirs, &amp;c, much the same staff, in fact, as the producers would employ on the headworks and trunk mains. Finally, there wouldbe bound to be protracted arguments between the producers and the distributorswhen new supplies were needed.19. The vesting of the sources of supply in joint boards would hamper theco-ordination of resources as a national or even as a regional policy.  The joint
board&apos;s first concern must be their consumers. If the board are selling surpluswater they cannot be expected to take less than cost price, which may be something more than the customer would have to pay for a new source of his own. If they want new supplies, and the cost price of surplus water belonging to another board is 2d. or 3d. a thousand gallons more than the cost of developing a new local source,they cannot afford to take the dearer supply simply because it is good water policy that new sources shall not be developed until existing sources are fully used. Withnationalisation, these conflicts of interests could not arise.A. BMinistry of Health, S.W. 1,30th June, 1950.
