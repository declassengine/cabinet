______ this   DOCUMENT  IS   THE   PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY*S   GOVERNMENT   12Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1950SECRET Copy No.       32CP. (50) 10310th May, 1950 -&quot; -   &apos; CABINET - .SUMMER PRICES FOR coal memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power. I have been warned by the National Coal Board, the Coal Merchants&apos;Federation and the Co-operative Distributors of coal that, in their opinion, thereis a grave danger of a breakdown in the supply of household coal to domesticusers during the winter (1950-51). They think it very probable that thisbreakdown will occur, unless immediate steps are taken to prevent it./ 2. My colleagues;: will remember what happened in 1947. Were the same thing to happen again next year, it could not fail to have the&apos; greatestrepercussions, both economic and political.3. There have already been widespread complaints about the supply of household coal since the beginning of this year. These complaints have, no doubt,been exploited by the, Opposition for party reasons. But they are, unfortunately,founded on a strong case. The complaints have not only arisen from the dirt inthe coal (about which vigorous action is already being taken in certain directions,while in others proposals are being considered-see paragraphs 14 and 15 below).They have also arisen from shortage of supply. Since January it has happened in many places that coal merchants have been four or five weeks late in fulfillingorders; supplies have actually run out altogether in some town and country districts; in a few places there have been coal queues; complaints are still coming from many parts of the country.1      4.   All this has happened in spite of the fact ; ; ; ./(a) that we had a very warm winter,&apos;:     (b) that the coal merchants and co-operative distributors started the winterwith record stocks (2-44 million tons) built up. during the summer of1949.If we had had a hard winter, or even four weeks of frost and snow, a mostserious situation would have arisen.5. The National Coal Board and the distributive trade urge that the dangernext year is greater than hitherto for the following reasons : -(a) we cannot gamble on having a third warm winter in succession;(b) the summer stocking subsidy for merchants of 4s. per ton has been withdrawn by the Treasury; without this subsidy the distributors willstock at least one million tons less this summer;(c) during recent years domestic users have bought less and less coal in the summer and more arid more in the winter!6. This third point is of particular importance. The trend of summer and winter sales during recent years has been as follows:-! ; (million tons):- Excess of:,                Total Winter over for Year Summer Winter Summer Sales1946    ......      ...      29 1 12-8 &apos; 16-3 3 51948    ...........29-2 12-5 16-7 4-21949    .........      39-0 11-7 17-3 5-638725
7. The failure of the domestic consumer to buy his stocks for the winterduring the summer months has caused the merchants the gravest difficulties.During the summer their staff and workers are seriously under-employed,and the lower grades, earning the minimum wage, have tended to drift into other employment. In the winter both the staffs and the delivery men are greatlyoverstrained and find it almost impossible to cope with the demands made on them. The merchants pay a heavy cost for the uneven distribution of their activitybetween summer and winter.8. The National Coal Board and the distributive trade are certain that thisprogressive tendency of the domestic consumer not to buy during the summer months can only be reversed by a return to the pre-war practice of having amarkedly lower summer price for domestic coal offset by a higher winter price.They have accordingly proposed that (a) for the south of England, the National Coal Board should reduce thepit-head price of house coal by 2s. Qd. a ton in the summer and increaseit by 2s. Qd. a ton in the winter, the merchants raising their prices to the consumer by 5s. a ton in the winter and lowering them by5s. a ton in the summer;(b) in the north, both pit-head and retail prices should be reduced by2s. Qd. a ton in the summer and increased by Is. 8d. a ton in the winter.(Traditionally in the north there is a more even disposal of coal to consumers, and less need for heavy summer stocking.) These proposals might cost the National Coal Board up to  380,000 a year.9. I was at first extremely reluctant to accept this proposal, but after fullinvestigation in my Ministry and prolonged discussions with the merchants and theCoal Board, I was driven to the conclusion that nothing else was likely to proveeffective.10. When I laid the proposal before the Production Committee, however,objections were raised, and I was asked to consider other alternative schemes to bring an adjustment (P.C. (50) 6th Meeting, Minute 2). I accordingly pre-pared such schemes and discussed them with the merchants and the Coal Board.I found that they were unworkable, and the Production Committee subsequentlyagreed with this view (P.C. (50) 7th Meeting, Minute 3).11. Objection, however, was still made in the Production Committee to myoriginal proposal, and it was urged that the public could be induced to buy morecoal in summer by sustained Government propaganda.12. The choice before the Cabinet, therefore, is to accept the present proposalfor lower summer and higher winter prices, as an incentive to the consumer tostock in the summer, or to rely on propaganda alone. The distributive trade are convinced that, however intensive the propaganda may be, it will prove, by itself,as ineffective as the special publicity initiated by my Department last summer,and reinforced by the trade with paid advertisements. The truth is that thepublic have had in recent years so much exhortation in the press, speeches andover the wireless on fuel matters particularly appeals to economise fuel, toavoid peak hours for electricity and to stock coal in the summer that, where theyare not deaf to such propaganda, they are bored and irritated by it. Moreover,the consumers&apos; present dissatisfaction about the low quality of domestic coal willmake them particularly allergic to any propaganda drive to make them buy more of such coal before they need to : many of them will always hope that, as a resultof pressure on the National Coal Board and the Government, some better coalwill be coming on the market later on. The merchants say that by far the most powerful agency for selling coal are the merchants themselves and their rounds-men. Last summer they made desperate efforts, but failed to get any result, becausethey were unable to offer the consumer any financial inducement to stock coal.13. The objection to the proposal for a lower summer and higher winterprice is purely political, namely, that it would be very unpopular with some of the poorer consumers who have no stocking space, and who will, therefore, have to payable higher price in winter for all the coal they buy, without any compensatingadvantage in summer.It is urged that this could be exploited by the Opposition and might be madethe ground for a severe attack on the Government.
14.   1 am not convinced that this objection is well founded.  Thus(a) The proposal is, as I have said above, merely one for a. return to a com-.      mercial practice which the industry and the trade found necessary,and to which the public was fully accustomed, before the war.  Since.&apos;: this is so, I think the Opposition would be on very difficult ground ifthey tried to exploit it against us.(b) The proposal is supported quite as strongly by the Co-operative movementas by the Coal Merchants&apos; Federation. The Co-operative spokesmenurge that it is absolutely essential to their business, and when I put to them specifically the difficulty of small consumers who have nostocking space, they told me quite categorically that it Was impracticable-able to exclude such consumers from the scheme, and1 that their inclusion would not give rise to any real difficulty.(c) The Domestic Coal Consumers&apos; Council appointed, a special Committeeto discuss the matter with me, and the Committee were unanimouslyand warmly in support of the proposal. The Council includes repre-sentatives of working class organisations such as the Standing JointCommittee of Women&apos;s Organisations, the Women&apos;s Co-operativeGuild, the Co-operative Congress and the T.U.C.id) The increase in winter prices would be only 3d. per cwt.; most consumerswould notice this very little, as there are already variations in theprice they pay from week to week of more than this, according to thequality of coal with which they can be supplied.(e) The maximum yearly burden on the poorer consumers would be 6s. avery small sacrifice to obtain an important national objective.15. The Production Committee also invited me to ascertain whether theNational Coal Board would be prepared to pay a stocking subsidy to coal merchantsof 4s. a ton, if the Government would take such steps as were practicable by wayof propaganda to encourage stocking by the public. The National Coal board are unwilling to do this, because if they subsidise stocking by one set of customersthey will inevitably lay themselves open to similar claims from other customers.And the Board feel, too, that mere propaganda, without any financial inducement,would have little or no effect on the consumer, and that a scheme limited to pay-ment of a stocking subsidy to merchants would do nothing towards providing asolution for the urgent problem of increasing sales to consumers in the summer.16. I am forced by the evidence before me to agree with the Board&apos;s views.I feel that we are in danger of confusing our main objectives, all of which mustbe achieved if we are to avoid the risk of serious trouble in the domestic coalmarket this winter.   They are (i) to see that the merchants are given more coal, and coal of better quality;(ii) to secure more co-operation from the merchants in keeping dirt, slate andpoor coal away from the domestic cellars; and in dealing with the complaints on poor quality from angry householders;(iii) to compensate the merchants for the heavy costs of carrying large stocks in the summer;(iv) to persuade the domestic consumers to lay down during the summer astock of several million tons.17. On the first objective I have put proposals to the Production Committee;the second I am discussing with the Minister of State, for Economic Affairs, andthe third and fourth are dealt with in the proposals discussed in this paper. Wemay fail unless we achieve all four objectives; but in particular and this must be emphasised we might succeed entirely on the first three, and, by neglect of thefourth, fail to avert a serious crisis next winter. We may get to the merchantsall the coal they can possibly need, and then find that during a hard spell of coldweather they are quite unable to get enough coal distributed to the public. Thereis, in any event, a risk of this happening to some extent, if we have a prolongedcold spell; but the risk would be far greater, and: the consequences far more serious, if the difficulties were aggravated by the failure of large numbers of consumers to build up stocks during the summer. :18. Past experience leaves us in no doubt as to the desperate nature of thesituation that might arise.   I have already mentioned the fuel crisis of 1947.
Let me also remind my colleagues of a crisis in London in January of 1945, whichwas even worse for the domestic consumer. There was no shortage of coal for the domestic market merchants had substantial stocks and over 300,000 tons washeld in Government dumps but during a period of very cold&quot; weather in Januarydistribution from merchants to consumers broke down. Long queues formed atfuel offices; merchants had to be helped by troops and military transport; localauthorities opened selling centres in school playgrounds, car parks, &amp;o, for saleof Government coal on a cash and carry basis; pilfering from dumps was rife; andlorries taking priority deliveries to old and sick people were so beseiged on their way that they never reached their destinations and sometimes even the lorrieswere stripped of coal, while the driver and his mate were away making the moredifficult deliveries in blocks of flats. It was fortunate that the severe winterended by the beginning of February.19. A breakdown in 1945 might be excused as due to the war, but in 1950it would be taken by many, if not most, people as due to gross mismanagement;and the blame would inevitably fall still more heavily on the Government, if theywere open to the charge of rejecting a scheme that might have lessened very con-siderably the hardships that consumers, and in particular the poorer consumers,had been called upon to bear. ,- 20. However well founded the political objections to an increase in winterprices, I am convinced that they are of slight importance compared to the political as well as economic dangers of a breakdown of supply in the winter months. Forthis reason I urge the Cabinet strongly to accept the proposals which I have out-lined above.P. J. N-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,15th May, 1950.
