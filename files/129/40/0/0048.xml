THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OP  HIS  BKIT&amp;NHIC   MAJESTY*S   GGT?ERMMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1950SECRET Copy No.      3 2CP. (50) 14829th June, 1950CABINETHOUSE OF COMMONS REFRESHMENT DEPARTMENTMemorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on 22nd June (CM. (50) 38th Conclusions, Minute 1), theCabinet invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Ministerof Works, the Chief Whip and myself, to submit a memorandum on the questionof principle involved in making an Exchequer contribution towards the provisionof restaurant facilities in the House of Commons.2. I annex a copy of a note by officials containing a resume of the historyof Exchequer assistance to the Refreshment Department and examining the latest proposals of the Kitchen Committee (contained in House of Commons PaperNo. 66). From this it will be clear that there is nothing new in principle in theidea of providing a financial contribution from the Exchequer; the question now is whether the basis of the present grant should be changed and the amount of theassistance increased.3. I have discussed the matter with my colleagues and we are in agreementwith the suggestion in the note that before considering further the proposal for anincreased Exchequer contribution the Government should insist that the KitchenCommittee, in its own interests, should seek expert outside advice on the possi-bility of impoving efficiency and achieving economy. Possibly the Hotels Executivewould be willing to assist in this way and might even be prepared to take over the catering arrangements, a solution which would have some obvious advantages.The specific points suggested in the note as worthy of examination by the KitchenCommittee might be brought to the notice of the experts.4. The question is to be discussed in the House on 7th July, and the debatewill no doubt take place on a motion in the name of the Chairman of the KitchenCommittee. If the proposal in the previous paragraph commends itself, we suggestthat a Minister should intervene in the debate on behalf of the Government andshould take the following broad line:  (1) He should recognise that the Government may reasonably be expected, asat present, to make some contribution to assist the Committee.(2) He should describe the assistance at present given in the form of freeservices and substantial cash contributions (amounting in 1949 to over 37,000), and should explain that the Government feel it would beunjustifiable to increase that amount.(3) He should suggest (or, if the suggestion has already been made in thecourse of the debate, endorse it) that an obligation rests on the KitchenCommittee to satisfy themselves that the refreshment arrangements are organised on the most efficient basis possible in the circumstances andthat the standard of service and amenities is not on a level which it is unreasonable to expect the taxpayer to support, even on the present scale.(4) He could then suggest that the Committee call in outside experts to advisethem on these matters.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council,29th June, 1950.38948
- annex note BY officials from about 1850 until 1921 the House of Commons Refreshment Departmentreceived an annual cash subvention from the Treasury, varying from  1,000 to 2,650. This was terminated in 1922 in view of the urgent&apos;need for generaleconomy and the decision to withdraw cash subsidies from Civil Service LuncheonClubs. On four occasions between 1922 and 1939 the Kitchen Committee askedfor a renewal of the subsidy and were refused. In a few years during this period the Department made a profit; usually it made a small loss.2. In November 1939 the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Sir John Simon)agreed to a grant to help meet the exceptional difficulties arising out of the black-out and the fact that the House met only two or three times a week. Between 1940and 1943 the Committee received grants totalling  1.1,800. When it emergedthat the total trading loss over this period was only  8,600, further grants were refused. In 1943 and 1944 the Refreshment Department made a profit, and in 1945a small loss.3. Up to this date the Kitchen Committee&apos;s difficulties had arisen from two main causes: the erratic attendance of customers, depending on the hours atwhich the House happened to sit and the nature of the business before it; andthe inconvenient arrangement of the mess rooms, attributable partly to architectural-tectural features, partly to the demand for separate accommodation for the various categories of customers served.4. At the end of the war the House decided that the Refreshment Departmentstaff, who had formerly been paid only for the 38-42 weeks of the year during which parliament sits, should be paid for the whole 52 weeks, and that tipping shouldbe abolished. This decision added  17,000 to the Kitchen Committee&apos;s wages billfor 1946. In 1947 the introduction of a Staff Pensions Scheme added a further 3,000. In 1946 the deficit on trading account was  6,600, and in 1947  13,000.At the end of 1947 the Committee had a capital deficit of  10,700.In the course of discussions with the then Financial Secretary to the treasury the Kitchen Committee suggested that this situation might be remedied by (a) putting the whole cost of the kitchen staff on to the House of CommonsVote, treating trading receipts as Appropriations-in-Aid, or(b) an annual subvention from the Treasury to cover staff costs during Recessperiods.The objection felt to alternative (a) was that the Committee would have no incen-tive to economise, and that the Speaker and the Chancellor of the exchequer would become responsible for regulating staff wages. Alternative (b) waspreferred, and a formula was worked out to achieve it. Grants-in-aid of  28,000(covering 1947 and 1948) and  14,300 for 1949 have been made from the Houseof Commons Vote.The Kitchen Committee&apos;s published trading accounts for 1949 show that,despite the grant of  14,300, the Department made a loss during the year of  7,688.In a footnote to the accotints there is a reference to free services (accommodation,furniture, lighting, &amp;c.) supplied by the Ministry of Works, Stationery Office and post Office. The Committee does not attempt to place any value on these items.The Ministry of Works value their services at  23,000. In addition, a cash con-tribution of  1,100 is paid by the Ministry of Works for cleaning undertaken bythe Kitchen Committee&apos;s staff.The true actual cost of the Refreshment Department^ operations in 1949therefore involves a loss of more than  45,000 on a turnover of just under  92,000.The Kitchen Committee ended the year with a net capital deficit of  9,600and a bank overdraft of  32,000.In their Second Special Report the Committee, after first referring to theimportance of improving the services offered by the Refreshment Department, statethat &quot; there remains the essential need for setting its finances once for all upona sound and stable foundation,&quot; and make the following proposals to that end:  (i) The grant-in-aid should be based not on the weeks of recess but on thetotal number of days on which Parliament does not sit. Had this formula been adopted in 1949 there would have been no trading loss.
(ii) Since the Committee has no trading capital and cannot be expected to operate without any, the Treasury should either bear the interest charge on the bank overdraft or should provide capital free of interest. Thisproposal presumably covers not only the present overdraft of  32,000but also the additional (unspecified) amounts that will be required if. the new amenities suggested earlier in the report are to be introduced.(The greater part of the cost of these improvements would, of course,,       fall on the Ministry of Works.)The CommitteeY justification for making these proposals is set out clearly inthe report. The Refreshment Department, they say, provides an indispensableservice for the House in just the same way as any other Department that appearson the House of Commons Vote. It is impracticable to cater on a strictly com-mercial basis and at the same time to provide amenities for customers and conditionsof staff employment worthy of the dignity of the House. The charge that Membersof Parliament have their meals subsidised is, they state, groundless.It is difficult to see how the Committee&apos;s proposals can be described if not as a request for an increased subsidy. In fact the Refreshment Department hasalways been very substantially subsidised by the Ministry of Works, and it mightwell be thought that free services worth more than  23,000 are a sufficient recog-nition of the peculiar difficulties with which the Kitchen Committee has to contend.The analogy drawn between the Refreshment Department and other services ofthe House, e.g., the messengers or the library, is quite inadmissible. The natureof the service is quite different and to the taxpayer it may appear that Membersof Paliament enjoy the amenities of a West End Club &quot;without paying an annualsubscription and are content that the expense should fall on him. The presentgrant-in-aid has already provoked criticism in the Press and some letters of protestfrom members of the public.The Committee^ proposal (i), which might appear at first sight to be a logicalapplication of the principle already conceded that the Treasury should bear thecost of staff for the periods when they are not productively employed, does notbear close scrutiny. If the question of staff costs could be regarded in isolationand the amount of free services provided by the Ministry of Works ignored,there might be a case in logic for making the grant-in-aid cover Saturdays, and even for taking some account of Friday afternooons and Monday mornings, duringSessions of Parliament. But there can be no case for including Sundays, whichare a proper charge on any wages bill. Proposal (ii) is an entirely novel one. Itwould be easier to accept if the Refreshment Department were just embarkingupon its task for the first time and had not been in operation for more than a century.The Committee itself rightly describes as the main cause of the very unsatis-factory financial position the decision to pay the staff full wages throughout theyear. (This decision, of course, leaves the staff free to earn additional remunerationduring the Recesses, but it is not known at what rates the Committee pays its staff.The view may also be taken that another main contributory factor is a desire to preserve amenities and maintain standards of service which can only be provided at an uneconomical cost. If, as has been asserted by the Committee, it is impossibleto increase charges in order to reduce the deficit, it may be necessary to reduce thestandard of the amenities generally available and bring the normal catering facilitiesdown to a level which is more within the means of the bulk of the Committee&apos;scustomers, some of whom, on its own statements, are going elsewhere for food.The precise steps to be taken to restore the position are, of course, matters for theCommittee, on whom responsibility should primarily rest for solving its ownproblems, but the following are some possibilities which would seeem to be worthfurther examination before their request is pressed upon the Government for the revision to a still more favourable basis of an arrangement for financial help whichwas agreed only two years ago:  (a) Eliminating the more luxurious items on the menu and restricting the choice of dishes, (which the Committee admit is excessive).(b) Raising prices of food and drinks either generally or in certain circum-stances. The abolition of the 5s. limit on meals should facilitate this.(c) Postponing expenditure on new amenities except in so far as these arelikely to increase custom and to pay for themselves in a short time.(Much of the Committee&apos;s latest report is devoted to stressing the needfor improved services.)
(d) Exploring the possibility of reducing the number of rooms in which mealsare served, rather than increasing them as suggested in the report.(Reduction may be impracticable, but it should be noted that theStanhope Committee, which reported on accommodation in the Palaceof Westminster in 1945, commented unfavourably on the number ofi mess rooms, not all of which of course are under the management ofthe Kitchen Committee.)(e) Reconsidering the proposal to sell to suppliers the right to use the words&quot; As supplied to the House of Commons.&quot; This suggestion was madein 1948 and does not appear to have been pursued.(/) Running down stocks of wine, now valued at over  14,000.It seems only right that the House should bring itself to face these suggestidns.It is for consideration whether, before looking at any request for increasedfinancial assistance, the Government should insist that the services of one or moreoutside experts in catering should be engaged to make a thorough examination ofthe Refreshment Departments operations and to report to the Committee on ways in which efficiency might be improved and economies effected, even at a sacrifice of some of the existing standards. Although the present manager has, it is under-stood, had lengthy and varied catering experience, this step might well producesome worth while results, and even if it did not it would at least make it easier for the Committee to convince the public that its troubles do not arise to someextent from inefficient management.In a few years time the problem may to some degree solve itself through theprovision of up-to-date catering facilities in the new building in Abingdon Street.Even though Members will probably wish to retain some of their own RefreshmentRooms in the Palace of Westminster, it should be possible to close the rooms nowused by the other customers and to conduct the Departments operations in the twobuildings on something much more nearly approaching a commercial basis. this of course will not happen for some years to come and it does nothing to solve theimmediate problem.2%th June, 1950.
