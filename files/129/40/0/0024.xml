THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OP  HIS  BRITANNIC   MMESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT    /Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    3 2CP. (50) 124Uth June, 1950.CABINETCONTROL OF CIVIL SERVICE NUMBERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. In November 1948 the Ministerial and Official Committees on CivilService Man-power were wound up, and, by direction of the Prime Minister, theTreasury &quot; resumed full responsibility for controlling the size of the Civil Service &quot;(CP. (48) 284). In this memorandum I describe, for the information of mycolleagues, the trend of Civil Service non-industrial staff numbers since October1948, and some of the new arrangements, both within the Treasury and in therelations of the Treasury with other Departments, for the control of establishmentswithin the Civil Service.2. The annexed Table shows a net decline, in the eighteen months October1948 to April 1950, of 26,255 (from 711,054 to 684,799) in the total number of non-industrial civil servants. These figures do not, however, tell the whole story, since,in the period under review, the numbers of the Civil Service were increased by (a) Local Authority Rating Valuation staff taken over by the inland Revenue Department with their work (LocalGovernment Act, 1948)    ...............      2,786(b) Cable and Wireless staff taken over by the Post Office withtheir work   ......      ............      ...      3,622(c) Royal Marine Police and Police Reserves formerly classified as industrials, now reclassified as non-industrials      ...      2,552Total     ...      ...      ...      ......      ......      ...      8,960In addition, upwards of 1,000 posts in the Air Ministry and the War Office,previously held by uniformed Service men and women, where handed over to civilservants.The gross reduction in the size of the Civil Service in the eighteen monthsunder review amounted, therefore, to more than 36,000, or 5 per cent.3. A great part of the reduction (particularly in the trade and industryDepartments) followed from the decline of work upon the relaxation of controlsof various kinds; but much has been done (for example in concentration of&quot; trade &quot; work in District Offices by the Ministry of Food), by planned rearrange-ments, sometimes at the cost of some inconvenience to the public. There has alsobeen an improvement in output as staff gained experience, and as the improvedquality of established staff recruited after the war gradually made itself felt.Departments generally have kept up a sustained effort, not only to see that majoreconomy measures were fully reflected in staff savings, but also, by constantvigilance and the adoption of improved methods, to prune staff wherever possible.The Principal Establishment Officers and their colleagues in all Departments have -operated whole-heartedly with the Treasury to this end.4.   My colleagues will be interested to know that an important alteration inthe control of Civil Service establishments was instituted just over a year ago.The object was, by delegation to heads of Departments of a greater measure ofresponsibility, to relieve the Treasury of the function of exercising detailed38862
supervision in staff matters and thus to enable it to take a wider view of its responsi-bilities in the matter of control of staff numbers. To quote the Treasury Circularof July 1949, which gave effect to the new arrangements:  &quot; The control of numbers in the Civil Service can only be carried outwith full efficiency by the Principal Establishment and Organisation Officerof each Department (whose appointment and removal is- subject to theapproval of the Prime Minister) acting on behalf of the Permanent secretary and Accounting Officer.&quot;The Circular goes on to say that the functions of the Treasury in the financial control and oversight of staff matters are most effectively carried out by concentra-tion on broad issues and avoidance of matters of detail. &quot; The Treasury will therefore direct itself chiefly to the central control and scrutiny of the exerciseof their responsibilities by Departments.&quot;5. In pursuance of these principles considerable powers have been delegated to the larger Departments to vary complements, within a total approved annuallyat Estimate time, and reviewed on the occasion of half-yearly forecasts of staffrendered to the Treasury in April and October. The relief from detailed workthus afforded to Treasury officers has been used to enable them to concentratemore on examining staff expenditure in the light of the amount and character ofthe work to be done, on suggesting the abandonment or modification of functions which appear no longer to justify the staff costs involved, and above all on spread-ing among all Departments the knowledge of measures of staff economy whichhave been effective in other parts of the Service.6. The recognition of the increased need for this kind of central control inthe Treasury has involved some internal rearrangements, of which perhaps themost noteworthy is the appointment of officers experienced in the adjustment ofstaff numbers and gradings to work-loads, whose sole function is to visit Depart-ments and test, by inspection upon the spot, the efficiency of their own internalsystems of control. I understand that, in general, Departments have welcomed the help of these officers, and that, besides making useful recommendations for application in particular branches, the Treasury Staff Inspectors have on occasionbeen able to suggest some improvements of the methods of staff inspection in usein the Departments visited. I am convinced that the best instrument for ensuringstaff economy in a Department is an adequate system of internal inspection, andthe Treasury will always encourage Departments to improve and strengthen their arrangements in this respect.Future Trend of Staff Numbers7. The abolition of points rationing and of the rationing of petrol will savesome 1,000 and 2,000 staff respectively. The ending of the Control of EngagementOrder should save 500 staff, and other economies in the Ministry of Labour afurther 1,000. There are no other significant reductions in prospect in theimmediate future and, on the other side, another 1,300 or so staff will be requiredin connection with the taking over of Rating Valuation work already mentioned.Allowing for the usual safety margin in Departmental forecasts, a further drop ofperhaps as much as 5,000 may, therefore, be expected in the course of the next three or four months. Thereafter, in the absence of any other major changes, staffs will tend to reman static or to decline at a much slower rate, unless Departmentscontinue unremitting efforts to make economies in administration, howeverindividually small, whenever an opportunity is presented. Since most of the obviouseconomies have already been made, the task of continuing the run-down will beharder, but I am sure my colleagues will agree that we must continue our efforts to reduce the numbers of.the Service consistantly with its efficiency even if therate of decrease slackens and I rely upon their co-operation to this end.R.
