(50) 121%th June, 1950CABINETREPORT BY THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE ELECTION OF AMEMBERMemorandum by the Attorney-GeneralThe Cabinet may wish to consider the action to be taken on the recommenda-tions of this Committee, whose report, together with the minutes of evidence^hasbeen published as a House of Commons Paper (No. 68 I, dated 18th May). Mycolleagues will recall that the Committee was appointed by the House in order toconsider whether the Rev. J. G. MacManaway, who was elected in the Unionistinterest for West Belfast, is disqualified from membership owing to the fact thathe is a clergyman of the now disestablished Protestant Church of Ireland.(1) Since the publication of the Committee&apos;s report, but before seeing theevidence, the Leader of the Opposition has advised the House that the great weightof legal opinion favours the view that Mr. MacManaway is not disqualified and(although, somewhat illogically, demanding the immediate introduction of legisla-tion) he has specifically advised Mr. MacManaway at once to take his seat, a course which the latter is reported to intend to adopt. If Mr. MacManaway does now take his seat in reliance upon Mr. ChurchuTs declaration of the law, and withoutawaiting the declaration by Parliament, as recommended by the Select Committee,the Cabinet may think that no action should be taken, and that, in the event of acommon informer&apos;s action the law should be allowed to take its course. If,however, Mr. MacManaway decides that legal discretion is the better part ofpolitical valour and does not take his seat, the Government will have to define theirattitude.(2) The law about the matter is in truth uncertain. It depends on the con-struction of the House of Commons (Clergy Disqualification) Act, 1801, which,being passed at a time when the Irish Protestant Church was united with and formed part of the established English Church, provided that &quot;. ... no personhaving been ordained to the office of priest or deacon, or being a Minister of theChurch of Scotland, is or shall be capable of being elected . . . .&quot;(3) On one view this Act only applies to those who have been ordained inthe Established Church in conformity with the provisions of the Act of Unjformity,and thus would leave clergy of the Protestant Church of Ireland (which was dis-established in 1869) or of the Episcopal Church in Scotland free to seek election.Priests of the Roman Catholic Church are specifically disqualified by the roman catholic Relief Act of 1829. Those of the disestablished Welsh Church werespecifically declared free from disqualification by the Wesh Church Act, 1914. on another view the Act of 1801 applies to all clergy who have been ordained by the laying on of hands in any Episcopalian Church recognising the doctrine of apostolicsuccession. This would result in all such clergy being disqualified whether membersof the Established Church or not, except where, as by the Welsh Church Act, the disqualification had been removed.(4) In the past, different Law Officers seem to have taken different views asto the proper construction of the Act of 1801, and before the Select committee sir David Maxwell Fyfe was clear that that Act only applied to ordinations in38842Copy No. ^ 4
conformity with the Act of Uniformity and thus disqualified only the clergy ofthe Established Church, while Mr. Birig was equally sure that the Act involved a disqualification of all ordained clergy, whether of that Church or any otherEpiscopalian Church. The learned Clerk, Sir Herbert Metcalfe, while preferringnot to express a firm opinion, inclined to the view that Mr. MacManaway wasdisqualified. &apos;1 ; v 1 - : ^(5) I considered the matter in detail and gave evidence before the SelectCommittee at some little length, my view being that the arguments on each side werenicely balanced, although my own-as I said-rather tentative opinion was that only the clergy of the Established Church were affected, with the result thatMr. MacManaway was eligible. No useful purpose would be served by setting out the opposing arguments here, but I should perhaps say that there is littlesignificance in the fact that Sir Da vidY conclusions and my own were similar. we reached our conclusions by different reasoning, and I stated that I thought thebasis of Sir Davkfs view was misconceived. In these circumstances, I suggestedthat the Select Committee should recommend to the House that an advisory opinionon the matter might be obtained from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council;a course which the House had adopted in 1913 in the case of Sir Stuart Samuel, inwhich difficult questions of law also arose.(6) The Committee, while agreeing with me that the arguments were nicelybalanced, have recommended that legislation should be introduced to clarify thelaw.(7) It is true that whichever view of the Act of 1801 be the correct oneanomalous results follow. If the true&apos; construction be that only clergy ordainedinto the Established Church are disqualified, this would leave clergy ordained intothe Church of Ireland or a Colonial or other Episcopalian Church but holding abenefice in the Church of England (as such clergy may without re-ordination) free to sit although those ordained direct into the English Church would be disqualifiedeven though not holding a benefice. If, on the other hand, the Act of 1801 affectsall ordained clergy, a curious consequence is that, while under the Clerical Dis-abilities Act, 1870, clergy of the Established Church may relinquish their office assuch and thus become qualified to sit, this seems not to be the case with clergyordained into the unestablished Episcopalian Churches. There are other anomaliesand there is therefore a case for saying that a judicial decision, whichever way itwent, would still leave the law in an unsatisfactory state and that, therefore, theproblem ought to be tackled now by legislation. Such legislation would, however,,be controversial.(8) The least that such legislation could do would be to declare that clergy ofthe disestablished Church of Ireland were not disqualified. But could legislationbe limited to this, since that would do nothing to clear up the anomalies already mentioned? Moreover, if the disqualification were removed in respect of the clergyof the Irish Church, those of other Episcopalian Churches might have some ground for asking for similar treatment. Thus the question whether Roman CatholicPriests should remain subject to a disqualification, imposed on them in 1829, which did not apply to rny other clergy outside the Established Church, might be difficultto exclude from . bate. It might also be said by some (although not by me!) thatthere were now no grounds for excluding the clergy even of the Established Church.(9) An alternative possibility is that legislation should, be introduced per-mitting clergy of the Protestant Church of Ireland or the Episcopal Church inScotland to divest themselves of their Orders, as is now possible in the case of clergyof the Established Church under the Clerical Disabilities Act, 1870, and thus to qualify themselves for membership. Such a Bill might possibly include a provision that Mr. MacManaway would be qualified on so divesting himself of his Orders, butthis is a matter which would have to be discussed with Parliamentary Counsel.Before deciding on such legislation it would no doubt be necessary to consult the ecclesiatical authorities and to consider whether such a provision could properly be made to cover the clergy of any Episcopalian Church, e.g., including the roman catholics.(10) If legislation were decided upon 1 would myself have thought that that suggested in paragraph (9) might be the most appropriate, but in view of the politicaland religious embarrassments of any legislation, I am inclined to think that if mr. MacManaway delays taking his seat the better course might be to suggest to
the House that legislation, would open up a difficult field,of controversy andshould not be undertaken at least without first obtaining an ^authoritative opinon as to the existing law; that therefore the House should seek an advisory opinion onthe case of Mr. MacManaway from the Judicial Committee of, the Privy -Counciland that if that opinion were that Mr. MacManaway was not disqualified, theGovernment would undertake to introduce a Bill of Indemnity should a CommonInformer successfully challenge the advisory opinion by an action in the ordinaryCourts-a most unlikely eventuality.(11) I should point out that, on any motion which the Government mightpropose referring the matter to the Privy Council, it would presumably be necessaryto consider whether the question should be left to the free vote of the House, Itis by no means certain that it would be carried. If it were not, the Governmentwould be under strong pressure to introduce legislation, which, however, I suggestshould be tightly drawn so as to accomplish one or other of the purposes indicatedin paragraphs (9) or (10) with the least opportunity for amendment.H.
