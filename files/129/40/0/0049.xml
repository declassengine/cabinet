S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 149 COPY NO.3X1ST JULY, 1950CABINETINTEGRATION OF WESTERN EUROPEAN COAEAND STEEL INDUSTRIESReport by a Committee of ministers at their meeting on 22nd June (C. M, (50) 38th Conclusions,Minute 5) the Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a small group of Ministers to examine the issues arising from the report annexed to C. P. (50) 128 on the Schuman proposals for the integration of theWestern European coal and steel industries.    The Prime Minister appointed the following group for this purpose:-Chancellor of the Exchequer (In the Chair)President of the Board of trade minister of Fuel and PowerMinister of SupplyMinister of StateOur report is as follows.2. We regard it as of the utmost importance that a preliminarydecision on the outline of the British proposals should be reached as soonas possible.    The outgoing French Government is known to have beendeeply divided in its attitude to the &quot;Schuman. proposals&quot;, and it is possiblethat the changeover will present the United Kingdom with the necessity of putting its own proposals forward.    It is not suggested that any UnitedKingdom proposals should be volunteered but that we should indicate their general line if and when we are requested to do so by the French.3. We have taken as our starting point the general opposition,expressed on both sides of the House of Commons during the debate onthe &quot;Schuman proposals&quot; to both the establishment of a supra-national body which would wield powers of decision over British coal andsteel industries, and to the participation by the United Kingdom in anyfederal system limited to Europe, for which the &quot;Schuman proposals&quot;were designed to be the first steD.   Despite the differences about approach and handling, there was virtual unanimity on these two points.4. We conclude, therefore, that the possibility of the United Kingdomjoining in a body having some measure of control over the coal and steel industries of Western Europe depends largely upon the constitution ofthat body.    If there is a suitable chain of responsibility to Ministers,it would in our view be acceptable to delegate a considerable amount ofcontrol.    We, therefore, deal, with this aspect first, and secondly withthe various ways in which control will be exercised, by reference to thereport of the committee of officials.   References to paragraph numbers areto this report except where otherwise indicated.   As a basis for our analysis,

and as a statement of objectives, we have taken paragraphs 54-56 of the reportof the working party (page 17), which we endorse.C onstitution of the Authority (paragraph 22)5. We consider that the international Authority should be con-stituted of three elements, namely:-(i)     An Inter-governmental Council of Ministers.(ii)     An independent executive council, responsible to the ministerial council, and consisting of &quot;industrial statesmen&quot; ratherthan technicians.(iii)     An advisory council of Government representatives, workers and employers from member countries.Our reasons for suggesting this type of Authority are as follows.6. We regard it as essential that an inter-governmental Council ofMinisters should have general charge of the policy of the Authority, becausemany of the major issues likely to arise could only be dealt withauthoritatively by Ministers.    These Ministers should be responsible totheir home Governments and decisions within the council should be unanimous.Experience on the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation inParis has shown that a determination by the United Kingdom as a majorpartner to get a matter settled, together with the existence of a veto, has,in the last resort, been one of the most effective ways of making progress.Ministers (or their alternates) should meet at fairly frequent intervalsand should have all major matters of policy brought before them so thatthey may give their directions upon them.   Some of these we mention when we come to deal with specific functions of the Authority.7. The Executive Council should consist of 6 - 12 whole time members appointed collectively by the Ministerial Council, on the nomination of member countries.   Members should be appointed for a period of years, andthe Executive Council should have its own staff and should consist of&quot;industrial statesmen&quot; rather than technicians.    The members wouldhave international status.    The expenses of the Executive Council, includingthe salaries of the members, would be paid by a levy on the coal and steel .industries of member countries.    It would possess wide powers ofinitiative and recommendation.   It would be responsible for all matters of ordinary operation and execution, but would have to submit major questions of policy to the Ministerial Council.    The Executive council would ordinarily function by simple majority, although in certain matters, a special vote, say, by a two-thirds majority, might be madeobligatory, e. g. , where the Council was exercising the powers of vetoin relation to investment proposed in paragraph 11 below.    The ExecutiveCouncil would be able to appoint such consultative committees as may benecessary for the discharge of its functions.8. Finally, we consider that there should be a purely Advisory Councilof representatives of employers and workers from each member country, towhich we think it would be advantageous to join Governmental representatives,on the model of the International Labour Organisation, in order to preventits proceedings having too narrow an industrial scope, and also so thatit might be fully informed as to the policy and progress of the Councils andof the industry.    This body should, we think, be set up and be primarily responsible tc the Council of Ministers.    We recommend that certain matters,e. g. , those closely bearing upon conditions of work, such as the closing of plants, should be compulsorily referred to the Advisory Council for its opinion.-2-

9. The interests of consumer countries should be dealt with, notthrough any special consumers1 body attached to the Authority, but throughliaison with O.E.E.C.10. It will be desirable to establish a link between the coal and steelauthority and O.E.E.C., as the central organisation for the discussion ofEuropean economic problems.   This link we think should be made throughthe Ministerial Council, which could make a periodical report on thew orking of the Authority.Functions of the AuthorityInvestment (paragraphs 5-6)11. We agree with the conclusion of the working party (paragraph 56),that there is a need to co-ordinate programmes, both to avoid the resultsof over investment and to ensure that it is undertaken in those countrieswhich can produce most efficiently.   This should be a function of theExecutive Council.    We do not consider that any question of principle would be involved in giving to the Executive Council the power to veto invest-ment plans;   in practice this should tend to work to the advantage ofthe United Kingdom, whose development plans for coal and steel have, inmany cases, been completed, and are in any case more realistic thanthose of other potential members.    We accordingly recommend that theExecutive Council should have &quot;power to veto investment, subject to thegeneral lines of policy laid down by the Ministerial Council.Output and Marketing Regulation (paragraphs 8-9)12. We endorse the recommendation of the c ommittee of officials,that the Executive Council should forecast demand and supply.    It shouldalso be the Executive Councils responsibility to take the initiative inwarning the Ministerial Council if supply appears likely substantially to exceed or fall short of demand and it should have power to put forwardrecommendations for dealing with the situation.   Ministers will beresponsible for deciding the general line which remedies should take,having regard to the possibilities of influencing the level of demand, whichwill mainly lie in fields outside the Authority&apos;s sphere.    This is a matterof particular importance in the implementation of employment policy,Improvement of Working Conditions (paragraphs 10-11)13. It is in the interests of both the British coal and steel industrieswhose wages are probably higher than in those of any other of the potentialmember countries, that wage levels should be protected and that thelower wages in other countries should be raised as rapidly as is compatible with the general economic situation in those countries.   At the same time it is necessary to a.void cutting across existing wage negotiating machinery.We have ascertained that the Trade Unions in the United Kingdom wouldprobably not take exception to the proposal that the Advisory Council,to which we refer in paragraph 8 above, should consider measures for improving conditions of workers in the coal and steel industries, and submit their recommendations to the Ministerial Council.    The presence of theTrade Unions1 representatives in the Advisory Council would itselfensure that that Council was unlikely to make recommendations which wouldconflict with established wage negotiating machinery.    We also endorse the specific proposals of the working party in paragraphs 69-74 of theirreport.

Supervision of Trade (Commercial) Agreements, DiscriminatoryPractices   (paragraphs 12-14)14. We endorse the recommendations of the committee of officials.Price Policy (paragraphs 15-16)15. This raises the very difficult question of the cp-existence of free markets and controlled economies.   We recognise that it willprobably be necessary to sacrifice, at any rate within the group, theexisting dual prices for coal and steel, despite the financial repercussionswhich this will cause;   the possibility of earning higher prices for exportsof coal and steel is, however, likely to disappear before long.    We endorse the working party&apos;s conclusion that principles would have to be laiddown about price fixing, which would be equally applicable to all membersof the group, and within which the British policy of long term price stabilisation could be operated.   We recommend that it should be theresponsibility of the Executive Council to work out a policy on this matter,subject to the general direction of the Ministerial Council.    It would, ofcourse, be one of the tasks of the Executive Council to devise a price policywhich would prevent dumping and other unfair practices.Tariffs, Quantitative Restrictions and Subsidies (paragraphs 1.-18)16. We endorse the general objective set out in the report of theworking party (paragraph 87, page 24), namely, that all tariffs andquantitative restrictions on trade in coal and steel between participating countries should be removed;   we also endorse the safeguards for the transitional period set out by the working party (paragraph 88) inregard to price policy, the elimination of unfairly low rates of wages and artificial discrimination on subsidies, transport rates, supply of capital,etc. , as between the coal and steel industries and other industries withinparticipating countries.    It should be the responsibility of the ExecutiveCouncil to formulate measures to give effect to these objectives forapproval b y the Ministerial Council.17. These changes will, at some stage, involve infringement ofBritish obligations under the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.) and the International Trade Organisation (I.T.O.), but we thinkthat the United States authorities are unlikely to oppose the necessary modi-fications in these agreements.    We should, however, resist any proposals that Commonwealth preferences should be modified as a result of theUnited Kingdom joining the new body.Research (paragraph 19)18. We agree with the endorsement by the committee of officials of the working party&apos;s proposal that the authority should be authorised topromote research work on an international basis in appropriate fields.Initialled on behalf of the committee.
