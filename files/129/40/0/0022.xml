(50) 12212th June, 1950CABINETECONOMIC report note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate a note on the more important statistics relating to the economicsituation which have become available since my last Economic Report (CP. (50) 86).R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,12th June, 1950.ECONOMIC report .-Man-PowerThere was an increase of 48,000 in the size of the working population during april 1950 compared with an increase of 44,000 in April 1949. The increase in both cases is attributed to the number of school leavers joining the labour force and toother seasonal causes. At the end of April the total working population was estimated at 23-35 million, an increase of 145,000 over a year ago.2. During April there was a further fall in unemployment and more men left the Armed Forces to take up civilian jobs. In consequence, the number in civil employment increased by 66,000. The total number in civil employment at theend of the month was 22-31 million and was 214,000 higher than at the end ofApril 1949. The number in manufacturing industries was 172,000 higher thana year ago.3. On 15th May 314,700 persons were registered as unemployed comparedwith 329,000 in the middle of April and 304,200 in May 1949. In May about1 - 5 per cent, of the total number of employees insured under the national insurance Schemes were unemployed.4. Between the middle of April and the middle of May there was a decline of 7,100 in unemployment in the Development Areas where the numberunemployed was 130,800 on 15th May two-fifths of the unemployed in GreatBritain. Compared with a year ago, unemployment in the Development Areasshows little change, a rise of 3,500 in the North-Eastern Area being offset by a fall of 1,800 in South Wales and Monmouth and smaller falls in other Areas.38811
II. Production5. After a promising start in January, when output did not fall seasonallyso much as last year, output for the first quarter of the year reached a levelabout 9 per cent, higher than in the corresponding quarter of 1949. Output inthe first quarter of .1950 is estimated as about two-fifths higher than in 1946.6. Preliminary figures for April show that the rate of production was main-tained in that month, although output for the month as a whole was lower, owingto the drop in production over the Easter holidays.Interim Index of Industrial ProductionAverage 1946 = 1001949 1st quarter 2nd quarter3rd quarter 4th quarter1950-1st quarterApril128129123135140[136-137]7. The rise in the output of the motor vehicles and engineering industries and of the paper and printing trades mainly accounted for the increase in productionin the first quarter of 1950 compared with a year ago. There were also notableincreases in the output of textiles and clothing.Coal8- So far this year the output of deep-mined coal has averaged 4 million tonsa week-about \\ per cent, higher than in the same period last year. Output ofopencast coal has also been higher than a year ago.9. The rise in production has allowed exports to be maintained at more than300,000 tons a week this year, except over the Easter holidays. Shipments of coal for bunkers have been slightly less than last year.10. At the end of the winter, total stocks of coal were down to about   million tons a million tons less than at the end of the winter of 1949.11. The rise in output so far this year has been achieved notwithstandinga fall in the number of wage-earners on the colliery books. The number is nowdown to 700,000. After allowing for normal seasonal variations, output per man-shift continues to rise steadily, ar^ there has been less absenteeism during the lasttwo months than in the correspo. -aing period last year.Steel12. Output of steel ingots and castings in April averaged 324,000 tons a weekcompared with the record of 330,000 tons a week in March. In the first four weeks of May, output was 327,000 tons a week 4 per cent, higher than in May 1949.13. Output of pig-iron in the first three weeks of May was 187,000 tons aweek-the same as in May 1949.14. Stocks of steel and of steel-making materials are now considerably higherthan a year ago. Although stocks of pig-iron have been falling since January, inthe middle of May they were two-thirds greater than a year ago. Stocks of scrapin the middle of May were 817,000 tons one-half greater than at the same timelast year. Stocks of steel at producers&apos; works and in the British Iron and steel corporation stockyards at the end of March amounted to 1-28 million tons,compared with 1 03 million tons in March 1949.Textiles15. Textile production has been rising during 1950, and although there was some drop in production over the Easter holidays the rate of output is higher thana year ago. Output of rayon yarn and staple fibre particularly has risen and isnow one-quarter greater than a year ago. There have also been notable increases in the production of cotton, woollen and rayon fabrics.
Motor Vehicles16. Output of passenger cars and commercial vehicles reached new highrecords in the first quarter of 1950, and the returns of output for April mainlyreflect the drop in production over the Easter holidays. Weekly output of passengercars in April was 9,579 compared with an average of 10,105 a week in the first quarter of 1950 and 7,137 a week in April 1949.- Output of commercial vehicleswas 5,051 a week in April compared with 5,101 a week in the first quarter of 1950and 3,725 in April 1949.17. The whole of this increase in production, both of passenger cars and commercial vehicles, has gone into the export markets. Production both of passenger cars and commercial vehicles for the home market is now less thana year ago. Nearly four-fifths of the total output of passenger cars are now beingexported and nearly two-thirdo of commercial vehicles.Merchant Shipbuilding18. There has been a further slight falling-off in the number of new merchant ships under construction, but the tonnage of ships waiting repair or conversionwhich was falling throughout 1949 has begun to increase again, and at the endof April amounted to 2-69 million tons compared with 2-44 million tons at theend of 1949.19. About one-third of the new ships under construction are for export orders.III. Building20. The number of new permanent houses, including aluminium houses, com-pleted in Great Britain in April was 14,862, compared with 19,385 in March and14,069 in February. Building activity in April was, of course, affected by Easterholidays.All Permanent Houses Completed in Great Britain		For Local1949	Total	Authorities1st Quarter     ......	......      52,712	45,9292nd Quarter    ......	......      48,465	40,5113rd Quarter    ......	......      46,089	37,5964th Quarter    ......	......      50,361	41,1391950		1st Quarter     ......	......      47,810	39,402IV.-External Trade21. United Kingdom exports fell to  149-9 million in April compared with 171-9 million a month in the first quarter of the year. The April figure was affected by the Easter holidays, but even if allowance is made for this, exports inApril were still slightly less than in the earlier months of the year.22. On the other hand, imports into the United Kingdom in April reachedthe higher figure of  211-4 million compared with an average of  201-4 million a month in the first quarter of 1950. This increase was mainly due to a sharprise in imports of raw materials, particularly crude petroleum and unrefinedwhale oil.23. As a result of the rise in imports and the fall in exports in April the adverse visible balance of trade for the month rose to  55 -7 million compared with 23-4 million a month in the first quarter of the year.24. Exports to the dollar markets of the United States and Canada have risen since the third quarter of 1949, but recovery has been most marked in thetrade with Canada, which has shown almost a continuous improvement since october last year.38811 b 2
25. Exports to the United States fell in April to  5 - 6 million compared with 6-7 million a month in the first quarter of 1950. The reduction was mainly dueto the sharp fall in shipments of whisky and china clay, though exports of someother commodities, such as textiles, showed an improvement in April comparedwith the first quarter of the year.V. Balance of Payments26. Since the last public announcement of the state of our reserves at theend of March, which showed also that the sterling area had earned a gold and dollar surplus of $40 million in the first quarter of the year, our position hascontinued to be strong.  Weekly figures (up to 27th May) are shown below:  Net Gold and Dollar Surplus and Increase in United Kingdom Gold and dollar Holdings : .    .(U.S.$ million)Gold Increase in gold and Dollar and DollarWeek ended                                       Surplus Holdings8th April        ...      -.....      -        17 2915th April       ...      A........         22 4422nd April       .............          3 2129th April       .........      ...         12 436th May          .........                 20 3513th May        ............

The difference between these two series is a measure principally of the aid we have been receiving under E.R.P. (in the form partly of reimbursements for expenditure already incurred, and partly of goods supplied without initial payment).At the end of April we also made one of our periodic drawings on the Canadiancredit (U.S.$9 million).28. The persistence of this gold and dollar surplus and the consequent steady increase in our reserves is the result mainly (a) of increased receipts from our ownexports, particularly to Canada, but more especially from sales of raw materialsat increasing prices by the rest of the sterling area; (b) of continued economy in dollar expenditure by the whole sterling area; (c) of considerable gold receipts from South Africa under our agreement with her; and (d) of the continued absenceof any gold payments to our erstwhile European creditors, Belgium and switzerland.VI. prices import and Export Prices29. In April a further rise took place in the index of import prices to 131,compared with 128 in March (1947 = 100). There was no change in the month in the index of export prices.Wholesale Prices30. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices for April was 246 (1938= 100), compared with 242 in March and 228 in September 1949. This was thesharpest rise in any month since October, the month immediately following devaluation.31. The most important increases were in prices of food and feeding-stuffs. Prices of feeding barley, wheatfeed and linseed cake and groundnut cakerose following the final abolition of subsidies on animal feeding-stuffs. There was an increase in the price of butter, resulting from the policy of keeping food subsidies
within the prescribed limits and in prices of coffee and vegetables. The rise inbacon prices, following the limitation of the bacon subsidy, occurred in May andwas not reflected in the wholesale price index for April.32. Among prices of raw materials, the most significant increases were in non--ferrous metals, Egyptian cotton, raw wool, wood pulp and motor spirit.Retail Prices33. The index of retail prices (June 1947=100) rose one point to 114 inApril, mainly on account of the increases in prices of fish, which were freed from control on 16th April, and in vegetables. There were also increases in the pricesof some items of clothing and soft furnishings and increases in local rates insome areas.34. The index for May is not yet available, but since April there has been some fall in the price of fish and the price of eggs was reduced at the beginning ofJune. Prices of bacon have been raised.VII.-Wage Rates35. The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100)remained unchanged at 110 during the first four months of this year. between january and April 1949 it was 108.36. During April there was an increase of approximately  40,000 in the weeklyfull-time wages of 223,000 workpeople. This compared with increases of  27,500in March,  178,000 in February and  106,000 in January. The principal increases in April affected workpeople employed in industrial and staff canteens, the potteryindustry, gas supply undertakings and milk distribution in Scotland.37. A number of important wage claims are outstanding; the most importantrelates to the engineering and shipbuilding industries. Other claims are beingpresented or considered by agricultural workers, mineworkers, railwaymen, shop assistants and by national and local government staffs.VIII. European Recovery ProgrammeAllocation of Aid38. A further allotment of $121-6 million has been made to the UnitedKingdom, bringing the total allotment of aid in the current fiscal year (1st July,1949-30th June, 1950) to $919-8 million, of which $14-2 million is in the form ofa loan. We have thus now received the full amount envisaged in E.C.A.&apos;s tentativeannual aid estimate for 1950 (see CP. (49) 225, paragraph 45). Total aid received to date by this country is $2,539 - 5 million.The 1950-51 E.R.P. Appropriation39. The Foreign Aid Authorisation Bill has now been passed by the UnitedStates Congress. Of the total appropriation of $3,100 million (including a carry-over of $150 million from 1949-50 funds) asked for by the Economic Co-operation administration, $2,850 million have been approved; the United Kingdom alloca-tion is not yet known, compared with our bid of $720 million.The European Payments Union40. The United Kingdom has submitted to the Organisation for european economic Co-operation revised proposals for a European Payments Union whichwould provide under certain conditions for full membership by this country. (Thescheme, if agreed, will take effect from 1st July, 1950, when the present Agreementexpires.)41. Following the adoption of Supplementary Protocol No. 2, amending the Intra-European Payments Agreement for 1949-50, unused multilateral drawingrights amounting to approximately $83 million in all were surrendered by the
United Kingdom, France and Portugal. This total included $15 million surrenderedby France as agreed at the Anglo-French Economic Committee on 30th March(see last report, pargraph 31) and $28-4 million surrendered by the United King-dom. On 30th May the Council of O.E.E.C. approved the recommendation,submitted by the Joint Trade and Payments Committee, for the redistribution ofthese drawing rights in favour of certain other countries, but E.C.A. have withheldapproval and have proposed instead a redistribution amounting to $30 million infavour of a smaller number of countries.42. The cancellation of the bilateral drawing rights established by the UnitedKingdom in favour of France for 1949-50 (amounting to $93 million), as stated in the last report, was agreed by the Council on 21st April, but the economic co-operation Administration has not -yet agreed to the conversion of thecorresponding conditional aid into direct aid to the United Kingdom.43. Multilateral drawing rights were exercised on the United Kingdom inrespect of April to the extent of $2 - 62 million by Austria, $2 - 30 million by greece and $3 - 29 million by Turkey, bringing the total multilateral drawing rights exercised by other participants on the United Kingdom, during the period July 1949-April 1950 to $19-38 million. All bilateral drawing rights established by theUnited Kingdom have been used. The United Kingdom has not exercised drawingrights on Belgium since September last.
