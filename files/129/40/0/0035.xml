THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOYERNMENT! Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1950. .:   , v.SECRET Copy No.      1CP (50) 13523rd June, 1950 -  .&apos;   CABINET- - . .MARGINAL land memorandum by the Home Secretary, the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State for scotland. We were invited by the Cabinet, -at-their meeting on 9th March, 1950(CM. (50) 9th Conclusions, Minute 2 (2)), to submit our proposals for thedevelopment of marginal land, including any proposals regarding the supply of fertilisers. Proposals on the latter subject were dealt with in Our report on the farm price review discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions (CP. (50) 45), and we now submit for the consideration of our colleagues the conclusions which we havereached with regard to the treatment of marginal land.2. This problem has been fully examined by a working party of officialsduring the past few months and by the Panel on Import Substitution. Their reports have been considered by the Agricultural Output Committee (comprising officials of the Agriculture Departments, the Treasury, the Ministry of Food, the CentralEconomic Planning Staff and the Economic Section of the Cabinet Office), whosereport is annexed. This report is summarised below, but we suggest to our colleagues that it is very desirable to read the report itself if the size and complexity of the subject is to be fully appreciated. * .3. The report points out that, apart from land covered by the Hill FarmingAct, 1946, there are some 3\ to 4 million acres in the upland areas of the UnitedKingdom, the productivity of which could be materially increased by long-termimprovement schemes similar to those already provided for hill land under the hill Farming Act. In addition there are a number of much smaller areas spreadabout the country and covering some 500,000 acres in all, which could with advantage be much improved and which, if improved, would contribute to themore economical farming of the surrounding areas.4. The Agricultural Output Committee recognise that it would take aconsiderable time to deal with all land that is capable of improvement, particu-larly if we are to rely on voluntary means, and bearing in mind that many land-owners would be unable, or unwilling, to find their share of the cost, even ifsubstantial Government grants were made available. Furthermore, the committee consider that it is necessary to have regard to our general capital investment programme as well as to the extent of our need for more home-produced meat.5. With these considerations in mind the Committee have put forward thefollowing recommendations, which we fully endorse (i) that a sum of  10 millions should be provided over the 5 years 1951 to1956 for 50 per cent, grants towards the cost of voluntary schemes for improving marginal land in upland areas;(ii) that a sum of  5 millions should be provided over the same period forthe extension of the facilities already available for the improvement ofhill land under the Hill Farming Act, 1946;(iii) that an additional  2 millions should be made available, if necessary, forthe purposes of (i) and (ii) above, subject to the approval of the treasury and of Parliament;(iv) that a further sum of about  4 millions should be provided for continuing the marginal production schemes from 1953 to 1956, provision having already been made under the recent price review settlement forincreased outlay at the rate of  1 - 2 million per year for the three yearsup to 1952;(v) the subsidy schemes for hill sheep and hill cattle should be extended fora further 5 years until 1956 at an estimated total cost of  11 millions.38914 b
These developments would require the employment of rather over 200 extra staffin all for the United Kingdom.6. In our view it is essential, both from the political and from the sociologicalaspect, that we should undertake specific measures for the development of marginalland in this country. On the political side we would remind our colleagues thatall the three major Parties advocated in their Election Manifestos measures for increasing production from marginal land, and The King&apos;s Speech at the openingof the present Parliament includes the following phrase:  &quot; The economic difficulties of this country have emphasised the need forrenewed effort to expand the production of food from our own soil, and my government will continue to take all practical steps to encourage our agri-cultural population to increase output by every efficient means and to make better use of marginal land.&quot;We should undoubtedly be vulnerable to severe criticism if we were to continueto spend substantial sums on various projects for the development of resourcesoverseas (some of them with considerable uncertainty as to the ultimate return^and do not stimulate similar development of the resources of the United Kingdomwhere the return is more certain, is entirely under our own control, and enures fully to our own benefit.7. The economic condition of farmers in marginal areas, notably in Scotlandand Wales, is reflected in the community life and amenities of such districts. Wherethe farmer finds it necessary to cut down his costs of production and to be content with a lower standard of life, there is corresponding depression among othermembers of these rural communities, who gradually move away from such areas,with the result that in many marginal areas of Wales there is now an acute shortageof bricklayers, carpenters and similar tradesmen. We understand that the AdvisoryCouncil for Wales have expressed considerable concern on this matter, and cori-sider that, purely on sociological grounds, active measures are desirable to increasethe productivity of marginal land.8. We commend these proposals to our colleagues as a wise development oflatent agricultural resources, as an insurance against loss Or diminution of overseassupplies of meat, and as a contribution towards the improvement of social conditions in the countryside.&apos;     3     &apos; &apos;      J.

PRODUCTION FROM MARGINAL LAND IN THE UNITED KINGDOMReport by the Agricultural Output Committee1. The Agricultural Output Committee have considered how effect could best be given to the Governments decision to promote the better utilisation of marginal land announced in the King&apos;s Speech in the following terms:-&quot;my government will continue to take all practical steps to encourage our agricultural population to increase ouptut by every efficient means and to make better use of marginal land.&quot; The Committee have also reviewed the operation of the HillFarming Act, 1946 * the main provisions of which are due to expire inNovember 1951.2. As a first step the Agriculture Departments set up a working party underthe chairmanship of Sir Patrick Laird (Secretary, Department of Agriculture forScotland), to investigate the possibility and cost of expanding home meat production by the development and improvement of marginal and hill land. Apart fromofficials of the Agriculture Departments the working party included two distin-distinguished scientists, Professor W. Ellison, B.Sc, Ph.D., of the University college of Wales and Dr. F. Yates, Sc.D.., F.R.S., of the Rothamsted Experimental Station.The recommendations of the working party are summarised in paragraphs 3 to 14of this Report.Recommendations of Working Party3. The term &quot; marginal land &quot; is often loosely used and estimates of thearea of this land in the United Kingdom vary to a correspondingly wide extent.The workiug party considered that probably the most practical definition is that it island which is best suited to be used mainly for the breeding or rearing of cattleor sheep and which is not suited to be used to any material extent for the productionof milk, fatstock or crops for sale. This definition would cover most of the hilland upland grazing land in the country, including land classified as &quot; hill farmingland &quot; for the purposes of the Hill Farming Act. The significant fact about suchland is that for years it has been under-farmed and under-capitalised, largely becauseof the uncertainty of the economic outlook and the lack of capital to carry outimprovements. As those farming on this land produce few end products, theybenefit only indirectly and partially from the guaranteed prices and assured marketswhich apply to the products of other farmers. Not all.of this land is capable ofbeing improved at reasonable cost but, excluding land coming within the scopeof the Hill Farming Act, there are probably in the United Kingdom some3J-4 million acres whose productivity could be materially increased by suitableimprovements.4. Apart from these main areas of marginal land there are throughout thecountry pockets or stretches of land of varying size, situation or character which byreclamation or improvement could show a marked increase in production.Examples are to be found in the Fens, among the light sandy soils of Nottinghamand the East Riding of Yorkshire, and in river meadows and marshes. There are probably about 500,000 acres of this land in the United Kingdom.5. Financial assistance for the improvement of production from marginal land has hitherto been derived from funds available under the Hill Farming Act, the marginal agricultural production schemes and certain other ad hoc grants such asthose for land drainage, water supply, and the application of lime. Grants underthe Hill Farming Act of 50 per cent, of approved cost are available for compre-hensive rehabilitation schemes designed to restore farms to a sound economic state;they are limited, however, to hill sheep farms. Assistance under the marginalagricultural production schemes is mainly in respect of short-term improvements,such as manuring and reseeding, which have a comparatively early effect uponproduction. Assistance under these latter schemes is mainly a policy of givingsupport to units which are for the time being uneconomic. Their productivity canbe increased and this assistance is not necessarily connected with the quality of theland. The improvement provisions of the Hill Farming Act expire in November1951, after which no further schemes may be accepted, while the marginal agricul-tural production schemes are due to come to an end in 1952-3.38914 B 2
6. During the past year attention has been focussed in various ways uponthe possibility of obtaining increased supplies of meat from marginal land. Therehave been debates and questions on the subject in both Houses of Parliament.Surveys of areas of marginal land have been carried out by and on behalf of the agriculture Departments. Papers on marginal land improvement have been !readby prominent agricultural scientists and the National Farmers&apos; Unions have recorded in memoranda the results of their special investigations into the problem. ! Theworking party found that there is general agreement that, if farms in the main areasof marginal land are to support increased numbers of stock, long-term schemes ofrehabilitation would be needed similar to those promoted under the Hill Farming.Act. Not Only should the land be improved by the application of fertilisers, fencing,drainage and reseeding, but to secure the maximum output other more permanentimprovements would be needed, such as the provision or improvement of housing,farm buildings, roads, water and electricity supply, some of which would be socialin character and designed to secure and maintain a proper balance of rural life.7. The working party considered estimates of costs and returns for marginalland so improved based on surveys carried out in England and Wales by theImport Substitution Panel of the Committee on Industrial Productivity and inScotland by technical officers of the Department of Agriculture. As mentioned inparagraph 3, these surveys suggest that there may be some Z\ to 4 million acres in the United Kingdom that are capable of improvement, but the working party&apos;view is that, even with the aid of a 50 per cent, grant, improvement schemes arehardly likely to be promoted within an 8-year period for more than about-2\ million acres. Even with the help of surveys, there is not&apos;sufficient evidence to enable exact financial estimates to be made of either the cost of or the returns fromimprovement schemes, but such evidence as is available suggests that, assuming that in fact 2,\ million acres were improved, this area might be expected to produceeach year about 265,000 extra store cattle (or the equivalent in store sheep) which,when fattened on lowland farms, would yield an annual increase in production ofabout 90,000 tons of carcase meat of high quality. The capital cost of full rehabilitation-tation schemes would average about  30 per acre at current prices, but since fullrehabilitation would not be provided by all schemes, the average would be some-what lower. Of this cost about one-third would be for improvements to the landitself (cultivations, seeds, lime, fertilisers, fencing and drainage), while the remainingtwo-thirds would be for buildings (including farmhouses and cottages), installation of water and electricity supplies, construction of farm roads and the planting of shelter belts. After meeting annual depreciation and maintenance costs of the improvements the additional output of store cattle (valued at current prices andexcluding hill cattle subsidy) might be expected to yield an average net return ofabout 4 per cent, of the total capital investment, assuming that the area involveddid not exceed 2-2^ million acres. The bulk of the capital expenditure would be incurred by the landowner, but the increased return would accrue in the first place to the farmer, who would only share it with the landowner in so far as rentsincreased.8. On the assumption that there is a continuing need for increased and betterquality supplies of home-produced beef and mutton, which in turn will dependvery largely on improved supplies of store cattle and sheep from the hill andmarginal land of the country, the working party considered that a good case existed for the provision of financial assistance for long-term rehabilitation schemes formarginal land in the main hill and upland areas. They thought that the simplestand most satisfactory way of providing for this would be to amend and extend the Hill Farming Act to enable improvement grants of 50 per cent, of the approvedcost to be paid for work done under comprehensive schemes on marginal land as defined in paragraph 3. This arrangement would have the further advantage thatit would at the same time enable the assistance at present available for hill farmingland, properly so called, to be continued. The improvement provisions of the Acthave run two-thirds of their course. Although for several reasons this part of theAct got off to a slow start, substantial progress has recently been made, and of the 4 millions at present available for grant some  3^ millions have been alreadyearmarked. Proposals for improvement schemes are still coming in at a steadyrate, and it seems reasonably certain, therefore, that there will be a strong case notonly for the additional  1 million which can be made available under the Act asit stands, but for an extension of the Act for a further period with the provisionof additional funds if the very desirable improvement of hill farms now going onis not to be brought to a standstill.
9. The working party therefore recommended that legislation be promoted toamend and extend the Hill Farming Act to embody the proposed policy for theimprovement of the main areas of marginal land as well as to provide for thecontinuance of hill farming land improvement schemes. This would of courseimply the continuance of the voluntary principle which was embodied in the HillFarming Act as an experimental measure. Landowners and hill farmers have onthe whole not been backward in submitting schemes and it therefore seemsundesirable to substitute compulsion for the voluntary principle, particularly ata time when the scope of the Act would be broadened to make assisted schemesavailable for a large number of hitherto ineligible farms. Moreover, where thestandard of farming or of estate management is unsatisfactory the powers of supervision and dispossession under Part II of the Agriculture Act, 1947, can be invoked. The working party considered also that the period of extension of theAct might be for eight years. This would give time for some schemes to be com-pleted and by their example to encourage other farmers and landowners to submitschemes; it would at the same time give confidence in the continuity of the policyof promoting the increased productivity of marginal land.10. The working party pointed out that some holdings coming within theirdefinition of marginal land would be units which are not now economic andwould be unlikely to become so even after a comprehensive scheme of improvement.They considered that public money should not be spent in assisting private owners to rehabilitate farms of this type; assistance for full rehabilitation schemes should only be given for units which are, or are likely to become, economic. The HillFarming Act already provides that the cost of the improvement work required for making any of the improvements must not be excessive in relation to the benefitto be derived from them. It is the practice of Departments before approvingschemes to make a preliminary economic appraisal to see that this condition willbe satisfied. In England and Wales the County Agricultural Executive Committeesand the Agricultural Land Service consider schemes in relation to the expectedmaintenance of, and increase in, productivity, and only if they consider that theschemes will be economic propositions do they recommend approval. A criterionoften applied is whether the increased stocking of the land would enable an economicrent to be paid on the capital invested. In Scotland the Department usually onlyapprove schemes where the increase in output is such as to meet the annualdepreciation and maintenance costs of the improvement, together with interest on capital of at least 2 per cent., which on the basis of a 50 per cent.&apos;grant is equivalent to at least 4 per cent, for the farmers&apos; capital. Schemes have to becomprehensive, i.e., they have to contain all the work necessary to put the farmsinto proper working order. This means that sometimes, for instance, where anumber of farms are served by a single private access road or water supply, thescheme has to cover several holdings. There should be no difficulty in applyingthese general principles to the assessment of improvement schemes for marginalland to ensure that full rehabilitation schemes are approved only for units whichare economic or are likely to become so.11. The working party considered, however, that, while many of theuneconomic units should not become the subject of full rehabilitation improvementschemes, it would be possible to increase their output appreciably by the expenditureof a reasonable amount of money on short-term improvements, such as directimprovements to the land and the provision of temporary cattle shelters forwintering. They thought that if the need for an increase in the output of home-grown meat is such as to require the full use of this land then it might be desirableto approve schemes of this strictly limited kind, which should rank for 50 per cent,grant. Although these limited schemes would of course be of a short-term natureonly, yet the assistance provided might be well worth while in relation to the returnsobtained. It would also prevent many of these farms from going out of production,as they are likely to do unless assistance is forthcoming, and would enable them tomake their proper contribution to the nation&apos;s meat supplies, while the problem oftheir permanent future was being further studied.12. The further consideration of the problem of the permanent future of theseholdings which cannot be made economic by means available to the private land-owner or occupier, particularly where the holdings occur in groups or areas, seemedto the working party to be a suitable task for the Agricultural Land Commissionin England and Wales and for technical officers of the Department and of theAgricultural Colleges in Scotland in accordance with the agricultural policy already38914 c
laid down by the Government in the Agriculture Acts. Indeed, they thought thatthe problem of obtaining full production from some marginal areas goes beyond are organisation of estate management and farming practice and involves the socialproblem of resettlement and redevelopment with a complete reorganisation of social services and amenities. They considered that one or two pilot schemes might wellbe carried out in establishing rural development areas for marginal land on the broad principles of the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945. This would probablyinvolve the acquisition of the land by the State. They also emphasised that intheir view no real increase in production from some marginal areas, particularly in wales, would be possible until the public roads there were put into a good state of repair. They did not consider this to be a fit subject for financial assistance under an amended Hill Farming Act, but recommended, as a matter of special urgency,joint examination of the problem by the Agriculture Departments and the Ministryof Transport.13. The working party recognised that the total cost of carrying out theimprovement schemes suggested would vary greatly according to the extent towhich farmers took advantage of the facilities provided and according to the actual cost of doing the work. As stated in paragraph 7, they estimated that not morethan 2-2^ million acres would be covered by schemes submitted within the proposedterm of eight years and they put the average cost per acre at about  30. They con-sidered that if schemes covering this area of land were submitted the total cost ofcarrying them out would therefore vary between  50 and  60 millions, representing a cost to the Exchequer of  25- 30 millions for a 50 per cent, grant. In additionto this a further sum would have to be provided to enable grants to be continued for schemes for hill farming land for the reasons already stated in paragraph 8above; for this they suggested  5 millions. They thought that provision should bemade for a reserve of a further  5 millions to be made available by Order subjectto the approval of the Treasury and Parliament. They pointed out, however, that even if these estimates were realised the actual cost to the Exchequer would be somewhat lower since much of the work done under the schemes would consist of improvements, such as liming, land drainage and water supplies, already able to attract Government grant under other arrangements. In so far as this work was done and paid for under a marginal or hill land improvement scheme a savingwould be effected in the cost of these other grants so long as they continue.14. In paragraph 4 reference was made to the existence outside the mainmarginal land areas of some 500,000 acres of land of marginal type occurring for themost part in pockets or patches, sometimes as an odd field or two on an otherwisenormal agricultural holding. In the view of the working party this land is wellworth reclaiming, as it is capable of a marked increase in production, but to theprivate individual the cost is prohibitive. Much of it is land which, once reclaimed,would be as good as the agricultural land around it. The improvements requiredare mainly short-term in character (such as manuring, reseeding and in certain districts claying and marling); but in some parts of the country longer-term workssuch, as the planting of shelter belts, the improvement of farm roads and drainageare needed before worth-while results are obtainable. The present marginal agri-cultural production schemes already make provision for most of these purposes,but their scope would need to be extended to cover the few additional long-termimprovements and they would have to be continued for several years ahead insteadof coming to an end in 1952-53. The working party recommended, therefore, that assistance under the marginal agricultural production schemes should be continued with the widened scope indicated up to the year 1955-56, and then be subject tofurther review. They also considered that assistance under the schemes should bemade available to landowners as well as to occupiers. The Government are already committed to the expenditure of nearly  4 millions up to 1952-53 under the exten-sions agreed at the recent price review, and the working party considered that thecost of this further extension would be approximately  5 millions.Views and Recommendations of Agricultural Output Committee15. The Agricultural Output Committee have considered the working party&apos;conclusions and recommendations. In doing so they have had regard to various factors, outside the scope of the working party&apos;s study, such as the country&apos;scapital investment programme, and recent estimates, which have only just become available, of the prospective long-term supply and demand position for meat.
16. The recent review of the capital investment programme has shown thatfor some years ahead severe restrictions on investment are likely to be required.The programme of marginal land development contemplated by the working party would imply an investment of some  10 millions a year from public and privatefunds for eight years. This investment might be expected to yield an average netreturn of about 4 per cent, related to 2-2% million acres (see paragraph 7 above).Current limitations require that most new investment to-day, at least in industriesother than agriculture, shall be expected to yield a much higher return than this ifit is to be judged on a commercial basis. On the other hand, historically investment in permanent improvements in agriculture has not normally been expected to yield so high a return as investment in other industries. Half the cost of thismarginal land development would fall on the Exchequer; there would thereforebe a small but direct Budgetary strain. The Committee are agreed that in presentcircumstances the case for giving Government grants on the scale suggested by theworking party, which would divert savings, public and private, to an investment which offers the prospects of earning a yield of the order contemplated, althoughcontinued over a relatively long period, must rest on other than economic grounds,such as those of national security, social desirability or physical need. There may,however, well be a smaller area of marginal land capable of yielding a returnconsiderably above the average, where investment might be justified on economic grounds, but might nevertheless not be undertaken privately without assistance.17. As regards physical need, the results of the most recent Ministry of Foodsurvey of the prospective future supplies of and demand for meatindicate that againsta gap of 150,000 to 300,000 tons between present consumption and potential demand,increased supplies of something between 200,000 to 300,000 tons might be expectedwithout taking into account any further development of marginal lands. these estimates are, however, necessarily subject to wide margins of error. Those forpotential demand are based on a recent survey made among retail butchers. Thisindicated that if prices and quality remained unchanged the average value ofrationed meat required to satisfy consumers would be at a level of Is. %\d. per headper week; while if prices remain unchanged but a free choice of quality were permitted the level might rise to Is. 9\d. This estimate is well below the earlierestimate of 2s. 2d. and the reduced demand for meat is probably in part a reflectionof the increaed pressure on personal incomes and in part due to the improvedsupplies of other foods. * The estimates of future supplies take into account a fairly optimistic estimate of an increase of 100,000 tons of carcase meat per annum in the supplies from the Argentine, Brazil and the southern Members of the Com-commonwealth as well as increases in the production of meat at home as a result ofthe agricultural expansion programme, the targets for which in beef, veal, mutton and lamb seem almost certain to be realised.18. In their consideration of the general problem of marginal land improve-ment the Agricultural Output Committee have borne in mind both the wide margins of error contained in these estimates of future supply and demand and the uncer-tainty of supply from some countries abroad, e.g., the Argentine. They have also had regard to the working party&apos;s conclusion that, if assistance of the kind recom-mended is not made available for marginal land, then not only can no increasein production from this land be expected but an actual decrease will almost certainlyresult as the farms become less efficient or even go out of production through lackof capital for maintaining fertility and making improvements designed to make it worth while to keep them going. As the working party emphasised, there is needfor assistance in many marginal areas on social grounds alone, for without theprovision of reasonable amenities the already sparse population is bound to declinestill further. (It is understood that the Welsh Advisory Council is about to submit a report on the social need for Government assistance in marginal land areas in wales). There is also the need on security grounds for developing home meatproduction in such a way as would most reduce our dependence on overseassupplies in time of war.* The Treasury, Central Economic Planning Staff, Economic Section and the Ministry of Foodpoint out that the demand for meat is at present stimulated by a subsidy amounting to about  35millions on carcase meat. They argue that if the subsidy were removed or substantially reduced, itmight well be possible to satisfy demand with little or no increase in the present level of supplies.These Departments further infer that there must be a substantial risk that the extra meat, whichwould be produced as a result of marginal land development, could not be sold at present prices.
19, These various considerations have led the Agricultural Output Committeeto conclude that the working party V recommendations are in principle sound and well conceived. In view, however, of the investment considerations and since theneed for extra meat is not now considered by the Ministry of Food to be so urgentor so great as had hitherto been thought, the Committee consider that a more modest and cautious approach should be made to the problem of improvingrtheproductivity of marginal land than that proposed by the working party, and thatattention should be concentrated on the land which would yield the highest returns.They recommend therefore that, at least for an initial period of five years, the pro-vision of financial assistance for long and short term improvement schemes of thekind recommended by the working party should be limited to (say) the first million acres of marginal land in the United Kingdom whose improvement will be mostworth while.* Returns from this area might be appreciably better than the averageof 4 per cent, estimated for the whole 2-2^- million acres contemplated by theworking party. There should be little administrative difficulty in providing for sucha limitation by the introduction of suitable standards of appraisal. The cost ofproviding for 50 per cent, grants by an extension of the Hill Farming Act to coverimprovement schemes for this area would be about  10 millions, while another 5 millions might be needed for the extension for a further five years of the existing provision for hill farming land improvement schemes, giving a total of the orderof  15 millions, to which ought to be added an additional reserve of  2 millions tobe made available in case of need by Order of the Ministers made with the approvalof the Treasury and of Parliament. While grants would be confined to applica-tions submitted within five years, the resultant expenditure would be spread over a longer period as there is a considerable time lag between submission of an improve-ment scheme and payment of grant on completion of the work. The average callon the Exchequer might not therefore exceed  2 millions a year. In addition, theAgricultural Output Committee consider that in order to provide for the recom-mended extensions of the marginal agricultural production schemes the sum ofabout  4 millions at present available for assistance under the schemes until1952-53 should be increased to  8 millions for the period until 1955-56.Departmental Staff20. In their report the working party drew attention to the strain already put upon the Agriculture Departments&apos; headquarters, local and field staffs by the examination of hill farming improvement schemes and they emphasised that addi-tional staff would be necessary if the approval and execution of the contemplatedschemes for marginal land were not to be seriously delayed and that the return tobe obtained will largely depend on the adequacy of the advisory services availableto farmers. The Agricultural Output Committee strongly endorse this view; delay of this kind would seriously endanger the success of the extended measures ofassistance. The total number of extra staff required would be rather over 200, ofwhom say 100 would be technical staff in the counties, about 70 clerical staff inthe countries and 40 clerical and executive staff at headquarters.Hill Sheep and Hill Cattle Subsidies21. The Agricultural Output Committee have also considered the situation that will arise when the provisions of the Hill Farming Act, 1946, relating to the hill sheep and hill cattle subsidies expire in 1951. Hill farming and in the presentcontext this term applies to much of the farming on the main marginal land areas is peculiar in that with the exception of wool it produces few end products andso hill farmers do not benefit to the same extent as other producers from thesystem of guaranteed prices and markets. The prices of the chief products (storesheep and cattle) are liable to fluctuate at least in the short term-from causesother than those affecting fat stock prices. The hill sheep subsidy in particular is designed to counteract these variations in hill farmers&apos; income; the rate prescribedannually by the Ministers is based on the economic returns to hill sheep farmers in the preceding year and adjusted so as to maintain the level of incomes as steadyas possible. A failure to renew this subsidy would in the absence of some othermeasure similar in design tend to undermine confidence in the future of theindustry and might well lead to a decline in the foundation flocks of hill sheep.* The Treasury, Central Economic Planning Staff and Economic Section dissent from theAgricultural Output Committee&apos;s recommendation in respect of short term improvements, described in more detail in paragraph 11. In their view the expenditure of public funds on units not capableof becoming economic is unjustified.
22. The hill cattle subsidies differ from the hill sheep subsidy in that theyare paid at rates fixed without regard to the industry^ level of income and are designed to stimulate an increase in the breeding and rearing of cattle on hill land.In Scotland the subsidy is paid only on breeding cows and heifers. The scheme in England and Wales provides for two rates of subsidy: (a) for breeding cowsarid heifers, and (b) for other stock summered on the hill land. This scheme hasthe additional purpose of encouraging the stocking of hill land so as to relieve the pressure on lowland pastures during the summer months and also to encourage the improvement of hill grazings themselves by the benefit to the herbage of the grazing and manuring of the cattle. The complete cessation of the schemes in1951 would be undesirable for the following reasons:-(a) It would tend to create a set-back to the expanding cattle population ofthe hills, since it would roughly coincide with the withdrawal of thecalf-rearing subsidy;(b) Farmers carrying out improvement schemes on hill land would need theadditional income afforded by the subsidy to enable them to purchasecattle for increasing the stocking of the improved pastures;(c) Now that milk production has reached the requirements of the liquidmarket, it is desirable to encourage milk producers on remote hill farmsto turn over to stock rearing, and the continuation of the hill cattlesubsidy would assist this process though it is not the only means of doing so.23. Both of these schemes have been working well and for the reasons givenin paragraphs 21 and 22 the Committee feel that provision ought to be made fortheir continuance for a further five years after the expiry of the present statutory authority. The cost of the hill sheep scheme, but not of the hill cattle scheme,is likely in the absence of any disaster such as occurred in the winter of 1946-47to be on a diminishing scale the average annual cost during the five-year period for the United Kingdom probably being of the order of  600,000 as compared withthe estimated cost in 1950 of  1,200,000. The total cost of both subsidies for thefive years is estimated at about  11 millions. In any event the amount of thesesubsidies is taken into account in calculating the farmers&apos; global net income atthe February price review. In so far as the object of the price reviews is to produce a predetermined aggregate net income, the amount of the hill sheep and cattlesubsidies must produce a corresponding price reduction elsewhere. The cost falling on the consumer or taxpayer is therefore no greater in the end. It should benoted that these subsidies, now costing  2^-3 millions per annum, are additional to the loss of  35 millions a year borne by the Ministry of Food on home-producedmeat.24. The Committee also call attention to the working party&apos;s recommenda-tions regarding the establishment of rural development areas for marginal landon the broad principles of the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945 (see paragraph 12),as likely to be of interest to Ministers, particularly those concerned with rural development in Wales. The Committee make no specific recommendations on thissubject, however, since it is one which also concerns Departments not represented on the Committee.Summaryii) There are some jr. to 4 million acres in the United Kingdom in the mainhill and upland areas of the country, in addition to hill farming land covered bythe Hill Farming Act, the productivity of which could be materially increased by long-term rehabilitation schemes of improvement similar to those already providedfor under the Hill Farming Act. In view, however, of the limitations placed on new investment and of the most recent estimates by the Ministry of Food of thesupply of, and demand for, meat, it is recommended that financial assistance for voluntary schemes of improvement should for the present be limited to the million acres of this land that is most worth while improving. The Hill Farming Act mightbe extended and amended to enable 50 per cent, grants to be made for this purpose
and also to continue the existing provisions relating to the improvement of hillfarming land. The extension should apply to schemes submitted within a period offive years.(ii) The extra cost of the Exchequer (to be incurred over a period of abouteight years is estimated at about  15 millions, and it is recommended that this sum should be made available under projected legislation. To this sum should beadded  2 millions to be held in reserve and made available for grant by Orderin case of need.(iii) The marginal agricultural production schemes should be extended so asto provide, in addition to assistance in its present form, grants for the improvementof marginal land not in the main hill and upland areas, which by reclamation orimprovement could show a marked increase in production and where owing to thecost the applicant could not be expected to do the work at his own expense or withthe aid of grants already available. For this purpose the schemes should beextended to the year 1955-56, subject to review at the end of the period. The 4 millions already available for assistance under these schemes until 1952-53should be increased to  8 millions for the period until 1955-56.(iv) Assistance should not be made available for full rehabilitation schemesrelating to holdings which are not likely to become economic without special measures not available to the ordinary landowners or occupiers; assistance for limited schemes of short-term improvements should however be given to unitsof this kind where the probable increase in returns would make this worth while.The long-term problem of these holdings should be studied by the agricultural land Commission in England and Wales and its equivalent in Scotland.(v) Provision should be made in the extended Hill Farming Act for thecontinuance of subsidy schemes for hill sheep and cattle, subject to the approvalof the Treasury and of Parliament. The cost, which should be on a diminishingscale, is estimated to amount to a total of  11 millions for the five years.May, 1950
