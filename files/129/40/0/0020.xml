[IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. P. (50)  1 20 &apos;   COPY NO.  ^2ND JUNE,. 1950CABINETINTEGRATION OP FRENCH AND german coal AND STEEL INDUSTRIESReport by Committee of officials the French Government have indicated to us that itis essential that we and the other countries concerned should agree to a communique about the Schuman coal/steelproposals in the form given in Annex I to this note,  on theground that this expressed the unity of view which is indis-pensable for the successful prosecution of the negotiations.They have &quot;further indicated that, if the United KingdomGovernment is unable to subscribe to this communique, theFrench Government will open negotiations on the stated con-ditions with the other countries which have accepted them asa basis.      In that event they will keep the United KingdomGovernment informed of the progress of the negotiations intheir desire to enable the latter to join in whenever they feel able to do so.2. In our view this latest French proposal is basicallyno different from the earlier one.    1 It essentially seeks to commit us in advance of negotiations to the principle ofpooling European steel and coal resources and to the surrender to an independent authority of sovereignty -over an importantsector of our economy.     We think it wrong to commit ourselves in this way, not because we necessarily preclude -any possi-bility of some measure of pooling or some surrender of sovereignty, but because we think it wrong to pledge our-selves on these matters without knowing more precisely thenature of the commitment we are being invited to accept.3. On this basis we would, therefore, have to contem-plate the prospect that the others may go ahead without us.Our provisional view is that the economic arguments in favourof coming in or staying out of an international associationof the kind contemplated by the Schuman plan are not conclu-sive one way or the other&apos;, and on this score there need be nocause for alarm if at this stage-the French decided to proceed without us.The main issues are really political.      The exchanges&quot;with the French Government have brought out that their pro-posals, which started in a Franco-German context, have nowbeen given a wider application.       It is not merely pooling of resources., but also, in the first place, the conception offusion or surrender of sovereignty in a European system whichthe French are asking us to accept in principle.      M.  Schuraan&apos;original memorandum said in terms that his plan would be astep towards the federation of Europe.      It has been oursettled policy hitherto that in vie?/ of our world positionand interests, we should not commit ourselves irrevocably to europe either in the political or the economic sphere unless we could measure-the extent and effects of the commitment.

This is in effect what we are now being asked to do.      Itis a commitment of this kind which in essence the FrenchGovernment is now seeking, and at the very moment when thedecision has been taken to develop and give greater meaningto the Atlantic community.5. The most important  aspect of the French proposals is that it represents a new and constructive approach to theproblem of Franco-German relations.      This is very much inour interest, from the political, as also the defence, pointof view.      If we abstain from-the present phase of thenegotiations the possible effects of our action on theprogress of Franco-German rapprochement will have to hehome in mind.6. The other Governments who have accepted the Frenchcommunique in principle are not in the same position as theUnited Kingdom Government either politically or economically.Yet even they have not accepted the French formula withoutmental and, in the case of the Dutch, explicit reservation.We shall he kept informed of the progress of discussions;and it is unlikely, that by refusing&apos; to join in now onthe French terms we shall be prevented, from participating in European discussions in some manner later on.7. It will be seen, therefore,  that there is a realdifference of view between ourselves and the French, whichcannot he glossed over by mere verbal ingenuity in the drafting of a communique, and in our view it is better to face this issue now rather than later.      For the abovereasons we recommend that the latest French proposal shouldbe rejected.8. In order to avoid misunderstanding and raisrepresen-t at ion of our position, it will be essential that our attitu.deshould be made clear in a public announcement.      A draft ofsuch an announcement is appended (Annex II) for- consideration.Signed, on behalf of the Committee,E.E.   BRIDGES.Treasury Chambers, S. V/. 1 ,2ND JUNE,  1950.

ANNEX ii draft COMMUNIQUE1. His Majesty1 s Government in the United kingdom have from the: outset welcomed the French initiative of9th May and have been fully alive to its bold character and far-reaching importance for future relations between Franceand Germany in -particular.      They earnestly hope that theinternational- discussions upon it may lead to a new era inFranco-German -relations, with beneficial effects for-JVestern Europe as a whole.2. His Majestyfs Government have been most anxiousto be associated with these discussions and have made their position in this respect clear to the French Government fromthe outset.      It is their view that these discussions should serve to clarify the practical application of the french proposal, which must jiecessarily be worked out on aninternational basis, and they would have wished to make a constructive and practical contribution to these discussions,in the hope that a detailed scheme vrould emerge which theywould be able to join..3*. The French Government, for their part, have taken the view that the first step in the execution of their planmust be an international conference of countries prepared toaccept a prior commitment in principle to pool their coal andsteel resources and to set up a new high authority whosedecisions will bind the Governments concerned..     In the viewof the French Government,  the negotiations should be aimed,in the first instance, at the preparation of a treatyembodying these principles, and establishing the high authority,to be submitted to ratification by Parliaments.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not feel able to accept, nor do they wish to reject in advance, the principles underlying the french proposal.      They consider that a detailed discussion, whichwould throw light on&apos;the full political and economic consequences of the scheme and how it would work, is anessential preliminary to the conclusion of a treaty.      they feel that there is a substantial difference of approachbetween the two Governments as to the basis on which thenegotiations should be opened. .   They have accordingly, totheir regret, found it impossible to associate themselves with  the negotiations on the terms proposed by the FrenchGovernment,k* At the same time, His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom wish to make it clear that they do not wish,and have never wished,  to delay discussion of the french proposals and indeed  it has always been their desire thatthese discussions should be initiated without delay.      they themselves have been actively engaged in working on proposalsinspired by the French initiative of 9th May,  in order thatthey might be ready to make a constructive contribution.They appreciate the offer of the French Government to keep them informed of the progress of their negotiations..

5. His Majesty&apos;s Government keenly regret that theconditions on which they have been invited to participate in the discussions have made it impossible for them at thisstage to do so.      They are none the less hopeful that itwill be possible to find a basis of agreement in this field which will give further support to the many enterpriseson which the two Governments in association with otherGovernments are now engaged in common, and in particular the strengthening and consolidation of the Atlantic communitywithin the framework of the Atlantic Pact.
