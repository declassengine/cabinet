this document  is  the   property  op his   britannic   majesty&apos;s   government 1 6Printed for the Cabinet,   June 1950Copy No.    32CABINETCHINESE CIVIL AIRCRAFT AT HONG Kong memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies and the Minister of state at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 24th April (CM. (50) 24th Conclusions, Minute 6),it was decided that steps should be taken to obtain an Order-in-Council enabling the courts to determine the ownership of the seventy civil aircraft in Hong Kongwhich were claimed both by the Chinese Government and by an American corpora-tipn. !It was also decided that the Order should ensure the safe custody of these aircraft pending the determination of their ownership.2. In the course of the discussion on this subject, the point was made that,if in the event the courts upheld the Chinese claim to the ownership of the air-craft, the Chinese Government might bring an action for damages in respect oftheir detention. The Cabinet agreed that the Hong Kong Government should notbe left to pay any such damages, and the conclusion was reached that theUnited States Government should be asked to indemnify the United KingdomGovernment against any damages which might be awarded against them by thecourts in respect of the detention of these aircraft.&quot; At the same meeting theChancellor of the Exchequer agreed that &quot; reasonable costs of repair and mainten-ance should be borne by the United Kingdom Government.&quot;3. It is assumed that the conclusions referred to in paragraph 2 above relatedprimarily to damages which might be claimable by the Chinese in respect ofdeterioration if the measures taken for the protection of the aircraft provedinadequate, though it is possible that a claim might be made for damages in respectof loss of profit through withdrawal of the aircraft from active service.4. An Order-in-Council relating to these aircraft was made on 10th May, inaccordance with the Cabinefs decision referred to in paragraph 1 above.5. Before the promulgation of the Order, the legal advisers of the ForeignOffice and the Colonial Office considered whether the United Kingdom Govern-ment&apos;s position could be safeguarded by the insertion of a suitable provision inthe Order-in-Council, under which a claimant would be required to bring intocourt a sum to cover any damages which might ultimately be payable. It was not found possible, however, from a legal standpoint to incorporate anything on theselines in the Order-in-Council, and with this conclusion the Attorney-General agreed.6. The legal advisers of the two Departments came to the conclusion thatthere were no good grounds on which we could ask the Americans to indemnify usagainst claims for damages, and in the light of these views it was felt that furtherconsideration had to be given to this question before action was taken. It was thought that to have made such a request at the time we informed the UnitedStates Government of the making of the Order-in-Council would in any case have destroyed the excellent impression created by our communication, which was madeon the day after Mr. Acheson arrived in London.SECRETCP. (50) 13422nd June, 195.0,38911
7. Further consideration has since been given to the question and theconclusion has been reached that we cannot ask the United States Government to indemnify us for the following reasons:  (a) there seems to be no legal reason on which we could base a case forasking the United States Government to indemnify us;(b) the United States Government would be most unlikely to accept; any liability, particularly as it would be a purely hypothetical. one, theamount of which could not be precisely assessed in advance. In any- case, the United States Government could probably not accept such a liability without the specific approval of Congress. This would bedifficult to obtain and would involve publicity which would be undesirable for the reasons stated at (c) and (d) below;(c) the Central People&apos;s Government would be bound to hear of our action,particularly if the United States Government submitted the matter to congress. The Chinese would be able to use it for the purpose ofrepudiating our contention that the Order-in-Council was made in theinterests of justice. Our relations with the Chinese, which are at acritical stage, might be adversely affected;(d) in any case, whether the Chinese heard of it or not, the fact would remainthat we had acted in a manner which conflicted with our declared policy.To formulate such a request to the United States Government would indeed run completely counter to our assertion that the Order-in-council has been taken in the interests of international justice and not inconsequence of American pressure. If we asked the Americans to indemnify us, the implication would be that, having held up the aircraft at their request, we expected them to make good any loss we incurred.8. This last consideration was felt to be decisive. A request of this nature would be quite incompatible with the position we have taken up, namely that theOrder-in-Council is an impartial measure designed solely to secure the ends ofjustice. The United States Government have not therefore been asked to indemnify the United Kingdom Government in the manner contemplated by the Cabinet.9. The Attorney-General has seen this paper and has no comments to offer on its terms.J. G.K. G. Y.22nd June, 1950.
