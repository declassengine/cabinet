(50) 11522nd May, 1950Copy No.      ^ 2CABINETCONVERSATIONS WITH M. SCHUMAN AND Mr. ACHESON ON11th, 12th AND 13th MAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate, lor the information of my colleagues, the following account of aseries of conversations which took place between M. Schuman, Mr. Acheson and myself from 11th to 13th May on matters of common interest. A copy of theagenda is attached as Annex A.2. The ground covered has already largely been reported to my colleagues inmy papers on the official and the bipartite Ministerial talks (CP. (50) 92 and 114).I do not therefore propose to go into the substance of the tripartite Ministerialtalks in any great detail.Assessment of World situation. As in the bipartite talks which I had with Mr. Acheson, we agreed on ageneral assessment of the world situation and on the common objectives which our three countries should pursue. In the discussion on this item M. Schuman \showed himself particularly anxious that we should not appear provocative eitherto the Russians or to neutral world opinion. He particularly stressed the need totake into account the present state of mind on the Continent, which was obsessedby the fear of war and the atom bomb. Soviet peace propaganda was havingconsiderable effect in this atmosphere, and, while we must be firm and state our determination to build up our strength by the defence of liberty, it was essentialto underline the attachment of the West to the ideal of peace and to point outthat war could be avoided if the West could indeed build up a situation of strength.The matter was really one of presentation.4. Mr. Acheson and I did what we could to show that we were aware of continental susceptibilities and agreed that, certainly in so far as any public exposi-tion of our views was to be made, we should take into account the points madeby M. Schuman.Chinese Representation in the United Nations5. There was considerable discussion on the question of Chinese representa-don in the United Nations. I had the feeling the French were seriously worriedabout the position and would welcome a solution. In fact, from some ofM. Schuman&apos;s remarks, I gathered that he might be thinking along the lines of voting for the seating of a People&apos;s Government representative in the variousUnited Nations organisations, while still refusing to recognise the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment.6. The Americans, on the other hand, were still adamant. The wholequestion for them is not the United Nations one, but one of giving way to Sovietpressure in order to secure Soviet co-operation in the United Nations field. this they feel would be wrong in principle.38759 &quot; B
(e) to instruct the High Commission to investigate the question of steel produc-tion and in the meantime to inform the Germans, if necessary, that;no increase in the permitted level of production is contemplated forthe present.18. Mr. Acheson promised to consider a Franco-British proposal for the relaxation of certain security restrictions on German trade in the Soviet orbit, i a french proposal -for exemption of certain Allied property from nationalisationin Germany, and an American proposal for the immediate relaxation of therestrictions on German shipbuilding for export were rejected. But the question ofGerman shipbuilding will certainly be raised again.19. M. Schuman spoke in support of his High Commissioners appeal to governments against the promulgation of the Law on the reorganisation anddecartelisation of the German coal and steel industries (Law 75). Mr. Achesonand I declared that we could not accept his argument that this question shouldbe regarded as outside the scope of the Agreement on Tripartite Controls, andthat we did not consider his grounds sufficient to sustain the objection.Meeting with Benelux Representatives20. At the end of the tripartite discussions a meeting was held with the benelux representatives to communicate to them the decision which had beenreached on Germany during our talks. This information was along the lines ofthat contained in the draft declaration issued as a result of the meetings. the benelux representatives seemed generally satisfied with the decisions taken.E.

(MIN / TRI / P / 6.)ANNEX BIM1N7TRI/P/66th May, 1950]MINISTERIAL TALKS: UNITED KINGDOM / UNITED STATES / FRANCEConsultation and Co-ordination of policy the following suggestions have been put forward during the preparatorydiscussions and are submitted for approval by the Ministers:  Consultations between the three Powers should be more frequent and betterorganised without, however, creating any new machinery.   In particular:  (a) The three Foreign Ministers should agree to try to meet each other two orthree times a year. These meetings need not be regular but should beheld with sufficient regularity so that they are regarded as normal practice, not exciting public opinion. Use should be made of theUnited Nations meetings at which Ministers are present.(b) The principle should be established that the Foreign Minister of each country should receive the Ambassadors of the other two countries for joint discussions of appropriate subjects. This should not interferewith the normal channels of discussion on particular topics.(c) The representatives of the three Powers on any organ of the North atlantic treaty organisation should also keep in touch with each other as appropriate.id) There should be intensified co-operation within the United nations organisation between the three countries. This would include evencloser co-operation between our delegations during meetings of theGeneral Assembly and also increased consultation between our per-manent representatives at the seat of the United Nations. This shouldalso apply to the Specialised Agencies.ie) At the conclusion of the Tripartite Talks in London the communiqueshould indicate the intention of the three Ministers to meet again inthe near future, possibly in New York before the next meeting of theGeneral Assembly.ANNEX CTMIN/TRI/P/25 -  .11th May, 1950]MINISTERIAL TALKS: UNITED KINGDOM/UNITED STATES /FRANCEDeclaration of the Foreign Ministers on MigrationIn the course of their discussions the Foreign Ministers have recognised thatthe excess of population from which several countries in Western Europe are suffering is one of the most important elements in the difficulties and disequilibriumof the world. In particluar it retards the efforts which are being made to assure
greater economic unity in Europe. It contributes to the increase of unemploymentwith the grave social and political problems which this entails.They also believe that the systematic exploration of opportunities for greaterpopulation mobility can contribute significantly to the solution of this problem. Inthis connection they have noted valuable work on numerous aspects of the problemsof migration which has been going forward within the O.Jb.E.C., and the united nations and its Specialised Agencies.They believe, however, that in view of the importance and wide scope of theproblem it would be desirable again to make a review of the activities of the variousbodies concerned with the question with a view to determining whether there are other and new approaches which could be undertaken. For this purpose they haveagreed that they will designate experts to confer together after the conclusion ofthese meetings.ANNEX DMINISTERIAL TALKS: UNITED KINGDOM/UNITED STATES/FRANCEStatement on Germany .   - *Following the London Agreements of June 1948 and the Washington Agree-ments of April 1949, the United States, France and the United Kingdom replacedthe military authority and the direct administration of the occupied territories inforce since 1945 by a civilian regime simply of supervision. By virtue of thisregime Germany was abie to produce a Constitution, proceed to free elections,call a Parliament, form a Government and elect a Federal President. The federal government and the Governments of the Lander were able to take over theadministration and control of internal German affairs.Furthermore by the agreement of 13th April, 1949, the Allies decided to ease the burden of reparations on Germany. Some months later under the PetersbergProtocol an agreement was reached for a final settlement in regard to the delivery of plant by way of reparations.In the domain of foreign relations the Petersberg Protocol made provision forthe appointment of German Consular and commercial representatives abroad.During the last few months steps have been taken by the Western Powers to securethe accession of the Federal Republic to a number of international organisationsincluding the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. Finally, she hasbeen invited to join the Council of Europe. The progress made has been accom-plished in large measure thanks to the action and the influence of the three allied high Commissioners in whom the three Foreign Ministers are happy again toexpress their full confidence. - rThe Allies are resolved to pursue their aim laid down in the WashingtonAgreement of April 1949 and reaffirmed at the Petersberg that Germany shallre-enter progressively the community of free peoples of Europe. When that situation has been fully reached she would be liberated from controls to which she is still subject and accorded her sovereignty to the maximum extent com-patible with the basis of the occupation regime. This regime is imposed on theGermans and on the Allies by the consequences of the division of Germany and ofthe international position; until this situation is modified it must be retained inaccordance with the common interests of Germany and Europe. . -The Western Powers desire to see the pace of progress towards this end as.rapid as possible. Progress will depend upon the degree of confident and frankco-operation displayed by the Government and the people of the Federal Republic.&quot;In the first place the pace will be determined by the extent to which the Alliescan be satisfied that their own security is safeguarded by the development inGermany of a desire for peace and friendly association with themselves. In thesecond place the pace will be set by the rate at which Germany advances towards a condition in which true democracy governs and the just liberties of the individualare assured. Therefore, the Western Powers wish to emphasise most strongly thatthe natural desire of the German people to secure relaxation of controls and therestoration of the sovereignty of their country depends for its satisfaction only
upon the efforts of the German people themselves and of their Government. Theyearnestly trust that the Federal Republic will fulfil in this respect the hopesplaced in the wisdom of her people and her leaders. Meanwhile the High Com-missioners in exercising the powers reserved to them will continue to place their main emphasis upon essential elements of security and fundamental democraticissues of real importance.In view of the continued refusal of the Soviet Government to permit theinhabitants of their zone of occupation to rejoin their fellow countrymen in a democratic and united Germany, it has not been possible, and will not be as longas this Soviet policy persists, to proceed to the conclusion of a treaty of peace withGermany. The Ministers accordingly agreed to set up a study group in london to undertake the necessary preparatory work to enable the Occupation Statute tobe reviewed at the appointed time and to make recommendations for eliminating the major practical inconveniences arising in the countries concerned from the stateof war, on the understanding that in the present situation of Europe supreme authority must remain in the hands of the Allied Powers.While retaining the framework outlined above the Allies intend to giveGermany the possibility of developing freely, while at the same time safeguarding the possibility of peaceful reunification of Germany, which remains the ultimateobject of their policy. The three Governments reaffirm the offers which wereformulated during the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers last June, andexpress the hope that the necessary conditions for the establishment of a Govern-ment for all Germany may be achieved which would guarantee to all Germansrespect for their laws and fundamental liberties, and they have agreed upon theconditions which are necessary, in their opinion, for this purpose.
