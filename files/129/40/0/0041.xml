LISTSMemorandum by the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for scotland. We have had under consideration certain alterations in the arrangements forprinting the Register of Electors which, in our view, are highly desirable but whichwill cost a good deal more.2. In the course of the preparation of the annual Register, provisional listsare published of those who appear to be entitled to be registered, so that the publicmay inspect them and, if necessary, put in claims or objections. This has long been regarded as an essential feature of our system of registration, and, particularly since the war, in response to pressure from the Parties, a good deal of publicityhas been given to urging people to take advantage of this opportunity to make sure of their vote. , -3. The present method of publishing these provisional lists is, however, quiteunsatisfactory. They are published in three parts the old Register, a list of newlyqualified electors and a list of those no longer qualified-which have&apos; to be readtogether in order to discover their effect. Particularly in urban areas, the Registeritself tends to be a fairly complicated document, bei ng sub -divided&apos; info1 pollingdistricts and streets. When it has to be compared with these additional lists, it becomes difficult enough for someone familiar with the arrangements to find his way about the three documents, and it is sometimes almost impossible for an ordinary member of the public to do so. It is hardly too much to say that thepresent method of publishing the lists tends to frustrate the provision for claims and objections to which so much importance is attached and sd much publicityis given. zv?&amp;q vW:        sir??/4. In these circumstances we have received strong and repeated representa-tions, with which we are in complete sympathy, from Members of Parliament,from representatives of the political Parties, and from the Registration Officersboth in England and in Scotland, to the effect that this system should be abandoned and a better one should be found. We have recently had the whole matterthoroughly examined, with the help as regards England of the Advisory ElectoralConference, on which the Chief Agents of the Labour, Conservative and LiberalParties serve, and in the case of Scotland in consultation with the Registration andReturning Officers and the Scottish agents of the parties. It is quite clear thatthe only satisfactory way of publishing the Electors Lists is to publish them inthe form of a complete draft Register, which must then be revised to give effectto claims and objections and published in final form as the Register for the year.5. The matter has been discussed with the British Federation of MasterPrinters, and they are prepared to operate this alternative system as an experiment,provided certain concessions are made to them as regards time and as regards theextent to which proofs are demanded. They say, however, that the change will involve much additional skilled hand labour which is very scarce. The questionof cost has been examined in detail by the Stationery Office and the Federation andit is estimated that, for the whole of the United Kingdom, it will be between  150,000and  200,000, in addition to the present cost of  545,000 for printing the annual38931-: Cppy:^&apos;No*32
Register (see Appendix). Half this cost would fail to be borne by the localauthorities. Against it may also be set some saving of clerical work in the offices of Registration Officers, to the value of perhaps  10,000.6. We recognise that this will be a heavy additional item of expenditure, butwe consider, nevertheless, that the change ought, if possible, to be made. We needribf&apos;stressJthe political importance of achieving a Register which is;;%S&apos;oornpjlete andas accurate as possible. One of the principal methods of achieving Tfiislsl^rmajce.the process of claims and objections a reality; but we really cannot go on tellingpeople that they must use this opportunity to make sure of their vote and that: ifthey do not do so the fault will be theirs if they cannot vote, unless we are preparedto provide Electors Lists in an intelligible form.7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, does not feel able to agreeto such substantial extra expenditure without reference to the Cabinet. We shallaccordingly be glad to have the decision of our colleagues.&apos; :     &apos;        - J. C. E.H. McN.21th June, 1950.appendix the following facts indicate why the proposed change would cost so much:  The Register for the whole of the United Kingdom amounts to about 170,000pages of type. The present system requires one handling of the pages, but theproposed system would require the pages to be handled twice. The need to handlethis vast volume of matter within narrow time-limits necessarily entails a consider-able amount of overtime work. In the typical case of a printer responsible for160,000 names, under the present system 170 pages of new and obsolete namesare set in type, proofed, corrected and printed at the list stage. After claims andobjections, the amendments are incorporated into 800 pages of Register. Thereis only one handling of the full Register. Under the proposed system, the whole800 pages of the Register will have to be handled page by page at the first stagefor deletion of old names and insertion of new names. After claims and objections,the whole 800 pages will again have to be handled for correction, proofing and printing final copies of the Register. Thus, in the example quoted, the presentsystem involves work on 970 pages, whereas the proposed system would involvework on 1,600 pages.
