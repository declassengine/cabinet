Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1962C. (62) 59 Copy No.   5 03rd April, 1962CABINETTHE PROBLEM IN CENTRAL africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentIntroductoryLast week I held a series of informal talks with the High Commissioner in salisbury and the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. My object in inviting them to London was to obtain up-to-date reports on the current situation in Central Africa, and on this basis to plot the course which our policy should take during the months ahead.2.  In a complex situation certain points at least are clear:(a) In the face of widespread discontent the Federation, unless maintained by force, cannot continue for much longer in its present form.(b) For economic and also for political reasons, every effort should be madeto evolve an alternative form of association between the territories.(c) Any such association, if it is to be durable, must be based on acceptance by the peoples of the territories.(d) To achieve these aims a fresh initiative is needed.   The Federal PrimeMinister, Sir Roy Wei ens ky, has made it clear that no such initiative isto be expected from him. I am convinced that this responsibility mustbe accepted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.A Composite Approach3. I therefore propose that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should take theinitiative by sending a small constitutional mission to Central Africa in order toget things moving. (The functions of this mission are described in paragraph and the Annex.) As I suggest below, the various aspects of the relationship between the territories need to be tackled individually. But it will make it easier to handle the problem of Nyasaland if all these aspects are embraced in onecomposite approach. I cannot think of a better method of dislodging the log jam,and making people in the Federation think of, and work out, an alternative method of association to that which at present exists. It would be difficult to wait until after the Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia elections as weshould lose so much time, but of course no final decisions would be reached until after those elections. We would hold in reserve the possibility of summoning an ultimate conference.Nyasaland4. The immediate problem is Nyasaland, or more precisely the handling ofthe African leader in Nyasaland, Dr. Banda. He is at present intending to cometo London this month and is expecting, before he makes this visit, to have been told whether or not Her Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to agree in principlethat he should be allowed to secede from the Federation. If he is told that weare not prepared to allow him to secede, or if he receives an answer which he60623
regards as mere prevarication, then he will almost certainly resign: from theGovernment. In the view of the Governor of Nyasaland, there is every probability that this would lead to a serious security situation, and it is unlikely that thiswould be confined to Nyasaland alone.5. On the other hand simply to give Dr. Banda the answer he wants (andpossibly expects) would in my view be an evasion by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentof their responsibilities both in regard to Nyasaland and to Central Africa as awhiple. It would make it more difficult to pin the attention of the Malawi Partyto the economic consequences of isolation and the need to give serious attentionto the construction of some alternative form of association with the other two territories. It would intensify agitation for secession in Northern Rhodesia wherethe African Nationalist Parties are already proposing to fight the forthcomingelections on a secessionist platform. Lastly the Federal and Southern RhodesiaGovernments would react most strongly against an immediate concession of thiskind which was unrelated to the Federal problem as a whole. All this would makethe task of evolving some new form of association between the territories evenmore intractable than it already is.6. I therefore propose that it should be made clear to Dr. Banda that it remains the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that there are great advantages forall the peoples of Central Africa in a continued association of the three territories;at the same time it is clear that there is widespread criticism of the present formof Federation; Her Majesty&apos;s Government acknowledge that Dr. Banda and theMalawi Party in Nyasaland, supported by a firm mandate at the last election, arenot prepared for Nyasaland to remain within the present Federation; on the otherhand Her Majesty&apos;s Government think it right that before any final conclusion isreached about Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal from the present Federation, there shouldbe a full examination both of the consequences of the withdrawal for Nyasaland and also of alternative forms of association with the other two territories.7. My colleagues will see that this makes clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentare not prepared to consider the timing or method of a withdrawal from the presentFederation until its consequences and the possibility of other acceptable forms of association have been fully explored. But it will also be seen that to get this machinery in motion we shall have to recognise that the withdrawal of Nyasalandfrom the present Federation is in the last resort inevitable if the people so wish.Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and their Possible Association with Nyasaland8. I have referred to my wish to appoint a small constitutional mission. its first task would be to visit Nyasaland to examine with the Nyasaland Governmentand others concerned the matters referred to at the end of paragraph 6 above. Thefuture of Nyasaland, however, is only one part of a composite problem. It would therefore be my intention that once the talks in Nyasaland had been set on foot,the mission should embark upon a parallel examination with the Governmentsconcerned of the possible forms in which Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesiamight be associated (a) with each other, and (b) with Nyasaland. I am anxious that the mission should examine any ideas which may be put forward and whichmight help towards a solution of the problems in Central Africa whether economic or political. There are, however, two premises which would underlie the wholeof the mission&apos;s work; the solutions to be evolved should be such as might be acceptable to the peoples of the territories and they should be designed to preserveand promote the advantages of a continued association.9. The mission would be as small as possible. My idea is that it should consistof a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman (who would be charged under the Chairman&apos;sdirection with the conduct of the enquiry in Nyasaland) and two members, possiblyan economist and a lawyer. The mission would keep in close touch with the HighCommissioner who would be the channel of communication with Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. The mission would present the results of their enquiries to her majesty&apos;s Government who would communicate them to and consult with all theGovernments concerned before any final decision was reached.10. If my colleagues are prepared to agree to these proposals, I propose thatconfidential preparatory soundings should be taken immediately with Dr. Bandaand with the Governments of the Federation and of Southern Rhodesia. TheGovernor of Northern Rhodesia will also wish to inform his Ministers in confidence.
SECRET&quot;.3    63I will of course inform my colleagues of the results before any public announcementis made. This could take place either just before or just after the Easter recess. Ipropose to visit the Federation myself some time in the month of May.Summary of Proposals11. I invite my colleagues to agree that the High Commissioner and the governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland should be authorised to takepreparatory soundings on Her Majesty&apos;s Governments intentions. These wouldbe based on:(a) The appointment of a constitutional mission for the purposes outlined inparagraphs 3 and 8, and the Annex.(b) The method of approach to the secession issue in Nyasaland described in paragraphs 4 to 7.There can be no certainty that this approach will enlist the co-operation whichwill be required for its success. In my view, however, it does have the merits offacing the facts of the situation and of providing a channel for the re-thinking of old attitudes and the injection of new ideas.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,3rd April, 1962.ANNEXFUNCTIONS OF PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL MISSIONA Constitutional Mission will be appointed:(i) to examine with the Nyasaland Government, with particular reference toNyasaland&apos;s financial needs and economic viability, the consequences of a withdrawal by Nyasaland from the present Federation, and possibleforms of future association with the other two territories which mightbe acceptable to the people of the territory;(ii) to examine with the Governments concerned the possible forms in whichSouthern and Northern Rhodesia might be associated (a) with eachother and [b) with Nyasaland, it being understood that any such arrangements should be such as might be acceptable to the peoples ofthe territories and should be designed to preserve and promote theadvantages of a continued association;(iii) to maintain close contact with the Federal Government on the matters arising under (i) and (ii) above and to afford them full opportunity of presenting their views on all matters of concern to them;[(iv) to consider, in consultation with any territorial Government which sodesires and with the Federal Government, whether it would be desirable and practicable to effect some redistribution of functions between theFederal and the territorial Governments concerned;](v) to report to Her Majesty&apos;s Government upon the results of their enquiries.April 1962* For further discussion between the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia, Sir Edgar Whitehead.
