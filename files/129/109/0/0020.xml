Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1962C. (62) 70 Copy No.    5 011th May;m62 3li^ .  ^ni^.&apos;. -n - -   &apos; &apos;      fCABINETCHINESE REPRESENTATION IN COMPETENT UNITED NATIONSORGANISATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&quot; Competent &quot; organisations are those which have the right and ability todetermine their own membership. &quot;Non-competent&quot; organisations take their membership from their parent body. Although there is no definite agreement asto which are competent and which not, the attached list at Annex A seems generally accepted.2. Since the United Kingdom voted at the last General Assembly in favourof seating Communist China there, we ought logically to support any attempt toseat the Communists in other competent United Nations Organisations. public and Parliamentary opinion would probably expect this. Moreover, some of the organisations, such as the World Health Organisation, take decisions requiringaction which the Nationalists could obviously not take in mainland China.3. But I have received strong personal representations from Mr. Rusk, theUnited States Secretary of State, that, so long as the Communists are not seatedin the General Assembly, we should help to exclude them from any specialised agencies and other organs of the United Nations. There are arguments in favourof doing this. It would, for instance, be awkward if the Chinese seat were heldin some United Nations Organisations by the Nationalists and the communists in others. Moreover, the General Assembly passed a resolution in 1950 (for whichthe United Kingdom did not vote) to the effect that the attitude adopted by theGeneral Assembly towards the representation of a member State should be takeninto account in other organs of the United Nations and in the Specialised Agencies.The main reason, however, for the United States attitude is domestic politics,though in point of fact the Chinese Communist Government would not accept aseat in other organs of the United Nations so long as they were excluded fromthe General Assembly.4. Mr. Rusk&apos;s suggestion is that if this problem arose, we should support in the United Nations body concerned a resolution in the following terms:&quot; Recalling the recommendation of the fifth General Assembly of theUnited Nations of 14th December, 1950, that the attitude adopted by theGeneral Assembly regarding the representation of a member State shouldbe taken into account in other organs of the United Nations and in the specialised agencies;Recalling the action which the sixteenth General Assembly of the united nations took on 15th December, 1961, regarding the representation of China:Decides to take no action on any proposal to change the representationof China at this session.&quot;5. I think that we can support such a resolution; but we should have tomake it clear that we were not denying the right of the organisation concerned-60809
to decide its own membership, but were merely agreeing that it should exercise its competence in this case by deciding not to change its present composition.We should also have to say that we had not changed our belief that the communist government ought to be admitted to the United Nations; and that we were votingas we did out of deference to the wishes of the majority of members and in orderto prevent Communist China getting into the United Nations through the backdoor. The sort of speech that our delegate could make is attached at Annex B.I have shown it to Mr. Rusk and told him it was the kind of thing I thought wecould do provided my colleagues agreed.6. I hope that the Cabinet will authorise me to tell Mr. Rusk that her majesty&apos;s Government will support such a resolution in appropriate cases providedour attitude to the seating of Communist China is made clear in an explanatoryspeech.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,10th May, 1962.

ANNEX draft FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATION&quot; The United Kingdom delegation have great difficulty over this resolution.In our view this organisation is competent to decide its own membership.Competence involves the duty as well as the ability to decide a question of thiskind on its own merits and without reference to what may have happened in other organisations. Moreover the United Kingdom did not vote for Resolution 396at the Fifth Session of the General Assembly and still do not agree with it.2. The view of my delegation is that the Government of the People&apos;s republic of China, which is the Government of China, should be seated in other united nations organisations as it should be seated in the General Assembly. The general assembly, after years of avoiding the issue by means of the moratorium, had the courage last December to put the matter of Chinese representation to debate andto vote. We think that this was a proper and a sensible step and that it would bethe right course to take in this organisation also.3. It is clear, however, that the views of my delegation are strongly contestedby others. It is clear also that our objective, which is to seek a solution as just aspossible in the vexed circumstances which have surrounded this issue for so manyyears, will not -be achieved by procedural wrangles in other United Nationsorganisations. Furthermore, the Government of the Peopled Republic of Chinathemselves have indicated that they would scorn participation in the activities ofthe Specialised Agencies and other organisations of the United Nations while theyare denied a seat in the main organisation. It therefore appears to my delegationthat our efforts should be centred upon a settlement in the General Assembly. Webelieve that it is there, through a more reasonable and sensible attitude by theprotagonists of both sides, that the problem must be settled. We think indeedthat we may dilute and weaken our efforts to this end if we force the issue here.My delegation therefore supports the resolution &quot;.May 1962,
