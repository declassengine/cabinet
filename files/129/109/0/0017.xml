confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1962 *C. (62) 67 Copy No. 5 09th May, 1962CABINETNATIONAL THEATREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretaryto the Treasury and Paymaster general on 5th April the Cabinet invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to suggest to the Chairman of the Joint Council for the National Theatre that the CouhciFsscheme should now be published so that it could be submitted formally to the arts Council for their advice (C.C. (62) 26th Conclusions, Minute 6).2. The Joint CounciFs scheme was published on 17th April. A copy isattached to this memorandum. On the same day the London County Council(L.C.C.) had agreed in principle to make available two separate sites on theSouth Bank for the National Theatre and the Opera House, and had indicated that they would be prepared to make an annual subvention of  100,000 towardsrunning costs (inclusive of their existing subsidy of  45,000 a year to Sadler&apos;s Wells)in addition to providing up to  1-3 million towards the capital cost. Also on17th April the Chief Secretary stated in reply to a written Question that theGovernment would take a decision on the Joint CouneiFs proposals when theyhad received the advice of the Arts Council, to whom they were referring them.3. The Arts Council have now given their advice on the Joint CounciFsscheme and, as expected, it is favourable. The Council &quot; welcome the scheme putforward by the Joint Council of the National Theatre, which appears to them tobe soundly based, and they unhesitatingly recommend its acceptance in its entirety.&quot;We need not trouble our colleagues with the CounciFs detailed comments on particular aspects of the scheme.4. The Joint CounciFs scheme has not encountered serious criticism from any quarter, including Stratford-on-Avon.5. The way is thus clear for the Government to take a firm decision inprinciple on the Joint OounciFs scheme, and indeed a decision can hardly now be delayed. We recommend that the Government should announce their acceptanceof the scheme submitted by the Joint Council and endorsed by the Arts Council,and their intention to arrange for the implementation of it to begin.6. The first step towards the establishment of the National Theatre will be toset up the National Theatre Board, whose first members are to be appointed by theChancellor of the Exchequer in consultation with the L.C.C. It is proposed,subject to the agreement of the L.C.C., to invite Lord Chandos to become the firstChairman and to seek his advice on the composition of the rest of the Board. Thefirst action of this Board, when appointed, will be to select the first Artistic Directorand the first General Administrator of the National Theatre.7. It will be very desirable that the erection of the National Theatre and thenew Opera House on the South Bank should be planned and carried through bya single body, which would also have the responsibility of deciding how much ofthe total money available should be spent on the National Theatre building and how much on the Opera House.  We have in mind that this important task might60788
be entrusted to a specially-created South Bank Theatre Board consisting probablyof two representatives each of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the L.C.C., theNational Theatre Board and the Board of Sadler&apos;s Wells, under the chairmanship of Lord Cottesloe, the Chairman of the Arts Council. Informal soundings suggestthat a body so composed would be likely to be acceptable to the L.C.C. and theother parties concerned, but the plan has still to be worked out in detail.8. We invite the Cabinet to agree that the Chief Secretary should now (a)inform Parliament that the Government, in the light Of the advice they havereceived from the Arts Council, accept in principle the Joint Council&apos;s scheme forthe National Theatre and Sadler&apos;s Wells and intend to arrange for its implementationto begin, and (b) proceed with the appointment both of a National Theatre Board,under Lord Chandos&apos;s chairmanship, and of a South Bank Theatre Board on thebasis outlined above.S. L.H. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,8th May, 1962.
Annex to C. (62) 67SCHEME FOR THE NATIONAL THEATRE AND SADLER&apos;S WELLSProposed by the Joint Council of the National TheatreThe scheme provides for an amphitheatre auditorium for drama to be builton the South Bank as the National Theatre on a site large enough to provideroom for a proscenium auditorium to be added to it at a later date. An operahouse, to replace the Sadler&apos;s Wells Theatre in Rosebery Avenue, would be builton a separate site on the South Bank, to be provided by the London CountyCouncil.2. The Old Vic Theatre in Waterloo Road would provide the prosceniumstage of the National Theatre until replaced in due course by a new prosceniumauditorium on the National Theatre site on the South Bank.3. The Old Vic Company and the Old Vic Trust would be wound up. Anew National Theatre Company would be created which would absorb, not be formed from, the existing Old Vic Company.4. A National Theatre Board would be formed to run the new national theatre Company. The first members of this Board would be appointed by theChancellor of the Exchequer in consultation with the London County Council.5. The National Theatre Board would appoint both an Artistic Directorand a General Administrator of the National Theatre Company.6. The two National Theatre auditoria (i.e., the new amphitheatre auditoriumon the South Bank and the proscenium auditorium, at first in Waterloo Road and later on the South Bank) should be able to be made available for use from time totime by other Companies, including distinguished foreign Companies.7. Sadler&apos;s Wells would run its Opera Companies as an organisation entirely separate from the National Theatre.8. The Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-on-Avon, would remainartistically and financially independent of the National Theatre. Machinery wouldbe set up, by agreement between the National Theatre and the Royal ShakespeareTheatre, to co-ordinate the programmes, etc., of the two bodies.9.   For the financing of the scheme the following funds would be available:(a) up to  1 million from Her Majesty&apos;s Government under the national theatre Act, 1949;(b) up to  1-3 million from the London County Council;(c) the proceeds of sale of Sadler&apos;s Wells Theatre in Rosebery Avenue, subjectto the approval of the Charity Commissioners.10. The Joint Council have been informed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government-and accept-that with the withdrawal from the scheme of Stratford (whose needs for financial assistance thus become a matter for separate consideration) the ceilingfigure for annual Government subvention for headquarters expenditure for theNational Theatre and the new Sadler&apos;s Wells under the scheme, if approved, wouldbe  300,000. This Government subvention would be supplemented by a grant from the London County Council.17th April, 1962.60792
