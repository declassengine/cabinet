Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1962C. (62) 92 Copy Nq.   ^4th June, 1962.CABINETNEGOTIATIONS FOR A COMMERCIAL TREATY WITH JAPAN:SENSITIVE LISTMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn December 1960 the Cabinet approved proposals by my predecessor forthe list of sensitive products imports of which from Japan would continue to be restricted after the conclusion of a Commercial Treaty. (C.C. (60) 65th Conclusions,Minute 7.) Now the progress of discussions with the Japanese, which have enabled us to assess more precisely the effect of imports from Japan of the categories ofgoods in question, and the development of our trade make it necessary to revisethese proposals. The purpose of this paper is to seek my colleagues&apos; agreement toan amended list. This was considered by the Economic Policy Committee on the23rd May and I was invited to submit it to the Cabinet.2. The Sensitive List is intended for items where there is a clear and immediatethreat of disruptive competition if imports are freed on entry into force of thetreaty. In addition, we shall have the right to restrict imports of any type of goods which are not on the List if these threaten disruption. I am concerned in this paperonly with the items to go on the List and the length of time for which they should remain on the List. The size of the quotas to be given to the Japanese and thequestion how far control should be exercised at the Japanese end rather than a tour end have not yet been brought to the point where decisions are required from us.Advantages of a Commercial Treaty3. It may be asked what advantage we shall get from a treaty with Japanif it involves further relaxation of controls on imports. The conclusion of a treatygranting m.f.n. treatment of each country&apos;s exports to the other, subject to the safeguards against disruptive competition which I have mentioned, will enable usto normalise our commercial relations with Japan and by withdrawing Article 35of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to accord to Japan substantially the same treatment as to all other industrial countries outside the Eastern bloc.The political advantages of removing the discrimination which we have practisedagainst Japan since the War are obvious.4. The economic advantages are even greater. We want a guarantee of equal treatment for our exports in the Japanese market, which our most formidable competitors already have. Japan&apos;s economy is expanding at a remarkable rate and this combined with rapid progress in liberalisation has enabled us to increase our total exports to Japan from  29 - 2 million in 1960 to  43 -1 million in 1961, an increase of 48 per cent. There has been a further increase in the first four months of 1962 when exports were running at an annual rate of almost  50million. Some details of trie changes in our trade with Japan are given in Annex A.It is true that the Japanese are damping down their economy at present, but it isstill relatively buoyant and past experience gives every reason to believe that theywill resume more rapid expansion in due course.  We are certainly not alone in60905a
valuing the possibilities of the Japanese market. Both the Americans and theGermans have been showing much more interest than our firms have shown until recently. The Italians, Austrians and Belgians have all, like us, sent Trade missions in the last few months: and most European countries-even the French areliberalising their treatment of Japanese goods., 5. I think it in any event wrong to regard the relaxation of restrictions of japanese imports as an evil, though perhaps a necessary one. Trade will increasewhen restrictions are removed only to the extent that private enterprise here findsa demand for Japanese goods and a profit in supplying this demand. It is surelyno part of our philosophy to obstruct private enterprise in filling the public&apos;slegitimate demands. We are justified in retaining restrictions only to the extent that they are essential to prevent the disruption of industries in this country whosesurvival we regard as indispensable. From an economic point of view, we shallbenefit ourselves most by removing restrictions to the greatest possible extent.The wider the field from which our manufacturers can buy components or semi-processed goods, the better for our economy; the greater the choice the domesticconsumer has, the better for our standard of living.6. Although we have liberalised a long list of goods from Japan in recentyears, there has been no dramatic increase in imports of manufactured goods,from Japan despite the apprehensions of some of the industries concerned. (see annex A.) We shall no doubt encounter criticism from sectional interests for moving forward, but representative bodies, such as the Federation of BritishIndustries, and the London and Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, are looking to us to conclude a treaty which will put our commercial relations with Japan ona stable footing and will criticise us, rightly, if we fail to do so. 1Proposals7. The course of the negotiations has made it clear that wc shall not get atreaty unless we cut down the Sensitive List further than we have hitherto been willing to do, and for the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs I am convincedthat we should be right to do so. The criterion for retaining goods on the listmust be the immediate threat of disruptive competition if imports from Japanwere freed on the entry into force of the treaty. Where there is no such clearthreat we should not seek to retain goods on the Sensitive List; if trouble appearslater we can use the safeguards procedure to reimpose control.8. I therefore propose that we should remove from the Sensitive Listaltogether (in addition to photographic equipment which was freed last year),clocks, golf balls, most optical instruments, certain kinds of toys, some textiles and, subject to the views of the Minister of Aviation, Certain kinds of transistorsand transistorised radio equipment. The textiles to be freed do not include anycotton textiles except piece-goods for re-export. Some of the non-textile items which I propose to retain on the List would be retained only until the end of 1964or 1965 in order to provide time for the industry here to adjust themselves. my proposals are set out in detail in Annex B which compares them with theproposals approved by the Cabinet in 1960 and with the proposals which theJapanese have put to us. Annex C contains fuller notes on each item.9. I ask my colleagues to agree to my putting these, proposals to theJapanese. I cannot promise that they will enable me to obtain a final settlementbut I am sure that we shall not reach agreement unless we are prepared to go atleast as far as this, and I think we can do so without endangering any vitaldomestic interests..: - - f:     : .. .

ANNEX C , . :J,NOTES ON ITEMS TO BE INCLUDED IN OR DROPPED FROM THESENSITIVE LIST1. Photographic Equipment. Imports have already been liberalised, andthere is therefore no longer any question of including this item in the List.2. Cigarette Lighters. Japan produces and exports cheap lighters on a verylarge scale. The excise duty of 6s. a lighter in effect provides substantial protection for our industry because it forms so large a proportion of the retail price that theprice difference between home produced and imported lighters becomes relatively small. There is also an import duty of Is. a lighter on imported lighters. If importsfrom Japan were freed, the well-known firms such as Ronsons would be able tohold their own, but the smaller manufacturers would find it difficult to withstandJapanese competition; they should therefore be allowed time for readjustment and,if necessary, developing the manufacture of other goods. I propose that this itemshould be retained on the list until 1st January, 1965.3. Clocks. In December 1960 the Cabinet decided that clocks and mechanical timing devices should be removed from the list only on theunderstanding that they would be restored if the Japanese had not removed theirimport restrictions on these goods by the time the Treaty came into force. Theyhave now removed many of these restrictions, and as imports from Japan are inany case unlikely to cause disruptive competition I think that we should now agreeto drop this item. Import duties range from 20 per cent, to 33  per cent. Watchesare a separate matter; imports are controlled from all countries.4. Cutlery. Japan is a competitive producer of tableware, especiallystainless steel tableware, whereas our industry has lagged behind and needs aperiod of protection until it is strong enough to withstand competition. I proposeto retain this item on the list until 1st January, 1967, but to concede 1st January,1966, if absolutely necessary. I do not think it necessary to include silver platedtableware or minor items of cutlery such as scissors and manicure sets which areprotected by duties mostly of 20 per cent, and the definition which I propose willnot cover these although it is somewhat wider than the one suggested by theJapanese.5. Sewing Machines. The Japanese are still considering whether they can accept this item. Our industry may be able to stand up to Japanese competition in time, but a breathing space is needed; I therefore propose to press the japanese to accept this item until 1st January, 1965. I would be prepared to amend this to 1st January, 1964, if it were absolutely necessary in order to reach agreement.Import duties range from 15-20 per cent.6. Fishing Tackle. Makers of fishing tackle in this country must expect tohave to face Japanese competition in time, but I propose that this item should beretained on the list until 1st January, 1966, though here again I would be preparedto shorten the period by one year if absolutely necessary. Import duties rangefrom 15-25 per cent.7. Golf Balls. There has been some Japanese competition at low prices inthird countries, but our manufacturers have great prestige and should be well ableto stand up to the Japanese with the protection afforded by a 25 per cent, import duty.  I propose that this item should be deleted.8. Nets and Netting. The industry is highly localised (in Bridport) andextremely sensitive to Japanese competition. We must insist on retaining all types of netting on the list and refuse to commit ourselves to a final date for liberalisation.Import duties range from 20-42 per cent., depending on the content of man-madefibres.9. Optical Instruments. I propose that, while agreeing to delete other instruments, we should press the Japanese to accept microscopes as well asbinoculars for two or three years. Optical instrument manufacturers enjoy a high degree of protection from the tariff which is 50 per cent, in most cases.10. Pottery. The definition proposed by the Japanese covers all types ofpottery now subject to import control except pottery of traditional Japanese shape
and design. This is acceptable provided that a suitable method of udentifyingpottery of traditional Japanese shape and design can be worked out. The import duty is low on tableware 25s. per cwt.; on ornamental pottery it is 90s. per cwt.11. Toys. The Japanese are prepared to accept restrictions on cheap metaltoys, where their main competitive advantage lies, and ceramic toys. I proposethat we should also press for some continued protection untill 1966 for other types of toys, except those of plastic, celluloid, rubber and glass, where theJapanese will have to compete with Hong Kong as well as with our industry.Most toys are subject to an import duty of 25 per cent.12. Transistors. This is an item to which the Japanese attach greatimportance. They have so far refused to accept it at all and some willingness to compromise on our part is likely to have an important bearing on the success ofthe negotiations. Our main need is for a measure of protection to enable our industry to catch up with Japan&apos;s lead in the production of transistor radios forentertainment and parts thereof where the price and scale of Japanese output is such that it could inflict severe damage on our industry in present circumstances.There is much less evidence to show that in default of restrictions industrialtransistors would be exported here in disruptive quantities, and transistorisedtelevision sets and gramophones are not being produced either here or in japan on a substantial scale, while the quality of Japanese transistorised radio-gramophones is said to be unsatisfactory. I propose therefore that all these items,which are protected by an import duty of 20 per cent, in most cases, should be deleted. In view of the rapid progress being made by our industry I also proposethat the time-limit for the items remaining on the list (principally transistorisedradios and parts thereof) should be shortened.13. Textiles. This item presents particular difficulty. We cannot hope toreach agreement with the Japanese on the basis of our original proposal that all types of textiles and textile manufactures should be included indiscriminately, buton the other hand we cannot make do with the very limited list which they have offered. Nor can we accept any obligation at this stage as to the dates forliberalising any of the items in this category remaining on the list. I propose thatwe should press for the inclusion of all the items enumerated in columns 2 and 3of Annex B.  This means freeing the following:(Import duties shown in brackets.)(i) Cotton and rayon piece goods for re-export (nil).(ii) Synthetic grey cloth for re-export (nil).(iii) Silk yarn (20 per cent, plus Is. 6d. per lb.) and linen yarn (7% per cent.).(iv) Some man-made fibres (7id.-9d. per lb.) and filaments (20 per cent, -r- 9d.per lb.).(v) Silk piece goods of medium weight (22^ per cent, or Is. per sq. yardwhichever is the greater) and apparel made therefrom.(vi) Linen piece goods (17^ per cent.) and apparel (20-25 per cent.).(vii) Household textiles other than of cotton (20-42 per cent.).(viii) Wooltops and yarns (7^-10 per cent.) and certain wool cloths (17  percent.) (see below).It is in our own interest to free imports for re-export. I see no immediate threat of disruptive imports of the other items included in this list. The Government ofNorthern Ireland dislike the proposal to free linen but Japanese exports of linenare very small compared with our own.14. Wool. The industry have argued strongly that all kinds of wool textilesshould be included in the Sensitive List. I am not, however, satisfied that a good case has been made out in respect of tops and yarns, and in default of further evidence I propose to free them from restrictions. The Japanese have offered to agree to the inclusion of &quot; light and plain &quot; cloths and garments made from them. This definition of cloth appears too restrictive and I shall try to widenit, if necessary at the price of dropping garments where the risk of disruptivecompetition does not appear very great. However, I shall be meetingrepresentatives of the industry on 4th June, and will report my final conclusionsorally to the Cabinet.May 1962
