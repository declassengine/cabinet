Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1962C. (62) 78 Copy No.   501st June, 1962CABINETTRAWLER , SUBSIDIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and food we feel that we should draw the attention of our colleagues to the situationwhich has arisen in connexion with the subsidy proposals for the trawler fishing industry.background. The background is that last year the Government accepted therecommendation of the Committee on the Fishing Industry under the chairmanship of Lord Fleck that the trawling industry had a reasonable prospect of becomingself-supporting in 10 years if they were given help to adjust themselves to new conditions, and if in the meanwhile operational subsidies were provided whichwould be reduced year by year. What had to be settled was the starting rate forthe subsidies for the different sections of the fleet. After much argument betweenthe Government and the different trawling interests, agreement was eventuallyreached on what these rates should be. The agreement was embodied in apublished exchange of letters between the Government and the two Associations(the British Trawlers Federation (B.T.F.) and the Aberdeen Owners Association)and announced to Parliament in the Second Reading of the Sea Fish Industry Bill.3. The agreement provided that there should be a basic subsidy for trawlers,decreasing annually by between 1\ and 12^ per cent.; that the initial rates shouldbe  15 per day at sea for distant water (over 140 ft. in length);  13 for middle watertrawlers (110 ft.-140 ft.); and  9 for near water trawlers (80 ft-110 ft.) and inaddition, supplementary subsidies should be available for particular groups oftrawlers in special difficulties, subject to a total of  350,000 in any one year and 2^ million over the 10-year period. Apart from the starting rates of basic subsidy,these arrangements are provided for in the Sea Fish Industry Bill, and the startingrates are to be embodied in a statutory scheme requiring Affirmative Resolutionas soon as the Bill becomes law.Views of Scottish Trawler Owners4. The Scottish trawler owners have now told the Secretary of State in nouncertain terms that the agreement made last year is no longer acceptable to them.The Granton owners have left the B.T.F. on this account and the Aberdeenowners say that they made a grave mistake in putting their name to the agreement.Their main argument is that they did very badly in 1961: are continuing to dobadly this year; and can see no prospect of being able to operate economicallyduring the 10-year period of the Governments policy. They claim that it iswrong to make viability in 10 years a condition of assistance as this does notaPPiy; for example, to their competitors in agriculture. For these reasons theyare asking that the initial basic subsidy rates for near and middle water trawlersshould be more than doubled.60904
Views of the English Trawler Owners5. The English trawler owners, on the other hand, have adhered firmly to theagreement made last autumn and are not asking for any revision of the basic subsidyrates.Current- Position6. All sections of the near and middle water fleet did badly in 1961. Scottishtrawlers made losses averaging about  3,600 per vessel after depreciation. InEngland and Wales the overall average loss was about half that of the Scots, thoughfor some ports, such as Grimsby, and for some sections at other ports, the averageloss was higher than the Scottish average. On the other hand nearly all sections ofthe near and middle water fleet both in Scotland and in England made an operationalcash profit in 1961 if depreciation is excluded. Nearly all sections have continuedto do badly in the first months of this year. The distant water fleet made an averageprofit of  3,600 in the year to 30th September, 1961 (after providing for depreciation),but like the rest of the fleet have been doing badly since.7. As a result of these bad times some 30 small companies in Great Britainhave defaulted on payments to the White Fish Authority on loans made by theAuthority for new vessels. In all some  350,000 is owing on 90 vessels. This issplit about equally between England and Wales on the one hand and scotland on the other. If the Authority (who finance loans for trawlers out of advancesfrom the Exchequer) could be given a moratorium by the Treasury so that theycould go easy with defaulters, the situation might be temporarily relieved (though not for those owners who have borrowed from other sources) and most of thetrawlers would probably continue fishing. This proposal is being discussed withthe Treasury but in itself will not satisfy the Scottish owners.Possible Courses of Action8. (a) The Government could stand on the letter of the agreement with theIndustry and introduce a subsidy scheme giving effect to the starting rates fixedlast autumn; or(b) they could increase the starting rates for near and middle water trawlerseither unilaterally or by reopening negotiations.Views of the Secretary of State9. The Secretary of State for Scotland recognises that there are cogentarguments in favour of the first course but feels that consideration should be givento the second course for the following reasons :(a) The repudiation of the agreement by the Scottish owners is a fact that mustbe taken into account because the Government entered into theagreement on the footing that it was acceptable to all trawler owners.(b) Scottish trawlers made substantial losses in 196.1 and with the subsidiesfixed last year the prospects for 1962 are worse; these facts should betaken into account in fixing the starting rates for a 10-year period ofannually decreasing subsidies.(c) If the Scottish fleet cannot become self-supporting in 10 years a reductionin its size may be inevitable; but the process should be gradual and theyshould be given a fair chance by getting the starting rates right.(d) Revision of the starting rates now would accord with the conclusions reached by the Government on the Fleck Report as set out in theWhite Paper of last August (Cmnd. 1453).(e) If nothing is done there will be political trouble when the subsidy Ordercomes before the House.10. The Aberdeen trawler owners have said that they signed the agreementlast year under strong pressure from the B.T.F. which they allege is dominated bydistant water trawler owners. They have also said that many of the owners ofnear and middle water trawlers in England and Wales share their views about the inadequacy of the present starting rates and this may well be reflected in the debate on the subsidy Order.
11. The Secretary of State appreciates that any increase in starting rates fornear and middle water trawlers will be opposed by the B.T.F. even if fhe distantwater rate is left at  15; but their views are unlikely to command much politicalsympathy. On the other hand to let the agreement stand will give rise to politicaltrouble. During the Debates on the Sea Fish Industry Bill the Government were constantly criticised both by Back Benchers and by Members of the Oppositionfor being far too generous to the big combines in the distant water section of theindustry (and increased profits declared by some large companies this year willgive further substance to these criticisms). The Scottish owners have made it clearthat they will do everything in their power to oppose the subsidy scheme and itwould be surprising if they did not receive support from near and middle waterowners in England and Wales.12. If the distant water starting rate is not reduced and it could not be without breach of the agreement any increase in the starting rates for near and middle water trawlers would add to the cost to the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State appreciates that this would cause difficulties for the Chancellor. Doublingof these rates, for example, would cost an additional  1-4 million in the first year and progressively smaller amounts in later years. Against this could beset some savings this year in supplementary payments (paragraph 3) and in thecost of a moratorium to the White Fish Authority mentioned in paragraph 7.Views of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food13. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food considers that theGovernment should stand by the Agreement voluntarily entered into by all sideslast autumn and to which the B.T.F., representing 550 of the 680 British trawlers,are still willing to adhere. The principle reasons for this view are:(a) The present critical situation is exaggerated.   The majority of near and middle water trawlers made an operational surplus in 1961 (excludingdepreciation). 1961 is the first year for some time that the Aberdeenowners have done badly as their main groups of vessels made substantialprofits in previous years.(b) Cases of hardship could be met to some extent by way of a moratorium asproposed in paragraph 7. This, together with the contribution ofsupplementary payments, would relieve the burden where it is most felt.(c) If the agreement were to be torn up and negotiations were to be reopened,the B.T.F. can be expected to put forward demands like Aberdeenfor very much higher rates but preserving present relativities betweendistant, middle and near water vessels. This would cost very muchmore. Alternatively, those ports that have no distant water interest might agree to higher rates for near and middle water trawlers, butthis would certainly not be accepted by the other ports and might wellbreak up the B.T.F.(d) Any reopening of the basic subsidy rates for near and middle watervessels only would be a major reversal of Government policy and arepudiation of the Fleck Report which recommended temporaryassistance to the fishing industry on a basis of cost and catchingcapacity and not on need, with the objective of encouraging more efficient sections of the fleet to expand.(e) A new settlement could not be agreed with the industry unless theGovernment accept substantial increases in subsidies that would maintain existing relativities. Scottish owners no longer accept theexisting agreement. The B.T.F. would not be able to accept any proposals that vary from the agreed relativities.(/) While the Minister of Agriculture agrees with the Secretary of State thatwe are obviously in for considerable political pressure when the orderto raise near and middle water rates is. debated we can at least reston the fact that we have agreement with the B.T.F. which represents85 per cent, of the industry. If we were to break faith with them and go back on our agreement, although we might pacify certain near and middle-water interests, we would be faced with the open opposition ofthe B.T.F. which would be worse.
1st June, 1962.14. Fishing fluctuates considerably from year to year. It is unfortunate that a bad year has coincided with the first year of the new policy but it wouldbe wrong for the Government to base their long-term policy over the next 10 years on the poor results of one year. As suggested, the right way is to deal with thisby way of a temporary moratorium for individual. companies on payments dueto the White Fish Authority which, together with supplementary payments, shouldtide the industry over the present bad patch. If however bad times continue for say two or three years, it would then be time to consider what, if anything,else should be dgne to prevent economic forces taking their course.Conclusion15. We have been unable to reach agreement and we ask our colleagues fortheir views.J. M.C. S.
