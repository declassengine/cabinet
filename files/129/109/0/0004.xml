C. (62) 54 Copy No. . 5 021st March, 1962CABINETSUPPLY OF CANBERRA BOMBERS FOR PORTUGALMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should welcome the views of my colleagues on an application by the english electric Company for a licence to supply six B-2 Canberras to the Portuguese AirForce. This matter was discussed on 7th March by the Strategic Exports Committeewho thought that before a licence was granted the Portuguese Government shouldbe asked for an assurance that these aircraft would not be used in the Portugueseoversea provinces.2. I would hope that this useful order, which is worth approximately  500,000,could be approved. In particular this would help us to improve our relations withthe Chief of the Portuguese Air Staff who has been ill-disposed to us since the Goaincident. A recent study by the Chiefs of Staff shows that there are certainoverflying and staging facilities in Portuguese oversea territories which we shall needand the goodwill of the Chief of the Portuguese Air Staff may make all the difference in this matter.3. It seems to me that the export of these aircraft, which are for delivery in continental Portugal, would be in accordance with our declared policy. As thePrime Minister stated in a written answer in the House on the 27th June, 1961, &quot;in deciding whether to negotiate a sale or to grant a licence for the export of military equipment to Portugal, we have to consider her reasonable military requirements as a NATO ally. But supplies of equipment to Portuguese oversea territories arein a different category and applications in these cases are for the time being in suspense &quot; (Hansard, column 19). Although there is no strict North Atlanticrequirement for Portugal to possess Canberras of this type, I do not consider thatthe formula used by the Prime Minister inhibits us from supplying them as part ofPortugaFs reasonable military requirements. Nor do I think that there is much riskof a diversion of these aircraft to Angola and Mozambique, because they areunsuitable for low-level flying and strafing.4. On the other hand the supply of these aircraft is unlikely to go unnoticedin this country and might easily arouse controversy. We could only effectively replyto criticism if we could state categorically that the Canberras would only be usedfor the defence of the Portuguese metropolitan and oversea territories against external aggression and would not be employed in internal operations in the overseaterritories. I would therefore agree that we should ask the Portuguese through diplomatic channels for specific assurances in this sense, which we could make public if necessary.5. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that the export of the Canberrasshould be authorised provided that we first obtain the necessary assurances fromthe Portuguese Government.H.Foreign Office, S.W.1,19th March, 1962.60561Printed for the Cabinet. March 1962
