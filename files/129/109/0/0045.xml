C. (62) 9520th June, 1962Copy No.   59CABINETARMS EXPORTSNote by the Minister without PortfolioT think my colleagues will be interested to read the attached report by officials,on British exports of military equipment, which has been submitted to the strategic exports Committee for information.M.Office of the Minister without Portfolio, S.W. 1,18th June, 1962.60957aPrinted for the Cabinet,   June 1962
SALE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT ABROADNote by the Chairman of the Official CommitteeThe attached report by the Official Committee has been prepared in accordancewith the instructions of the Ministerial Committee for a review to be made of current progress and prospects regarding the sale abroad of military equipment.2. Sales diminished from  184 million in 1959 to  150 million in 1960. Thefinal figure for 1961 is likely to show a further downward trend owing to the falling off in the sales of military aircraft and ships. This is not unexpected if one takes account of the changes in the shape and size of our own forces over the last fewyears. The prospects for 1962 are not a great deal better the ArgentinianGovernment have just suspended negotiations for the construction of warshipsvalued at  25 million in British shipyards but it is hoped that this year may marka turning point, and that we shall begin to reap the benefit of German orders and sales of guided weapons (e.g., to Sweden and Switzerland). The figures for later years will depend on the success of new Army weapons under development, e.g.,the CHIEFTAIN, and our ability to secure a major share of the North AtlanticElectronic Ground Environment System (which it is estimated will cost at least 100 million).3. The United Kingdom has agreed that Norway should have the primecontract for the manufacture in Europe of the American BULLPUP air-to-surfaceweapon and it is reasonable to suppose that this gesture, which has been well received in Norway, will lead to a greater willingness on the part of Norway toplace armaments orders in the United Kingdom, particularly as she becomes lessdependent on American aid. The most promising items are the Mk. 44 torpedoand the VIGILANT anti-tank weapon.4. The report also gives a useful indication of the areas both geographicaland technical on which it would be advisable to concentrate our sales efforts inthe near future.G. WHEELER.REPORT BY officials at the first meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Strategic Exports the strategic Exports (Official) Committee were instructed to conduct a review of current progress and prospects regarding the sale abroad of military equipment and to report to the Ministerial Committee.2. Bearing in mind the tenor of the Ministerial Committee&apos;s discussion at that meeting the Official Committee have not attempted to carry out a general reviewof policy but have confined their examination to the preparation of an up-to-date and detailed statement of sales of military equipment to various parts of the world in respect of ithe years 1958, 1959 and 1960, together with an assessment of theposition for 1961 and the prospects for future years.3. Prior to the preparation of the earlier review a report setting out detailsof arms exports in the years 1955, 1956 and 1957 was issued. The statement at appendix A to the present report sets out similar information in respect of theyears 1958, 1959 and 1960 together with a detailed analysis of sales of naval and land equipment and complete aircraft for the same years by destination of equipment sold.Future Prospects4. Naval Equipment. The Admiralty estimate that the peak of naval salesbased on the large number of surplus ships of the war programme has now been passed. There is likely to be a decline in sales over the next few years but this might be partly offset by an increase in Government to firm orders for new construction,
5.   Land Equipment(a) GeneralExports from both Government and commercial sources in 4958, 1959and 1960 were  36 million,  33 million and  35 million respectively and areexpected to be around  29 million for 1961. Thereafter there should be anincrease in exports in 1962-63 and a higher level is expected to be maintained for three or four years subsequently.(b) Government-to-Government SalesOrders received in 1960 and 1961, which will be reflected in exports in1961-62 and 1962-63, were  17 million and  23 million respectively. federal german contracts worth more than  30 million will be placed in 1962, for delivery in 1963-66. In addition, other orders received in the next few years are expected to amount to between  15 million and  20 million a year.The biggest single potential market at present is Germany where the saleseffort is aided by the German expressed intention to purchase arms to offset the cost of maintaining British forces in Germany and to assist our balanceof payments. They have now decided to adopt the 105-mm. tank gun fortheir new standard tank and orders for the gun and ammunition worth about 30 million will be placed in 1962 for delivery in 1963-66.The 105-mm. tank gun and ammunition developed in the War OfficeResearch and Development Establishments have scored a marked success and are our current best sellers. As stated above Germany is ordering bigquantities. Canada, Holland, Switzerland and Israel have already - ordered105-mm. conversion kits for their Centurions and Denmark and Swedenare considering doing so. Sweden has also bought 110 Centurions fitted withthe 105-mm. gun. The United States has adopted the gun, initial orders forguns and ammunition are in course of delivery. The size of the United Statesfuture orders depends on the extent of her re-equipment and the proportion to be made in Britain. India has adopted the gun for her new light tankand has bought a licence to manufacture the gun and ammunition in India.Initial quantities of components and ammunition are expected to be orderedin Britain.Sales of surplus equipments continue at a useful modest level.Offshore purchases by the United States have declined to a small level.The adoption by the British Army of weapons of foreign origin, theBelgian F.N. rifle, the F.N. machine gun and the Italian 105-mm. packhowitzer have reduced the scope for sales. Political difficulties limit salesas in Indonesia.A resurgence of interest in British weapons is expected in 1964-65 whenthe new weapons including the CHIEFTAIN tank,&quot; the ABBOT 105-mm.self-propelled field gun, the new family of armoured personnel carriers, the120-mm. WOMBAT anti-tank weapon and the 81-mm. mortar of the armament Research and Development Establishment have been adopted and proved.Political difficulties apart, the volume of sales in the future will depend upon the merits of new weapons, tested and tried by the British Army, backed by prompt delivery and a reliable after-sales service.Sales promotion will continue to need visits to potential buyers, the enthusiasm and support of our Military Attaches overseas and adequatedemonstrations and trials at home and overseas.(c) Commercial SalesApart from the large order for Hispano-Suiza carriers placed with a Britishfirm by Germany now nearing completion, most recent orders for majorequipments have been placed on a Government basis.The trade carried on by firms from new manufacture is for the most partconfined to small arms, sub-machine guns, small arms ammunition, explosives,signals stores and starter cartridges, and is likely to continue at current levels.There is a useful trade export of about half a million pounds a year inspares for armoured fighting vehicles, mainly of United States origin, fromsurplus obsolete stocks.  This trade will decline as the vehicles go out of use.60957
6. Air Equipment. Sales of military aircraft declined considerably in 1960.The total sales of air items for 1961 are expected to be slightly less than the figure for 1960 and the immediately following years are unlikely to show any marked increase. The Argentine is showing interest in an order for 22 Dart Herald aircraft,the aircraft used by the Duke of Edinburgh during his recent South Americantour. ^    - ^7. Electronic Equipment. When the Ministerial Committee considered theearlier review of arms exports the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Aviation,made the point that for some items, notably electronics, it might be difficult andmisleading to dissociate military equipment from civil. Total sales of otherelectronic equipment have therefore been included in the statement at Appendix B.8. The two largest orders in 1959 were for Early Warning Radar forIndonesia ( 3 million) and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe( 4-63 million), while in 1960 Canada bought Army wireless equipment to a valueof  2 million.9. Sales of military electronic equipment for 1961 are estimated to reachabout  9 million while sales figures in 1962-63 should begin to reflect the newelectronic ground environment for Central Europe if the Anglo-french committee on Air Defence system is accepted by the North Atlantic Alliance.10. Guided Weapons. Preliminary export figures for surface-to-air guided weapons for 1961 appear promising. Delivery of the main equipments ofBLOODHOUND I to Sweden will be completed during 1961 and some  10,000worth of spares will be delivered in 1962. An order from Australia ( 2-3 million)will mainly have been delivered during 1961 and completed in 1962.11. Deliveries of the supporting equipment against the Swedish order forSEACAT ( 350,000) commenced during the last quarter of 1960; a furtherquantity of equipment ( 63,000) was delivered during 1961 and the order shouldbe completed in 1962.12. During 1961 orders for the SEACAT system were under negotiation with Germany ( 275,000), New Zealand ( 450,000) and Australia ( 850,000). TheGerman order was signed in September 1961. The two British firms who have successfully tendered for the four Argentine frigates have offered SEACAT. Theestimated value of the order is between  300,000- 525,000 depending on asingle or double system. Argentina is also a prospective customer forTHUNDERBIRD I and its associated ground radars. Other countries that may consider adopting SEACAT are India, Pakistan and the Netherlands while Chileis hoping to include this system in a refit programme of her two Vickers-builtdestroyers.13. Contracts have also been signed with Sweden ( 15 million) and switzerland ( 27 million) for complete BLOODHOUND II missile and radarsystems for which deliveries will commence in 1963.14. Yugoslavia has already advised the Ministry of Aviation of herwillingness to purchase one battery of THUNDERBIRD I ( 1-7 million) and itis understood that the maximum requirement is for four batteries ( 6-8 million).15. Several countries are evaluating the operational capabilities of theVIGILANT anti-tank missile along with its continental rivals as replacements fortheir present anti-tank weapons. An order for 300 missiles valued at  325,000has been received from Kuwait for delivery in the second half of 1962. The recentadoption of VIGILANT by the British Army should act as a stimulus to overseasales although the existence of similar foreign weapons may limit the extent ofthese orders.June 1962
