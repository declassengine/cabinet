Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1962C (62) 65 Copy No.   503rd May, 1962CABINETVIENNA CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC relations memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer hesitate to trouble my colleagues with what may appear to be rather smallpoints, but they involve the controversial subject of diplomatic immunity, andraise important questions of Revenue principle.2. A year ago a conference on diplomatic relations convened by the united nations signed a convention at Vienna, and the convention (Cmnd. 1368) has now come forward for ratification.3. I would prefer that ratification should be subject to reservations on two points.4. The first question arises under Articles 34 and 36 of the convention. the wording of these Articles is ambiguous, and attempts by the United kingdom delegation at the conference to clarify the text were rejected, but the ForeignOffice impression is that the intention of the conference was that the privilegesin question should be granted.5. The point at issue is whether Diplomatic Missions and diplomatic representatives in this country should be allowed to obtain British goods whichare normally subject to excise duty without payment of that duty, in the same way that they obtain foreign goods free of customs duty. A notable example isScotch Whisky, but if the point were conceded the same question would arise on other goods, including beer and a wide range of goods liable to Purchase Tax.6. The considered view of Customs and Excise is that exemption fromexcise duties, which has never been granted to any persons or bodies in thiscountry, would be a fundamental and dangerous breach of the control over therevenue from these duties. Such an exemption raises quite different issues fromthe traditional exemption from customs duties of foreign goods under diplomaticprivilege, which is deeply rooted in history, and which is based on the concept ofthe envoy being free to receive goods from his home country without customs bar.7. The grant of a concession on excise duties would open the door wideto abuse, since disposal of Scotch Whisky and British manufactured cigarettes iseasiest of all, and could make serious inroads into the revenue from excise duties and Purchase Tax. It would involve considerable administrative difficulties inapplication. A concession would not lead to any significant gain in foreign currency to offset the direct loss in duty, and the evasion of much more, whichit would cause.8. A concession might, moreover, lead to pressure for a similar extension ofthe privileges allowed to international organisations and certain of their officials.No clear end can be seen to this since to give excise privileges now, which wouldbe new and different in kind, would raise the whole issue of duty-free use in thiscountry.CONFIDENTIAL60768THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
9. The grant of any such concession would necessitate legislation and is unlikely to be well received in Parliament where the feeling is that privilege, evenif it has not gone too far, has gone far enough.10. The second point concerns a proposal that the private servants ofmembers of a Diplomatic Mission should, if they are not nationals of orpermanently resident in the receiving State, be exempt from taxes on the emoluments they receive by reason of their employment. This proposal is opento obvious objection. The private servants of the Head of a Diplomatic Missionreceive this privilege here by virtue of the original Diplomatic Privileges Act of1708; and this treatment can be defended on the basis that the Embassy itself isregarded as foreign soil. It is going very much further to suggest that servants ofother members of the Mission, paid not by the foreign Government but by thesemembers, should enjoy immunity from taxation on their pay. There is no obviousreason why they should have this privilege, and if it is granted we shall be under constant pressure for similar concessions to be made to persons employedprivately by the staffs of Commonwealth Missions, of Consulates and ofinternational organisations. We all know how these privileges spread once theyare granted.11. It would be necessary to legislate in order to give effect to the convention on this point, and I am not clear on what grounds the legislation could be justified,save that other countries took no objection to the proposal at Vienna. My ownpreference would be that our ratification should be subject to a reservation onthis point.12. I realise that these two points are small matters in terms of revenue, butI am becoming increasingly concerned at the steady flow of demands for specialtax treatment in the international field. There is considerable disquiet, particularlyin Parliament, but also in the country generally, over the growing number of individuals who enjoy immunities of one kind or another in this country.13. While I recognise the difficulties with which the Foreign Secretary isfaced, I believe that, quite apart from the revenue aspects, Parliament and publicopinion would take the view that to enlarge the tax concessions granted in the diplomatic field at this juncture would be a step in the wrong direction.14.   I would value the advice of my colleagues.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,2nd May, 1962.CONFIDENTIAL
