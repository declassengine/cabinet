Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1962C. (62) 75 Copy No.   5015th May, 1962CABINETAWARDS TO POSTGRADUATE STUDENTSMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council and Ministerfor ScienceThis memorandum comments upon the memorandum of the Chief Secretary,Treasury (C. (62) 69).2. I am concerned with the postgraduate studentships awarded by the research Councils in scientific subjects. Postgraduate student awards in other subjects are given by the Education Ministers.3. I am strongly opposed to the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal that the increases proposed by the Education Ministers and myself should be implemented in threeannual stages and I would most strongly urge that they be implemented in full asproposed in the paper. Whilst on the matter at issue between the Chief secretary and the Education Ministers I favour the view of the Education Ministers, I feelI must urge my colleagues most strongly to implement the proposals so far as concerns science and technology without delay and irrespective of the decisions on the rest of the case.4. There are 3,410 current postgraduate studentships (as against only 570in the arts) in science and technology awarded by the Research Councils. Thepurpose of these studentships is to fit first degree graduates for careers of research.It is not too much to say that the entire scientific effort of the country, in defence,in industry, in the Universities and in pure science depends on the quality and quantity of this handful of men and women. Quite apart from the value of their work I know of no other way of ensuring that we get value for money in the sumswe spend on research and development than that we ensure that these few people should be absolutely of the first quality.5. Postgraduate students are not paid salaries; it has been the policy of theGovernment to pay awards as allowances whilst they qualify. This is why theyare so low. Unfortunately postgraduate students have had no increase since 1958(the Anderson decisions referred to in paragraph 7 of the Chief Secretary&apos;s paperdid not apply to postgraduate awards).6. Since 1958 there has been an increase of 8-2 per cent, in the cost of living and over 14 per cent, in the items of the ordinary cost of living scale which mostaffect postgraduate students&apos; expenditure.7. Postgraduate students in science and technology are recruited from themost-sought-after young first degree graduates in the Kingdom. Although wehave given a salary increase to the University teachers, the cost of which amountsto only 3 per cent, of the whole salary bill, this has been concentrated at the lowerend of the scale so as to give 12^ per cent, (from  800^- 900) on entry.8. The Ashby Committee, appointed by the Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research to consider the value of their postgraduate awards, examined in detail the position of students at different universities. They came to theconclusion that the cost of living at an adequate standard for postgraduate60821
students was about the same whatever university they were attending. TheCouncil of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research attach major importance to equalising the amount of awards to postgraduate students at different universities. -9. The Ashby Committee recommended that the awards should amount to70-75 per cent, of the income after tax which could be earned by a first degreeScience graduate on first entering outside employment. Those with good firstdegrees in science, and technology are easily able to obtain employment, but it is.very much in the national interest that a high proportion of the best of them shouldreceive postgraduate research training. In the postgraduate field quality ratherthan quantity of applicants is the main objective. This will not be secured if thestudentships are inadequate in amount in relation to the rewards availableelsewhere. Many tempting offers of postgraduate studentships in the UnitedStates are now made to our best first degree students.10. The proposals for postgraduate students under the Research Councilsat Oxford, Cambridge and London would give an increase of 13 per cent. Includingthe cost of levelling up the studentships at other universities the overall increase is 17 per cent. In my view these proposals are not in any way inconsistent withthe rest of our university policy. If they are not implemented there will be serious risk that too many young scientists will enter employment, or will be enlisted asuniversity staff without adequate research training. There is already a markedfalling off in the number and quality of applications for research studentships.11. The cost of the proposals made by the Education Ministers and myselfin respect of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research studentshipsis  136,000 in 1962-63, and  285,000 in 1963-64. Except in the latter year, this expenditure could be met from the funds which the Treasury has already offered to make available to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research forpostgraduate awards in these years. I should be prepared to ask the Council ofthe Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to meet the whole cost within these proposed allocations by reducing the number of studentships. Theexpenditure of the other Research Councils on postgraduate studentships is about15 per cent, of that incurred by the Department of Scientific and industrial research.12. Conclusion. For these reasons I would most strongly urge thatpostgraduate studentships for science and technology should be increased with effect from 1st October, 1962, at all universities to: 450 per annum away from home 340 per annum at homeas the Education Ministers and I proposed.HAILSHAM.Office of the Lord President of the Council and Minister for Science,14th May 1962.
