FAY OF SERVICE DOCTORSMemorandum by the Minister of DefengjIn my memorandum of 6th April,  1962,  to the wages committee I proposed a scheme of increased pay for doctors in theServices, estimated to cost  663,000 in 1962/63.    I also set outthe extreme urgency of a decision, particularly in the case of theArray.2.     The position can he summarised by saying that if the Armycannot attract a substantial number of recruits from the nextavailable crop of newly qualified doctors, who leave the schools in June, their medical services will be in danger of completecollapse.    The only resort then would be to use the powers of theArmy Reserve Act,  1962, a highly unpopular&apos;decision which theGovernment are pledged to avoid if at all possible.3.     The Wages Committee at their meeting on 11th April   asked meto consider whether:-(a) An acceptable scheme could be devised at a cost ofnot more than  500,000 (i-.e., about the differencebetween the actual cost of the recent  &apos;G-riggTincreases and what they would cost if the full&apos;Grigg&apos; statistical increases had been applied).(b) The  increases can be presented in such a way as not to appear as a straightforward pay increase.THE SCHEMEh.     It is essential that any proposals put forward for Service doctorsshould &quot;be likely to be supported by the British Medical Association(3.M.Ao) when announced.   Bearing in mind that even my original schemefoil far short of the kind of lead over their civilian counter-partswhich the B.M.A. have been pressing upon us for Service doctors,  I am quite sure we shall not get this support unless we can offer theyoung entrant a starting salary, if he is married,  of around 2,000 a year.    This part of my original scheme, therefore, must stand.   But this means that the whole of the reduction of 160,000 proposed by the Wages Committee must be applied to.the senior ranks -from Major upwards,  and I am satisfied that it isnot possible to produce a suitably progressive scale of pay onsuch a basis.    It would mean, for example,  either than officersof the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and Colonel would get at mostincreases of a shilling or two a day or no increase at all,according to how the scale was constructed:    and this would notonly seriously prejudice the proposals of securing adequate numbers-1-0,(62) eh  -15th April,  1962 COPY NgJ g. CABINET
 of Service medical officers, but also produce resentment in the senior ranks and increase the risk of premature retirement.5e     Given the premise that we must maintain the existing startingrate and the existing scale for early years of service it would bepossible to produce a scheme which would include modest increases for senior ranks at a cost within a total of  575,000 for 1962/63.Although this would mean cutting the increases originally proposed for the middle ranks and might very well make short servicemedical officers less willing to accept permanent commissions, Iwould be prepared in the present difficult wages situation toaccept it.PRESENTATIONGo     It would not be possible to pay the increases as a separateallowance on existing rates but they can be expressed as a leadover civilian pay, advocated by the B.M.A., and introduced in recognition of the special conditions of service, for example,frequent change of station, which the Service doctor must accept and which have no counterpart in civilian medical practice.    Thiswill clearly differentiate this particular scheme from any otherpay negotiation inside or outside the National Health Service,,CONCLUSIONS7.     Overall,  the revised scheme outlined in paragraph 5 aboverepresents a lead of about lb per cent as compared with 18-g- per centunder my original scheme and against a recommendation by the B.M.A.of 30 per cent.     This scheme will clearly be less attractive todoctors but I hope that it will prove sufficiently acceptable to theBoMoA. to secure their co-operation in an intensive recruiting drive.8.     Accordingly, I would ask my colleagues to agree to theproposals outlined in paragraph 5 above7H.W.Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.13th April, 1962.
