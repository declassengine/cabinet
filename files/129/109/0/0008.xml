NFlDENTftAL        - ____gHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (62) 58 COPY NO.    ifl3rd April, 1962CABINET&apos;THE EVIAN AGREEMENTSMejnorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs my colleagues may like to have a summary of the main provisions ofthe agreement between the French Government and the &quot;GouvernementProvisoire de la Republique Algerienne&quot; (G. P. R. A. ) signed at Evian on18th March, 1962.^&apos;      The Cease-Fire.     This came into effect on 19th March and hasbeen followed by the declaration of an amnesty and the release of all prisoners within 20 days.     Civil liberties will be restored &quot;as soon aspossible&quot; and the Front de Liberation Nationale (F. L. N. ) will beconsidered a legal political organisation.3*      The Transitional Period.     This will last until the referendum, tobe held in all the Algerian and Saharan departments not less than threemonths and not more than six months after the cease-fire.    During thisperiod French sovereignty will continue and France, which will berepresented by a High Commissioner, M. Fouchet, will remain directly responsible for foreign affairs, security, defence, justice, currency,economic relations and, &quot;in the last resort&quot;, the maintenance of order.Otherwise the country will be run by a 12-member French-nominatedProvisional Executive under a Moslem President, M. Fares, and helpedin its task by a local security force of up to 60, 000 French-officeredMoslem auxiliaries and a mixed &quot;Tribunal of Public Order&quot;.4.     Algerian refugees abroad (who number some 300, 000) will be helped to return.    But all Algerian armed forces now in Tunisia andMorocco (about 30, 000 in all) will remain where they are until after the referendum, in which they will therefore not vote.5.      The Refejrejnduno.     The population of Algeria will be offered threechoices:-(i) Maintenance of Algeria as a French department.(ii)  Independence by breaking all links with France.(ixi)  Independence in co-operation with France.Both the French Government and the G. P. R. A. favour the third choice.If this is adopted, independence will be immediately recognised by france and responsibility immediately transferred.     Within three-1-
5 Qweeks the Provisional Executive would organise elections for an AlgerianNational Assembly, to which it would remit its powers.6. &apos; Independence and Co-operation (if the third alternative is chosen,which seems likely owing to the discipline exercised by the F. L. N. overthe Algerian Moslems).(i) Individual Rights. There will be no reprisals for acts committedor opinions expressed up to the date of the referendum.Settlers will then have three years in which to decide whether toassume Algerian nationality or remain French (in which case they maycontinue to live in Algeria as privileged foreigners, even to the extentof enjoying the present French legal system).     Their participationat all levels of the Government and Administration will be guaranteedin relation to their numbers, their property and employment will be safeguarded, and special courts will ensure that their eights arerespected.France will maintain the French nationality of all who now possessit in Algeria and do not wish to renounce it, and those French citizens,Moslem or European, wishing to leave Algeria will be free to go, taking their goods and money with them.(ii)    Economic Co-operation.    Algeria will remain in the Franc zone and will receive, for three years in the first instance, full economic andtechnical aid at the level at present provided under the Constantine Plan.Algerian markets will remain open to France and vice versa.In the Sahara existing rights will be respected and oil andmineral resources exploited on an equal basis under the direction of ajoint technical co-operation agency.    French companies will have aprivileged position for six years.    Algeria will retain full sovereignty,grant all future concessions and promulgate legislation coveringexploitation of the Sahara.(iii)    French Military Installations.    French forces will be allowed toremain in Algeria for three years after independence, but they will be progressively reduced, 80, 000 only remaining after the first year.France will retain the Mers-el-Kebir naval base for 15 years andthe lease can be renewed.    She will also retain the use of other bases and installations (including the nuclear testing centre in the Sahara) for five years.    Use of certain airfields may be further renewed thereafter.&quot;7*     Settlement of Disputes.    Disputes will, in the last resort, bereferred to the International Court of Justice.8.      There is little doubt that this agreement represents aconsiderable triumph for General de Gaulle.    Many of its provisions -e.g. , over military bases and guarantees for European settlers - aremuchbetter than could at one time have been expected and have only-2-
CONFIDE NTS ALbeen wrung from the Algerians after a great deal of bargaining.    Indeed,in agreeing to allow France to retain the use of her nuclear testingground, the G. P. R. A. acted in the full knowledge that they would belikely to incur the odium of their fellow Afro-Asians.    According tothe United Arab Republic Ambassador in Moscow, the Soviet Governmenthave been as surprised as his own by these far-reaching concessions on the part of the Algerians.9.      On the other hand, it is possible that the G. P. R. A. were forcedto make these concessions through fear of partition and it may well bethat the extremer elements among the Algerian nationalists have agreedto this settlement with the mental reservation that they can go back ontheir word when they have achieved complete independence.    Theremust always be a doubt whether the safeguards wrung from theG. P. R. A. on paper will prove worth the year of delay during which theOrganisation de 1&apos;Armde Secrete (O. A. S. ) grew from nothing to itspresent strength, especially since the French claim that the G. P. R. A.will now cease to function as such.10.     The main obstacle to the application of the agreement is theO. A.S. which will presumably continue to sabotage it with every means at its disposal.     But now that the French Army has at last moveddecisively against the O.A.S. and, providing that the military impetuscan be maintained, there is every reason to expect that its resistancewill soon be broken, though not without further bloodshed.11.     There have been signs that the O. A, S. have been losing theconfidence of the Europeans (on whose continued support the O.A. S&apos;position ultimately rests) because of:-(i)    Loyalty of the Army.(ii)    Absence of any effective O. A. S. counter-actionfollowing the siege of Bab-el-Oued and themassacre of over 50 civilians by Moslem troopsin Algiers on 26th March.(iii)    Discipline shown by Moslems in the face ofprovocation.(iv)   Capture of General Jouhaud and other O. A. S.leaders.12.    Reactions in France to the cease-fire have been restrained and its terms appear to have been accepted by the French people.     There is little doubt that General de Gaulle will get another large majority in the referendum to be held in Metropolitan France on 8th April to approve the Evian agreement.13,    As sovereignty over Algeria remains vested in France until the referendum, there is no question, for the time being, of our recognisingany Algerian Government and our contacts with the F. L. N. leaders and&quot;representatives&quot; will continue to be on an informal basis.H.Foreign OfHce, S.W. 1.30th March, 1962. -
