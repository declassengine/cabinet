HI:  . 151S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). C. (62) 8.3 copy no.23rd May, 1962CABINETLEAS EHOLD RSFORMMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and Minister for i&quot;Welsh affairs shall very soon have to make a statement about the governments attitude to leasehold.2.      As a result of the agitation in South Wales I invited the RoyalInstitution of Chartered Surveyors, the Chartered Auctioneers and EstateAgents&apos; Institute, the Incorporated Society of Land and Property agents and the Law Society to examine and report on the present practice of ground landlords, particularly in South &quot;Wales, as regards the sale ofreversions and the extension or renewal of long leases.3.      In order to hold the position in Parliament for the time being i have undertaken to publish a   summary of their reports.   I attach a brief summary of the first three - this may need to be expanded before publication and has in any event to be agreed with the bodies concerned.I have not yet received the Law Society&quot;s report  though they promise itdaily.4.      What the first three reports suggest is that by and large landlordstreat their leaseholders fairly, sometimes even generously.   The law society are likely I understand to say that while this i s true where the estate is still controlled by the old family, the commercial landlords &apos;are apt to operate on strictly commercial principles with little or noconsideration for lessees.5.      What it comes to then is what one might expect;    landlords differ.On the whole a good proportion seem to be considerate.   But behind the lease-hold agitation there is much more than agitation about the landlord whodemands his full pound of flesh.     The fact is that many lessees simply donot understand why rents should be substantially increased, or a premiumcharged, on renewal;  who no credit should be allowed for improvementscarried out;  or why if the reversion is sold they should have to pay asubstantial sum.   Having often lived in the house for many years, or havinginherited it, they regard themselves virtually as owners; they are shockedwhen they realise that at the end of the term they have nothing except theright to stay on as a statutory tenant.   Further, because they think of themselves as already owners, they sometimes believe the charges madeby landlords for renewal or purchase to be extortionate, even where infact they are quite generous.   And there are plainly cases in which the landlords make small effort to reach accommodation with the lessees,even lessees of long standing.Pi
6.      In strict logic these reports may not make a strong case for amendment of the leasehold law.   They do make a case for explaining toleaseholders, well before leases expire, what their position is.   But Ido not think that to stand coldly on the logic will be acceptable to our Party.In South Wales especially, Conservatives as well as Labour Members ofParliament are clamouring for amendment of the law.   Similar pressurev/ill do doubt come in other areas where there is a great deal of lease-hold property.   It has begun in Dulwich and recently a deputation of conservative Members pressed on me the need for some such changeas is here discussed.7.      I would like to promise investigation of the possibility of givingthe lessee, who has been by himself or his family in occupation for acertain number of years, the right,, in the absence of proposals for re-development, to an extension of his lease,   I think however that it wouldbe necessary to allow the landlord the option of selling the freehold to the lessee if that is what he prefers to do.8.      The rent payable on renewal of the lease - or the price if the landlord prefers to sell - would have to be at market value, with a rightto arbitration if terms could not be agreed,   I recognise that this wouldgive no material advantage to the many who are already offered such terms;and that indeed full market value would in some cases be higher than theterms which landlords offer now to sitting lessees.   But the fact of theright would, I believe, relieve from anxiety a great many leaseholderswho can never be sure at present that they will get renewal or the rightto buy.   Their present right to stay on as statutory tenants is very littlesatisfaction to them, because a statutory tenancy is not a marketableasset, and because it connotes a loss of status.   A right of renewal onarbitrable terms would also provide a method of assuring leaseholdersthat the terms they are offered are fair.9.      I am well aware that there will be difficulties in working out aright of renewal.   But I think that a workable scheme could be produced.What I have in mind, broadly, is that landlords should be required, ifthe lessee so requests, to settle terms for renewal (or sale) not less than,say, 3 years before theexpiryof a term, wherever a leaseholder or his family will have been in occupation for riot less than, say, 10 years bythe time the lease expires.   The renewal should ordinarily be for not lessthan Zl years;  the rent and/or premium proposed (or purchase price ifthe landlord prefers to sell) should represent not more than the market value;and the other terms and conditions should, be the same as before unlessvaried by agreement.   Disputes about the prices should be arbitrableand the landlord should be entitled to refuse renewal or sale if he couldsatisfy the leaseholder, or failing him the arbitrator, that he intended re-devei.opm.ent at the end of the term.   He should also be entitled to refuserenewal for a period as long as 21 years if he could satisfy the lease-holder, or failing him the arbitrator, that he intended re-developmentwithin a shorter period;  though in that event the leaseholder should beentitled to a further renewal if, when it came to the point, the prospects of re-development had faded.   For arbitration on price the lands tribunal would perhaps be most appropriate, but for the other questions the Lord Chancellor would propose the County Court;   and we shouldhave to consider here whether the issues could conveniently be split.Maybe the County Court could take them all.
10.    These proposals will do little to help the leaseholder with lessthan 20 years to run who cannot sell his lease because would-be purchaserscannot raise a mortgage on it, the term being too short.   This is a realcause of hardship;  but we cannot make building societies or anybodyelse lend money on what they regard as inadequate security.   &quot;What perhapswe could do is to provide that landlords should be required to acceptsurrender of the lease where the leaseholder or his family has been inoccupation for not less than 10 years and the lease has less than 20 years to run, provided that the landlord, or failing him the court, is satisfiedthat the lessee has made all reasonable efforts to dispose of the leasewithout success.   This would raise a question about the financial settlement between the landlord and the lessee but I think that thepossibilities are worth exploring.11.     There is one difficulty in tackling this whole subject towhich I must call the attention of my colleagues0     We refused to give any right of renewal or enfranchisement to tenants of rent-controlledhouses which were subject to block de-control.   Some of them had beenin occupation for many years.   This may well be thrown at us if we now propose to do something for leaseholders.   But I think we can reply thatleaseholders are much more generally of long standing, and are muchmore akin to owner-occupiers being ordinarily responsible for any im-improvements and for all maintenance and repair.   Ordinarily the landlordis willing to renew or sell, but what the leaseholders want is the assurance that this will happen, a drill which assures that it happens in good time,and the right to test the financial terms offered.I ask that I should be allowed to say that the possibilities ofgiving a right to renewal (or purchase) are being examined.   If this is agreed my Department will work out a detailed scheme for consideration,in consultation with the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department.C.H.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, S.

ANNEXSjummary^ ofJReports by the Royal Institute ofCh^ariered Surveyors, the Chartered Surveyorsand Estate Agents Institute and the IncorporatedSo ciefr^ of Land and Property Agents, on theworking of the leasehold system.General Policy99 years was commonly chosen as a suitable term for a buildinglease in the belief that the buildings to be erected would not last longer than a centuray and that the property would then need to be re-developed.In present conditions, however, early re-development after leases fall inis not often an attractive or even a practical proposition;   consequentlyground landlords are, generally speaking, willing to sell the reversionor to grant an extension or renewal of the lease.   There is no uniformity in policy among ground landlords;  each landlord will offer the kind ofbargain that suits his own interest.   Company landlords, for example,needing regular income out of which to pay dividends, prefer to renewor extend existing leases, whereas private landlords are more oftenready to sell the reversion in order to provide funds to meet actual orcontingent liabilities for death duties.   The past history of the estate maybe an important factor in influencing the landlord in his choice of policy;where fragmentation has already gone some way, either by voluntary salesor throught piecemeal acquisitions by public authorities, the landlordhas less incentive to retain the remainder of the estate intact and islikely to be more willing to sell reversions.2.      In view of these considerations no distinct pattern emerges eitherover the country as a whole or in particular regions.   One of the inquiringbodies did however express the view that sales of reversions were more frequent in South Wales than elsewhere.Financial Terms3.     Similarly, no definite pattern of values could be established.Examples were quoted of new leases which had been granted at rentsbetween 3 and 7 times as high as the rent reserved under the previouslease:  but such figures have to be used with caution since the comparisonwill be affected by the length of the new lease, the length of time thatthe previous  lease had already run, and many other factors.   Moreover,some landlords offer concessionary terms to occupying lessees.   Oneof the reporting bodies commented that where a renewal or extension was granted for a substantial term of years the landlord sometimes required a provision for periodic revisions of the rent in the expectation that thevalue of money would continue to fall.   There was general agreement thatit was unusual for landlords, in negotiating new terms, to allow lesseescredit for improvements carried out during the currency of the old lease;apparently on the footing that it was for the lessee to decide at the relevanttime whether it was worth his while to make the improvements havingregard to the length of time for which he could expect to enjoy the benefitof them, and in the knowledge that all the buildings would revert to the landlord at the expiry of the lease.,   -4-
4.      For renewal or extension of a lease the landlord will ixsuallyask either a higher rent, or a premium for renewal or extension atthe original rent;   it is uncommon to ask for a premium as well as ahigher rent.   The general impression was that most landlords prefer to increase the rent, though demands for premiums are commoner thanthey used to be, and perhaps commoner in South Wales, the london area, Birmingham and Liverpool than in other parts of the country.   Theneed to find capital to meet death duty liabilities is an important factor in influencing landlords to ask for premiums rather than higher rents.Company landlords on the other hand, being more interested in maintainingincome, are less interested in.premiums and ofter prefer simply toincrease rents.5.      When the reversion is sold to the occupying lessee a specialfactor enters into the negotiations, since the value of the reversion tothe leaseholder; , who can then merge both interests into a simple freehold,is greater than the investment value to a potential third party purchasingthe reversion subject to the existing lease.   All three bodies-agreed thatthe landlord&apos;s terms for sale of the reversion to the lessee usuallyinclude a part, but less than the whole, of this additional value.   It waspointed out, by way of comment, that this practice would enable the lessee to obtain a profit if he wished subsequently to sell his house-;and that the landlord can reasonably expect to obtain more than the investment value of the reversion since the sale is likely to diminish theremaining value of the estate as a whole.Mi see llanequ6.      Landlords were generally thought to be strict about the enforce-ment of repairing convenants, although their powers have been considerablyrestricted by modern legislation.   In some cases the tenant was requiredto carry out nece ssary repairs as a condition of renewal of his lease.One of the reporting bodies thought that a minority of landlords usedonerous dilapidations claims as a means of bringing pressure to bearon ignorant lessees to purchase or renew on unreasonable terms;  but ingeneral it was felt that landlords were not unreasonable in their demands andthat most claims were settled amicably.7.      There was little practical experience of the working of Fart Iof the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954, as very few cases ever reachedthe County Court;  but the Act was thought to have served a useful purpose by strengthening the lessee&apos;s bargaining position.8.      All three bodies agreed that there was widespread ignorance amonglessees of the limited nature of the interest which they held and of their rights under landlord and tenant legislation;  they thought that it was this general lack of understanding, rather than any inherent defects in the leasehold system as such, which was responsible for the widespreaddissatisfaction   of lessees with their position.May, 1962
