C. (62) 62 Copy No.   5013th April, 1962CABINETRESALE PRICE maintenance memorandum by the Lord President of the Council and Ministerfor ScienceOn 4th April, 1962, the Economic Policy Committee discussed a memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade covering the report of. an inquiry by theBoard of Trade into resale price maintenance.2. The majority of the Committee agree with the President^ conclusion thatthe economic arguments for prohibiting resale price maintenance are strong andwith his recommendation that the Government should announce that they havedecided to introduce legislation in due course in order to remove the protection ofthe law from,resale price maintenance clauses in trading contracts. It is argued that the system encourages inefficiency in distribution, which has been absorbingmanpower at a much faster rate than the economy as a whole, and that it hampersthe spread of new techniques. The abolition of resale price maintenance would reinforce action elsewhere to make our economy competitive.3. Mainly on political and social grounds, a minority of the Committee are opposed to the prohibition of resale price maintenance. It is argued that hardshipwould be caused to small independent shopkeepers and that many of them might even be put out of business. It is further argued that the quality of goods and ofafter-sales service to the consumer might be adversely affected. The Government^action would be severely criticised as favouring large multiple stores against thesmall man. It would also be said that it is too soon since the Restrictive trade practices Act, 1956 (which actually extended the protection given by the law toresale price maintenance), to make such a fundamental change in the system.4. Those in favour of abolition reply that the collapse of resale price maintenance in the grocery trade has not had any marked effect on small retailers.Moreover, consumers in general are at present subjected to a policy of restraint in incomes and have begun to demand Government action in the field of prices.Although the protests of small shopkeepers will no doubt be louder than theapprobation of consumers, it is by no means certain that the balance of political advantage would be adverse to the Government.5. If the Cabinet agreed in principle that resale price maintenance shouldbe abolished there are two main ways in which this could be done:(a) a reasonably straightforward Bill which would render the relevant clauses in existing contracts between manufacturers and distributorsunenforceable;(b) a Bill which whilst in general declaring resale price maintenance clausesunenforceable would leave room for exceptions. This scheme might take the form of permitting manufacturers or distributors to make acase before the Restrictive Practices Court for an exemption ofparticular goods from the general prohibition. If this alternative were adopted it would be necessary for the Government to define criteriato guide the Court in considering these cases. This course lacks the clear-cut nature of that in (a) above, but has the advantage of asafety valve. The President of the Board of Trade has examined its implications and he has circulated a separate memorandum (C. (62) 61)to the Cabinet.iPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 196260687
6. The length and complexity of the legislation are important factors to betaken into account. If we have to introduce legislation in the next Session to giveeffect to a decision to enter the European Economic Community, there will be littleParliamentary time available for other measures. And.if we fail to legislate onresale price maintenance next Session, we might find it difficult to fit in a Bill duringthe life-time of the present Parliament. The content of the legislative programme for the next Session is now being considered by the Future Legislation Committeeand will in due course come before the Cabinet.7.  I invite the Cabinet to decide whether:resale price maintenance should be declared unenforceable;there should be provision for exceptions ;&apos;an announcement should be made by the President of the Board of Tradein the terms of the draft annexed;whatever decision is taken on the general principle, a White Paper shouldbe published embodying as much of the report of the inquiry as isdesirable.HA1LSHAM.Office of the Lord President of the Counciland Minister for Science, S.W. 1,13th April, 1962.annex draft ANNOUNCEMENTSuggested question to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he has now completedhis study of the results of the fact-finding enquiry into the practice of resale price maintenance recently completed by his Department; what conclusions he has reached as a result of that study; and whether he will make a statement.Suggested AnswerYes Sir. After carefully considering the material resulting from this enquiry Ihave come to the conclusion that this practice favours the continuance ofinefficiencies in the system of distribution and hampers the spread of new techniques in the distributive trades without conferring substantial offsetting benefits on consumers or on the economy as a whole. The Government have therefore decided that the continuation of resale price maintenance is undesirable on thegrounds that it is inconsistent with a modern competitive economy and in due course legislation to amend the existing law on the subject will be introduced. the broad effect of this legislation will be to make resale price maintenance illegal. Inorder to assist hon. Members in their consideration of this subject, I am to-daylaying before Parliament, as a White Paper, a survey of the extent and effects ofthe practice and of the views which have been expressed to my Department in thecourse of the fact-finding enquiry.April 1962.
