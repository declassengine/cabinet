ANNEXCOMMONWEALTH ORGANISATIONS: IMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGESf) p Report Prepared in the Cabinet office at their meeting on 19th December, .1961, the Cabinet called for a further report on four points  &apos;(a) the nature and scope of the legislation required to implement theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s proposal that immunities and privilegesshould be conferred on Commonwealth organisations and their staffs;(b) how far a satisfactory result could be obtained by means not involvinglegislation for example, by attaching members of the organisations to the offices of their respective High Commissioners in London;(c) what Commonwealth organisations were already in existence or likely tobe created for which immunities and privileges would be wanted;(d) how far international organisations and their staffs had been permitted to enjoy the.full range of immunities provided for by the international organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950.Nature and Scope of Proposed Legislation2. The proposal made by the Commonwealth Secretary would involve legislation for the same purpose as, but not necessarily on parallel lines with, theAct of 1950.  The legislation Would cover organisations-on which Britain and one or more Commonwealth Governments were represented;which were jointly financed by  the  Commonwealth  governments represented in the organisations; andwhich had a permanent establishment of servants who were not responsible to any one Commonwealth Government.The principle underlying the legislation would be that the status, immunities and privileges applicable in respect of Commonwealth organisations should not beless favourable or more favourable than those in respect of other international organisations.3. The legislation would state the maximum immunities and privileges that could be granted and would provide for Orders in Council to prescribe theimmunities and privileges to be accorded to the individual organisations and their staffs within the maxima laid down by the Act. The 1950 Act is framed in that way. As Commonwealth organisations generally have no written or formalconstitution, further consideration would have to be given to the questions whetheror not a formal agreement should be required by the statute and, if an agreement is required, whether or not provision should be made, as in the Act of 1950, thatthe immunities and privileges conferred should not be greater than those requiredby the agreement to be conferred. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland would rank as a separate Commonwealth Government for the purposes of theproposal, but the Government of the Irish Republic would not.Solutions not, Involving Legislation4. The problem could not be solved by attaching the staff of commonwealth organisaitons to the appropriate High Commissioner in London:(i) This would not make the Commonwealth organisations equal in statuswith other international organisations.(ii) The chairman, secretary and other senior staff affected would becomeidentified with a particular Commonwealth country when the aim isthat they should be independent &quot; Commonwealth civil servants &quot;.(iii) Such attachment might be precluded in practice by the strict rules governing the eligibility of persons for addition to the diplomatic list.(iv) It would not, without specific legislation, solve the income tax problem.(v) It would not of itself entitle the organisations or the attached persons toany immunities or privileges whatever.
5. No one has been able to think of any other administrative device; and itis clear that no such device would meet the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s main objective of equating the status of Commonwealth organisations with international organisations. If the proposal is to be pursued, therefore, legislation is inescapable.The Commonwealth Organisations Concerned6. A number of organisations already in existence fulfil the conditionsdescribed in paragraph 2 above and could be affected by the proposed legislation.These organisations are: .The Commonwealth Education Liaison UnitThe Commonwealth Eoonomic CommitteeThe Commonwealth Agricultural BureauThe Commonwealth Telecommunications board the British Commonwealth Scientific Committee and Working PartyThe Commonwealth Shipping CommitteeThe Commonwealth InstituteThey, the Government representatives, the organisations&apos; officials and staff wouldbe eligible for immunities and privileges in accordance with the legislation. If,however, unlike the Act of 1950, the legislation excluded citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies and persons already resident here, its provisions conferringimmunities and privileges on representatives, officials and staffs would apply inrespect of two persons only, that is, one person in the Commonwealth EducationLiaison Unit and one person in the Commonwealth Economic Committee. Allthe senior staff of the other organisations appear to be United Kingdom citizensonly or resident in the United Kingdom.There is a project to establish a Commonwealth English Language Centre.If this is set up in London as at present planned, it would fulfil the conditions andwould come within the scope of the proposed legislation.7. There exist some further Commonwealth organisations which do not as at present organised fulfil the conditions, for example The British Commonwealth Forestry Conference and Standing CommitteeThe Committee on Overseas Road research the Commonwealth Air Transport council the Commonwealth Aeronautical Advisory Research CouncilAny of these might at some future date (though there are at present no signs ofthis) reorganise their finance and administration so as to qualify.Practice under the Act of 19508. The immunities and privileges provided for in the Act of 1950 representa maximum scale which under section 1 (2) of the Act may not be applied to an extent greater than is necessary to give effect to the obligations undertaken by theGovernment under the agreement whereby a particular organisation is established.The effect of these agreements is summarised in the Annex to the memorandum circulated to the Cabinet by the Lord Chancellor (C. (62) 80).Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd May, 1962.
