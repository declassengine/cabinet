C. (62) 88 COPY NO. JV28thjvdax,^1962CABINETNote by the Minister   of 1The memorandum annexed has been considered by theEconomic Policy Committee, and I was invited to circulate it to theCabinet.2.        The issue, very briefly, is that the Pacific Steam NavigationCompany have asked us for an operating subsidy for their passengerliner the &quot;Reinadel Mar&quot;, which is now running at a loss.3.        I propose to tell the Company that the Government cannotgive them a subsidy.   This will mean that the &quot;Reina del Mar&quot; willbe taken out of service and may be sold to foreigners.   This isregrettable but I think we must accept it.E. M.Ministry of Transport, S.E.1,28th May, 19620
MNEXSUBSIDY FOR OPERATING THE S,S,  &quot;REINA DEL MAR&quot;The Pacific Steam Navigation Company (which is associated withRoyal Mail Lines) have asked for an operating subsidy for theirpassenger liner,  the &quot;Reina del Mar&quot;.      They will dispose of the vessel and abandon their passenger service to the west coast ofSouth America if the Government will not give help to keep her in service.2.     A letter from the Chairman of the Company is appended.     MyDepartment have discussed the matter with them.      The &quot;Rei-na del Mar&apos;is losing about  300,000 a year,  there is no prospect of improvementin the near future and the Company cannot afford to continuecarrying these losses (Royal.Mail Lines themselves are sufferingbadly on their cargo services from subsidies and discrimination inBrazil and recently had to declare no dividend).3.     An annual subsidy of some  300,000 would thus be required tokeep the vessel in her present service.      This subsidy would haveto go on indefinitely.      My Department have asked the Company whetherthe vessel could not be used for cruising, but the answer is that about  700,000 would, have to be spent in altering the accommodation and the Company lack the capital;    moreover the economics ofcruising, even in combination with a reduced service- to SouthAmerica, would be uncertain.h*     The Company think that several foreign lines might be interestedin buying the &quot;Reina del Mar&quot;, which might fetch about  3 million.I feel doubtful whether other British lines would buy her, sinceBritish passenger services generally are already in trouble.     Someforeign lines are given subsidies to help in competition (e.g.American, French and Italian),  others have lower crew costs(e.g. Greek) or can use passenger ships on imigrant services at a lower and cheaper standard of service.     Without subsidy,  it islikely that British passenger lines generally will find it increasing difficult to compete with countries that have a lowerstandard of living, since the crew costs of passenger ships are alarge element in total operating costs.5.     Although it is distressing to have to withdraw a ship whichis only six years old,  from a service which the Company hasoperated for a hundred years, and although British prestige inSouth America may suffer, I cannot recommend that the Governmentshould give a subsidy.      It seems to me out of the question toconsider  helping with a loan on favourable terms for conversion tocruising, and I do not consider that against the background ofnational policy generally it would be justifiable to give a subsidy for the purpose of keeping in operation a regular service to thewest coast of South America.CONFBDENTIAL
6.      There is the further consideration that if we were prepared to subsidise the &quot;Reina del Mar&quot;,  it would he difficult to refuseother requests from passenger lines for subsidy.      In thisconnection, I should mention that we have recently received an approach from Cunard about their existing North Atlantic services,on which I am circulating a separate paper,      P. &amp; 0. are also ingreat difficulty in making their passenger ships pay.7.      If my colleagues agree that I must reject the request for anoperating subsidy for the &quot;Reina del Mar&quot;-, I do not think that theGovernment ought to attempt to interfere with the Company&apos;s freedom to dispose of the vessel.      The Company will be aware that  their fellow-shipowners will regard it as an act of disloyalty if the vessel is&apos;sold to some foreign line that would use her to compete with other British lines.     I would propose, however, to ask theCompany to keep me informed to their plans for disposing of the vessel so that I shall be in a position to consider if necessary,with the General Council of British Shipping, whether there is anything that other British shipowners could do to help themselvesin this situation.Re c ommend at i on s8.     I should like to know that my colleagues agree that I mustinform the Pacific Steam Navigation Company that the Government doesnot feel able to comply with their reciuest for a subsidy for the&quot;Reina del Mar&quot;, and that we should wish to be informed of their plans for disposing of the vessel.E.

Cony of a letter from the Chairman and Managing;Director of the Pacific Steam Navigation Co. to,the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of transport i have for- several months been increasingly worried about theoperation, of &quot;RE IN A DEL MAE&quot;, the working results of which havebeen far from satisfactory.&quot;REINA DEL MAR&quot; entered %he service in 1956, having been built in Belfast to replace &quot;REINA DEL PACIFICO&quot; then obsolescent.She was built for the service between Liverpool/France/Spain andthe West Coast of South America,  and is in fact the only Britishpassenger ship proceeding from the United Kingdom to the WestCoast Republics of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile, alsoserving Bolivia through Chilean ports.     She also calls at la Guayra  (Venezuela) on the way to the Canal and is, I believe,the only British passenger ship to do so.      She is primarily a passanger vessel, with acoomodation for 218 in First Class, 219 inCabin and 337 in Tourist.      She can carry, however,  about 5?000tons weight of cargo.     She is a beautiful ship and we are proudof her.Unfortunately,  latterly she has been operated at a cash loss,attributable to serveral separate and. distinct causes which Ienumerate below :-(A) The dramatic advent of jet travel, which has made seriousinroads into the business travel.which provides a goodportion of her revenue.(B) The very large increase in operational costs, i.e.crews&apos; wages, repair costs, port charges and in factin almost every single item of expenditure.(C) The unhappy situation in Cuba, making it necessary forthe ship to omit the calls there.      Havana used toprovide &quot;REINA DEL MAR&quot; with about one-third of herrevenue.      For geographical reasons this also meantomitting Bermuda, Nassau and Kingston,  each of which made a useful contribution but not sufficient to warrant the longer route involved in calling thereonce Havana was eliminated.(D) The great restrictions currently imposed by Chile andVenezuela on foreign travel, as part of the policy ofthe governments of those countries to put their financial houses in order.The situation described under &quot;B&quot; could be covered by anadequate increase in revenue, but here fares are limited by whatthe Airlines charge and by what our foreign competitors do.The fares charged by these competitors - an Italian Line and,  for part of the route, a French Line - are already lower than ours(their ships are not so good) and as it is largely a price marketwe have found it impossible to get rates up.      The Italian andFrench Lines are heavily subsidised, and the economic employmentof their ships is of secondary importance to them.The unfortunate fact, therefore, is that the ship is now operating at a loss - a cash loss - and although it is not a verylarge one,  it is greater than the Company is able to bear at this time of generally depressed trading.      The Court of Directors hasdecided, therefore, that the vessel must be withdrawn and disposedof unless we can obtain help from the Government to keep her in service.     Having, regard to the categorical statement of thew3*&quot;
&quot;Financial aid would be justified in the national interest where a particular British shippingservice or a particular section of the industryis in danger of having to be abandoned or substan-tially reduced in strength, due to competition ofa kind which can no longer be met effectively byefficient commercial operation,&quot;2. - The Pacific Steam Navigation Company has maintained a passanger service between, the West Coast of South Americaand the United Kingdom since 1868 without interruption,except during the 1939/45 war (passenger ships were kept in service right through the 1914/18 war).      The names ofthe Company and of the ship were household words thewhole length of the West Coast and their value from the angle of national prestige is undoubtedly very high,British prestige v/ould inevitably suffer were the ship to be withdrawn, and in Latin America prestige is hot anunimportant matter,3. - It is feared that if and when the ship is withdrawn,foreign subsidised competitors would step into the breachand would take not only the passenger traffic but would go after the cargo as well,h, - The withdrawal of the ship would be a noticeable blow tothe port of Liverpool, The immediate results would bethat the sum of rather more than  1+00,000 per annumwould no longer be spent in the port on repairs, stores and so on, and that 350 men would cease to find regular employment in manning the ship, but it is not&apos; difficultto see that the chain reaction set up by a move of this nature extends to every branch of the port&apos;s activities.A very small subsidy would obviate all these losses, theeffects of which would be widely felt.When making my annual trip to the South American countries ayear ago, I discussed with our Ambassadors in the different capitalsthe fear that it might be found necessary to withdraw the vessel.Each and every one was emphatic in expressing the hope that thiswould not come to pass, and fully concurred with the view I haveexpressed ahove regarding the prestige value of the ship from anational point cf view.In view of the &quot;Qo3&quot; debacle,  I hesitate to make comparisonwith Cunard, but I can say without fear of contradiction that&quot;RE IN A DEL MAR&quot; is just as important in her sphere as the &quot;&quot;Queens&quot;are in theirs;   when I had the temerity to give evidence before theChandos Committee I said, in reply to a direct question,  that anyone who could make as good a case as Cunard should have access to similar facilities,      I think the case for &quot;REINA DEL MAR&quot; is asgood.I would be happy to discuss this matter with you if you canspare the time and think that any useful purpose would be served.(Signed) Leslie Bowes-4-CONFIDENTIALMinister during the recent shipping debate in the House of Commons &apos;in the sense that the Government has no intention cf subsidisingshipbuilding or shipping, I would be diffident to raise the matter were it not for the following reasons:-1,-1 believe the case to come strictly within the terms ofparagraph 9 of the Summary of Main Recommendations of the survey of British Shipping of the General Council ofBritish Shipping (page UU) which reads as follows:-
