Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1962C. (62) 86 Copy No. 5025th May, 1962CABINETPROPOSED CUNARD-B.O.A.C. JOINT company memorandum by the Minister of AviationMy colleagues may like a report on these proposals for co-operation betweenthe British Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) and the Cunard Company.2. The scheme is for a joint subsidiary company &quot;B.O.A.C.-Cunard Limited&quot;.This would operate scheduled air services between the United Kingdom and theUnited States (bar the West Coast, i.e., San Francisco, Los Angeles, &amp;c.) plus the carribbean area, with extensions to such countries in the north of South america as Peru and Venezuela.3. The authorised capital would be about  30 million and the Cunard shareprobably 25 per cent, but not less than 20 per cent. The capital would be entirely in the case of B.O.A.C., and as to two-thirds in the case of Cunard, represented by aircraft contributed to the joint company. B.O.A.C. would put in initiallyeight Boeing 707s and Cunard would put in two 707s, plus the cash equivalent ofa third 707.  The Cunard contribution would thus be approximately tl\ million.4. Cunard have made it clear that they do not have the resources to take alarger share than 25 per cent, at the present time, but their present intention is inany case to maintain their capital investment in proportion to the growth of thejoint company in the future. The joint company would produce about one-thirdof B.O.A.C&apos;s current total production (capacity ton miles) and about the samefraction of their current total revenues. Cunard&apos;s 25 per cent, would thereforerepresent more than a merely nominal participation in B.O.A.C.5. Throughout the area of the new company&apos;s operations neither B.O.A.C.nor Cunard will operate air services in its own name. B.O.A.C. will howeverremain free to operate services crossing the area (although transit sectors falling within the area will be operated in pool with the joint company), while Cunardwill be free to operate scheduled services within Europe and charter nightsanywhere in the world, provided they do not use the name of Cunard for theirsubsidiary company.6. There would be a combined sales effort and also integration andrationalisation of selling and similar organisations in the United States.7. These and similar broad terms of the proposed arrangement between theCorporation and Cunard have been agreed by the two Chairmen and eachChairman has similarly obtained the agreement individually and informally ofhis Directors.8. Both Chairmen tell me that, although their Boards have not approvedformally, individual members are behind the scheme in principle. final agreement to such proposed &quot; Heads of Agreement&quot; depends upon a more detailed examination of the potential profitability of the joint exercise. Thecurrent view of both sides is that this exercise which is being urgently carried outCONFIDENTIAL60856 &apos;     --&apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
Ministry of Aviation,23rd May, 1962.is not likely-to change their initial views. Indeed however poor the prospects ofthe joint B.O.A.C.-Cunard company may be, it is almost certain that they will bebetter for each side than if the two operated in rivalry with each other.9. The two Chairmen have undertaken to tell me as soon as final agreement is reached. They are anxious to announce agreement as soon as possible afterpublication of Cunard&apos;s Report on 31st May. I have indicated that I hoped i could let them know the Government^ views in time for a Press conference on 4th June. If the scheme went through there would have to be a simultaneousGovernment announcement.10. There are in my view attractions in bringing private and publicenterprise together in this field. B.O.A.C. and Cunard are both great names in transport which despite their present difficulties have contributed much to our national cause both in earnings and prestige. There are also plenty of problems.My own present feeling is in favour of this plan.P. T.
