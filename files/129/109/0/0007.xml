C. (62) 5 7 COPY NO. ^30th March, 1962CABINETNATIONAL THEATREMemorandumbjy^tb^^chancellor of the Exchequerand the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster-general we think the Cabinet may like to know the present position on theNational Theatre.2.      On 20th June last the Cabinet invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to ask the Joint Council for the National Theatre, in co-operation with Sadler&apos;s Wells, the Old Vic and the Royal ShakespeareMemorial Theatre, to submit a scheme for a National Theatre designedto implement the offer made by the London County Council (L. C. C. )to contribute from the rates the additional sum required over and above 1 million to build a National Theatre on the South Bank, provided thatthe Government would make available the  1 million approved byParliament in the National Theatre Act, 1949- (C. C. (6l) 34th Conclusions,Minute 1).3.      A letter was accordingly written to Lord Chandos, as Chairmanof the Joint Council, inviting him to submit a scheme for the considera-tion of the Government and the L. C. C.     It was made clear in this letterthat the Governments annual subvention towards the running costs of thecompanies permanently using the South Bank Theatre would be limitedto a sum not exceeding  400, 000 ( 230, 000 for drama and  170, 000for opera).     This ceiling would cover all expenditure at the headquarters of the institutions concerned, i. e. including the Memorial Theatreat Stratford as well as the South Bank Theatre, and also the Old Vicbuilding in Waterloo Road if the scheme were to provide for the continuanceof performances there.   Expenditure on provincial touring would beprovided for separately.   If any one of the three organisations concerned should not participate in the scheme, the amount of annual Governmentsubvention would have to be reconsidered, and the Government wouldbe under no obligation to contribute monies for the improvement of theexisting premises of a non-participating organisation.   In any event theGovernment would not provide capital funds for improving the Old Vicbuilding.4.      Lord Chandos has submitted informally the outline of a schemedrawn up by his Joint Council.   The main features of this scheme are:--1-
(a) There should be built now on the South Bank an arena theatreand an opera house, which should be two distinct buildings, preferablyon separate sites, so as to allow room on the theatre site for aproscenium auditorium to be added in 25 years&apos; time or later toreplace the Old Vic, which meanwhile would serve as the prosceniumauditorium of the National Theatre.(b) Sadler&apos;s Wells would run their opera company independently,with the new opera house on the South Bank as their headquarters.(c) A National Theatre Company would be created which would absorb the existing Old Vic Company.     The first Artistic Directorwould be Sir Laurence Olivier, who is willing to start work in theautumn of 1962.(d) The Royal Shakespeare Company would remain outside theNational Theatre scheme.(e) In view of the non*-participation of Stratford, Lord Chandosassumes that the  230, 000 for drama promised by the chancellor would be abated by  100, 000, and he hopes that the L. C. C. might be willing to make up the difference.(f) The Old Vic building would be repaired and renovatedout of the proceeds of sale of the Sadler&apos;s Y/ells Theatre in RoseberyAvenue.5.      It is fundamental to the Joint Council&apos;s scheme that the LC. C.should be willing to provide on the South Bank sufficient space for the eventual erection of three auditoria (two for the National Theatre, andan opera house).   The Leader of the L. C. C, has let me know that,provided they are not called upon to contribute towards  the cost of thebuilding more than the  1. 3 million they have already promised, hewill recommend his Council to make available, without charge, twosites between County Hall and Hungerford Bridge.   The smaller of these(adjoining County Hall) would accommodate the opera house;  the larger(adjoining Hungerford Bridge) would take the arena theatre, leavingroom for a proscenium auditorium to be added at a later date when theOld Vic Theatre comes to the end of its useful life.   (It is conceivable that detailed study of the costs might show that it was likely to be more economical to dispose of the Old Vic site and to build a second national theatre auditorium on the South Bank straight away. )  As regardsrunning costs, the L. C. C. might be willing to contribute  100, 000a year, which would include the  45, 000 they now give to Sadler&apos;s Well6,      The Treasury have had some informal consultation with theL. C. C. and with representatives of the Arts Council,  who consider thatthe proposals put forward by the Joint Council offer the basis of a practicable scheme.     Lord Chandos accepts that it would be up to theJoint Council (or any successor body) to keep the cost of the new buildings and any necessary repair of the existing Old Vic buildingwithin the figures promised, i. e. ,  1 million from the Government, 1. 3 million from the L. C. C. , plus the proceeds from the sale ofthe Sadler&apos;s Wells Theatre in Rosebery Avenue.-2-CON FIDE NTSAL
CONFIDENTIAL ------     57.        The most questionable element in this plan is perhaps theposition of Stratford.     The basic reason why Stratford optedvoluntarily out of the Joint Council&apos;s scheme was because they were no longer willing to contemplate complete fusion with the Old Victo form a National Theatre Company.     They have however expressedthe view that the National Theatre concept should include theRoyal Shakespeare   Company, together with the Old Vic and Sadler&apos;sWells, in a national federation which in general terms would embraceand co-ordinate the work of the three institutions.Both Lord Chandos and the Arts Council regard any kind of federa-tion as completely unworkable.     The Arts Council view is that thewithdrawal of Stratford is in the best interests of the National Theatre,since fusion between the Old Vic and Stratford might have tended toproduce a National Theatre Company too large for good administration and artistic effectiveness.     The Arts Council also believe thatStratford, who up to the present have never received any subventionfrom public funds, Should, given a modest subsidy, be perfectlycapable of holding their own with a National Theatre Company, atleast so far as activities at Stratford-on-Avon are concerned.    the arts Council would not, we gather, feel under any obligation tosifcb&amp;i&amp;lse   Stratford&apos;s operations in London, which are of course a recent innovation.8.        We do not think we should let the non-participation ofStratford worry us, but we must recognise that if the Government indue course announces its approval of a National Theatre schemewhich excludes Stratford, there may well be some criticism from them and their sympathisers.    However, experience strongly suggeststhat it would not be possible to devise a National Theatre schemewhich would please everybody.9.        Nor do we think that the National Theatre scheme - as it isnow taking what may be its final shape - can be criticised on thescore that it will be at the expense of the provinces.    As mentionedin paragraph 3, the subsidy figures quoted in the invitation toLord Chandos are not intended to cover provincial touring by theNational Theatre Company, which would be provided for separately;and, as our colleagues will know, the Arts Council have also been promised an additional  150, 000 a year, starting in 1962/63 for thebenefit of provincial theatres.10.       As yet all consultations with Lord Chandos, the L. C. C. andthe Arts Council have been informal and confidential.     The stage hasnow been reached when we should submit the Joint Councils proposalsformally to the Arts Council, as the body to which the Governmentlook for advice in this field.     The Arts Council would in turn wishto consult their Drama Fanel, and at that stage it is unlikely thatthe matter could continue to be kept confidential.     It might thereforebe best for the Joint Council to publish their scheme without further delay, and we now propose, subject to the agreement of the L, C. C. ,to suggest to Lord Chandos that this should be done.-3-CO H FS DE NTS AL
11.       Meanwhile the Government would remain finally uncommitted.If, as will almost certainly happen, the Arts Council endorse the joint council&apos;s scheme, it would thereafter be difficult for the Governmentto avoid undertaking an early and definite commitment.    Planning ofthe buildings is bound to take some time, and it is unlikely that anyof the Exchequer&apos;s  1 million v/ould be required before 1963/64 atearliest.12,       We invite the Cabinet to agree (a) that the Chief Secretary,Treasury should suggest to Lord Chandos that the Joint Council Isscheme should be now published, and (b) that the Chief Secretary,Treasury should submit it formally to the Arts Council for their advice.S.
