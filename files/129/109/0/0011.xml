Printed for the Cabinet. April 1962C. (62) 61 Copy No.    5013th April, 1962CABINETRESALE PRICE maintenance memorandum by the President of the Board of trade at the meeting of the Economic Policy Committee on 4th April, 1962, 1 was invited to circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum examining the implications ofprohibiting resale price maintenance, but with a provision for exemptions inparticular cases to be obtained by application to the Restrictive Practices Court;suggesting the criteria which might be laid down; and estimating the length and complexity of the legislation required.Suggested procedure and criteria2. In Annex A to this paper, I have outlined the procedure which might beadopted if we were to decide that applications to maintain or to impose resale price maintenance should be judged by the Restrictive Practices Court. Annex Bsets out a provisional indication of the criteria which the Court might be requiredto apply. I estimate that a Bill to make resale price maintenance illegal subject toany exceptions granted by the Court under this procedure might contain about10 clauses.Difficulty of devising satisfactory criteria3. The proposal that applications to maintain resale price maintenanceshould be judged by the Court according to criteria laid down in the law, implies that we can foresee cases in which the continuation of this practice may be justifiable. On economic grounds I am myself by no means satisfied that this is so.Nor do I find it easy to visualise, still less to define, the circumstances in which itwould be necessary and proper to make exceptions for social or other non-economic reasons. Once, however, we make provision for any exceptions we shall, as I see it, be under almost irresistible pressure to add additional criteria on &quot; analogous &quot;grounds.Legislative problems4. If, as I believe to .be necessary, the criteria are drafted in such a way asto make it unlikely that many, if indeed any, applications to the Court will succeed,we must expect strong opposition in Parliament. There will be endless scope forthe proposal of wrecking amendments and a Bill embodying such proposals mustbe expected to take up a good deal of parliamentary time. Even so it wouldprobably not emerge without substantial amendment which might mean that resale price maintenance would, in practice, be allowed to continue in its present form.Debate over each of the criteria in the Bill and in proposed amendments to it would inevitably be prolonged by the knowledge that under the Restrictive Trade PracticesAct, 1956, experience has shown that the likelihood that a registered agreement willbe justifiable under any of the criteria laid down in Section 21 of that Act is small.5. I recognise that the strength of opposition to a Bill which made no provisionfor exceptions would be even greater. I believe, however, that we should be onmuch stronger ground if we took our stand on the principle that resale price60684
maintenance is in all cases undesirable than if we conceded from the outset the needfor exceptions in particular cases and were then forced to accept additional criteria probably of a wrecking character-in Committee. Certainly a Bili which did not make provision for exceptions could be much shorter (say three clauses), could beintroduced much sooner, and would require a good deal less parliamentary time.Other difficulties about this approach6. There is the further point that under any Court procedure involving strictand meaningful criteria, the likelihood is that only the biggest and best organisedof the industries concerned would, in practice, have the financial and other resources to mount a case which would be successful. We should have to face the criticism that the procedure inevitably favoured -those who had least need of special protection.7. Under a system of particular exemptions from the general prohibition,there is also the problem of the status of existing resale price maintenance practicespending any determination by the Court. Whereas the number of RestrictiveTrading Agreements affected by the present Restrictive Practices legislation hasbeen reasonably manageable the number of manufacturers who carry on resale price maintenance practices (and who would wish to continue to carry on such practicesif any possibility existed) is probably very great. It might well therefore be several years before the Court could examine all applications which it received, even if theCourt procedure were relatively simple and if a proportion of the. applications wereto be withdrawn after a few &quot; test cases &quot; had been heard by the Court.Possible alternative approaches(a) An &quot; administrative tribunal &quot;8. In the light of these difficulties I have considered whether some alternativeprocedure might be more satisfactory than a provision for reference to the restrictive Practices Court. Some of the problems might be removed if applications were to be considered departmentally or by some advisory committee. The natureof the circumstances which it would be relevant to take into account in particular cases would in many ways make the task of judging applications more suitablefor an administrative than a judicial body. There still remains, however, theproblem of devising and defending against pressure for extension the criteriaagainst which applications are to be judged. There is also the additional problemof &quot;appeals&quot; and political pressures. My conclusion is that this alternativeapproach would not materially simplify the legislative problem and would leadto an exemption system which could be politically embarrassing.(b) Exemption for specified classes of goods9. In theory we could also qualify the general prohibition by excluding fromthe outset particular classes of goods (e.g., books) where it may be plausibly arguedin Parliament that there are special reasons for the continuation of price fixing.The main difficulty here is that I do not think we could devise a list of this kind which would be defensible and even if we provided for additions to the list byOrder in Council procedure we should inevitably have protracted debate in committee on the list itself and on the criteria by which applications for additionsare to be judged. This approach again involves a fairly lengthy and controversialBill.Conclusions10.   To sum up, there are, as I see it, the following possibilities:(a) A general prohibition of resale price maintenance with provision forexceptions approved by the Restrictive Practices Court.This would require the longest Bill (about 10 clauses) and wouldinvolve much controversy about the criteria.(b) A general prohibition with provision for exceptions approved by an administrative tribunal.This would require only a slightly shorter Bill and would be just as controversial as (a).
(c) A general prohibition with provision for exemption of scheduled classesof goods. &apos; &apos; .The Bill would be a good deal shorter but it would be difficultto draw up a satisfactory and defensible schedule. Any provision aboutamendment of the schedule by order in Council would give rise to.similar controversy as under (a) and (b).(d) A general prohibition without exceptions.This would require only a very short.Bill. The controversy wouldbe short and sharp but there need be no protracted debate.11. My own conclusion is that the only approach which could be embodied in a short Bill which could be introduced at an early date is a general prohibitionof resale price maintenance with no exceptions. On economic grounds I alsobelieve this to be the right and most defensible course. An approach embodyingprovisions for reference to the Restrictive Practices Court would be technicallypracticable, but would involve rather complicated legislation. Moreover, if itwere to have the broad effect of making it very difficult for these practices tocontinue, save in the most exceptional circumstances, such legislation would belittle less controversial and much more expensive in Parliamentary time than a comprehensive prohibition.F.

ANNEX APOSSIBLE PROCEDURE INVOLVED IN. APPLICATIONS TO the restrictive PRACTICES COURT TO LEGALISE CERTAINRESALE PRICE MAINTENANCEThe Committee have suggested that resale price maintenance should be prohibited, but that provision should be made enabling persons to apply to the restrictive Practices Court for exemption from this prohibition.Such applications would probably necessitate the following procedures:(a) Any person imposing resale price conditions in relation to goods supplied by him would have to notify the fact to the Registrar specifying thegoods or classes of goods concerned, and the persons affected by theconditions. The practice would not be unlawful unless and untildeclared by the Restrictive Practices Court to be contrary to the publicinterest.(b) It would be the duty of the Registrar to bring each case before the restrictive Practices Court. In references to the Court the practicewould be presumed to be contrary to the public interest unless theparty concerned established to the contrary by reference to specifiedcriteria (see Annex B).(c) The procedure would involve the delivery of pleadings setting out theground or grounds upon which the application is founded and the registrar^ rejoinder. There would be provision for discovery andexamination of records as is the case under the Act of 1956.April 1962.ANNEX BCRITERIA FOR THE RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES court the imposition or maintenance of resale price conditions can be authorised by the Restrictive Practices Court for a period not exceeding [2] years, which couldbe extended for one or more similar periods on further application to the Court,provided that it is satisfied that it is necessary to provide:(a) facilities or services without which there would be danger to the life orhealth of the buyer or of some third party; or(b) a sufficiently large number of points of distribution for a product the widedistribution of which is desirable in the interests of the intellectualand cultural life of the community; or(c) a measure of protection against the sale of a product by a retailer at orbelow the cost to him solely for the purpose of advertising and not for the purpose of making a profit on sales of that product;and provided that the Court is further satisfied that the imposition or maintenanceof those conditions is not unreasonable having regard to the balance between the considerations set out above, and any detriment to the persons subject to theconditions or to the public, resulting or likely to result from the operation of theconditions.April 1962.
