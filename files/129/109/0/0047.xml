ARTICLE VIII CONSULTATIONS WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM, 1962Final Statement by the Managing DirectorI should like to begin my remarks this afternoon, Mr. Chairman, by expressingour satisfaction at the results already achieved thanks to your efforts to overcome1 the difficulties which were apparent at the time of the last Article VIII discussions.Since then the world situation has, in a number of ways, been favourable for theUnited Kingdom. Rising, costs on the continent of Europe have helped tostrengthen this country&apos;s competitive position, and there has been a slight fall in import prices. Moreover, Western European countries have continued to increase their imports, and the level of activity in the United States has risen. The resolutepolicies you initiated last July have made it possible for you to take advantage ofthose favourable conditions. The balance of payments, which is the focal pointof our discussions, has improved, both on current and capital account, and theposition of sterling has been strengthened.Domestic policies are of course at least as important as external factors in determining the balance of payments position and we have therefore given themconsiderable attention in our discussions. We are in full agreement with your two main policies: first, that of preventing the pressure of demand from againbecoming excessive and, second, that of keeping the growth of money incomeswithin the long-term rate of growth of production. The success of these policiesis essential to a strong balance of payments position and also to the achievement of steady and sustainable growth. In this connexion the review you areundertaking, including work to be done by the National Economic development council, of specific obstacles to growth should be of considerable value; we hope. forthright action will be taken to eliminate these obstacles, including factors whichhamper the growth of productivity, eyen if this means overcoming a certain amountof opposition from sectional interest.Even under present policies, a substantial increase in demand seems likelythis year. Exports are rising, and should go on rising. Public investment willbe higher, though private investment has levelled off, after the large increases in capital expenditures by manufacturing industry during the previous two years.Personal consumption is expected to rise substantially. We see no reason to challenge your view that gross national product can rise sufficiently to meet allthese demands. Past investments have added to productive capacity, the increasein the work force will be larger than usual, and you have told us that there is sufficient slack in labour supplies to permit the needed increase in productivity.We would hope that this more rapid expansion of output in 1962 will in due courseencourage manufacturers to increase their spending on capital equipment; theincrease in public and private consumption will in any case have to be carefully watched, so that conditions of excess demand are not allowed to reappear. It is,of course, particularly important that room should be found for a high level of productive investment.I mentioned last year that in my view the United Kingdom economy had now exhausted the margin in costs and prices which it obtained from the devaluation in 1949, and I therefore welcome the importance which you nowattach to achieving, by appropriate methods, moderation in the increase of money incomes. Although this country may be helped by rising costs abroad, it wouldnot be safe to rely on that alone for strengthening the competitive position.Incomes policy has so far taken the form, first, of the so-called &quot; pay pause &quot;,which seems to have achieved its main aim of giving a breathing space and,second, of the publication of the White Paper in February, which has been followed by a distinct slowing down in the rise of labour costs as compared with conditions before the &quot; pay pause &quot;. The third stage is now being worked out.While results so far have not been dramatic, I believe that what has been achieved in the last twelve months is a constructive development. But further efforts are needed, especially with regard to incomes in the private sector. Bothsides in wage negotiations should find it helpful to receive official guidance onthe size of the increases that are regarded as compatible with price and coststability, and I should also hope that economic conditions will be such as toencourage compliance by both sides.  A policy of maintaining the average level of
demand at a lower level in relation to the gross national product than hasprevailed on occasions in the past, so that profits are not too easily earned, is animportant ingredient of incomes policy. Each country must decide for itself, inthe light of its social framework as well as its economic institutions, how best to tackle this difficult issue. The experiences of other countries with this problemmay be instructive, and I hope that consideration will be given to more specificaction by the Government than you have perhaps been willing to contemplate inthe past.Another critical issue is the control over the growth of public expenditure.The budget for 1961-62 was on the whole a conservative one though the outcome an overall deficit of. 211 million was not as good as had been expected owingto the presentation of large supplementary estimates. The budget for 1962-63,which was designed to give no further stimulus to the economy, provides for an overall deficit of  74 million and is not expected to lead to any rise in marketabledebt. On the assumption that the budget figures are not upset by supplementary estimates, the policy regarding the Governments finances may be characterisedas restrained. None the less, it did not prove possible to keep the increase insupply expenditure within the limits set by the Chancellor last July, and it is apparent that the effort to bring the growth of public expenditure into line withthe increase in national resources is running into difficulties. For the healthydevelopment of this country, both internally and with regard to its internationalposition, I believe that a reduction in the ratio of public expenditure to gross national Product would be of great benefit. I recognise that the public pressure for increases does not make this an easy task. I know too that certain public expenditure, e.g., the investments of some nationalised industries, must be favourably considered, because they contribute to the productive capacity of the economy. But it is clear that there is a substanial amount of non-productiveexpenditure which subtracts resources from the economy that might otherwise beused for investment or exports and adds to the burden of taxation. It is theseexpenditures which need particular attention. If an increase in public expenditure is inevitable in 1963-64, the aim should be, at least, a much smaller increase than this year. The fulfilment of this aim should, incidentally, make it easier, on therevenue side, to continue the policy of keeping the budget in rough overall balance.It cannot be overlooked that some other countries will seek to reduce the heavy burden of taxation. It is my considered opinion that for this and some othercountries, the high level of Government expenditure is an obstacle to the achievement of a desirable rate of sustained growth.The task of the monetary authorities was made easier in the last fiscal year bythe fact that the overall deficit was financed without any increase in marketabledebt, and the same should be true in 1962-63. At the moment the demand for credit is not strong, and the liquidity position of the banks seems now comfortableenough to enable them to meet the reasonable credit needs of the economy as itexpands. Action has been taken in the last few days to reduce the special depositratio and to ease the restrictions on hire purchase, and we think that now it wouldbe wise to wait and see how the situation develops before embarking on furtherrelaxations. I fully agree with the statement in one of your answers that &quot; withthe external position still far from secure in the longer term, and the new departuresin longer-term economic policy initiated since last July still only in an early and experimental stage, it would be foolish to risk undue acceleration in the pace of expansion &quot;.   This, indeed, seems to me applicable to all aspects of policy just now.Coming now to the balance of payments, we can welcome developments since last July. The current account has improved steadily, with a fall in imports, and exports rising in recent months. The position on capital account has also been better since last July, and the favourable balance of monetary movements has meant that about half of the drawing made on the Fund could be repaid. Theserepayments have been in accord with the concept of the revolving use of the Fund&apos;resources by which a country repays as its problems are resolved. Although it is always difficult to predict the future, there seems to be a good prospect of further improvement in external payments in 1962. The availability of capacity, and a slightly stronger competitive position, should enable this country to take advantageof reasonably good conditions in world markets, and an increase in exports of5 per cent, over the 1961 level should be within its grasp.   Imports are not expected
to rise and, with a reversal of the recent deterioration in the private invisibleaccount, the current account should show a surplus large enough to cover the netlong-iterrh capital outflow. However, the expected trend in output suggests that imports will begin to rise, if not in 1962, in the following year, so that I do not think you will be able to relax the efforts to make the economy more competitive.Cyclical conditions may well be favourable over the coming months, and a further large increase in exports will be needed in 1963, if the objective, which we regard as a minimum objective, of maintaining a balance in monetary movements over thecycle is to be achieved.I myself agree with your intention to liberalise capital movements further asconditions permit and hope that any steps in this direction will be on a world-widebasis. The substantial amount of foreign aid given by the United Kingdom is animportant contribution to the development programmes of the poorer countries,though I recognise that the pressing claims for more aid have to be reconciled withthe needs of your own balance of payments position. The increased inflow ofcapital into (the United Kingdom is a comparatively new development, and we havebeen interested to learn of the.emphasis you place on domestic financial policy in trying to influence this inflow; I hope that in implementing this policy, you &quot;willkeep in mind its implications for the balance of payments of those countries fromwhich the funds emanate as well as the requirements of the United kingdom economy and that you will allow market forces to operate.So far as the Fund is concerned, it will naturally continue to be ready to makefinancial assistance available to you, in accordance with Fund policies, should youfeel the need for it. I have mentioned above the desirability of consolidating thecurrent account position, and it is important that, while this task is being carriedout, the sterling position should be seen to be strong enough to withstand pressures on the short-term capital position caused by external factors. Uncertainties aboutthe United States balance of payments, and the possible effects of developments inthe negotiations with the European Economic Community, make it vital that sterling,as an international currency, should be defended, and we wish to support yourefforts in that direction.I will close by making one or two observations on your present exchange andtrade arrangements. We appreciate the determination you have shown, even inthe difficult days of last summer, to preserve a regime of freedom for current tradeand payments; and we hope that you will in the not too distant future be able toget rid of the remaining discrimination in your import system, including that against japan. I understand that my colleagues have already discussed with you the new arrangements for channelling certain direct investments through the switch dollarmarket. For myself, I hope you will keep a careful eye on the way this marketdevelops. If the rates in it were to diverge substantially from parity, adverse effectsmight be felt on the stability of sterling, and it might then be wise to consider puttingthese transactions into the official market.Mr. Chairman, I should like to thank you, and all the United kingdom representatives who have taken part in our discussions, for the candid way in which you have approached these consultations. It has been a pleasure for us to be inLondon again, and I look forward to continued and close collaboration between theFund and the United Kingdom Government.June 1962.
