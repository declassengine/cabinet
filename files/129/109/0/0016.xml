Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1962C. (62) 66 Copy No.   Ej Q8th May, 1962CABINETTHREAT OF DOCK strike memorandum by the Attorney general at their meeting on the 1st May, the Cabinet invited me to consider the legalimplications of a proposal to use service manpower, in the event of - a national dock strike, not only for the unloading of perishable foodstuffs and essential supplies, but for the maintenance of fuller port services including the loading of priority goods for export (C.C. (62) 29th Conclusions, Minute 1).2. The Admiralty, Army Council and the Air Council may by order authorisethe employment of officers and men of Her Majesty&apos;s Forces in agricultural work or such other work as may be approved in accordance with instructions issued bythe Admiralty, the Army Council or the Air Council as being urgent work ofnational importance. (The Emergency Laws (Repeal) Act, 1959 S.2 and 2ndSchedule Part C.) The Admiralty, Army Council and Air Council are entitled to regard the employment of troops for loading vessels as of urgent national importance, and if they do, provided that the necessary instructions and orders are given, there can be no doubt that the employment of troops on such work islawful.3. Troops can, under the provisions of the Emergency Laws (Repeal) Act,1959, be so employed and employed on unloading without any Proclamationunder the Emergency Powers Act, 1920. But a Proclamation will be necessaryin order to enable Regulations to be made to provide for billeting.4. I have considered the draft Regulations prepared in 1958. Bearing inmind that the Regulations only continue in force for seven days unless a resolution is passed by both Houses providing for their continuance, it is obviously desirableto avoid a series of parliamentary debates by making all the Regulations that maybe required at the same time.5. I feel, however, that I should draw attention to Regulation 2 which provides for the suspension of the Dock Labour Scheme and the employment ofwhat would be called &quot; scab labour &quot;. Such employment would not take place without the authority of the Minister of Transport but I draw attention to this as taking power to employ such labour may perhaps be regarded as likely to have repercussions extending beyond the docks.R. E. M.-B.Law Officers&apos; Department, W.C. 2,7th May, 1962.60786CONFIDENTIAL
