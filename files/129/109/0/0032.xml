Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1962C. (62) 82 Copy No. gQ23 rd May, 1962CABINETCO-OPERATION WITH FRANCE IN BUILDING A SUPERSONICAIRLINERMemorandum by the Minister of aviation the purpose of this note is to inform my colleagues of the current position ofthis project and the steps which I propose witn a view to submission of recommendations to the Cabinet in a few weeks&apos; time.2. The question whether or not Britain should participate in a project ofthis kind raises a number of complex technical, economic and political issues, whichwill require further time for proper consideration. Officials are now studying themand I am not asking my colleagues to express a view here and now. But I shall need a decision before long.3. Prior to the recent resignation of M. Buron, the French Minister ofTransport, I had gone a long way towards agreeing with him a possible plan forsharing on a 50:50 basis a project for the development of an aircraft of light alloyconstruction, designed to carry about 100 passengers with a cruising speed ofabout Mach 2-2. Such a plan was ad referendum Governments but the&quot;FrenchCabinet had already approved in principle the development of such an aircraft andhad authorised substantial funds to be committed during the next two years. Itwill be necessary to make our own position clear to the French as soon as possible.4. I suggest that it would be both convenient and appropriate to refer thematter first to a small group of Ministers most closely concerned. The Committeeon Civil Scientific Research and Development would appear to be a suitable forumin which to consider the problem, and its Chairman, the Minister without Portfolio,is, I understand, agreeable to this course.5.   I invite my colleagues to note the action proposed.P. T.Ministry of Aviation, W.C. 2,22nd May, 1962.
