Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1962C. (62) 69 Copy No. 5 011th May, 1962CABINETAWARDS TO STUDENTSMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general  feel I must ask for consideration by the Cabinet of certain proposals by theLord President and the Education Ministers for an increase in the awards tostudents at universities, Colleges of Advanced Technology, teacher training colleges, etc. These were discussed at the Education Policy Committee on 3rd May, and at the Committee&apos;s request a subsequent discussion took place between the Lord President, the Minister of Education and myself. The financial effect of the recommendations made by the Lord President and the EducationMinisters is described below, and a summary of the financial provision for the universities as a whole is in the Annex to this paper.2. Undergraduate Awards. The cost to public funds of awards to under-graduates and those on comparable higher education courses is  39-3 million inthe academic year 1962-63, and it is proposed to make increases which would raise this by  6-6 million. This, I understand, represents the cost (0-4 million)of bringing up the rates of award in Scotland to the existing levels in England andWales, and then applying to all awards an average increase of something over15 per cent.3. Postgraduate Awards. The awards for postgraduate studentships nowtotal nearly  1-9 million. The cost of the proposals has been worked out by theLord President and the Education Ministers in terms of the additional cost inthe financial year 1962-63, which will only contain some of the grant instalmentsat any new rate. Relating the cost to a full academic year, as has been done withthe undergraduate awards, the proposed increases of 17^ per cent.-25 per cent,would cost over  0 - 3 million.4. The proposals result from a review by the Standing Advisory Committeeon Grants to Students, which was asked last year to review the rates of maintenancegrants, which had not been reviewed since 1958. For undergraduates, theCommittee&apos;s proposals would have increased the cost by 28 per cent. Part of theincrease is justified by the increase in prices since 1958 of the items in students&apos;budgets (ascertained at 14 per cent.), and part on the ground of other improvements,notably a levelling of Redbrick to Oxford and Cambridge standards, and other institutions of higher education to the standard of the universities. TheEducation Ministers&apos; proposal, a 15 per cent, increase (about half the Committee&apos;recommendation), does not in itself seem unreasonable in relation to the previousbackground of policy on this matter. The proposals for postgraduate awards(representing average increases of 17-1- per cent, by Research Councils and 25 percent, by Education Departments) appear more generous, giving, for example,increases of 32 per cent, for Redbrick students, but I understand that the lord president is satisfied that they are fully justified.5. For my part I am not disposed to quarrel with these proposals in detail,as a development of past policy. If it is deliberately decided as a matter of social policy, without calculating the ultimate total cost, that all students should be60804
given grants subject only to a specified qualification and a parental means testwhich now affects only high-income parents: that the real value of these grants should be maintained: that there should be a rapid levelling-up to Oxford and cambridge standards of awards at other universities and within the whole of full-time higher education; and that we should do this regardless of the rate of expansion of the number of students or the other costs involved in the growth of higher education: then I cannot fault the figures.6. But I must tell my colleagues, from the point of view of my responsibilitiesboth for universities and for public expenditure, that this seems to me to beleading us into inconsistencies and wrong priorities.7. First, the decisions in November 1960 on the Report of the Committee onGrants to Students under the Chairmanship of Sir Colin Anderson (Cmnd. 1051),increased the cost of university awards to public funds by over one-third. In1961-62 this cost was  25 million (compared with the pre-Anderson basis of 18^ million), double the 1956-57 figure of  12-7 million. The plain fact is thatthis gives us a grant system more comprehensive and generous than any other inthe Western world. 93 per cent, of university students in England and Wales, andmore in Scotland, receive grants. In France, Germany and Holland only about one-quarter of students get awards at all following a means test, some by way of grant and some by way of loan. In Sweden, most students live partly on grantsbut more usually on loans. In the United States the overwhelming majority liveon their earnings and parental resources, though grants are increasing. Even atpresent scales I do not find it easy to believe that any material number of ourstudents is in serious hardship, though I fully agree that some do not find thingseasy.8. Secondly, the Government have had to take difficult decisions on universitypolicy, which have involved us in much controversy. This has turned on the quinquennial grants, on the universities&apos; capital programme, and on unversity teachers&apos; pay. The additional cost to public funds of the proposed awards for university students rises to about  4 million a year. Had I felt that such additionalsums could be allocated to the quinquennial grants, I think I could have produced a rate of increase which the University Grants Committee would have willinglyaccepted and publicly endorsed as adequate for the university expansion. Thesum of  4 million a year applied to salaries would have been equivalent to a university salary increase of 12 per cent., as compared with the 3 per cent,authorised. The extra amounts sought by the universities for university buildingare of a smaller magnitude than  4 million a year. Will this appear, and is it infact, a sensible set of Government priorities in university policy, to allocate an extra 4 million a year to the least urgent need?9. Thirdly, every decision that we take on student awards is inevitablymultiplied as the numbers in higher education grow. The more successful weare in expanding higher education and the better the services we provide, the biggerwill these bills become. The growth to 150,000 university students by 1966-67already involves an increase in awards from  25 million in 1961-62 to  35 million,which would be increased to  39 million by these proposals. If we accept this,we shall be that much less able to accept the further claims for Exchequer money which the universities will undoubtedly be making on us, and our policy of expanding higher education will be that much more difficult to carry out.10. In short, it seems to me that these proposals, however automaticallythey flow from earlier principles and procedures, do not make sense within thewhole picture of higher education policy. They would indeed pi  ice me in 3. verydifficult position vis-a-vis the universities.11. I can equally see that the Lord President and the Education ministers would be in a very difficult position if nothing was done. The best suggestion Ican make is that the increase they propose should be accepted but that they shouldbe implemented over a period of three academic years, in three equal instalments.H.
