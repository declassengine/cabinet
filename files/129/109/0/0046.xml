5.        The bleak outline is as follows:-(a)    Stuop^ly^Exp^^di^ure^.   The rate of increase of Supply expenditureshows little or no signs of slackening,   hi the 5 years before 1960/61 theaverage increase in money terms was a little over 4 per cent.   In thelast 3 years since 1960/61 the average increase, again in money terms,has been well over 7 per cent.   The forecast estimates for 1963/64, justin from Departments and not yet discussed with them, enable us to see whether the trend of the last 3 years is being continued.   The results are as follows:-  Per cent rise overmillion previous year1960/61 (expenditure) 4,986 7.8196l/62 (expenditure)1962/63 (Budget estimate)1963/64 (Forecast       say-estimate)5, 3685,6116, 050-1-7. 77. 3 (comparing estimatewith estimate)7. 8 (comparing estimatewith estimate)SECHETC. (62) 96 COPY MO.    yP7th June, 1962CABINETGOVERNMENT expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am for expansion.   But it must be soundly based, in other words, growing out of increased exports, and not of a nature likely toland us in another balance of payments crisis.2.        I reject utterly the idea that devaluation is a satisfactoryanswer.   I believe that it would produce a state of uncertainty in  -the international payment system that would damage our trade, breakup the sterling area, and result in a substantial lowering of our standardof living.3.        As a result of recent measures, the economy is fairly wellbalanced, and our competitive position has improved.4.        I must however warn my colleagues that I am much disturbed at the further expansion of public expenditure at present envisaged by Departments.  To incur an even greater increase.se of public expendi-ture than that already contemplated would carry too great risks.   Iam horrified at the thought that even greater increases should be con-templated by some of my colleagues.
(b) E^]^ ^SM^d .^J ^ &amp; imS !i&apos;   The Departmental figures for1962/63 (schools, roads, housing, prisons, hospitals, universities, etc.)are 13 per cent above 196l/62 in money terms - perhaps as much as half is cost increase. For next year 1963/64 Departments estimate an in-crease of 1G per cent in real terms as against the statement I made inthe House on 27th February that we were intending to hold theincrease to 6 per cent.Housing is estimated to rise by 10 per cent in 1963/64, quite apart from any acceleration of the kind foreshadowed during theCabinet&apos;s discussion last week (C. C. (62) 38th Conclusions, Minute 2).(This would of course increase the above figures for public investment).(c) Education.   Local authorities&apos; relevant expenditure for general grant, and the expenditure of the Education Departments and theUniversity Grants Committee will in 1962/63 be about  100 million more than in 196l/62 (i, e. , about 10 per cent up):  in 1963/64 theincrease (apart from possible pay increases) is estimated at about 80 million.   The local authorities&apos; education investment is fairlystable through this period, about 15 per cent higher&apos; in real terms thanthe level in 1960/61.(d) Pensions.   We are expecting to do a pensions operation sometime in 1963.   On a basis of an increase of 5s. or 7s. 6d. , this wouldinvolve  115-175 million a year gross.   A large part of this would ofcourse be offset by increased contributions, but these are a form oftaxation.(e) Defence.   This year the increase in defence is  100 million.The Departments&apos; figures show defence expenditure in 1963/64 upby over another  100 million.( )     Overseas Government Expenditure.   In 1962/63, this is likelyto exceed by about  50 million the target of  400 million which Iannounced on 25th July, even if full credit is taken for German armspurchases (which help the balance of payments but not government expenditure).The Consequences of Higher Spending6.        These big prospective increases in public expendittire, nextyear as well as this year, show that there is no diminution in therate of increase of the past two years - indeed, the pace is quickening,both in total expenditure and in public service investment.     the truth is, of course, that throughout the social services the Govern-ment have an excellent record for expansion in every branch ofexpenditure, whether it be education, hospitals, roads, pensions or national assistance.7.        With expenditure rising at this pace - much faster thanthe prospective resources - my room for manoeuvre in next yearrsBudget is being reduced every day,S.L.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.7th June, 1962
