Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1962C. (62) 100 Copy No.     5020th June, 1962CABINETNYASALAND: DISCUSSIONS WITH Dr. BANDA IN london memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentIntroductionIn the talks during my visit to Nyasaland last month, I was strongly pressed by the leader of the Malawi Congress Party, Dr. Banda, and his unofficial colleagues to make an early announcement, preferably before leaving the territory, that theprinciple of secession had been granted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.2. I succeeded in containing the position within the bounds of my statement to the House of Commons on 8th May, and Dr. Banda accepted my plan toappoint a special group of advisers. He made clear, however, that he could not commit himself to considering alternative forms of association with the other territories, unless and until the principle of secession had been agreed and granted:in particular, he could not contemplate any association with Southern Rhodesia.He also pressed for the work of the advisers to be concluded so that a decision onsecession could be taken not later than September.3. I explained that I could not accept a date, and that what I proposed wasa genuine enquiry which could only help Nyasaland and was not being conducted in order to delay matters. Whilst Dr. Banda acquiesced in the matter being left in this way, it is clear to me that it is going to be extremely difficult to defer thesecession issue beyond the autumn. I shall of course be consulting my colleagues on this after my advisers have reported. Meanwhile, however, we cannot hope for more than half-hearted collaboration on that part of my advisers&apos; enquirydealing with alternative forms of association.4. It is against this background that we have now to consider the questionof further internal constitutional advance for Nyasaland, which Dr. Banda also raised with me. He put forward a programme whereby Nyasaland would move to full self-government in July this year, and thereafter to independence withinthe Commonwealth in April 1963. This second stage would follow an early decision by Her Majesty&apos;s Government that Nyasaland should be allowed tosecede, and the working out by a special commission of the practical implications of such a decision. I left him in no doubt that this programme was much toorapid for me, and that in particular the question of independence could not becontemplated in advance of the work of my advisers and decisions on the broadFederal issue. I said that I considered it would be necessary to have a conferencebefore the Nyasaland Constitution could be altered to provide for a measure ofinternal self-government; in particular, I had in mind the need to introduce, forthe protection of minority interests, a Bill of Rights and Council of State. I wasencouraged to say this from my contact with the Europeans. Dr. Banda at firstvigorously opposed this, but eventually said he would accept a conference in theautumn on condition that it would also define a date for independence. I was able to hold the position only by saying that these were matters&quot; on which I mustconsult my colleagues, and by inviting him to London to continue our conversations.60962
2SECRE1The Forthcoming Talks with Dr. Banda: General Considerations5. I have now to decide what line to take with Dr. Banda on these matters in the first week of July. The position of the Malawi Ministers is clear: assumingas they do that Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal from the Federation is now merely amatter of time, they see no reason why the territory should not move as rapidlyto independence as, say, Tanganyika has done. In postulating their programme,:they pay little or no regard to the practical issues which condition the desirable and possible pace of advance, such as:(i) the economic and financial difficulties, in particular the annual deficit on the recurrent budget;(ii) the lack of trained manpower to take over the higher echelons of theadministrative and technical services of government for many years to come;(iii) the need to make proper provision for the public service, including acompensation scheme for expatriate officials.These are the sort of problems which would arise even if Nyasaland were to beregarded simply as a separate entity: they are further complicated by the need to adjust Nyasaland to whatever new pattern we may evolve in Central Africa(involving, for example, the possibility that the Governments of the three territorieswill have to assume responsibility for a wider range of functions than at present,calling for still greater resources of finance and manpower).6. It would be unwise to underestimate the strength of the political pressuresat work in Nyasaland. On the other hand there is grave risk, if the pace of advanceis unduly forced, of financial and economic recession, leading to a catastrophicset-back in the territory&apos;s progress, and of a breakdown in the governmentalmachine, with a large and rapid exodus of expatriate officials.Independence7. It would be difficult enough (as elsewhere in Africa) to apply the brake asfirmly as we might wish, even if we were handling Nyasaland in isolation. it remains doubly difficult so long as Nyasaland&apos;s position vis-a-vis the presentFederation is unresolved: but that is the situation in which I shall have to meetDr. Banda next week. It is unfortunate that the question of secession and of independence should now be confused in his mind: and I shall try to bring himto realise that withdrawal from the Federation is not the same thing as independencefrom the United Kingdom, and that the progress of Nyasaland towards independenceas a territory must be subject to realistic consideration by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Nyasaland Government of all the usual factors on which the ability of a country to stand on its own feet depends.8. Ideally, it would be desirable to avoid any further move on the territorialconstitution until we could see our way to a solution of the Federal issue: if that should be settled to Dr. Banda&apos;s satisfaction, there will be some prospect of a more realistic approach on his part to the problems of domestic advance. I fear however that some move will have to be made in the forthcoming talks, if Dr. Banda&apos;acceptance of and collaboration with my advisers is to remain secured. Thequestion is what is the minimum which will keep him in play.9. So far as independence is concerned, I shall have to try to convince him that I cannot possibly contemplate a programme or date at least until my advisershave done their work and Her Majesty&apos;s Government have been able to take stock of the whole Federal problem. It is neither prudent nor practicable to try to lookahead in this way until the circumstances in which Nyasaland may eventually bemoving towards independence have been clarified and I could not now undertake,even if a constitutional conference were to be held in the autumn, that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would then be in a position to agree to a date for independence.Internal Self-Government10. If however this firm line is to be taken on independence, and at the sametime Dr. Banda is to be kept on the hook for my general enquiry, I think we shallat least have to offer him the prospect of further territorial advance before the endof the year. I would therefore propose to offer a constitutional conference in theautumn, at as late a date as I could negotiate.  I should wish if possible to allow
time for some consideration of Nyasaland&apos;s position in relation to the Federation,in the light of my advisers&apos; report; but no doubt Dr. Banda will be reluctant to wait beyond September. He will realise that we are seeking to buy time, and Octobermay be the maximum we can hope to gain.11. It has to be recognised that making this offer probably means that weare committing ourselves to the introduction of virtual self-government in nyasaland by the middle of 1963, and possibly earlier (e.g., 1st April). Dr. Banda&apos;sobjective for the next stage will be an all-elected, non-advisory Executive Council,from which the official Ministers of Finance and Justice have withdrawn, the chief secretary becoming a Deputy Governor. Once at the conference table, it will bevery hard to hold the line much short of this; and no doubt much will be made ofprecedents in East Africa. On the other hand, there are a number of matters which call for very careful thought before we agree to go so far. Would it be wise,for example, at this stage to allow all control of the public service, or of the police and law and order to pass out of the Governor^ hands? And should Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment not seek to retain some financial control, having regard to Nyasaland&apos;special problems and the financial reshuffling that will be involved in any generalchange of the Central Africa pattern, in a Constitution coming into force in 1963?12. There is a further difficulty in negotiating self-government for Nyasaland,so long as the present Federation remains in being. At the stage of full self-government, it is normally the powers of defence and external relations whichthe United Kingdom Government retains to themselves, but under the presentFederal constitution these powers rest with the Federal Government. In thesecircumstances, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would find themselves in the peculiarposition of having practically no. remaining responsibilities towards the territory.13. I can consult my colleagues at a later date, when these problems havebeen further examined, about our objectives at the conference itself. But it is clearthat any limitations upon full internal self-government will be difficult to negotiate,and that to achieve what we may think to be desirable we may have to adopt a tactical starting point still further back.14. Assuming that such a conference is offered to and accepted by Dr. Banda,two subsidiary questions arise, namely, the timing and content of any announcement.   These are dealt with in the Annex to this paper.Summary of Proposals15. I accordingly seek my colleagues&apos; agreement that I should in theforthcoming talks offer Dr. Banda a constitutional conference in the autumn todiscuss the granting of a substantial measure of self-government to the territory,at the same time making it plain that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are not able atthis stage to enter into any undertakings as regards a programme for independence;and that I should handle the problems of timing and content of the announcementof this move on the lines set out in the Annex.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W.1,19th June, 1962.
ANNEX . 1(i) The Timing of any AnnouncementDr. Banda will no doubt wish to announce the results of his visit to Londonalmost as soon as he returns to Nyasaland (9th July). But it is obviously necessarypolitically to bring the Federal Government into the picture before any announcement is made, and this will have to be done very carefully if their acceptance of my general enquiry is not to be endangered. It would also be inaccordance with normal practice to consult with the Opposition Party in Nyasaland(U.F.P.) before Her Majesty&apos;s Government formally commit themselves to such aconference. Such consultations will not of course be palatable to Dr. Banda:before the talks with him begin, I am therefore consulting the High commissioner and Governor about the manner and timing of such approaches to the federal government and the U.F.P.(ii) The Content of any AnnouncementDr. Banda will no doubt press for the announcement to go as far as possibletowards indicating that the conference will result in self-government for Nyasaland:and we shall no doubt have to let him return from London with somethingconcrete to tell to &quot; his people &quot;. For our own purposes, however, we should wish the conference to be described in a neutral way, e.g., &quot;to consider the next stage of constitutional advance in Nyasaland &quot;.; the wording is of importance fromthe point of view of minimising the Federal Governmenfs suspicions and Europeanreaction generally in the Federation, as well as of maintaining Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s freedom of action at the conference table. This will be a matter for negotiation: but Dr. Banda&apos;s agreement to a satisfactory formula may welldepend on his being assured privately at least that it is our thought that the nextphase in Nyasaland will be one of substantial self-government.June 1962
