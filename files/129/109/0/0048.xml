Tress and Flemingin the London and Cambridge Economic Bulletin for June.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,18th June, 1962.60956Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1962C. (62) 9819th June, 1962
ANNEXEXPORTS, DEFLATION AND GROWTHMemorandum by the Economic Adviser to Her Majesty&apos;s GovernmentThe article by Messrs. Tress and Fleming in The Times of 23rd May (a longerversion appears in the June London and Cambridge Economic Bulletin) is opento a number of criticisms:(i) Was the pressure of demand excessive in the first half of 1961 ?Messrs. Tress and Fleming suggest that the main trouble last July was aspeculative attack on sterling. They deny that there was excessive pressure of demand and claim (in the longer version) that the United Kingdom&apos;s balance on current and long-term capital account &quot; though adverse is now seen to have beennotably small&quot;. They are mistaken on both points. Excluding the Fordtransaction and advance debt repayments, the debit balance on long-term capital account was  193 million in the first half of 1961 and there was also a debitbalance of  60 million on current account; this makes an adverse balance for the half year of  253 million, which can hardly be called &quot; notably small&quot;. At thesame time there was only a small margin of unemployed labour (registeredunemployment averaged \\ per cent, over the half year). Plainly demand wasexcessive, if not in relation to actual output, at least in relation to the quantity ofgoods and services that would have been available if the trade deficit had beeneliminated.(ii) Does a contraction in home demand encourage exports ?Messrs. Tress and Fleming agree that a measure of disinflation designed tobring total demand within the limits of capacity will cause exports to rise. Inview of what has been said above, this admission weakens, if it does not wreck,their argument that the policy of the Government does nothing to encourageexports. The Governmenfs policy is designed to keep demand in reasonable balance with capacity, not to produce severe deflation. It is true that, for the timebeing, there is some slack in the economy, but this is intended to allow for a steadyexpansion in exports. Such an expansion, which is already in progress, may come about either because firms are more inclined to strive for increased export business when their home market contracts or fails to expand, or because theforeign demand for British goods is improving and in that case sufficient roommust be left in our economy to meet this demand. Messrs. Tress and Flemingdispute the first of these reasons although there are obvious examples (such asmotor cars) to the contrary. They say little about the second; but it has been the favourable opportunities in expanding world markets in 1962 that have beenchiefly emphasised in Government statements.(iii) Must we wait for exports to grow before expanding production ?Messrs. Tress and Fleming argue that it is wrong to slow down the growth ofproduction in order to regulate the balance of payments. They christen the government&apos;s attitude &quot; waiting for exports &quot; (the heading of their longer article).But when they come to put forward an alternative in their final paragraph thisturns out to be an old friend, namely &quot; variations in exchange rate parities &quot; whichthe Government rejected last July. The measures then taken cannot conceivably be represented as more damaging than a devaluation of the pound (especially asall, or nearly all, of them would have had to be taken had there been a devaluation).(iv) Will disinflation help or hinder incomes policy ?Messrs. Tress and Fleming argue, quite reasonably, that a high rate of growthshould make it easier to pursue a successful incomes policy. They are on firmerground in this part of their article.  But where they go wrong is in implying that
our rate of growth could be permanently improved by deliberately increasing the pressure of demand beyond what now prevails or is likely in the period ahead.Such an increase in pressure might raise output initially but this would be a once for-all gain, not a steady upward climb in the rate of growth of productivity. Ifthis objective is to be achieved, it is not so much a higher level of demand as a more vigorous response on the side of supply that is needed: more skilful management,better training, greater attention to advances in technique, more rapid displacementof lethargic businesses by their competitors, and so on. Furthermore, even ifMessrs. Tress and Fleming are right to expect some favourable effect on longrun productivity growth by running the economy at full stretch, they do not givesufficient weight to the damaging effect on the size of wage increases that are aconcomitant of a strong demand situation. They underrate, therefore, the repercussions on costs and on the competitive position of British exports thatwould result. Their policy of &quot; growth at all costs &quot; might soon turn out to be arecipe for more and bigger exchange crises. No one who looks at the situation inGermany can be under any illusion that a high rate of growth necessarily leads to greater moderation in wage-claims. Nor does Continental experience suggest thatit is easy to operate an incomes policy in conditions of acute labour shortage. Theone thing that is fatal to an incomes policy is excess demand; and it does not makeit any the less fatal if it is allowed to masquerade as a talisman for growth.A. K.
