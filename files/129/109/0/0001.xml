secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT: ^Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1962C. (62) 51 Copy No.   5016th March, 1962CABINETREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SECURITY IN THE PUBLICSERVICE (THE RADCLIFFE COMMITTEE)Memorandum by the Prime minister the Radcliffe Committee were appointed on 11th May, 1961, &quot; to review thesecurity procedures and practices currently followed in the public service and toconsider what, if any, changes are required &quot;. In August 1961 they were invitedto examine also the D Notice system. They presented their Report on21st November, 1961.2. The Report has been considered at meetings of the Ministerial Committeeon Security at which I have presided. The Committee have agreed that all its recommendations can be accepted. They have also agreed that there would onthis occasion be advantage in publishing, not merely a brief statement of the radcliffe Committee&apos;s findings, but a substantial part of the argument on which their conclusions are based. The Report, while suggesting several ways in which our security measures should be intensified, discloses no radical defect in the system as a whole. Moreover, it not Only illustrates the extent of the espionage threatbut also demonstrates, in convincing detail, the difficulty of countering it effectively in a free society. Publication will therefore help to secure a better publicunderstanding of both the importance and the difficulties of the security problem.3. I have therefore come to the conclusion that we should publish the text of the Committee&apos;s Report to the maximum extent compatible with the publicinterest and the requirements of security, preserving as nearly as possible thesubstance and sequence of the Radcliffe Committee&apos;s argument in their own words.
2SECRET1The attached draft of a White Paper contains a version of the Report which hasbeen prepared on this basis, under the direction of the Ministerial Committee on security, and is acceptable to Lord Radcliffe.4. I have discussed the Report, in confidence, with the Leader of theOpposition and three Privy Councillors in the Labour Party. They favourpublication on the lines suggested in paragraph 3 above. They pressed especiallylor the publication of Chapter 9 of the draft White Paper, which deals with theD Notice system. I have ascertained that the Press members of the Committeeresponsible for administering D Notices would on the whole be in favour ofthe publication of this chapter.5. I will explain orally to the Cabinet why certain parts of the Report are notto be published. Over some of these we shall be in some Parliamentary difficulty,but this must be faced.6. I seek the authority of the Cabinet to present a White Paper as soon aspossible in the terms of the attached draft.H. M.Admiralty House, S.W. 1,16th March, 1962.

1. On 11th May, 1961, the Government announced the appointment^ ofan independent Committee to review security procedures and practices inthe public service.   The Committee was constituted as follows:The Right Hon. the Lord Radcliffe, G.B.E. (Chairman)Mr. F. W. D. Deakin, D.S.O. &quot;Sir David Milne, G.C.B.Field-Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., K.B.E., D.S.O.The Right Hon. Kenneth Younger.2.   The Committee&apos;s terms of reference were:&quot; In the light of recent convictions for offences under the official secrets Acts, to review the security procedures and practices currentlyfollowed in the public service and to consider what, if any, changes arerequired.&quot;In pursuance of an undertaking given in the House of Commons on 3rd August, 1961, the Prime Minister also asked the Committee to examinethe D Notice system, both generally and with particular reference to a notice dated 27th July, 1961.3. The Committee have held 61 meetings; and, in addition to considering a great volume of written memoranda, they have taken oral evidence frommore than 70 individuals in a series of interviews extending over five months.Their Report, which was submitted on 21st November, 1961, makes a comprehensive and searching examination of the security procedures and practices in the public service. The Government welcome this opportunityto express their gratitude to Lord Radcliffe and his colleagues for the timeand care which they devoted to their task.4. In the course of their enquiry the Committee have had the fullestaccess to all relevant material, including the Report of the Committee underthe Chairmanship of Sir Charles Romer, which investigated the circumstancesof the Portland case. In addition, they themselves carried out a correspondinginvestigation into the Blake case. In the light of these investigations theimpression which they formed of the security services was, in their ownwords, that &quot; while there are certain respects in which improvements arestill possible, the quality of the security organisation and procedures and thegeneral standard of security discipline is good &quot;.5. The Government have now considered the Committee&apos;s Report. it contains a substantial amount of material which it would not be in the publicinterest to publish. But the Government have decided that it would be rightto publish the Committee&apos;s recommendations, with their supporting argument,to the maximum extent compatible with the public interest and therequirements of security. These parts of the Report are reproduced in the text attached to this paper. Lord Radcliffe has agreed, on behalf of his committee, that, despite the omissions necessarily made on security grounds,this text preserves, as nearly as possible in the Committee&apos;s own words, thesubstance of the Committee&apos;s argument relating to security procedures and practices in the public service generally and to the D Notice system.6. The Government accept the recommendations made in the Committee&apos;sReport.ii

Report of the Committee on SecurityProcedures in the Public service the text which follows sets out the Committee&apos;srecommendations, with their supporting argument, to themaximum extent compatible with the public interest andthe requirements of security.

CHAPTER 1.-introduction in the context of our enquiry we have taken &quot;security&quot; to mean the safeguarding of such information in the possession of the Government as would by its unauthorised disclosure cause injury to the interests of thecountry. The agencies against which protection is needed are various; butthe sources from which the main threat to security comes are:(i) the intelligence services of foreign Powers;(ii) subversive organisations in this country, of which in current conditions the most formidable is the Communist Party of Great Britain, withits fringe of associated bodies and sympathisers.2. The evidence that we heard satisfies us that to-day much the mostserious source of danger lies in the intelligence services of the Soviet blocwhich, there is reason to suppose, are co-ordinated as between the various countries taking part. These services must be envisaged as steadily at workin this country collecting information for intelligence purposes and trying tobreak through our screen of protective security to get at the secrets we wishto preserve. In this work they are prepared to employ all the most up-to-dateresources of espionage and they look for useful agents or instrumentswherever skill or occasion presents an opportunity.3, The activities of the Communist Party of Great Britain are not of thesame order as a threat to security. It is not the policy of the party,according to our information, to give its members, open or secret, any encouragement to undertake espionage, although this policy might, ofcourse, be changed in changing conditions. Nor should the instruments ofthe Russian Intelligence Service be envisaged as selected either necessarilyor essentially on ideological grounds. Any form of sympathy or compulsionthat can be laid hold of will serve its turn and among these compulsionsfear, pressure, and mercenary motives are as strong as any other.4. We have thought it necessary to say this in explanation of the background against which we have approached the recommendations contained in our Report, because, as will be seen, our assessment ismaterially different in emphasis from that made by the Conference of PrivyCouncillors in their Report of 24th January, 1956 the last occasion uponwhich our subject was considered in any comprehensive form on behalf ofthe Government.   Their assessment was as follows:&quot; One of the chief problems of security to-day is thus to identify the members of the British Communist Party, to be informed of its activities and to identify that wider body of those who are bothsympathetic to Communism or susceptible to Communist pressure and present a danger to security. Thereafter steps must be taken to see thatsecret information is not handled by anyone who, for ideological orother motives, may betray it.&quot;  (Cmd. 9715.)5. In our view this assessment would not by itself be a satisfactory guidefor future action for the following reasons:(a) It seems to suggest that the central problem of security is to excludeCommunists from access to State secrets.   For the reasons which we
have given we believe that the central threat lies further back thanthe British Communist Party.(b) The whole of our investigation has led us to conclude that nothing is more important to effective security than the basic measures of physical security, if well planned and consistently carried out.Safeguarding premises, documents, and cyphers and eliminatingcarelessness are of the first importance. No system of personnelsecurity, however much elaborated, can be effective enough to modify their primary value.(c) Counter-espionage against enemy agents is an indispensable part ofthe defensive system. None of the various defensive measures can safely be neglected in reliance on another; but one real success incounter-espionage can have positive results more far-reaching thanall the rest.6. It would be commonplace to say that the social and political systemof this country is inimical to effective security. We cannot hope under thissystem to achieve results comparable with those achieved in, for example,the USSR with its much harsher control of individual activity. OurParliamentary methods, our Press immunities, our Trade Union activities,all assume and in their different ways achieve that much information that,theoretically, it would be desirable to conceal becomes more or less availableto the public. From a security or intelligence point of view this is sometimesto be deplored. But perhaps even more pervasive is the general publictradition that an individual is entitled to a fair hearing in respect of anyaccusation entertained against him and to fair treatment irrespective ofpolitical or public convenience. At this stage all that we wish to say isthat, in considering any additional security measures to recommend, wehave reminded ourselves that security weaknesses of this kind are part ofthe price that we pay for having a social and political system that men want to defend.&apos;   CHAPTER 2.-GENERAL IMPRESSIONS7. The standing instructions on security open by emphasising that security is the concern of everyone in the Government service. While thiswould doubtless be generally accepted as an aspiration, we cannot reportthat the evidence we heard convinced us that there was a uniform levelof active concern for security. In carrying out a fairly close examination ofthe security arrangements of a dozen Departments, our general impression was, as we expected, one of patchiness. In those branches of the publicservice which have in the past suffered serious blows to security, for example the Foreign Office and Atomic Energy, and in those where the paramountneed for security is obvious to the staff as a whole, the standard of security organisation and personnel and the general feeling of alertness and careimpressed us favourably. In Departments generally, however, the standardseemed to us to be a good deal more varied. Naturally at the time of ourreview security was much in people&apos;s minds, as a result of the trials whichwere the occasion for our appointment. But even within those departments which are regularly handling a great deal of highly secret information.we found more than one in which the level of interest in or attention to security
seemed to have been low and the subject itself treated as one which in practiceranked lower in importance than most others. , ....... ---8. This was not to us a surprising discovery. Protective secufity isdefensive in concept and it is not unnatural that it should at times seem tothe public servant at all levels to be less deserving of his care and effort thanbis. more constructive duties. This: feeling is encouraged by the apparent,remoteness of the threat. In locking up his secret papers at night the publicservant is not only fighting an enemy who is invisible, but one of whoseexistence he may feel somewhat sceptical. To some extent this attitudeprobably reflects an equally ambivalent attitude on the part of the general,pjublic and of the Government towards the Communist Powers and theCommunist Party generally. ,. 9i In time of war there is no doubt about the enemy&apos;s identity and aslogan &quot; Careless talk costs lives&quot; can strike an immediate response inpebple&apos;s minds. In a state of cold war the blacks and whites of wartimemerge into a more neutral grey. Although the Soviet bloc and the western powers are at conflict on a number of fundamental issues, we are at thesame time officially in friendly relations with the Soviet Powers and theGovernment is seen to be working hard towards an improvement of theserelations and encouraging commercial, cultural and other contacts.&quot;&quot; 10. A similar ambiguity arises over the treatment of Communism in .this country. The Communist Party is known to be subversive in intentafid for this reason a considerable effort is made by the Government to keepinformed of its activities. But the Government does not seek to excludeCommunists as such from its own service (provided that they are notengaged on secret work) and the party is treated as one of a number ofpolitical parties seeking the votes of the electorate. : -  ;fioil; &quot;-These apparent inconsistencies help to aggravate the other difficultiesof persuading Civil Servants of the importance of security. In the followingChapters we examine, the existing security organisation and procedures and make certain recommendations. None is in our view more important thanthose which are directed to the question of persuading Government employeesthat security.is the concern of everyone in, the Government Service.definitions ...12. For the sake of brevity we have followed the common practice of using the phrase &quot; Communist&quot; throughout to include Fascists. We also,as. a matter of convenience, talk freely in this report about &quot; Departments&quot;.We naturally do not mean, in the present context, to refer to all GovernmentDepartments, many of which by the nature of their work have little or no need for special security measures. We are thinking throughout primarilyof,.those Government Departments or branches of Departments which areconcerned with the protection and safeguarding of classified informationof ^material. The Service Departments are, of course, within this category.Moreover, when we speak of a &quot;public servant&quot; we mean the.general termto include not only Civil Servants and members of the armed Servicesserving with them in.Departments but also all members of those Services.We also include, in. the. term &quot; Departments &quot; the United Kingdom atomic energy Authority:    &apos;  * .....1        -        &apos;-  :w
CHAirrER3:-^RGANrSATlbNPOR SECURITYDepartmental Responsibility **i .. &apos;; 13. Up to thepresent each; Government Department has been regardedas individually responsible for maintaining a proper standard of protectivesecurity within its own field, advised as necessary on technical questionsby the Security Service. It has sometimes been suggested that it would bebetter if the security organisation throughout the Government service were:to be brought under the direct control of the Security Service. In so faras this would secure a centralised and therefore a possibly more effective control and a greater element of professionalism in the security systemthis proposal has superficial attractions. But we are in no doubt that theyare quite illusory. The transfer of responsibility from Departments to theSecurity Service would greatly&apos;encourage the dangerous tendency to regard;security as something outside the normal business of the Department and.therefore a matter of no real concern to the general body of departmentalstaff. Nothing would be more likely to damage security than the developmentof such an attitude and we share the view, which was expressed to us by departments and by the Security Service with complete unanimity, that apolicy of departmental responsibility is essential if an adequate standard of security is to be achieved.cr 14. But the system of departmental responsibility is dependent for its success on three factors, which we discuss in the remaining paragraphs of this chapter:(i) access to the central pool of security intelligence and expertise in theSecurity Service; -&quot;&apos;(ii) arrangements for Departments to keep in touch with each other on security questions of common interest;(iii) an effective security organisation within each Department.Role of the Security Service15. It is the responsibility of the Security Service to supply departments with information and advice on the nature and scale of the various threatswhich exist to the security of the State and to advise on measures of defence against them. .      . -16. Security Service advice and assistance to Departments takes a variety of forms of which the following are probably the most important in practice:(a) it deals with personnel vetting enquiries from Departments, i.e., checksindividual names against intelligence records;(ft) it undertakes, by invitation from Departments, detailed inspections!.     of their headquarters premises and out-stations, reporting and making recommendations on a Wide range of subjects directly related to,.,  security and acts as the security inspector of. the premises of firms. working on classified Government, contracts;(c) it responds ad hoc to departmental or industrial requests for adviceii.    or assistance, or on occasion takes the initative in offering such; advice^
&apos;\d) it plays a full part in the interdepartmental, security committeesr   &apos;   structure and often takes the initiative &quot;in submitting to these&apos;    committees proposals relating to security policy or techniques. .17. The Departments expressed themselves as well satisfied with the-qualify of the advice which they receive from the Security Service and generally speaking the relationship between the Security Service and departments seemed to us to be one of co-operation. The practical danger is probably not so much of friction (of - which we saw no signs) as of a degree of apathy on the part of Departments. The Security Service doesinot, however, and in our view certainly should not, feel itself debarred from taking the initiative in offering advice to a Department unasked, when itjudges. such advice to be necessary. The. Service has much that is useful to offer in the way of advice and there is no good reason why it should bediffident in coming forward, provided always that it makes no avoidablemystery as to the facts on which it acts. - ri18. On the other hand, this initiative does not extend to the field of security inspection and we considered whether it should. We were shown an example of a report made by the Security Service after a thorough inspectionby their officers of the security arrangements of one Government Departmentfind, were impressed by the care and effort which had gone into its preparation.A periodical inspection of this sort,, whether of. a Government department as &quot;a whole or of particular branches or establishments within a Department,is&apos;clearly&apos;^valuable and ought to be recognised as a,necessary element in thesecurity system. -- -&quot; &apos; --    -:; &apos;,&apos;&apos; &apos;19., TJut it is.,quite another matter to lay down that the Security Service&apos;is&apos; to have the right and duty to carry out inspections uninvited.: -We, areagainst such an extension, if only because it would tend to impair the sense of direct responsibility for maintaining a proper standard of security whichshould be felt by each Departmental head.S! 20&apos;.: We are aware that a special situation could arise in which there is., a conflict Of view between the Director General of the -Security Service, whofeels that an inspection is called; for on the one hand, and on the other theHead of a Department who thinks that there is no. necessity for it to takeplace. Something like this has occurred in the past. If such a situation should arise in the future the recognised procedure should be for the director general of the Security Service to seek an interview with the Departmentalhead and to state.frankly his reasons for; disquiet on security grounds,-,; Ifaction to allay his disquiet cannot be agreed upon, the question should bereferred to. the Joint Permanent Secretary of the Treasury, as Head of theGivil. Service, for an arbitral decision. --Inter-departmental Committee Structure21. Under the authority of Ministers, responsibility for formulatingadvice on questions, of - security policy rests with various officialinter-departmental committees. We saw and heard enough of the work ofthese committees to be left in no doubt that they play a very useful part intie ^security&apos; system-. &apos; By bringing together officials dealing with securityquestions in all the more sensitive Departments (including representatives ofthe Security Service) they act as a useful clearing house for experience and$
ideas; and, although most of the members attending fare. not. in a; careersense security specialists, the committees help to create something of ahofficial security &quot; community &quot; and to bring an atmosphere of professionalisminto this work which we regard as desirable.; 22. Nevertheless we attach much importance to its being brought home to the Civil Service as a whole that security is a subject of active concern to those at its highest levels and we therefore recommend that as a matterof policy the supervising committee should associate itself somewhat more directly with what goes on. For example-fa) It should receive a six-monthly report from the Security Service as:;       a basis for a general review and discussion of current security matters;(b) The junior committees should be instructed to report briefly twice&apos;;      a year on their activities.  . .;;.1 (c) When standing instructions on security are revised, the text preparedby a junior committee should be submitted to and formally authorised;by the supervising committee and circulated in its name. *Security Organisation in Departments23. The third and probably most important requirement for security isa proper security organisation within each Department. We have enquiredinto the security organisation of 12 different Departments and were notsurprised to find that in no two were the arrangements exactly similar,Given the wide variety of circumstances in different parts of the government service, there is no standard organisation which can be prescribed for all departments. But there are certain basic features which seem to us to be essential in any Department.Departmental Security Instructions24. First, every member of the departmental staff who is handlingClassified information and is therefore within the scope of the protectivesecurity system must be instructed in his personal responsibility for security and in the various security rules and procedures in force. We think k rightto make a sharp distinction between the issue of security instructions and the carrying out of security education. The latter, which we discuss more fully in Chapter 8 below, is principally a matter of explaining to employees whySecurity is important and what the practical risks are, as a means, of encouraging general alertness on security matters. Security instructions are(or should be) orders. It is true that the Government instructions on security which are prepared centrally and issued to Departments for their guidanceare phrased in general terms and consist by their nature mainly of advice.But the departmental security instructions, which should reflect the policy laid down in the instructions issued centrally while adapting it as necessaryto.the particular circumstances of the Department, ought to be phrased so asto leave the reader in no doubt that disregard of them is an offence againstdepartmental discipline.v ; 25. This does not mean that the departmental instructions need be longand detailed. If they are, they may well defeat their own object by&apos;. remainingunread.  The;need, as .we; see, ,it, is &quot;for instructions.which, are clear,.Jfiririi
arid concise; outlining the&apos;security organisation and rules and&apos; procedures- ia -fprce in the Department and bringing home to each member of the staffwnaf contribution he should make to that organisation.    ;26. If it is possible for departmental security instructions to be issued ina separate, document so much the better., Not all Departments will find thisWorkable; but all those in which security is a major problem would do well to have a separate booklet for the purpose. In either case it is worth takingtrouble to see that the instructions are clearly laid out. Their preparationbught not to be regarded as merely a mechanical task of &quot;lifting&quot; passagesout. of the instructions issued centrally. It calls for the exercise of judgmentand imagination and should in our view be regarded as one of the mostimportant tasks that fall to a departmental security officer.Departmental Security Staff ,, 27. The basic responsibility which each Civil Servant bears for securitywithin his own field of action does not lessen the heed for a security organisation in the Department to prepare security instructions, check thatthey are being observed, investigate breaches of security and so on. each department must therefore have a security organisation with a clear allocation of responsibility for both physical and personnel security questions and. achain of responsibility from the lowest, to the highest levels. It was the lack of such an organisation in the Admiralty at the time of the Portlandcase that, as much as anything else, made it possible for the offences to occurand to remain undetected. . *28. In most Departments questions of personnel and physical security are dealt with in different sections and come together at Under-Secretary orAssistant Secretary level either in the hands of a full-time head of a SecurityDivision or in those of the Principal Establishment Officer. Putting asidecertain special problems raised by the three Service Departments, which wedeal with below, we take the view that in general the best arrangement is toinclude security in all its aspects among the responsibilities of the PrincipalEstablishment Officer. This is the usual practice to-day and it seems to usconsonant with the views on the role of the Principal Establishment Officerexpressed by the Plowdeh Committee in its recent report on Control of public expenditure (Cmnd. 1432, paragraph 47). The circumstances of the particular department will determine to what extent he is to be assisted by officersworking whole time or part time on security duties.Security in Otjtstations29. The security organisation of outstations presents special difficulties towhich not all Departments seem yet to have found entirely satisfactoryanswers. Again, no standard pattern will be suitable for general application,but we think that the following principles. should be regarded as valid invirtually any circumstances:, (a) Primary responsibility for the security in an outstation should lie withthe Head of the station in other words security should (in militarylanguage) be regarded as a command responsibility.:(b) In every outstation an officer should be nominated as Security Officer,serving full-time or part-time as circumstances dictate. The SecurityOfficer&apos;s responsibility will be to the Head of the station, whose7
-&quot;      principal adviser he will be in security matters.  But he should have.;       a right to communicate direct with the Headquarters or regional security organisation on-technical matters affecting his activities as SecurityOfficer.   The post of Security Officer, whether it is full-time or only part-time, should be regarded as one which requires not only a clear and up-to-date set of instructions, but also specialised training,undertaken either by the Department itself or probably in most cases, by the Security Service.,(c) The Headquarters security organisation should have the right and duty to inspect the security arrangements at outstations from time to time.This is, in our view, important.  It will both keep outstations on theirtoes and will give Headquarters  an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of individual security officers and an understanding of theproblems with which they are faced.Secondment by the Security Service30. We have considered whether the staffing of departmental securitybranches could usefully be strengthened by more widespread secondment ofofficers by the Security Service. This is already practised on a limited scale.In our view the secondment of officers from the Security Service to departments is not necessary as a general rule and we think that it would be undesirable, because it would tend to foster precisely the notion that it is mostimportant to dispel that security is a matter for the experts and not for theordinary Civil Servant. The most that we would wish to envisage beyond thepresent practice is that on special occasions a Security Service officer mightbe seconded to a Department for a limited period, as when a Department is taking steps to implement recommendations arising from a major review ofits security organisation.Responsibilities of Senior Officers31. We have left to the last, in order to emphasise it, the requirementwhich, perhaps more than any others, will determine the effectiveness of aDepartments security organisation. This is that the security organisation should be staffed by competent people who have the confidence and supportof the senior officers of the Department. Any impression that a security postis not the mark of a promising career or that the security branch is the naturalhome of the incompetent would be fatal to the effect that we want to seeproduced.32. We attach the greatest possible importance to a firm lead in securitymatters from the senior officers of a Department, including in particular thePermanent Secretary. Only this is likely to set the right security tone in a department. A Permanent Secretary cannot personally be constantly in touchwith security matters: but he can regard it as his personal responsibility toensure that the Department has an effective and adequately manned security organisation,&apos; that the organisation is provided with proper facilities, thatthe departmental security instructions are clear and comprehensive and thatbreaches of security will be promptly investigated and corrective action taken.We do not doubt that many of the Departments from whom we heard evidencesatisfy these requirements. What is needed is that the standards of the bestshould be general throughout the. Government service.
(a)1 Each Department should-remairi responsible for maintaining a properv\&apos;.&apos;.r    standard&apos; of security, advised as necessary by the Security -Service. -(6) If the &apos; Director-General of the Security Service finds himself in^disagreement, with\the&apos;permanent&apos;Hg on-me need&apos; for a security inspection and the matter cannot be resolved in discussion,the question should be referred to the Joint Permanent Secretary of thev; !    Treasury as Head of the Civil Service.   ; zz &apos;(pfS- (c) The inter-departmental cdmmittee&apos;respbnsible for co-ordinating advice on security policy should be more directly associated with developments in the security field. To this ehd!r(i) it should receive a six-monthly review of current security mattersfrom the Security Service; &quot;&apos;&quot;(ii) its junior committees should each report twice.a year on their\       .    - activities; [ .. , .(iii) it should formally approve future editions of the standinginstructions on security in Government Departments.w (d) Each Department should issue a set of security instructions, whichshould be clear and concise and mandatory in form. :   ; &apos;&quot;(e) Each Department should have a security organisation with a Clearallocation of responsibility for physical and personnel security. Thesequestions should normally come together in the hands of the PrincipalEstablishment Officer.(/) The organisation of security in outstations should reflect the following principles:(i) primary, responsibility for security should lie with the Head ofthe station;(ii) an officer should be nominated as Security Officer, with direct responsibility to the Head of the station, but with the right tocommunicate direct with Headquarters on technical securityquestions;(iii) the security arrangements at outstations should be inspected byHeadquarters from time to time.(g) Officers should be seconded to Departments by the Security Serviceonly in special circumstances.(/i) Permanent Secretaries and other senior officers should make it their personal responsibility to ensure that each Department has an effectivesecurity organisation and that the staff are alive to the need for security precautions.CHAPTER 4-SECURITY CLASSIFICATION34. Since it would be futile to give the same degree of security protection to all types of information in the possession of the Government it isfundamental to the security system that the various classes and items ofinformation should be classified according to their sensitivity from a securitypoint of view. Most Government information is in documentary form and the
classification process, applies in the,&apos;main to riles, papers,: diagrams, .&amp;&amp;&apos;: But- the. same principles and procedures apply to those material objects (bombs,aircraft, &amp;c.) which need security protection.,.- 35. The classification process governs virtually, every type of. security  procedure. Thus it determines whether a paper is to be locked in a cupboardfitted with this type of lock or that, whether it is to be despatched in an&apos; envelope, a leather pouch, or a locked box, whether the staff who are permitted to handle it are to be yetted, and so on. We felt it necessary, therefore, to spend a good deal of time examining the arrangements for security&quot;classification in order to see whether there are any improvements that weCould suggest. This is a task that has often been attempted at various points but to us, as to others, it proved a singularly baffling one.36. There is an obvious probability that security arrangements, like mostether forms of defence, will be the more effective the more limited is the fieldto be protected. To try to protect a greater volume of information than isnecessary is bound to be wasteful, since security is expensive in terms of equipment and manpower; it is bound to handicap efficiency, since securityprocedures inevitably act as a brake on the administrative machine; andit will tend to defeat its own object by bringing the idea of security itself into disrepute.37. It was the unanimous view of our witnesses that the security system:is at present trying to protect too much. They felt certain from their personal knowledge that substantial quantities of documents are at present being given a security classification higher than is really necessary or in circumstances where no classification is really needed at all. Moreoverclassifications originally necessary are retained after the need for them is. over. If this view is to be relied on, and it is so widespread that we donot think that it can be ignored, this seems to us to be a serious defect inthe security system. It is not difficult to see the circumstances which giverise to over-classification. It probably arises in part from a genuineuncertainty as to what is the proper standard of grading, in part from atendency to play safe. The consequences are cumulative. Given a slipshodattitude to security there results a loss of confidence in the effectiveness ofthe&apos; various grades of classification and officers tend to overgrade by wayof compensation.: 38. Unfortunately our witnesses were far from unanimous in their viewson what, if anything, could be done to remedy this state of affairs. It is ourview that the only hope of tackling the problem successfully lies in a simultaneous approach on several fronts.. 39. The time is, we think,,ripe for a high-level reappraisal as to whatrelative priorities of security ought to be given to.which types of information.In the defence sphere we have received the impression that the radical changes in strategic thought which have taken place have not so far been accompanied;by a parallel reassessment of security priorities, many of whichare all too likely to be based more on habit than on contemporary realities.^Similarly, it would.be very useful to achieve a -reassessment of the relativepriorities appropriate to the security, of defence, economic and political5information. A start has now been made in this direction, and there,.is nothing more that we can usefully say except that we support this actioncarid think that it should be carried through............    . . &apos;. .
e r40: But a new high-level reappraisal will riot of itself solve the problem;;The official who in the course of his daily work originates a document whichcseems to him to call for security protection has the difficult task of applying to each case as it arises guidance which can only be phrased in general aridrelative terms. The definitions in current use are too vaguely descriptiveto offer much guidance and much is left to depend on individual judgment.But it is not easy to see how they could be phrased more helpfully.41. What is needed, therefore, is a system in each Department whichwill assist officials to base their classification of documents not only on theofficial definitions but also on modern requirements as defined by high-levelguidance. Officials can probably be most effectively helped by the circulation of as much detailed guidance as possible in departmental securityinstructions. It would be a real help to them if the. official definitions; Could be amplified in each Department by up-to-date examples, drawn fromits Own field of activity. /42. Beyond this there are certain procedures which we put forward as justifying wider adoption. The tendency to play safe is likely to be morepronounced in junior than in senior staff. We recommend, therefore, that departments should consider seriously whether some limitation of authorityto apply security classifications might not be embodied in a working rule-^-as is already the practice in some Departments. A possible alternative isto lay down that none of the higher grades of classification is to be regardedas more than provisional until it has been confirriied by an officer of the rank of, say, Principal (or his equivalent). This would mean in practicethat while no steps would be taken to hold up classified papers so long asaction was being taken on them, when action was completed the registry; would be under instruction to refer the papers to an appropriate officer for confirmation of the security grading before putting the papers away.43. The classification of information of a technical nature may lenditself to and indeed may require the issue of detailed guidance. We were impressed by the work of the committee which determines and regularlyreviews the security gradings to be applied to all aspects of weapons and-equipment being developed or produced by the Ministry of Aviation for theService Departments. This committee issues a graded guide to the securityclassification of each weapon and item of equipment under development or&quot;production; the guides being distributed within the Departments concerned and issued to contractors. The scope for such a system may be limited,but it is a valuable one in the technical and material field and consideration should be given to the possibility of its application in other spheres.f; 44. Finally there is the question what can be done to secure more effective downgrading or declassification of papers than is achieved atpresent.  The Governments secrets are often quite ephemeral.  For example,[Government policy on some particular aspect of foreign policy may properly be regarded as Secret until it is announced; thereafter the importance of itsprotection is. a very different matter.   We found our witnesses to be ratherSharply&quot; divided on this question. Some thought that once papers had ceased to be the subject of current action and were put away in a cupboardthe advantages of securing their downgrading or declassification did not justify the effort involved.  They suggested that an accumulation of &quot; dead &quot;
&quot;^fes^wiih^^bsplete-^security&apos; markings. was. a minor nuisance which had to&quot;be tolerated. Other; Departments apparently thought it worth their while to&apos; take&apos; fairly, vigorous steps to &quot;downgrade or declassify, old files, if only to relieve the pressure on their security . cupboard accommodation. - In one department for example;it has been found possible in the last two&apos; or three-years to- reduce-,the:. number ;.pf the most highly, classified documents byabout two-thirds. ,    - &quot;, ....... *................&apos;. - 45, Departments were equally divided on the question whether it wasfeasible to arrange for files to be downgraded or declassified,,automaticallyafter the lapse of a certain period. Some thought that this ought to be&quot;possible, others that given the variety of circumstances no general rule aboutautomatic downgrading would be universally applicable even within a single department and that it would be only infrequently that the officer responsiblewould feel able to issue a firm instruction that a particular file was to bedowngraded at some specific future date.: 46, Our own view is that most Departments would probably find itextravagant of effort to try to sort through their whole stock of classifiedpapers to see Which could be downgraded or declassified. The necessarydecisions could only be.taken by relatively senior officials in current touchwith the topics concerned, who would almost certainly have more importantthings to do. Nor do we think that it will often be possible to lay downgeneral rules providing for papers to be downgraded automatically. But wesuggest that Departments would be well advised to make a determined effort to prevent their accumulation of papers with obsolete security classificationsgrowing any larger than it already is. Such accumulation is wasteful of spaceand money and it imports an element of futility into security work. Wesuggest that departmental officers ought therefore to be encouraged andreminded to keep constantly in mind the value of downgrading papers andto give instructions for this purpose, wherever they see the opportunity;47.   Recommendations.   (a) The current reappraisal of relative security priorities should be pressed forward.(b) Each Department should amplify the standard definitions by examplesdrawn from its own field of activity.(c) Consideration should be given to limiting authority to apply the highersecurity classifications; or alternatively to providing that suchclassifications are to be regarded as provisional until confirmed by anofficer above a certain rank. ......(d) Consideration should be given to extending to other fields the technique of the committee which determines the security gradings to be appliedto classified information of a technical nature.(e) Departments should make a determined effort to check the furtheraccumulation of papers with obsolete classifications. &apos;
tlHAPTER ; 5.-PERSONNEL SECURITY IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE:THE PURGE PROCEDURE AND POSITIVE VETTING48. The arrangements for achieving personnel security in the publicservice have grown piecemeal. The main developments in Government policy have been as follows:A.-1948 V&apos; The first public statement of Government policy on the subject of personnel security in the public service was made when Mr. Attleeannounced in March 1948 that the Government intended to bar Com-munists and Fascists and their associates from employment in the CivilService in connexion with work the nature of which was &quot;vital to thesecurity of the State &quot;. He emphasised that this action was being takensolely on security grounds. The State was not concerned with the politicalviews, as such, of its servants and as far as possible alternative employment would be found for any deemed to be unsuitable for secret work. this statement of policy is regarded as still ruling. It is left to individual departments to decide which of their posts involve employment on work  the nature of which is &quot;vital to the security of the State&quot;. Officialguidance on this point has given primary emphasis to defence secrets.It is for the Minister of the Department concerned to make up his mind whether he ought to apply this policy to any particular Civil Servant.If he does seek to do so what is called the &quot; purge procedure &quot; comes intooperation. The procedure is that if, in the light of information obtainedfrom the Security Service or from other sources,-the Minister is satisfiedthat he ought to initiate action, the Civil Servant is so informed and isgiven such particulars relating to the allegations against him as can be disclosed without prejudicing secret sources of intelligence. He is then asked to say whether he accepts or denies the allegation. If he denies it,he may make written representation to the Minister and, if the allegationagainst him is still maintained, may ask for the case to be referred to a standing panel of Three Advisers. The Three Advisers hear evidence in private from representatives of the Department and of the Security Serviceand invite the Civil Servant concerned to appear before them in person.He is also permitted to ask third parties to testify as to his record,reliability and. character. After receiving the report of the Three Advisersthe Minister reconsiders his ruling. If he is still disposed to uphold it,the Civil Servant is given a final opportunity to make representations. Ifthey do not prevail, the Civil Servant will be posted to or retained in anon-secret branch within his own Department or, if this is not practicable,will be posted to a nonrsecret branch in another Department. If no suchalternative employment can be found for him, he will be offered the. alternative of resignation or dismissal, either of which involves the loss of&apos; ; superannuation rights (except that an officer of over 50 who resignsvoluntarily may receive at 60 the pension which had accrued to him at thetime of resignation).
B.-1952In January 1952 the Government announced that Civil Servantsemployed on exceptionally secret work would be subject to special overtenquiries. . This procedure, known as Positive Vetting, is aimed atestablishing the general integrity of the person concerned. The range of posts to which if applies consists of:  .(a). Those which involve regular and constant access to the most highlyI: &apos;      classified defence information or material.  .(b) Those giving access to the more highly classified categories of atomic energy information.; (c) In addition, Under-Secretaries and candidates under consideration for promotion to that rank are in all cases subject to Positive^      Vetting, regardless of, the posts which they occupy, since any Civil) Servant at this level must be regarded as likely to have access tohighly secret information.The Positive Vetting process consists of the following stages:   .(i) a check with the Security Service, to ascertain whether intelligencerecords contain any adverse information about the individual inquestion (which in practice means traces of Communist associationor sympathies or of other forms of subversive activity);(ii) completion by the subject of a standard security questionnaire(in which he is asked, inter alia, whether he has or has ever had. any. connexion  or  sympathies  with  Communist  or  Fascistorganisations); ...(iii) letters to two referees named by the subject asking for information&quot; bearing on his reliability and character;(iv) a field investigation into his character and circumstances.C.-1956 &apos;Although the practice of Positive Vetting for specially sensitive postshad started as early as 1952 and character defects had, even earlier,been regarded as liable to debar a man from occupying a post of thiskind, it was hot until after the Conference of Privy Councillors in 1956that the Government publicly declared that character defects, as distinct from Communist sympathies or associations, might affect a CivilServants posting or promotion. It does not seem that the consequences,to the man concerned, of this development of policy have been as fullyworked out in the context of character defects as in the context of communist sympathies. In the case of the latter the procedure requires a formal charge and provides a right of appeal to the Three Advisersif he is (or is to be) employed on work vital to the security of the State,or is in the running for promotion to the rank of Under-Secretary. by contrast a man regarded as suffering from some character defect withoutCommunist associations (however the relevant information is derived)is not posted to, or left in, a sensitive post; and his defect might conceivablydebar his promotion to senior rank. But Departments appear to follow noconsistent practice as regards intimating to.him any formal finding or decision adverse to him or providing him with a right of appeal to the
? Head of the Department under normal departmental procedures. (Ceasesi    of this sort are outside the jurisdiction of the Three Advisers.) i. 49. We must now consider how these procedures operate in practice,how far they are effective, and to what extent they are capable ofimprovement. .The Purge Procedure .2 ;50. To take the purge procedure first, the number of cases in recentyears has been smaller than in the earlier years. There is, of course, morethan one good reason why this should have been so. No doubt the mainone is that one is not comparing like with like. When the purge procedure was instituted in 1948 the Governments new policy had to be appliedto the whole existing body of Civil Servants in vital posts. Now it has tobe applied only to those newly moving into those posts each year.51. Nevertheless we were satisfied by the evidence that we heard thatin some Departments containing sensitive posts a number of cases is to befound where the departmental authorities (and the Security Service, as their advisers) are conscious that they are carrying an element of risk on thegrounds of a man&apos;s suspected Communist associations but at the same timefeel unable to take any overt action to protect themselves.52. We think that the pattern of departmental treatment of such casesemerged fairly clearly from our enquiries. Having regard to the pledges given in Parliament it is recognised that no action concerning posting orpromotion that is likely in any material way to affect a man&apos;s career shouldbe taken on the ground of suspected Communist association, unless he isto be formally challenged and given his right of appeal under the proceduredescribed at A in paragraph 48 above. Establishment officers are carefulin their recognition of this principle. On the other hand they remainwatchful about any man who, through vetting or otherwise, is marked withsome suspicion of current or fecent Communist association and they accordingly welcome an opportunity of posting such a man to a post in whichthere is little or no chance of his coming into contact with secret information.If the opportunity for such a transfer occurs, they take it, provided that itis not to the man&apos;s prejudice. If it does not, they remain so far as possibleoh the watch, choosing, if a sensitive post cannot be altogether avoided, a post as little sensitive as possible. No one can say that this is an altogethersatisfactory situation and we have had to consider whether there is anyfeasible improvement that we can recommend. But it is fair to say that,worked as the system is, it does not, in our view, deprive the individual ofany safeguard to which he is entitled, nor does it suggest a major securityrisk.53. It is natural to ask at this point whether it would not be possibleto clear up what difficulties there are by promoting a regular resort to thepurge procedure whenever there is any security misgiving on a matter of communist association. Is there&quot; some defect either in the current* terms ofreference of the Three Advisers or in their application of those terms to cases that come before them which is capable of correction?   We could* See Official Report 29th January, 1957,. cols: 155-6. aifET
find no useful-line of recommendation on this point Certainly, &quot;pripr to1956, there was a general impression -among the Departments that theThreeAdvisers, in dealing with what could often be no more than a questionof suspicion or risk, imposed too strict a standard of proof upon thechallenging; Department. ; This;.was intended, however, to be corrected bj/the report of the Conference of Privy Councillors, which not onlyencouraged the Three Advisers to tilt the balance in favour of the State,against the individual but also recommended that they should be required;t&amp;i answer the single direct question which now forms the main substance of,their terms of reference -&quot;Are there or are there not reasonable groundsfof supposing that the individual has or has recently had Communistsyhipathies or associations of such a type as to raise legitimate doubts about his reliability? &quot;; We cannot see how this question can be refined uponfurther. It does hot dispose precisely of the point which is troubling theDepartment, faced as it is with the problem of continuing to be responsiblefor the employment in what may be a highly sensitive post of a man in whose reliability it has insufficient confidence. Theoretically a negativeanswer by the Three Advisers ought satisfactorily to dispose of departmentaldoubts. In practice, it seems that it does not always do so and the anxietysometimes remains. But we cannot suggest that the situation would reallybe improved if the question to be referred to the Three Advisers were castin the explicit form: &quot; Is it or is it not reasonable to treat Mr. X as a security risk on account of suspected Communist association &quot;or sympathy? &quot;For one thing the-answer to that question is one purely of administrativeJudgment and it is not a question which can fairly be referred to a tribunal which; evenvif advisory; is naturally looked upon as an objective assessorof fact. For another, such a question removes even more completely fromthe Ministerial Head of the Department his constitutional responsibility foideciding whom he should or should not retain in the service of theDepartment; *  - -       -- 54. The fact is, as we see it, that there is unavoidably some contradictionbetween an appeal on a matter of this kind and the administrativeconsiderations.; that underlie it. Any tribunal in an appellate role is boundto approach its task in as judicial and as objective a spirit as the case allowsand in so doing it is unlikely on every occasion to dispose of departmentalrnisgivings about the nature of the continuing risk involved. But, accepting this, it is not practical politics to think of abolishing the right of appealunder the purge procedure, which since 1948 has been pledged by declarationsof Government policy and is plainly of value to individuals of doubtfulstatus. Nor, we think, is-it desirable to produce, some new formula to be incorporated into the Three Advisers&apos; terms of reference, which will stillmore positively tilt the balance in favour of the suspicion. To do that&quot;would be to destroy altogether the reality of the promised appeal.: -55.. It does not follow, however, that there is not even now some&quot;contribution to be made by a more active policy in Departments witlj;regard to suspected cases of Communist association and sympathy. It ispot satisfactory just to sit back and feel unhappy. The onus should weigh;we think, in favour of bringing to a head any serious suspicion and ofgenuinely clearing anyone against whom suspicions cannot be maintained.This involves three things: . vt .n
.-. (a) scrutiny in the Department of what the evidence supplied by, the,jt?;t.   -Security.. Service really amounts -tq;..r-,.r.        - y ^,,i,  jV?feJ&quot;3T (6) - candid disclosure by the Security-Service (of &quot;course,&quot; in ther strictest!V.-     confidence and to only the most responsible officials) ofc its&apos;, material;. - and its weight;      -..&apos;-&apos; i   &apos;.- &apos;:- .-.&apos;&quot;&apos;.&apos;&apos; ,&apos;-&apos;.&apos;.       r &quot;-.&apos;- b ;io .^ (c) more frequent resort to the purge procedure in marginal cases.asuatraIt also involves an acceptance by Government Departments generally-that&apos;Civil&apos; Servants who have to be transferred from secret work on grounds Of-Communist associations or sympathies are a charge&apos;oh&apos;;the government service as a whole.  We return to this point in paragraph-62.:The Positive Vetting Procedure        f lI   56.   We now turn to the system of Positive Vetting. 3 It has this in common with the purge procedure that it involves a decision whether a man-is to be cleared on security grounds for holding a particular post; but the:post in this case is not described as involving work &quot; vital to the security;of the State&quot; but as falling either within certain recognised categories of:which the typical one involves constant and regular access to the most highly?,classified defence information or is otherwise of major security importance.!The one system of protection therefore overlaps the other in a somewhatconfusing way, for whereas the purge procedure only threatens a man&apos;position on the ground of Communist association (except that the ThreerAdvisers  are  permitted  to  fortify  their  views  on evidence  of  such-association by consideration of any character defects reported to them), aman may on the other hand be refused P.V. clearance on the grounds ofcharacter defect alone or of Communist association alone, apart from the-possibility that he may be regarded as affected by both defects at once.To him it makes little difference under which head his fault is thought to lie.   In either case&apos;his career in his Service is threatened with diversion,possibly blockage and in an extreme case with a premature end.   Yet,whereas he is guaranteed a right to appeal in cases where he may be,prejudiced by a charge of Communist association, there is no appeal to any:comparable body open to him where P.V. clearance is refused on the ground of character defect.   Nor could there well be such an appeal unless thetribunal appealed to were in effect to take over the whole responsibility of anian&apos;s Department for his posting and promotion.  This seems impossible.57. The P.V. system has now been operating for some nine years.&quot;Within its limits it is, we think, an effective system. It produces at the.relevant point of time a good deal of material information bearing upon aihan&apos;s background, associations, character and way of life, and this isinformation which is not otherwise readily obtainable in a Service whose members nowadays know little of each other&apos;s lives, away from the office.It helps to eliminate from sensitive posts persons obviously unsuitable onthe ground of a patent character defect. ,    . -58.   The inherent weakness in Positive Vetting, as we see it, is thatthe field enquiries only; rarely throw up material which is &quot; hard &quot; enpugHifor; any conclusive action to be founded upon them.  Traces of Communist
association&quot; are &apos; usually derived from intelligence recofdsl rather than from the field enquiries or security- questionnaires. What the investigationsCovered; by&apos;Positive Vetting do expose-^on the rare occasions when anythingadverse;- turns: lip at all-are defects of character or combinations of circumstances insobriety, financial instability, untruthfulness, irregularsexual or marital relations, family connexions behind the Iron Curtain, etc.-the significance of which is largely dependent upon their particular context.While it can be said that in theory such defects constitute vulnerability totemptation or pressure, they do: not present themselves as necessarily the,most dangerous traits from a security point of view and they do not in,practice make a very firm base for action against a person as a security risk,,unless he is to be envisaged as placed in some special situation, such asservice behind the Iron Curtain.59. Any Department which is faced with the task of making a; P.V.assessment of one of its officers is presented with, a dilernrria that does hot.admit of any completely satisfactory solution. If it treats all character;defects as security risks and acts accordingly, it is imposing an excessively!high, standard upon the morals and conduct of a particular section of thepublic service, and, by so doing, is affecting its postings and promotions,;possibly without either formal disciplinary proceedings or a right of appeal,such as exists under the purge procedure. If, on the other hand, it exercises a-discretionary judgment upon each case, as in effect it is bound to do, italternates between giving P.V. clearance in a number of cases with some.misgivings on the score of possible security dangers and refusing the clearance in other cases, With the consequent obligation to find an acceptableposting for the &quot;suspected&quot; person that is unfair neither to him nor to the!Service.. &apos; &apos;   .-&apos; - &apos; r     \   . \        . *&quot;: 60. W? did. not get the impression, that the burden of working the P.V.system in this way has,, generally speaking, proved too heavy for the.Departments principally concerned. It has usually been found possible to5accommodate acceptably in non-sensitive posts either in the same or another department persons who have failed to obtain P.V. clearance on the grounds&apos;of; character defect. But we were warned again and again by those responsible fpr these questions in different Departments that ihe position thatthey were left in was Unsatisfactory. What they hoped for was a clearer and!&apos;publicly available definition of their responsibilities and ,duties with regardto cases where character defects potentially affect security. We return tothis in paragraph, 64. In the meantime we must record our impression thatin this matter Departments generally are fully conscious of a duty to balance the interests of security against the rights and expectations of the individual&apos;!Civil Servant; and have given much care and thought to the Working out!of! the relationships as fairly as possible.- &quot;61: Theoretically, the whole P.V. system would be much simpler andeasier to apply if a man who could not obtain clearance was required toleave the Service as unsuitable for further employment. He is; ex hypothesisin greater or less degree a security risk and that fact in itself impairs hisutility for his! defect, such as it is, means that he is not available for employment throughput the whole range of the Service: We considered the-feasibility of such a recommendation but felt bound to reject it;  The penalty&apos;
of forced retirement or &quot;disintegration&amp;sai^rwith &quot;the displacement and&apos; forfeiture of superannuation rights that it implies (at least below the age of 50) -would-!in- very: many cases be totally&apos; disproportionate to the offence&quot; of being 1-liriqualified for pivotal. clearance. For example, there are defects of characteror circumstance which, however relevant to security Considerations, do hotin-ahy way prevent a man carrying out his duties efficiently in the office.Again, marriage to a wife with relatives in China or behind the Iron Curtaininvolves ho reproach at all in respect of character or conduct of the personaffected. While there may indeed be a case for a more determined weedingbut of Civil Servants on the ground of inefficiency or for disciplinary reasons,When P.V. investigation has afforded the thorough assessment of Weaknessesthat would not otherwise have been possible we do not think that, so long asinnocuous posts can fairly be found for such people in the Government service,if would be right to remedy the difficulties of the present position by institutinga policy of discharging persons on the mere ground that they are technicallya security risk and therefore cannot be cleared for sensitive posts.62. So far as we can see the present system will work all right for thefuture but its maintenance depends upon the observance of certain conditionsWhich we deal with in this and the two following paragraphs. First, itmust; be clearly accepted that persons who cannot be cleared on PositiveVetting but who are not inefficient or in breach of accepted standards of discipline are a charge upon the Government service as a whole. It is nottp be- expected that those Departments that carry a large proportion ofP.V. posts to their total complement will always be able to find non-sensitiveposts for uncleared persons without prejudicing their future careers. the remedy is an effective system of inter-departmental transfers, since secret-posts represent only a small proportion of; the total number of posts in theService and there are a number of large departmental employers whose work involves very little contact with classified information or material. Aswe have said, there has been a number of staff transferred from one department to another on this ground in recent years. Generally speaking,such transfers have been arranged through the agency of the Treasury, butit has not been concealed from us that it has not always been easy tonegotiate a transfer by agreement when the subject of it is someone who hasupon him even the slight imputation of a character defect or a suspicion of Communist association. This is one of the awkward by-products of the-P.V. system. Nevertheless we take the View that it is.important that those persons whom we have described as a charge upon the Government service as-a whole should be freely accepted wherever there are posts availableto them in the Government service which do not involve securityconsiderations; otherwise the consequences of a responsible maintenance ofthe P.V. system are likely in the end to prove unacceptable. ministers and Heads of Departments must, we think, approach their obligations witha-clear understanding of this necessity; As now, the Treasury should beused as the clearing house for these purposes and its consideredrecommendations for placing should be treated as having the force ofinformal arbitration. At the same time it should be a firm rule that noDepartment should ask another to help it out by accepting a transfer of aP:V. reject until it has satisfied the Treasury that it cannot, properly retainhim within its own field of appointment. Departments must in the first,instance consume their own smoke. v.. fc p ih
:, , 63, Secondly we think that the procedure governing an officer who is;refused P..V/ clearance on grounds,of character defect, alone and , whose careervssiii^e^veWlx-^if?cfed. thereby should/carry;,a..clearer right of appeal tjvanjappears to exist-: at \ present.,; - We .have jgiyen earlier our reasons for thinking,that - the^T-tocee Advisers cannot be, brought into this, and we are conscipusit^at questions of P.V. clearance&apos; are; often inextricably associated with:questions of posting and promotion out of which the P.V. investigation itselfarises. Nevertheless the refusal of a, P.V. clearance is itself, or can be:made to bes, a,definite decision dependent upon the existence of certain facts?and an assessment of their weight. In our view the general, rule should be,that an officer who is the subject of such a decision ought to be informedthat it has been made and of its grounds. He knows already that the investigation is going on and it seems only fair that he should be told of:the result. He should also be told that, if he wishes to challenge the;decision, he is entitled to appeal to and bring the matter up before the.Head of his Department and to argue his case.64. The third condition is that the Government must make it clearlyknown to everyone concerned what are the implications of Positive Vettingand what are the respective rights and responsibilities that arise out of it.We do not think that this, information is sufficiently clear to-day and we;have not found any document or instruction which is adequately explicit.Ilack of this seems to be partly the cause of the departmental embarrassments&apos;to which We have alluded and in our view that particular cause can and;should be removed. We think therefore that a new and franker statement ofGovernment policy in the matter of personnel security should be reflected ina revision of the Standard form of warning about security which is published in the prospectus of competitions held by the Civil Service Commission.;  65.  We do not recommend any substantial curtailment of the enquiries/under the Positive Vetting procedure. They undoubtedly have their uses and many case we recognise that the Government could not easily defend a situationin which it failed;to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself as to the general;background and character of the people to whom it was entrusting its mostrimportant secrets.  But it follows from our general comments that we would;not.recommend the extension of the procedure to a wider category of Civil.Servants or posts.   In theory security could be strengthened by extendingPositive Vetting enquiries to posts with access to any secret defenceinformation or to whole grades or classes whose members may have access&apos;to such information.  But, given the tenuousness of the connexion which wehave found between the information revealed by enquiries of this nature and security, we think that this would be misplaced effort.: &apos;66. We also considered whether the Positive Vetting procedure could in ,some way be made, more effeotive. At present the Investigating Officers,are for the most part retired Police Officers (many with experience in theSpecial Branch) or retired officers from the Armed Forces, Colonial Services,&amp;c. In general we found that Departments are quite well satisfied with thetact and perspicacity with which these officers go about their tasks and with,the quality of the reports which they submit on each case. We ourselves-saw. a number of such reports and thought that they were entirely adequate,in quality.   .&apos;. .
67. Nor do we think that there is much to be gained by making &quot;tfiefield investigations more elaborate than they are at present, for exampleby asking for more character referees than the present&apos; two, by takingfingerprints or by making it the regular practice to undertake enquiries inthe: neighbourhood of the man&apos;s home. Generally speaking, the enquiriesmade at present seem to us to be about as extensive as is profitable. Beyondthe minimum procedures laid down, it must be left to the discretion of theindividual Investigating Officer how far and in what quarters he presses his enquiries in any particular case.68. It is an admissible criticism of the procedure that, since it is left tothe individual being vetted to nominate his own character referees, thereferees themselves may not be trustworthy. We considered the suggestionthat to meet this point the referees themselves should as a matter of routinebe checked through the Security Service,, On balance we do not recommend the adoption of this proposal. We suggest that what is wanted is that theInvestigating Officer should be under clear instructions that it is part of, his$ask to satisfy himself of the referee&apos;s bona fides and that he is to take such. steps to that end as he thinks necessary.&apos; 69. There is, however, one direction: in which we see scope for someextension of the Positive Vetting: effort: and that..concerns the matter of.reviewing.; We observed a tendency among: the Home Departments to look upon Positive Vetting as ;a once^for-aU:,.process, and to assume that a P.Vclearance, once given, could be regarded as, of indefinite validity. . Thiswould be an unrealistic view, even if one was dealing only with mature adultsiIn fact some young employees have,to be P:Vds before: they, can sensiblyLberegarded as mature at all. To; begin with;&apos; thereforej we think that thepublic service should make a general practice of the rule now, followed inthe Foreign Service under which any P.V case under 21 should be reviewedannually until the age of 21 is reached, - ,f ; 70. Even so, older men are capable of changing their behaviour andtvay of life and, to some extent their character. For this reason&apos;we suggestthat Positive Vetting must be regarded in principle as a form of ClearanceWhich requires re-examination from; time to time so long as the manConcerned is in a post subject to P.V. We recommend the adoption of whatis.m substance the present practice of the Foreign Service and the atomic energy Authority: to review each case regularly at the end of five years from the last vet and, apart from that, at any time within the period if thereis a marked change of circumstance affecting the man that is likely to bear upon his security rating.&apos;r&apos; 71. Such a re-examinatibh does not call for a repetition of all the stepsof the original P.V. procedure. The procedure required is that the Securityfile should be studied and a decision taken whether to reaffirm the clearancewithout further action or to reinvestigate the case to; cover the period of time since the previous clearance was granted. When a case is selected forreinvestigation, action should include- as a minimum an examination of theEstablishment file,&apos; an interview with ;ari officer who has; supervised the&apos; workof the individual during the last five years and an interview with the officerResponsible for security at. the individual^ establishment. New significantinformation should be followed up as necessary. If the information suggests
a subversive connexion the Security Service should be consulted. After the&quot;satisfactory completion of the review of a case the existing Clearance shouldbe reaffirmed and the date of the reaffirrhation should be recorded. &quot;&apos;&apos;. 72. Side by side with the practice of reviewing there should be developed and maintained a system within the Department which ensures that any item of information received about an officer from whatever source which mayhave a possible bearing on his security is seen by the branch responsible forpersonnel security questions. This is largely a matter of good departmental organisation and to some extent of good filing. It is important that such asystem should be attended to because, as we have already pointed out, theamount that is known within an ordinary home Department about the privatelives and behaviour of its employees is extremely limited. No amount of instruction as to vigilance in reporting conduct of possible security significanceis likely to alter this situation and it remains a limiting factor in the effectiveness of the personnel security system as a whole.73. There is one type of case where particular care is needed before P.V.clearance can be granted or maintained. This is the case where a publicservant returns to his service after being held captive or interned for anysubstantial period (by which we have in mind a period of say three months)In Communist hands. From evidence which we have heard and from our examination of the recent case of Blake we think that there must be a riskinvolved in employing anyone who has been through such an experience phsecret work. While we recognise that circumstances may arise in which itWill be thought right to take a calculated risk, we recommend that the general rule should be adopted that no one in the category we have described shouldbe re-employed (or employed for the first time) in any post within the field of Positive Vetting.74.  Recommendations r(a) Departments should do their best to resolve one way or another casesof suspected Communist associations or sympathies which have notbeen submitted to the purge procedure. This involves, candiddisclosure to Departments by the Security Service of its information,careful assessment of this information by the Department, more frequent resort to the purge procedure, and readiness by departments which have non-secret posts available to accept on transfer Communistassociates and sympathisers.(b) Adequate arrangements should be provided, under the auspices of theTreasury, for the transfer from sensitive to non-sensitive Departments,where necessary, of persons who cannot be cleared on P.V. but arenot inefficient or in breach of accepted standards of discipline.       ,(c) If an officer is refused P.V. clearance on grounds of character defectalone and his career will be adversely affected thereby he should&quot; asa general rule be informed of the fact and allowed to bring the matter up before the Head of his Department if he wishes.(d) The Government should explain more clearly the implications of.   rv Positive Vetting; and this should be reflected in prospectuses, &amp;c;v-      issued by the Civil Service Commission.   Thereafter the standing- instructions on personnel security should be. revised. ni
.&apos;. (e) Investigating Officers should be under standing instructions to satisfy1:.!).. themselves :of the bona fides of character referees. . &quot;!:^: (/) Any P.V. cases under 21 should be reviewed annually until that age isreached.

The views and recommendations which we have expressed in earlierChapters apply equally to the Foreign Service and to the Service and civil departments. While our enquiries have been directed primarily towardssecurity policy and procedures as they apply in the public service generallythere are several separate points relating to the special circumstances ofparticular services or Departments to Which we think it right to call attention.The Foreign Service76. The maintenance of security in the Foreign Service is in many waysmore difficult than in the Home Civil Service. The staff are dispersed all overthe world in relatively small units; and, operating in foreign countries, they are subject to attack by foreign intelligence services on a scale far greater(particularly in countries behind the Iron Curtain) than is known in thiscountry.77. On the other hand Foreign Service officers can be in little doubt asto the reality of the various threats to security. The man who has actuallyhad a concealed microphone detected in his dining-room wall Can more readily be trained and persuaded to adopt a high standard of discipline andalertness in security matters than his counterpart in the Home Civil Service.The Foreign Service also has the advantage of being a relatively small service,whose members tend to know each other (and each other&apos;s families) personallyas well as officially. This makes it possible to maintain a more effective system of personal vetting than is possible in the Home Civil Service, wherelittle is known inside the office of a man&apos;s private life and habits.78. We formed the impression that the Foreign Service is alert to theimportance of security precautions and that there is an effective security organisation in the Foreign Office. Since the defection of Burgess and Macleanthere has been a thorough overhaul of security procedures and this hasresulted in an attitude different from that which may have prevailed in earlier years. Virtually all members of all branches of the Foreign Service are subject to Positive Vetting.   Although it cannot be the case that every
Foreign Official has &quot; constant and regular&quot; access to the most highlyclassified information, we were informed that in view of the high degree ofmobility imposed on the Service and of the. difficulties of administration which would be caused by the treatment of some posts as requiring a higherdegree of security clearance than others it was regarded as necessary tosubject the whole staff to the P.V. procedure. This seems to us to be areasonable policy to adopt: and the same rule is in fact in force in the moresenior posts in the Commonwealth Relations Office. )79. Security problems are particularly urgent in Her Majesty&apos;s missions in countries of the Soviet bloc since members of the staff at all levels are an obvious target for hostile intelligence services. The best defence is a high standard of security discipline and of general morale. In our view the ForeignOffice are right to insist that the provision of amenities such as clubs, canteens,recreational facilities, &amp;c, while desirable in the interests of welfare and morale in any circumstances, is an essential precaution for Iron Curtainposts since by helping to maintain morale in uncongenial surroundings theyrender the staff less vulnerable to subversion and accordingly help to promote a good standard of security.80. This exposure of all members of a Mission to hostile intelligenceattack is something of which the Foreign Office cannot too clearly remindDepartments (such as the Service Departments) who attach staff to diplomatic missions. Junior staff are just as critical for this purpose as their seniorsand are likely to find it more difficult to solve the problems of adaptation tolocal conditions. Very great care should therefore be taken in the selection ofall such staff. Moreover it is unwise to allow them too long a tour of duty,since the longer a man stays the more vulnerable he is likely to become; andreposting after such an appointment should be a matter of the most carefulscrutiny.Foreign Wives81. The suggestion is sometimes heard that foreign wives of foreign service officers represent a special risk to security. We do not believe thatthere is any substance in this. It is to be expected that many diplomats shouldmarry foreign wives and we do not doubt that the Foreign Service and thecountry have greatly gained thereby. But we regard it as essential that thesecurity element of the question should always be borne in mind in theForeign Office, both at the time when the initial decision is taken that the marriage of a member of the Foreign Service to a foreign wife is or is riotcompatible with his retention in the Service and thereafter whenever theofficers posting is under consideration.Locally-engaged Staff Overseas . :j82. It is the normal practice of the Foreign Office to recruit junior ^ndancillary staff (interpreters, clerks, messengers, cleaners, drivers, &amp;c.) for her majesty&apos;s Missions overseas from the nationals of the country in which theMission is situated. Our attention was drawn to the special security problems to which this practice gives rise in Missions behind the Iron.Curtain, sincelocally-engaged staff have to be assumed, and are frequently in practice proved,to be agents of the local intelligence service. This is a most serious, andharassing consideration.  Steps are taken to deny locally-engaged staff access
^a^Il^^ln*SjnMti&amp;^aiM ^d^M^teJ^aaajBa:^&quot; of. diplomatic^ Missions&quot;into zones of different degrees&apos; of security, so that the access of such-staffcan be effectively controlled. Nevertheless it is impossible no prevent them from observing points about the Character and activities of members of theMission and their visitors which? might be^ of ^alueKtbsashostile^ihtelhgence&apos; service; and they have considerable opportunity to install eavesdroppingdevices. We were informed matHtHe^oVietipractice :-is to staff all the posts;iin its diplomatic Missions wi^ with theForeign Office whether it would be feasible to eliminate locally-engagedstaff at least from British Missions behind the Iron Curtain.  We came to therConclusion, however, that it would be virtually impossible &apos;toi find peopleprepared to undertake these Jobs who had sufficient knowledge of the; appropriate languages and conditions to do them effectively!   From ther language point of. view alone they would have to he retained in posts for a. relatively long period and the longer they stayed the more vulnerable they,would be likely to become.  We accept with regret, therefore,, that it is notfeasible to eliminate locally-engaged staff from Missions behind the iron curtain.   The necessary alternative is that an exceptionally high standardof security discipline needs to be maintained in these Missions and no securityprecaution in the lay-out and structure of buildings or in protective devicescan safely be omitted.The Service Departments83. The Service Departments have special problems of their own which arise largely from the fact that they are staffed jointly by members of two different services-the Civil Service and the Armed Services concerned. .84. The Admiralty has in the past had no single or co-ordinated security organisation, responsibility being spread over a number of branches. Froma study of the report of the Romer Committee and from the direct evidence which we heard we think that it was this weakness of organisation, combined with insufficient alertness to the importance of security, which made it possiblefor the espionage activities of Houghton and Miss Gee to remain undetectedfor so long. The First Lord of the Admiralty announced in the House ofLords on 5th July, 1961, that a new Security Department was to be set up within the Admiralty &quot; in which all the threads of personnel and material.,security as they affect both the civilian establishment and the Fleet will bebrought together &quot;. The new Department was to be staffed both by naval officers and civilians and its responsibility was described as &quot; ensuring thatthe security arrangements at headquarters and Naval establishments are working properly and for seeing that the regulations are fully understood and applied; and it will have the staff to enable it to test this by inspection in thefield&quot;.   This Department was set up on 29th August, 1961.85. In the War Office, both at Headquarters and at all its outstations, andin all establishments, formations and units under Army command,responsibility for personnel security lies with the Principal EstablishmentOfficer for Civilians and with the Director of Military Intelligence (D.M.I.)for Service personnel. Responsibility for documentary and physical securityis divided as follows: m2&apos;5
.For War Office Headquarters and Research and Development&quot; :;i ^Establishments; Royal Ordnance Factories and certain other establishmentswhich were transferred: in 1959 from the Ministry of Supply, the chain ofresponsibility is from the Head of the establishment of branch, throughthe Assistant Under-Secretary of State, to the Permanent Under-Secretary: : of State.At all other War Department establishments responsibility is in themilitary command chain, security procedures being laid down by theD.M.I. At these establishments, security inspections are carried out bythe counter-intelligence units of the Intelligence Corps. ;      ;; Thus, in any particular establishment, there may be two lines of responsibility in respect of personnel security one for civilian personnel and the other for Army personnel. There is, however, in any one establishment, only onechain of command relating to physical security.86. In the Air Ministry responsibility for personnel security in respectof civilian staff both at Headquarters and at outstations rests with thePrincipal Establishment Officer, who is also responsible for physical anddocumentary security throughout Air Ministry Headquarters. The PrincipalEstablishment Officer is assisted by the Head of one of the Civil Establish-ment Divisions to whom the Chief Security Officer is responsible for physical and documentary security. Each directorate or division of theAir Ministry is required to appoint its own security officer.87. Responsibility for personnel security in respect of members of theRoyal Air Force both at Air Ministry Headquarters and at outstations lies with the Director-General of Personal Services, advised by the assistant chief of Air Staff (Intelligence). Personnel Security investigations are carried out by trained security officers of the Provost and Security Servicesregional organisation, controlled by the Director of Personal Services(Provost Marshal). In addition, D.P.S. (P.M.) is responsible for the investigation of subversive or suspected subversive activities which are calculated to undermine the loyalty, morale, or discipline within the RoyalAir Force.... 88. The main question which arises from this diversity of organisationand practice is whether the new Admiralty organisation, which represents a marked change from the existing system in any of the service departments, best meets the needs of the Admiralty and, if so, whether asimilar organisation could profitably be established in the War Office andthe Air Ministry. We do hot think that it would be sensible toexpress a view on either of these questions until the new Admiraltyorganisation is a tested working system. There is no absolute ruleto be insisted upon and Departments must have flexibility in meetingtheir own circumstances, it is to be expected that in the Admiralty:this new organisation will focus much more attention on security than, hitherto and will bring together much work which has in the past been,only loosely, if at all, cO-ordinated. Much will depend on the general(attitude throughout the Department from the highest level down. We thinkthat the right course is to regard the new.organisation as experimental andto keep its progress under review.   Such a review ought not in our Opinion
to be regarded as a matter of solely domestic concern to the Admiralty,jsince it is-important that the other Service Departments (and possibly thetGiviji.; Departments;^ as well) should learn what lessons they can, from this new development:  We accordingly recommend that before the end of 1962such a review should be carried out with this wider object in mind.The Armed Forces. 89. : Evidence which we heard from the Heads of Intelligence of thethree Services showed that there is no uniformity in their arrangements forPositive Vetting of personnel. Positive Vetting is applied in all three services to selected posts, except that in the Royal Air Force all officers ofthe rank of Group Captain and above are subject to Positive Vetting. TheP.V. procedure carried out is in each case based on the procedure set outin the standing instructions and described in Chapter 5 above.90. We found that there are, however, a number of variations of practice in the different Services and also between the Services and theCivil Service, in particular in respect of field investigations. In our viewfield investigation procedures should be standard and we recommend thatthe three Services should make sure that their arrangements on this matterare in line with Civil Service practice.91. The three Services also differ in their arrangements for undertakingfield enquiries. In the Royal Navy these are carried out by a team of serving Naval officers, of the rank of Lieutenant-Commander or above,who usually serve on this work for two or three years. In the Army fieldenquiries, when carried out, have been undertaken either by Army personnelor by the Ministry of Aviation staff of Investigating Officers. The Army isat present in the process of enlisting a team of civilian Investigating Officersrecruited from retired service and police officers, with the object of startingbackground investigation on all subjects for Positive Vetting with five years&apos;or less service. In the Royal Air Force a team of civilian InvestigatingOfficers already exists and has, we are told, proved very satisfactory.92. We have two comments to make on these arrangements. The first is that it seems to us preferable to employ on these field enquiries civilianstaff rather than to entrust the work to serving officers for whom it is likelyto be no more than incidental to their main careers. We think that in thisrespect the practice adopted by the Royal Air Force and proposed for theArmy is preferable to that of the Royal Navy.   Our second comment is-that, it seems unnecessary and may be extravagant of manpower that each service should have a separate organisation for this purpose. Since a gooddeal of travelling is involved, a common-service organisation is likely to.-heeconomical in the Services, as it has been found to be in the Civil Service., We recommend, therefore, the formation of a single team of InvestigatingOfficers recruited from civilians of the necessary experience and working for all three Services.   This team should either be administered by the^Ministry; of Defence Or, by one of the Service Departments on behalf of all.As in the Civil Service, responsibility for assessing each case and for taking a: decision; to. grant or withhold; clearance would lie with each Service inrespect, of.its. own personnel, zzzvjvd r...:&apos;: &apos; tkiz     ; ; .

Many Government contracts, particularly in the defence field, are subject in whole of part to security classification and the protection ofclassified information and material in the hands of Government contractorsJis an important element in the security system. The security arrangementsamong Government contractors are broadly similar to. those in GovernmentDepartments^ The main features of the system are as follows. In addition-to the general sanctions of the Official Secrets Acts the contractor is requiredto undertake certain measures set out in detail in a security clause whichis included as a standard condition in all Government contracts which havea classified content. This provides for the exclusion from access to classified; information of any person who does not need such access for the properperformance of the contract, or who (unless the Department specifically; consents) is an alien or is not the servant of the contractor, or whom the, Department has required to be excluded; it gives the Department a right tobe supplied with full particulars of all persons handling classified information,to inspect the security arrangements of the firm, to control the placing of sub-contracts and so on. Failure to carry out these security obligationsgives the Department the right to terminate the contract.Procedures95. Either before or (more usually) after the contract has been signed the; Department sends the contractor written instructions (in a letter usually called the &quot;secret aspects letter&quot;) defining the security classification which is to beapplied to each part of the contract. In principle the application of the purgeprocedure and P.V. to contractors&apos; employees is on the same basis as in thepublic service. In practice these personnel security procedures, thoughsometimes calling for delicate handling, do not appear to present contractorswith major difficulties or embarrassment. - ,-&apos;96. In addition to the formal procedures, contracting firms are helpedin various ways to carry out their security obligations:(a) They are provided with a manual which gives both general and detailed guidance on security procedures.,(6) The Security Service runs special courses for industrial SecurityOfficers and occasional short courses for higher management.       &apos;
; (e) The Security Service employs a team of officers who act as Security5 Advisers to Government contractors. These officers, who act as; agents for the contracting Departments,, visit contracting firms to^ ; inspect their security arrangements and to offer help or advice oifanysecurity problems that may arise.We heard oral evidence on the working of these procedures both from theMinistry of Aviation and the Security Service and from representatives ofCertain Government contractors with experience of classified contract work.Comments97. The security of Government classified contracts cannot be achievedeither by the contracting Department or by the contracting firm alone. it requires an effort by both sides and co-operation between them.98. On the contractor^ part there seem to us to be two mainrequirements.(i) Employees at all levels must be given clear instructions as to securityrules to be observed, and so far as possible these rules should be incorporated in routine procedures so that their observance becomeslargely automatic.(ii) The firm must have an effective security organisation and takeadequate steps to see that security rules are obeyed. The needs ofdifferent firms vary according to their size and circumstance but inevery firm one individual, whether he is a whole-time Security officer or not, should be charged with particular responsibility for security.Many companies nominate a member of the Board of Directors (or,if his status is adequate, the Company Secretary) to take generalcharge of security matters. We regard this as an essential requirementand reoommend that any contracting firms which have not adoptedthis practice should be persuaded to do so. If it is known throughouta firm that the management insist on a high standard of security andthat the Security Officer has their full support, this attitude will be reflected in an awareness of security among employees generally.Because there is no easy way of persuading directors and managers togive a lead of this sort, it is the more important that Ministers and senior Civil Servants in the contracting Departments should take every opportunity that occurs to let it be known that the Government expectsa high standard of security among its contractors. In particular anysubstantial lapse in security by a contracting firm ought invariably tobe treated by the contracting Department as a serious matter, to bedealt with at the highest levels and in a suitably formal manner.99. In general we formed a favourable impression of the care which istaken by contracting firms to maintain a proper standard of security. they appeared to us to understand what is needed, to have established an adequateorganisation, and to be receptive of advice.100. The Government has for its part two main obligations towards itscontractors in relation to security. The first is to give them the clearestpossible instructions as to the classification of the various parts of each
contract. Although the procedure of the &quot;secret aspects letter&quot; appearsgenerally to work well, several firms complained to us that the letter didhot always give them sufficiently clear or detailed guidance. Indeed itsometimes suggested that the contracting Department was confused in itsown mind about the real security requirements of the contract. We feel bound to emphasise that the responsibility for defining the securityclassification of contracts rests solely with the contracting Department. - we regard it as essential that formal instructions for this purpose, set out in clear and detailed terms, should be issued in respect of every classifiedcontract and that this.should be done with the minimum delay. Unless this practice is followed in every case with scrupulous care, we see scope for serious confusion and misunderstanding.101. The Governments second duty is to give contractors as muchhelp and advice as they need and to supervise and. inspect their security arrangements, i The written advice provided; by the manual seemed to usto be valuable and to be well regarded by the firms whom we met. Forthe rest security advice is provided by the team of Security Service officers who act as Security Advisers to individual firms. Although it might beconsidered more logical for the Security Advisers to be provided by the contracting Departments, the present arrangement works well and we aresatisfied, that there are solid grounds for maintaining it.102. All the evidence which we heard showed that contracting firmsrespect and welcome the advice and prompt assistance which they receive from the Security Advisers- both in the course of their regular visits andad hoc when special problems arise. Although we do not think that thepresent frequency of such visits of inspection is seriously inadequate, thedifficulties of the existing team giving sufficiently detailed attention to the numerous industrial establishments undertaking classified contracts areself-evident and we recommend that the team should be increased in size.We regard it as important that these officers should have time, in additionto their primary task of inspection and advice, to arrange or undertake acertain amount of security education in industry and to develop and maintaincontacts with the various contracting Departments. We recommend that the size of the increased team should be decided with these considerations inmind.103.   Recommendations(a) Government contractors engaged on classified work should issueclear instructions to their employees on the security rules to be observed and should maintain an adequate security organisation. Amember of the Board of Directors should normally be nominated as generally responsible for security matters. Contracting departments should treat any substantial lapse in security by a contractor as aserious matter. .......(b) Contracting Departments must issue clear, detailed and promptinstructions defining the security aspects of every classified contract.(c) The team of Security Advisers should be strengthened.
CHAPTER 8.-PHYSICAL AND DOCUMENTARY SECURITY AND\-/- SECURITY TRAINING oj- - :104, Our review of personnel security procedures led us to the broadConclusion that there is no feasible system which can offer a completeassurance that every member of the public service who has access to secret information will prove trustworthy at all times and in all circumstances.While the present procedures can be relied upon with a fair degree ofconfidence to reveal recent association with Communist organisations or individuals it cannot be assumed that they are of anything like equalefficacy in pinpointing the man who may at some future time turn traitorfor ideological or psychological reasons (or a mixture of the two). Andit is the most effective and therefore the most dangerous spies who arcmost likely to slip undetected through the personnel security net.Physical Security- 105. This suggests that the maintenance of a high standard of physical and documentary security must always remain of the first importance. Wehave not examined in detail the standing instructions relating to physicalsecurity but we are satisfied that there are adequate arrangements forsecuring co-ordination of policy in this field and we proceed on theassumption that the standards of protection which are laid down in thestanding instructions are adequate. The real difficulty lies not so much indevising standards or procedures as in ensuring that they are regularly and properly observed...... 106.  We rank as first in importance observance of the &quot; need to know &quot;principle, under which classified information should be disseminated nowider than is required for the efficient discharge of the business in hand;If may well be easier to state than to apply it, but unless a conscious attempt is made to apply it, security will be jeopardised at once. In this contextthe formal indoctrination technique should be taken as the working modeLWhen this technique is applied in respect of some particularly secret subject;information about it is restricted to a named list of officers and each isrequired to undergo some procedure of formal indoctrination before he islisted. The technique is necessarily expensive in time and staff, but we arein no doubt that it provides a higher standard of security than can beachieved in any other way.I. 107. Reduced to essentials, physical security is largely a matter ofregulating access to premises and documents and of locking things upSafely. While there are still certain deficiencies of equipment, in practicecarelessness is probably a much more serious threat to security thaninadequacy of equipment. Inspections of offices by security staff afterworking hours are recommended in the standing instructions as a regularroutine and there is no doubt that they have a salutary effect, provided thatproper arrangements exist for breaches of security to be reported to theSecurity Officer and to higher authority as necessary and for such reports to; be -followed up and action taken. This is a point at which senior officerscan, with relatively small expenditure of their own time, make it clear to thestaff that security is for them an active concern.     ;   ;      :n
Protection of Documents-and Material : t(i   : - ji108. Accepting, however, that in the last resort there is no procedure&apos;of personnel or physical security which will offer complete protection against the ill-disposed public servant Who has access to secret information,there remains the question whether any further steps can be taken at least to make the illicit removal of documents or material from a Governmentestablishment sufficiently risky to deter the waverer.109. It is important to grasp in this connexion that, while in certain cases verbal information or manuscript notes may suffice, the chances arjsthat anyone engaging in espionage will be under pressure from his mastersto.provide information in documentary, probably photographic, form. Hewill need therefore either to photograph classified documents in the office or to remove them temporarily from, the office so that. they can . bephotographed elsewhere. . w Vi-110. On this basis it is possible to concentrate on two critical points:: The opportunity to make copies of documents, photographically orotherwise, in the office. This requires above all privacy-the ability towork singly in a room. It would be absurd to suggest that no one in theCivil. Service should have a room to himself, but the security aspect of thequestion should not be overlooked when accommodation is being planned,particularly accommodation for typing, duplicating or photo-copying staff.When officers do -work csingly, it is desirable to arrange for inter--communication between adjoining rooms by door, window or hatch. -&apos; &apos; 111. Attention. must also be given to the opportunities Offered by officers staying late in the office or coming in at times -Outside ohOrhialworking hours. &apos; There need, riot be anything sinister in this, - of course but the security authorities of a Department ought to know which membersOf the staff have such a habit. We recommend, therefore^ the generaladoption by Departments having any substantial amount of sensitive workOf the practice of requiring anyone leaving late or coming in at odd times to sign in and. out in a book, to be subject to regular inspection by theSecurity Officer. . . : r     .   &apos; ,7v&apos;\ &apos;&quot;1-12. -The opportunity to take classified documents out of the bffiee.--we considered all the obvious methods of detecting such practices-routine ofsnap checks, searches, either of the person of of bags, brief cases, &amp;c. It iiqiiite plain that they could never be wholly effective against a determinedperson: and to have even a likelihood of being effective they would be intolerable to those concerned. While it is possible that the chance of beingsearched would have some deterrent effect, it seems much more than possible,that searches would be resented by the staff and would have a bad effect onstaff relations. We should ourselves share their resentment and have;&apos;concluded; therefore, that there is no workable procedure that we canrecommend for the detection of unauthorised removal of classified documents;113. We ought to mention, since it is related to one of the difficulties thatwe met, that it is not improper per se to take classified documents out, o?Government premises: The propriety depends on ad hoc permission ofdefined fujes.&apos;- We doubt very much; whether the existing rules are carefullyobserved and this may be because they are not suitably adapted to presentconditions. We think that the authorities might well consider their revision.-5
Security Training and Education-;:..! ^ -        &apos; \v..:h::/:;   r114.  It would be unreasonable- to expect a. high standard of securityoisi,i-the public service unless adequate: training and education were provided.  Inour view these- are two -main needs.   First, there must foe training of Civil,Servants (or Service officers) who,: are appointed to deal specifically with security questions, whether in a whole-time post of Security Officer or on apkrt-timc basis.   All such men should be given; some formal training; insecurity work.   This training should be designed primarily to give securitystaff; an insight into the nature of the various threats to security, to persuade them that the challenge which these threats presents makes security a worth-while job, and to instruct them in the necessary techniques.  We think that,in the main training of this sort ought to be regarded as the responsibility ofthe Security Service and. carried out by. them.  Generally, speaking this work is done by them at present, but we think that, having regard to the tenor ofour recommendations, some increase of staff engaged on these training duties.,is called for.   A refresher course can be even more useful than an initialcourse, and we see much advantage in giving a newly-appointed SecurityOfficer a relatively brief course of initial training followed by a few monthsof practical experience in a security post and then to recall him for a refreshercourse, when further training can be assimilated against the background of atleast limited practical experience. .L-* 1151   The second requirement is the much wider task of persuading the;general body of public servants who are handling or are liable to handle;classified information that security is a matter of practical importance.  the biggest single risk to security at the present time is probably a general lackof conviction that any substantial threat exists.. This attitude of mind can;be overcome only by a sustained and skilfully directed educational effort inthe right quarters.  We recommend that a programme on these lines shouldbe drawn up. . .    -1. 116.   The size of the field to be covered makes it inevitable that for themost part each Department will have to undertake its own programme of security education, looking to the Security Service for advice on trainingtechniques and for the provision of suitable material for talks and lectures.If is very important that this material should convey an adequate sense ofreality to every listener.  Hitherto effective education has been handicapped by the fact that the subject tends itself to be regarded as secret. The averageCivil Servant, even in a defence Department, has little conception of the:extent and intensity of the effort to penetrate his secrets and probably knowsnext to nothing of the existence or activities of the Security Service.   Whensomething dramatic happens, as in the Portland case, the whole subject jsprings.momentarily to life: but for the rest it seems remote and unreal.  Ifhe is to remain constantly on the alert in security matters he will have to bebrought more into touch with what goes on and, despite the very real,difficulties that attend plain speaking, something more of the traditional veil,will have to be lifted. ;,;117.

On 3rd August, 1961, in reply, to a question in the House ofCommons from Mr. George Brown, M.P., the Prime. Minister undertook to refer to us in this Committee the general issue as to; the role of D Noticesin security arrangements and the value of such Notices and also a particular:issue as to the necessity or propriety of one such Notice issued on 27th Julylast? \..r/..-...:. &quot;-&quot;y- 7;&apos;..;&apos;--.:; 119. We have accordingly enquired into these matters and have ConT::;sidered documents and heard evidence upon them.  Our conclusions are:   ,d(i) D Notices have a part to; play in the general system of protectingsignificant defence information from unauthorised publication;   : -;n&quot; (ii) they are of value for this purpose; &apos;(iii) the Notice of 27th July was not unnecessary or improper,. but parts;:-     of it were expressed in a way which caused genuine misgivings,to.some editors as to whether a new and more restrictive attitude;-V   towards newspaper publication was being adopted.   These misgiving^have now, we believe, been removed by further explanation of the ]intended import of the Notice. &quot;The Role of D Notices ...       ,.120.   A D Notice is a formal letter of request which is circulated -confidentially to newspaper editors, to editors of news in sound broadcasting iand,.television, stations and to editors of some periodicals concerned with-,defence information.   It is issued upon the authority of a Committee knownas the Services, Press and Broadcasting Committee, composed partly ofGovernment officials and partly of representatives of various Press andrad^o, organisations., No one except the Committee can issue a D notice and no ,;one can require it to do so.   A Notice has no legal force and canonly5 be regarded as a letter of advice or request:   Each aspect is.of some importance: a Notice is advisory in that it gives an editor warning that
an item of news, which may well be protected under the Official-&quot;Secrete,Acts, is regarded by the defence authorities as a secret of importance, andif is of the nature of a request in that it informs editors that, whether ornot any legal sanction would attach to the act of publication, publicationis considered to be contrary to the national interest.121. The D Notice system therefore operates by arrangement betweenthe newspapers on the one side and the Government Departments concernedwith the protection of defence information on the other. Its success depends upon goodwill and, in effect, upon very little else. The maintenance ofthis goodwill involves a delicate balance of conditions which can only be appreciated in the light of the history and composition of the Services,Press and Broadcasting Committee.History of the D Notice System122: The Committee in its original form was set up in 1912, a year after the coming into force of the Official Secrets Act, 1911. It was entitled&quot; Admiralty, War Office and Press Committee&quot;. From the beginning itissued D Notices to the Press, and Press members of the Committee weregiven confidential information to enable them to judge the necessity andcontents of any D Notice they were asked to sponsor. Its secretary was the manager of the Press Association news agency or, later, one of its officials.123. When war broke out in 1939 the Committee ceased to operate,since a Press Censorship Department was organised at the Ministry ofInformation, which provided the Press with an elaborate and continuousservice of censorship such as was required by the war situation. D Notices,agreed with representatives of the Press, were issued by this Department,supplemented on occasions by communications, styled Private and confidential -tial Letters, issued by the Chief Press Censor on his own authority.124. In 1945 the Committee was reconstituted in its present form.There are four Government representatives, the permanent Heads of theWar Office, Admiralty, Air Ministry and Ministry of Aviation, and 11representatives of the Press (in which phrase we include broadcasting and television). The Chair rotates between the three Service Departments. Itis proposed to add the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence tothe membership of the Committee and we may say in passing that weendorse this proposal.125. The Secretary of the Committee has not changed since 1945. Heis Rear-Admiral (Retired) G. P. Thomson, who had held the office of ChiefPress Censor at the Ministry of Information during a large part of the last war, and was very well known to and appreciated by many members ofthe Press in that capacity. Although it was arranged in 1945 that theGovernment was to provide the Secretary and bear all the expenses ofD Notice distribution, Admiral Thomson was in fact appointed at therequest of the Press members as well as with the approval of the government representatives, and we think that any account of the post-war operationof the system must be read in the light of Admiral Thoms6n&apos;s very special position and prestige in all matters of Press-Government relations.
Method of Operating126. AD Notice is not normally the product of an actual committee meeting. A Department wishing to have a Notice issued settles the draftof the proposal with the Secretary, who is able out of his experience to adviseupon the form and content which are most likely to make it acceptable tothe Press. When that is settled he personally takes it to available Pressmembers of the Committee in London for&apos; their concurrence: if that is obtained, the.draft is circulated to all Press members, and, if there is nodisagreement, the consequent Notice is issued by him as a D Notice, though in the name of the Committee as a whole. Drafts that cannot be agreed ordrafts that seem to contain some new principle of restriction require considera-tion at a full meeting of the Committee. In very urgent cases the secretary is authorised to issue a D Notice on his own responsibility, provided that hecan secure the concurrence of two Press members.127. The range of the subjects that can be covered by D Notices is described as being &quot; naval, military and air matters the publication of whichwould be prejudicial to the national interest&quot;. This is the formula agreedwhen the Committee was reconstituted in 1945 and it is on the same lines asthe original formula adopted in 1912.. The Press do not in fact insist on anyrigid interpretation of the wording of this formula, so long as a clear caseof national prejudice of &quot;a military&quot; nature can be made out. ThusDepartments not directly represented on the Committee have on occasionsresorted to the Committee with a request for the issue of a D Notice. Casesof this kind lie on a borderline which does not receive and in fact defiesprecise definition, and their handling illustrates again the importance of personal relations and mutual confidence if the D Notice system is to be worked effectively.128. Up to now it has worked effectively. There have been cases ofnon-observance but, according to our informants, such cases have beenrelatively few, more often accidental than deliberate, and they have never been persisted in after the Secretary has taken the matter up with the responsible editor.The Value of the D Notice System129. In our view the system makes a valuable and effective contributionto protecting from disclosure &quot; military&quot; information which needs to beconcealed and which it would be useful to other Powers to possess. By its operation Her Majesty&apos;s Government succeeds, year in and year out, in keeping out of newspapers, radio, and television a great deal of material which, so far as we can see, could not be kept out in any other way.130. It is necessary to ask what practical alternative there is to main-taining a system of this kind. One must begin with recognition of the factthat in this country the Press do acquire a very considerable volume ofinformation on secret matters which, prima facie, is of interest and importanceto their public. This information comes from a variety of sources, oftenunidentifiable at any one moment, but not by any means necessarilyillegitimate or reprehensible. So far as legal sanctions go, there is nothing to restrict publication except the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts, 1911-39;and these provisions, though widely drawn are, generally speaking, confined to
the protection of information about &quot; prohibited places&quot; and information obtained through some &quot; wrongful communication &quot; by or through an official.Some that comes to the Press may originate in this way, but at any rate somemay not: and in any event, it must often be impossible at the critical moment of publication for the editor himself to say whether he is within or without theprovisions of the Acts. While, therefore, their existence does serve as a generalrestraining influence at the back of editorial life and there is always the possi-bility that they might be resorted to in the case of a gross breach of security,they do not on the other hand provide a working code of what should or shouldnot be published on any particular subject nor is there a lively expectation inthe Press that in any ordinary case of publication of matters which the Govern-ment wishes to keep secret publication will be followed by a criminalprosecution. It must be taken, therefore, that the Official Secrets Acts are not an effective instrument for controlling Press publication of that kind of&quot; military&quot; information of some though perhaps no great individualimportance which it is nevertheless most desirable to keep from hostileintelligence.131. Such an instrument is provided by the D Notice system and, in theabsence of compulsory Press censorship or voluntary censorship supported byad hoc Defence Regulation (the system that prevailed in the last war), we see no alternative to it. It appears to suit the needs of both sides. It suits the official side, because it provides a centralised and quickly working means of communi-cating requests and warnings to the Press before the damage is done and underthe authority of a Committee upon which Press representatives are known to bein a majority. It suits the Press side because, without being mandatory, itenables an editor to know before publication that a news item is regarded bythe Government as unfit for use without prejudice to the national interest apoint on which the Press are sensitive where &quot; military&quot; information isconcerned and it does give him the kind of guidance in respect of matters thatmay be affected by the Official Secrets Acts that he would have to look forsomewhere for his own protection if there were no D Notices to rely on.According to the evidence we heard, neither side wishes to abolition :h or in anysubstantial way to amend the present system.132. We asked ourselves whether we could detect any danger toGovernment security in the use and circulation of D Notices. The existenceof the Committee and the necessity of the concurrence of the Press membersbefore a Notice is issued means that confidential or secret information has tobe shared with them. But in one form or another it is a commonplace of a newspaper man&apos;s life to be a confidential recipient of secret information, andin the context of a Committee of this nature we do not see in the practice any risk that is worth attention. The official side is well aware of the importanceof restricting as much as possible the positive information contributed by aD Notice; and, at the receiving end, we did not get the impression from thosewe asked that the Notices were carelessly distributed in the newspaper offices.The Future133. We feel no hesitation therefore in recommending the continuance ofthe D Notice system on the present lines, provided that it can be so continued.We now address ourselves to this point, which requires consideration under two different aspects.
134. First, there is the personnel and organisation of the Committee. Theofficial representatives have been the permanent heads of the respective departments concerned; and this, in our view, is right. The representativesof the Press have, of course, been appointed by the various Press interests concerned. It is clearly desirable that they should be of the calibre and experience that is needed for their responsibility. Apart from emphasisingthis fact, we have not thought it necessary to make any positive recom-mendation; for, although the matter would be of the first importance if thePress as a whole were prepared to regard D Notices as necessarily binding on them by the mere fact that their form had been agreed before issue by theirrepresentatives on the. Committee, this is not their attitude, and we do notthink that under current conditions it is ever likely to be. It must be expectedtherefore that rare occasions will arise upon which some newspaper will wishto criticise in public a D Notice to which it objects in principle and we do notthink that this possibility would be eliminated even by a greater strengthening of the Press side of the Committee.135. This consideration serves to stress further the importance of what isin our view the critical question for the future the personality of the Secretary.It is upon the work of the Secretary and not upon what can only be veryinfrequent meetings of the Committee that the operation of the D Notice systemdepends. His work involves much more than the various procedures thatlead to the issuing of a D Notice. Since in most cases such notices will not be acceptable to the Press as a whole if they are intended merely as blanket stopson a particular subject a point which we elaborate when dealing with the DNotice of 27th July, 1961 he has to provide in himself something like a continuous advisory service of voluntary censorship so as to pass, amend, orreject copy that falls within the range of subject embraced by the Notice.This is an exacting task arising at unpredictable hours and often demandingan exercise of rapid and experienced judgment on the part of the secretary or in other cases urgent consultation with the experts in the Departmentdirectly concerned.136. We do not think it an exaggeration to say that the D Notice system has been as successful as it has since 1945 because of the special qualifications and personality of Admiral Thomson himself. He passed into the post of secretary after some four war years as Chief Press Censor and he brought tohis task great experience, a very wide knowledge of the ramifications of thePress, and an exceptional measure of goodwill due to the service that he had given. According to our information he, and through him the Committee,still enjoy these advantages.137. It seems unreasonable to expect that this state of affairs can continuelong into the future. In our view, therefore, it is now high time for theauthorities to plan how to deal with the problem of replacing him when he wishes to retire. No replacement will be able to bring to the office hiscombination of advantages, but we think that it must be prudent to try to select a man now and to give him a chance of running in with the work whileAdmiral Thomson is still there. It is not useful for us to try to outline alist of the qualifications required, but the advice we received suggested theimportance of at least two conditions. Negatively, the Secretary should notbe himself drawn from journalism: positively, he must be familiar with the
ways of the Press and have a sympathetic personal approach in his relationswith them.138. Since, as we have indicated, the effective work of the Committee hastc be done by the Secretary, there is much to be said for raising formallythe status which Admiral Thomson enjoys by virtue of his own prestige and making the Secretary a full member of the Committee itself. This, however,can only be brought about if the Press members of the Committee agree toit. Secondly, it must be realised that Admiral Thomson has apparently madehimself available on nearly all days at nearly any hour. It remains to beseen whether a successor can be found to give such untiring continuousservice. Considering the amount that the Government stands to gain by keeping the D Notice system in good running order, we do not think that therewould be any waste of time or money if two men were allotted to this task,though it must be a matter for further enquiry how much of other dutiescould be combined with the discharge of this one.139. We spoke above of two aspects from which the future of the systemneeded to be regarded. We turn now to the second. It must be realised onthe Government side that the system is essentially a voluntary one, whichtrenches upon the very delicate subject of Press freedom. If it is to continueto be operated successfully, it must not be subjected to overstrain and this basiccondition of its existence must always be kept in mind. Since there have been no less than three occasions during the course of this summer when difficultiesarose over the issue of D Notices something quite exceptional in relation tothe post-war average we think that it would be useful if we listed briefly thepoints which have been brought home to us by our enquiry as bearing onthese matters:(a) When queries arise in respect of copy that is the subject of a D Notice,there must be a service on the Government side that will provide aprompt and authoritative answer. Such an answer may be given bythe Department concerned direct or by or through the Secretary to theCommittee: but from the Press side there are advantages in expectingthe query to be handled by the Secretary.(b) The agreement on the Press side to receive and respect D Notices iscontingent upon the subject matter being confined to &quot; naval, militaryand air matters the publication of which would be prejudicial to thenational interest&quot;. As we have said, this formula is not strictlyinsisted upon: but any attempt to go outside it is liable to be regarded with suspicion and should only be resorted to, therefore, on specialoccasions when the subject is one of grave and obvious importance.There is always likely to be resentment if a Notice is thought to havebeen dictated by &quot; political&quot; considerations, or if it is thought that theofficial side is trying unreasonably to suppress here matter which isalready public knowledge abroad.(c) It is particularly desirable that no news in the possession of a newspaper should be held up on a Departmental request or underDepartmental pressure in the name of security when there is reasonto suppose that the real motive of the request or pressure is the convenience of the Department or its political chief. Complaints ofsuch incidents recur from time to time. They are a standing grievance
with the Press and they do more than any other single thing to prejudice the system of voluntary co-operation in the withholding of news whichis represented by the D Notices.The D Notice of 27th July, 1961140. This Notice was issued on the authority of the Committee, and itsheading &quot; Classified Weapons and Equipment: and Air Photography andDiagrams &quot; sufficiently describes the subject matter with which it dealt. Therestrictions that it requested recipients to observe related, therefore, to information about defence matters of a military nature and to nothing else.141. The Notice stated that it was in substitution for three precedingNotices which were then outstanding, one of 10th December, 1951, one of13th February, 1956, and a &quot; War Potential Letter &quot; of 11th April, 1957. Theform of these earlier Notices had not given complete satisfaction to all members of the Press and for some time before July 1961 the Press membersof the Committee, or some of them, had been arguing that a more satisfactoryform of restriction should be found. The general objection to the earlierNotices was that they were too comprehensive in their restrictions. Forinstance the first Notice, that of 10th December, 1951, requested that thereshould be &quot; no disclosure of information regarding weapons or equipmentbefore it has been officially released &quot;. Such a Notice, if strictly observed,meant that no factual information of any kind regarding weapons or equipmentcould be printed until it had been published in an official announcement orspecifically released on the authority of the Government department concerned.142. There seems to be no doubt that the intention of the Committee inissuing the new D Notice was to reduce the area of subject matter upon whicha newspaper was requested to refer copy either to the Secretary of theCommittee or to the interested Department. It sought to do this by listing anumber of detailed points arising in relation to weapons, equipment,installations, &amp;c, and confining its requests for restricted publication to information affected by these points. Nevertheless the range of such information still continued to be very wide.143. Each of the main sub-divisions of the requests headed &quot;ClassifiedWeapons and Equipment&quot; was preceded by the words &quot; Until officiallyannounced . . .&quot;. For instance the first ran &quot; (a) Until officially announced no mention should be made without prior advice from the appropriate Depart-ment of the existence of a new weapon or military equipment underdevelopment&quot;. The second ran &quot;(b) Until officially announced no information should be published of the code name or number, the design, thetechnical or military characteristics, or the performance of a weapon or military equipment under study, development or test; nor should the name ofthe firm or establishment which is developing it be published &quot;.144. These words &quot; officially announced &quot; are, perhaps, ambiguous. Theirnatural meaning suggests that an official announcement must precede thepublishing of any information by a newspaper, however fully it may be inprior possession of the material.  We are assured, however, that this was not
the intention of those who drafted the Notice and that they did not contem-plate that there should be any change in the existing practice of allowing Presspublication of any information within the restricted field, provided that it was first approved by the Secretary or the responsible Department.145. The criticisms and protests which followed the issue of this Noticearose from suspicions aroused by a combination of three factors. First, theNotice was in unusually detailed form and that in itself, suggested that a code of restriction was being evolved for the Press as a whole to which eachnewspaper would be held without variation. Secondly, the phrase &quot; untilofficially announced &quot; was read, at any rate by some newspapers actively con-cerned with this kind of information, as indicating a change of practice underwhich it would no longer be possible to obtain ad hoc release of a newspapersindividual copy, pending an official statement or hand-out. Thirdly, it was feared that, having regard to the wording, it was no longer to be permissiblefor copy to be submitted to the Secretary for approval and that everythingmust go to a Department.146. The Notice was not, in our view, happily drafted in these particularsand we see nothing unreasonable in criticisms directed to getting it elucidatedor amended. We are informed that this has now been done. The criticismshave been taken account of at a further meeting of the Committee and afurther communication has been circulated to the Press which is intendedto make it clear that as heretofore copy which falls within a restricted categorymay nevertheless be submitted at any time for approval and release, though no official statement has been made, and that the Secretary of the Committeewill continue to be available for the purpose of giving or obtaining suchapproval.147. We were given to understand by the representatives of the newspapers who had published criticisms of the Notice and whom weinterviewed accordingly, that this meets the substance of their objections andwe recommend that the matter should be regarded as closed on this basis.148. There is, however, one remaining point to which we should draw attention before we leave this incident. The new Notice of 27th July, 1961,was produced, as we have said, for the purpose of meeting the objections of press members of the Committee that the existing Notices were needlesslycomprehensive in range. Its form was in fact the subject of protractednegotiation with them, was discussed before issue at a full meeting of theCommittee and was agreed to by all the Press members. How then, it maybe asked, did it nevertheless provoke criticism as soon as it was issued, and why, for that matter, were the criticisms not ventilated through the Committeerather than by immediate public representations? There is, it seems, a conflict of interest which divides the Press on much that relates to information on defence subjects. Many newspapers do not possess the resources or,sometimes, the inclination to work up news on these subjects on their own initiative: to them a system of detailed instructions releasing or barringparticular topics, supplemented by official publications from time to time,is entirely congenial. Others, however, including some London dailies andsome technical journals, interest themselves in the study of defence matters and retain specialist contributors for the purpose: to them it is essential to getwhat advantage they can out of their individual effort.   They much resent,
therefore, any system which tends to hold them back to the same line as the others and they regard themselves as entitled at all times to have their copyconsidered from the point of view of publication and only held up or inpart excised for a valid security reason. The Notice of 27th July, 1961,bore directly upon this particular division of interest and the division is a sufficiently sensitive matter to make it impossible for those concerned to be content with the fact that the form of the Notice had been agreed by thePress members of the Committee.149. We regard this second class as entitled to its point of view; nor does the public lose by its maintenance of an active interest in these defence matters. That being so, it is, we think, desirable that when D Notices areprepared they should be drafted with that consideration in mind. It isdesirable too, when planning the future staffing of the Secretary&apos;s post, to remember that for this reason alone active assistance, in scrutinising copy andhelping to get it passed is one of the services that will be expected of itsoccupant in return for observance of D Notices.Printed in England and published by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office
