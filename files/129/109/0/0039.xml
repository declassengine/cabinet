s-    !k- -.1sjm* . copy no-28th^ay^T962CABINETNA TIONA L ASS IS TANC E - SCALESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster-GeneralThe Minister of Pensions   and National Insurance proposes(C. (62) 85) that the National Assistance scales should be raised by4s. (single) and 6s. (married) at a cost of  22 million a year.2.        The full cost of any increase falls upon the Exchequer, andfinancially, therefore, very large sums are involved here, and it isnecessary to look well ahead.   For my part I believe that it may well bethought fit to increase the national insurance retirement pension nextyear;   I am sure from past experience that we cannot do that without atthe same time making some improvement in National Assistance scales,because otherwise recipients of National Assistance will gain nothingfrom the pension increase:   and therefore, as we must envisage twoincreases in National Assistance scales within a year or less, it isimportant that the first increase should not be larger than our obligationsnecessitate.3.        The Minister&apos;s proposal to increase by 4s. (single) and 6s.(married) would, on the contrary, give a liberal additional margin.   Itwould in fact accommodate an increase in the retail price index to between121 and 122,   As soon as the special seasonal factors of potato scarcity,etc. , have been eliminated, this index is expected to average about 119in the second half of this year.4.        I suggest that the increase should be 3s, for the single house-holder,    5s, for the married couple, and 2s. for the single non-house-holder (there is a clear case on merits for a materially smaller increase for the non-householder, but this is a subsidiary issue which perhaps theMinister and I can settle without troubling the Cabinet).   My proposal would cost  17 million a year, a reduction of  5 million a year on theMinister&apos;s proposals.   I am not suggesting that this  5 million shouldbe held back in perpetuity, but that if it is to be given, it should begiven next time and not this.5. It may be helpful to the Cabinet,, in reaching its decision,to have the following figures of cost per annum, for each increase ofIs. in the scale: -Single householder  3 millionMarried couple  1 millionSingle non-householder     :f million,-1-
6. I do not question the necessity of increasing the scales this autumn, but I suggest that the date should be 1st October, which isabout the time when people have to find more money for heat and light.Each extra month makes of difference of  1.4 million on my proposals and  1. 8 million on the Minister&apos; s.H. B.Treasury Chambers, S. &quot;W. 1.28th May, 1962-2-
