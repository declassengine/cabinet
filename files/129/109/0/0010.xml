C. (62) 60 Copy No. 5012th April, 1962CABINETTHE ANGLO-PORTUGUESE ALLIANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsSeveral of the treaties comprising the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, as well asthe Secret Declaration of 1899, contain commitments on the part of this countryto defend the Portuguese colonies (summarised in the Annex to this paper). -2. This commitment no longer corresponds with reality, and at the time ofthe Indian attack on Goa we found it a source of acute embarrassment. Ourrelations with the Portuguese suffered heavily because they felt that, in not giving them assistance against India, we were being untrue to the Alliance. The obligationto defend Portuguese colonies cannot be reconciled with our views on Portuguesecolonial policy or with our own entirely different colonial policies. The commitmentis unpopular with public opinion in this country and in many quarters abroad,particularly at the United Nations. If another situation like Goa should arise, we might well face the same embarrassment without even the reason of our commonwealth commitments to explain our inaction. For example, the Portuguesemight invoke the treaties if Timor or Portuguese Guinea were attacked, and would again be indignant if they did not receive the help to which they believed they were entitled. Anglo-Portuguese relations will indeed continue unsatisfactory so longas the Portuguese believe that they have the right to expect from us assistance which in fact we are not prepared to give. In my view we cannot afford a source of misunderstanding of this kind to persist in our relations with an ancient allyand a partner in the North Atlantic Alliance.3. The problem is how to shed our anachronistic commitment gracefully andwithout provoking hostile reactions in Lisbon. We cannot legally get rid of the commitment by simply denouncing the relevant parts of the treaties, which containno provision for termination. Nor is it likely that the Prime Minister of Portugal,Dr. Salazar, will release us by denouncing the Alliance. He may well feel thatwhile PortugaFs European interests are at present protected by the North atlantic alliance, the British Alliance is of more lasting importance. But he has statedpublicly that he is studying the 1899 Declaration to see what &quot; positive content&quot;still remains in the light of our attitude over Goa. This provides us with a peg onwhich we could hang an approach to the Portuguese Government, designed toget our relations on to a better footing. My idea is that we might explain to themfrankly the difficulty in which we find ourselves and invite them to discuss with us how the traditional friendship and alliance between the two countries can be preserved from the strain of conflict over their differing colonial policies. we might suggest, for example, that an &quot; interpretation &quot; of the treaty should be worked out and embodied in a statement of policy, in which the Portuguese Governmentwould explicitly accept a limitation of our commitment relating to colonial territories, as part of a reaffirmation of the basic purposes of the Anglo-PortugueseAlliance.4. There is, unfortunately, a complicating factor of which my colleagues should be aware. The Chiefs of Staff have concluded that staging facilities in Salin the Cape Verde Islands are essential at 24 hours&apos; notice to enable us to fulfilour African commitments, and that other facilities, including continued use of the60675fPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1962
Azores, are desirable. It is clear that we should have little chance of obtainingthese facilities in present circumstances unless we were able to offer compensatingadvantages. One price we should almost certainly have to pay would be theprovision of modern airfield equipment. But in addition to this the Portuguesewould be likely to ask whether we would supply them with air transit facilities1 in the event of external agression against their overseas territories, and until wehave cleared up our position in regard to the treaty this will be a question weshall have difficulty in answering.5. We have little of value to offer in this field. The matter has been studied by officials who have tentatively concluded that we might agree, if asked, to grantfacilities at El Adem (subject to overflying permission from the Libyans), aden and Mauritius. We could also continue to turn a blind eye to the presentunderstanding with the Federation authorities whereby the Portuguese overflythe Central African Federation. But apart from the scantiness of these facilities,we could not promise them for an indefinite period. Moreover, even with theuse of Aden and Mauritius, the Portuguese could not reach Timor withoutAustralian permission to use the Cocos Islands or Darwin, which may or maynot be forthcoming. I must also point out that it might be almost as embarrassingand difficult for us to grant transit facilities in the event of trouble in a Portuguesecolony as to give military aid; and we might find that we had given a promise,dated 1962, which we could not carry out. This would be worse than renegingon an ancient treaty.6. My conclusion is therefore that in the first instance we should do no morethan approach the Portuguese Government in an informal and friendly mannerfor the purpose of discussing with them how the present embarrassments in anglo-Portuguese relations can be overcome. We would explain how the forceof circumstances and differences in our colonial policies have made it impossiblefor us to honour the military obligations in respect of Portuguese colonies whichdevolve upon us under the treaties; that we nevertheless value these treaties andwish them to remain the basis of our relations with Portugal, and that we are willing to reaffirm our commitment under the Alliance to defend metropolitanPortugal and the Atlantic Islands. (This formula would cover not only the azores and Madeira, which are considered to be part of metropolitan Portugal,but also the Cape Verde Islands, which are not.) We would wait to see how this approach was received before deciding how to deal with the question of airstaging facilities in the Cape Verde Islands and the Azores.7. If my colleagues agree with this, I would propose to take the first stepmyself when I meet the Portuguese Foreign Minister, Dr. Nogueira in Athensfor the meeting of the North Atlantic Alliance in the first days of May.8. The only alternative that I can see is to take no action at all. In this event,unless Dr. Salazar took some initiative, we should have simply to hope that anotherGoa will not occur soon and that we shall not require strategic facilities from thePortuguese until the dust from Goa has settled. If our hopes were belied, we might find it difficult to explain why we had in the interval after Goa donenothing to put our relations with Portugal or a realistic basis.9. For this and for general reasons I should myself prefer to take the initiativesuggested in paragraphs 6 and 7 above.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,10th April, 1962.
ANNEXCOMMITMENT TO DEFEND PORTUGUESE colonies the most important statement of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments commitment todefend PortugaFs colonies is in the Secret Article of the Anglo-Portuguese Treatyof 1661. There is some doubt about the exact original wording of this article, butthis does not matter as the authoritative text has been established by the second part of the Anglo-Portuguese Secret Declaration of 1899 which quotes and confirms the 1661 article. The 1899 Declaration is quoted in full below.2. There have been other references in Anglo-Portuguese Treaties to ourobligation to assist in the defence of the Portuguese colonies. These are also listedbelow.Anglo-Portuguese Secret Declaration, 1899&quot; The Government of Her Majesty The Queen of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Ireland, Empress of India, and the Government of His Most FaithfulMajesty the King of Portugal and the Algarves, considering as of full force and effect the ancient treaties of alliance, amity and guarantee which subsist between the twoCrowns, specifically confirm on this occasion article 1 of the treaty of the29th January, 1642, which runs as follows:&apos; It is concluded and accorded that there is, and shall be for ever, a goodtrue and firm peace and amity between the most renowned Kings, CharlesKing of Great Britain and John the Fourth King of Portugal, their heirs andsuccessors, and their kingdoms, countries, dominions, lands, people, liegemen,vassals and subjects whomsoever, present and to come, of whatsoever condition,dignity or degree they may be, as well by land as by sea and fresh waters, soas the said vassals and subjects are each of them to favour the other and touse one another with friendly offices and true affection, and that neither of thesaid most renowned Kings, their heirs and successors, by himself or by anyother, shall do or attempt anything against each other, or their kingdoms, byland or by sea, nor shall consent nor adhere unto any war, counsel or treaty, inprejudice of the other.&apos;They equally confirm the final article of the treaty of the 23rd June, 1661, ofwhich the first part runs as follows :&apos; Over and above all and singular agreed and concluded in the Treaty of marriage between the Most Serene and Most Powerful Charles, the Second ofthat name, King of Great Britain and the Most Virtuous and Serene LadyCatherine, Infanta of Portugal, it is by the secret article concluded andaccorded, that His Majesty of Great Britain, in regard of the great advantages and increase of dominion, he hath purchased by the above-mentioned Treatyof Marriage, shall promise and oblige himself, as by this present article he doth,to defend and protect all conquests or colonies belonging to the Crownof Portugal against all his enemies, as well future as present.&apos;The Government of His Most Faithful Majesty undertakes not to permit, afterthe declaration of war between Great Britain and the South African Republic, or during the continuance of the war, the importation and passage of arms, and ofmunitions of war destined for the latter.The Government of His Most Faithful Majesty will not proclaim neutrality inthe war between Great Britain and the South African Republic.Done in duplicate, at London, this 14th day of October, 1899.&quot;
