(62) 6313th April, 1962CABINETINTERVENTION IN KUWAITMemorandum by Minister of DefenceDuring my recent visit to Bahrein I was very impressed with the continuingnecessity for our forces there and in Aden to be at a high state of readiness and forthe Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to have as much authority as we can properly delegate to him to act swiftly on the advice of the Political Resident,Persian Gulf. Although communications between London and Bahrein have been improved, they are by no means certain when conditions are adverse.2. It is clear that the Iraqis have not lost their interest in Kuwait. Indeedwhile I was there they were carrying out photographic reconnaissance with MiGaircraft. If they press this form of surveillance our chances of carrying out succesful interceptions will be slight.3. Since my return, the Chiefs of Staff have re-examined plans for re-entry into Kuwait and are also examining various proposals for keeping our forces thereat a high degree of readiness. One difficult political problem has arisen. however much we can reinforce the air defence of the Bahrein area, it is clear that with the iraqi introduction of advanced types of Russian MiG fighters and with the extremely short flying distance from the Basra/Shaiba to the Kuwait frontier, itwill be impossible to guarantee a favourable air situation over Kuwait at the timeof the introduction of airborne troops without an attack on Iraqi airfields in this area very soon after any Iraqi attack has been mounted. I am advised by the Chiefsof Staff that the Iraqi air force available to support such an attack on Kuwait islikely to be one jet light bomber squadron and two jet fighter squadrons. What Iam now proposing is that we should delegate authority to the Commander-in-Chiefto carry out the necessary attack on Iraqi airfields in this limited area in order to destroy Iraqi aircraft on the ground and thus ensure a favourable air situationover Kuwait in the early stages of any Iraqi aggression. Provided thatcommunications were possible, the Commander-in-Chief would obviously seekconfirmation of his authority for this, as for other action, from London. However,should communications fail, 1 think we should give him the authority to act subjectto two important safeguards:(i) That the Amir must have formally requested assistance.(ii) That the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, must have concurred in this action.4. I therefore seek the approval of my colleagues to the extension of theCommander-in-Chiefs authority accordingly. I attach a copy of the reviseddirective to the Commander-in-Chief.H. W.Ministry of Defence,13th April, 1962.60689Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1962 *
REVISED DIRECTIVE TO THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF MIDDLE EASTIntervention in KuwaitProvided that the Amir has made a formal request for British forces to cometo his assistance to prevent Iraqi forces from seizing Kuwait by military means,and provided that the Political Resident, Persian Gulf concurs that this request should be met, the Commander-in-Chief Middle East is authorised at his discretion to take certain action as soon as he is satisfied that Iraqi Land forces have crossed the frontier or Iraqi Air Forces have attacked targets in Kuwait. The action towhich this authority applies is limited to the following:id) Carrying out such attacks as are necessary to neutralise Iraqi offensivemilitary aircraft on airfields in the Basra I Shaiba area to permit thesuccessful delivery of the spearhead force. These attacks are to be restricted to rocket and cannon attacks only by DF/GA aircraft.(b) Carrying out offensive air action against Iraqi ground and air forces in and over Kuwait. This authority covers hot pursuit of Iraqi aircraft to a distance of 30 miles inside Iraqi territory.(c) Deploying forward to Kuwait DF/GA forces and any extra men toactivate the stockpile and operate type T radar on more than one-watchbasis together with ground forces to protect the airfields.id) Completing all necessary measures for intervention short of deployinghis remaining forces in Kuwait.(e) Extending PR reconnaissance into Iraqi territory but this must be limitedto high-altitude flights that do not penetrate beyond the Basra area.2. In the event of Iraqi aircraft attacking Sharjah, Bahrein or British forcesat sea, the Commander-in-Chief is authorised at his own discretion to engage themand, if necessary, to pursue them as far as the Iraq border. In these circumstancesair attacks on Iraqi airfields and other ground targets on Iraqi territory are notto be initiated without specific authority from London at the time.April 1962.
