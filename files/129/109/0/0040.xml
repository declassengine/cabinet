C. (62) 90 Copy No.     5 029th May, 1962CABINETIMPORTS OF COTTON TEXTILESMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade negotiations with India, Pakistan and Hong Kong about the arrangements for limiting exports of cotton textiles after the expiry of the present arrangements atthe end of 1962 are in a very advanced stage, and it will be necessary to make astatement in Parliament about them, and about our import policy generally in regardto cotton textiles, before Whitsun.Agreements with India, Pakistan and Hong Kong2. My colleagues will remember that the arrangements with these countries were first made in 1959 for a period of three years. In the case of Hong Kong, thearrangement, which took effect on 1st February, 1959, was in the form of a unilateralundertaking by the Hong Kong industry. In the case of India and Pakistan, therewere inter-industry agreements negotiated with the Cotton Board on behalf of theBritish industry. These agreements came into operation on 1st January, 1960.The ceilings on exports amounted in total to 377 million square yards a year. InAugust 1961, when negotiations were carried through for the extension of the hong Kong arrangement up to the end of 1962, the ceilings were raised to 422 million square yards.  These arrangements did not apply to yarn.3. Decisions on the future of these arrangements are urgently needed becauseuntil the British industry knows that duty-free imports from these sources willcontinue to be kept in check, and at what level, firms will not feel able to go ahead with re-equipment and modernisation schemes in accordance with the intentions and provisions of the Cotton Industry Act, 1959. The final date for the submission of applications is 9th July.4. The British industry is going through a very bad time and is sufferingfrom a complete collapse of confidence. It has pressed hard and repeatedly fora renewal of the arrangements with the three Commonwealth countries but onthe basis of a reduction in the ceilings at least to the 1959 levels. The case fora reduction was pressed very strongly by a deputation from the industry which met the Prime Minister on 15th May. It had become increasingly clear thatthe Cotton Board would have the greatest difficulty in securing the support ofthe industry for negotiating an extension of the inter-industry agreements with india and Pakistan on the present basis and might have felt obliged to refuseto make, the attempt.5. On the other hand, the exporting industries, and their Governments,could not be expected to agree to a reduction in their export opportunities, whichare of such great importance to their plans of economic development. In thecircumstances the Economic Policy Committee decided on 18th April that we should seek to continue the arrangements on their present basis up to the end of 1965and that a ceiling should be introduced on yarn imports.6. Since that decision was taken the Government of Hong Kong, withgreat skill, have led the Hong Kong industry to offer an extension of the present arrangements on these lines. As regards yarn imports, the offer is that they willtake effect during the present year. This offer is conditional upon India and pakistan accepting similar restraints.7. In all the circumstances the best course was to seek unilateral undertakingsfrom the Indian and Pakistani industries similar to that offered by Hong Kong.60874Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1962
Soundings taken through the Governments of the two countries have shown thatthe Indian industry is prepared to give such an undertaking; the PakistaniGovernment and industry are unhappy about the yam proposals but I hope thatthey will acquiesce. I expect that the discussion will have advanced far enoughbefore Whitsun for me to be able to make a firm announcement on these mattersalthough some details will still remain to be cleared up.The Lancashire Reaction8. The Hong Kong offer has been published. The United KingdomGovernment announced simultaneously their view that it is a reasonable offer.The fact that India and Pakistan had been approached to give similar undertakingswas also announced. This has led to bitter disappointment and criticism inLancashire. The disappointment is the more intense because of hopes aroused bythe Report from the Estimates Committee of what the industry regarded assupport for its case. The Fourth Report from the Committee, on assistance to thecotton industry, which was published on 15th May, concluded that, &quot;failing aspeedy and satisfactory solution to the related problems of imports, marketing andthe fuller use of plant and machinery, much of the expenditure incurred [under the1959 Act] will have been to no purpose &quot;.Imports From Other Sources9. The anxieties of the British cotton industry are not only with importsfrom the three Commonwealth countries. In 1960, when demand was boomingand the home industry was unable fully to meet it, imports flooded in from all parts of the world including many countries which had never previously been regarded as textile exporters. These imports proved to be substantially in excessof requirements and heavy stocks of unbought cloth have been hanging over themarket. The present depressed state of the industry is largely a result of inflateddemand 18 months&apos; ago. Imports, like home production, have fallen awaysharply. The industry is convinced, however, that, when demand revives, importsrather than the home industry will benefit unless something is done to prevent thisfrom happening. It has publicly repeated its demands that &quot; overall imports fromunder-developed and low-cost Eastern producers should not be allowed to increaseagain to higher than the 1959 levels&quot; and that &quot;the disruption clauses of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade arrangement should be used firmly andquickly in the case of sudden increases in the imports of any particular category of cotton textiles &quot;.Competition with North America and Western Europe.10. The industry bases its case on the threat of imports from countries with low living standards, but in fact more than 100 million yards of cloth a year nearly a quarter of our total imports of cloth for home use is coming into thecountry from Canada, the United States, and countries in Western Europe whosestandards of living are comparable with our own. All these imports, except those from Canada, pay duty of 17-^ per cent. It is a disturbing feature of the present state of the British cotton industry that while it is vulnerable in its home market,its exports show a progressive decline. The export performance of our Europeancompetitors is by comparison better than ours. In 1961 British exports to Canada,for instance, were less than half what they had been in 1957, but Canada wasimporting substantially more from West Germany and the Netherlands than from britain, although our cloth enjoys a tariff preference. Much the same thing has happened in the United States. Well over half our present exports of cotton cloth are imported cloth that has only been finished in this country.11. What is happening is that the British industry is being left behind bythe rest of the world. There are still in Lancashire some excellent firms and greattechnical skill. But for the most part its equipment, its organisation and itsmethods of working are out of date. In the longer run, its only hope of survivalas a major industry, failing a degree of protection which would be quiteinconsistent with our international commitments, our commercial policy generally and with the needs of our economy, is in thorough-going reorganisation. As theSelect Committee pointed out, marketing and the fuller use of plant and machineryare urgent problems. Scrapping of redundant machinery has been carried out butthe reorganisation of the structure of the industry and the wide development ofshift working, which are matters to be dealt with by the industry itself and which
it was the purpose of the 1959 Act to encourage have not yet been carried far.Unless something is done to provide some confidence in the future, there will beno hope of substantial re-equipment or reform. ,Import Policy12. One objective of my forthcoming statement must be to build upconfidence. The question is to what extent this can be done without new and unacceptable departures of policy. It is not possible to give the industry all thatit wants, but the present policy, seen in its proper setting, ought itself to bereassuring. The industry should be brought to realise that the present crisis ofconfidence is overdone. The flood of imports in 1960 and early 1961 followed aperiod when Lancashire could not offer quick delivery and when her prices werehigh. The fact that it happened in these abnormal conditions does not show that anything on the same scale will happen again. It will not, so long as Lancashire&apos;sorder books are not abnormally long and her prices are not wholly out of line with her competitors. Imports from the most dangerous competitors, e.g., Chinaand Japan, are already subject to severe quantitative control. Imports from Spainare limited by voluntary agreement. The long-term agreement regardinginternational price in cotton textiles recently negotiated at Geneva and now beforeGovernments for their acceptance should provide a means for dealing with threats of disruption from some other sources. We shall use this means where we can and if need arises.13. The industry would like me to promise that imports from any newsource, or any increase in imports from a potentially disruptive source, (however that may be defined), will be stopped, but any such comprehensive promise couldnot be implemented without departure from the policy of admitting Commonwealthgoods free of restriction and without breaking our obligations to commonwealth and to foreign countries under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.This would expose our exports to retaliation and set the worst possible example to other countries, notably the United States, where there is considerable pressure for restrictions on our exports.14. The industry is full of fears, but in fact the sources of real danger arevery few and the case for taking action may never arise. We should avoid givingpromises which we cannot fulfil. On the other hand, we want to give as muchassurance as possible that we are keeping developments under control and willnot hesitate to act if the need arises and if action can be taken consistent with our general commercial policy.Proposed Action15. Under these circumstances, I think there is one step we can take nowwhich should have some psychological value in the present state of mind inLancashire. I propose that we withdraw from all sources except India, pakistan and Hong Kong the Open General Licence under which imports of cotton textiles and yarns may be imported freely; we would replace this by a system of OpenIndividual Licensing. This would not constitute a control on import and can be defended in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provided it is appliednon-discriminatorily: it will, however, involve a licensing system on Commonwealth,including Colonial, as well as foreign supplies. It will have the slight practicaladvantage that it will give us more accurate information on imports of cotton textiles and thus enable us to introduce an effective control somewhat more quicklyshould this prove to be necessary at a later stage.16. I also propose that approaches should be made without delay to certainexporting, or potentially exporting, countries with a view to enlisting their co-operation in avoiding the difficult situation which would arise if there were tobe a marked rise in their exports to this country.17. I propose to emphasise in my statement the need for action by theindustry itself, and that the industry will be judged by the results it achieves. Iintend also to deal with certain other matters in addition to those discussed above,but I need not trouble my colleagues with full details of them.18. I attach at Annex my proposed statement in draft. I should welcomemy colleagues&apos; approval of it.F J EBoard of Trade, S.W. 1,28th May, 1962.
ANNEXCOTTON TEXTILESDraft statement i wish to make a statement of Government policy concerning imports ofcotton textiles and other matters affecting the cotton industry.[The Government have now received through the Governments of HongKong, India and Pakistan undertakings from the industries of these countries tocontinue up to the end of 1965 the present ceilings on their exports of cotton piecegoods and made ups for retention in this country.In addition the industries of the three countries have undertaken to limit theiryarn exports to the level of their trade in 1961. This is a new feature which will come into operation next month.Certain details remain to be settled but a continuation of the arrangements with Hong Kong, India and Pakistan is thus assured for another three years, withthe inclusion of yarn, and without any further additions to the ceilings.]These arrangements will ensure stability over a large part of the market.Supplies from all the major low-cost Asian producers are now regulated either by voluntary means or otherwise. Imports from Japan, Formosa, China and theEastern bloc countries are under licensing control. This will continue. Importsfrom Spain are limited by agreement with the Spanish industry. All imports ofcotton cloth from foreign countries, including the United States and the countries of Western Europe, from which imports are continuing at a relatively high level,have to pay an import duty of 17-  per cent.The long-term Geneva Agreement is due to come into operation in Octobernext. The Government hope it will be accepted by many countries. They intend to accept it for the United Kingdom subject to a reservation exempting us fromobligations under the Agreement to admit increased imports.Cotton textiles is a trade where exports from new sources may grow very rapidly. The Government intend to keep the situation under review and aretherefore introducing a system of open individual licensing. This involves thewithdrawal of the present Open General Licence under which cotton piece goods and yarn may be freely imported from most sources, but it does not entail newrestrictions. A full announcement of the details of the licensing arrangements isbeing issued to-day.It would be unfair to those countries who are voluntarily restricting their supplies to this market if other countries should take advantage of such restraintto increase their own sales. Countries with no traditional trade in cotton textilesshould not count on being able to build up a new market in Britain.There is one further matter to which I should refer. The Cotton industry act 1959 allowed three years for the submission of applications for re-equipmentgrant. This period ends on 9th July next. Firms intending to submit applicationsto the Cotton Board should do so without delay. They will still have another yearto place their orders with machinery makers and up to July 1964 to completeinstallation of the plant.This statement will enable firms in the industry to judge where they standand to decide upon their future action. Much special help is being given to theindustry, but the industry itself has a great deal to do. The problems of re-organisation are great but they must be solved if the industry is to survive. Itis for the industry to solve them.May 1962.
