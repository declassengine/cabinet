IlIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (62-) 945th June, 1962CABINETQMNTS^AND LOANS FOR FISHING vessels and ENGINES BUILT ABROADMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculturef-   Fisheries and food the Prime Minister wishes this question to be considered bythe Cabinet and we are therefore circulating this paper to set out the background and the recent history of the matter.background.   As a measure of rehabilitation grants and loans for fishingboats and engines were made available for herring boats in 1944(Herring Industry Act, 1944) and inshore fishing boats up to 70 ft. . in1945 (Inshore Fishing Industry Act, 1945).   The grants were conditional on the boats or engines being built in the United Kingdom, not to pro-tect our boat-builders but because we were short of foreign currency and would have had difficulty in supervising construction abroad.   &quot;Wehad not then of course become members of the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade or the European Free Trade Area..3.   when a wider scheme for grants for boats up to 140 ft. in lengthwas introduced by the White Fish and Herring Industries Act, 1953, theearlier requirement that boats and engines must be built in the UnitedKingdom was applied by statutory schemes subject to an affirmative resolution:  and the requirement has remained in force ever since.4,   In I960 the Swedish Embassy enquired about this requirementsuggesting that it conflicted with the provisions of the European free trade Area convention that special facilities to purchasers may not be restricted to purchases in the country giving the facilities.   The enquiry was not followed by a formal complaint; no action was taken but thepoint was noted for future consideration.5.   The requirement also conflicts with a similar provision in theGeneral Agreement on Tarsffs and Trade but has not been objected toin that context.   On the other hand Her Majesty&apos;s Government havehad occasion to object to similar restrictions on assistance given byother governments to their own suppliers in other fields;  notablywhen the Italian Government gave grants to their farmers for the purchaseof tractors they confined them to Italian-made tractors.   This her majesty&apos;s Government objected to and the regulations were alteredto include foreign tractors.-1-COPY.NO.s0
6.   The Sea Fish Industry Bill now before Parliament makes pro- &apos;visions for grants and loans for new fishing boats of any size,including those over 140 ft.   This change will necessitate amendmentof the statutory scheme governing grants:  and consideration has there-fore been given as to whether we should continue the requirement that assistance is given only to boats (and engines) built in the United Kingdom.7.   The arguments for dropping our requirement are:(a) It conflicts with our obligations under the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the European Free Trade Area.(b) At a time when our fishing fleets are facing difficult and new conditions it can only be to their advantage to have access to foreignyards which could (in respect of certain specialised vessels) have something to offer which is not available in this country;   and(c) Foreign yards may be cheaper which would be of benefitboth to the fishing industry and the Exchequer.8.   On the other hand it was recognised that dropping the requirementmight adversely affect the boat-builders especially of the smaller boats,many of which are in the north-east of Scotland in areas of high un-employment and where alternative employement is difficult to find;and many of whom had already been affected by the decision of the WhiteFish Authority at the beginning of last year to go slow in giving furthergrants for new boa,ts.   On this account dropping the requirement couldbe expected to give rise to some political difficulty.9.   After interdepartmental discussion it was agreed in these cir-cumstances that the requirement should be dropped for boats over80 ft. , the builders of which are normally larger concerns: but therewas disagreement on whether the requirements should be retained for boats up to 80 ft.10. This question was considered by the Economic Policy Committeeon 28th March who decided that the requirement that grant-aided boats and engines should be built in the United Kingdom should be droppedaltogether, provided that those who wish to have vessels built abroadare required to provide evidence that British yards have been given  an equal chance to compete.   The decision was communicated by theMinister of Transport to the Boat Builders Associations and was announced by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in replyto a written Question on 18th May in the following terms:-&quot;It has been decided that having regard to fhe interests ofthe fishermen, for whom this assistance is provided, andto our international obligations, this requirement shouldbe removed.   It is intended that this decision will beput into effect in the schemes for grant assistance forthe purchase of vessels and engines, which will be presented to Parliament under the Sea Fish industry bill when it has received the Royal Assent.   A similar-2-
change will be made in the arrangements governing the provision of less assistance for these purposesby the White Fish Authority and the Herring industry board.Any applicants for grants and loans who propose to havevessels built abroad will be required to provide evidencethat British yards have been given an equal chance to compete. &quot;11.   The announcement has given rise to a whole string of parliamentary questions to all the Ministers involved . and there is an AdjournmentDebate on Whit Friday.   The Minister of Transport met representativesof the Boat Builders on 4th June.   The builders were partiallyreassured by the procedures proposed to ensure that British yardshad an opportunity to compete.   It was also agreed that a working party should be set up jointly with the industry to give further, studyto the position with special reference to the practices of otherGovernments which assist their fishing industries.12. One of the questions which has been raised and is likely tobe pressed is that it is unfair to British yards if grants are givenfor boats built in foreign yards that are subsidised by their Governments.This question has not been decided and there is a difference of opinion among Ministers concerned about it.   It will be considered by theEconomic Policy Committee on Thursday, 7th June, and a copy ofthe paper which the Secretary of State for Scotland has circulatedto the Committee on this aspect of the matter is annexed.J.S.M.C.S.5th June, 1962
ANNEXgrants and loans for fishing vessels&apos;&quot; &quot;    &quot;and engines&quot;&quot;An urgent decision is required on the question whether or notgrants and loans should be given to British fishermen to buy fishing vessels built in foreign shipyardswhich are known to be subsidised.background.      Grants and loans are given to fishermen, through the Y/hite FishAuthority and Herring Industry Board, towards the cost of new fishing vessels and engines.   Hitherto the vessels or engines have had to be built in the United Kingdom.   The Economic Policy Committee decided on 28th March that this restriction should be removed and grants andloams made available for foreign-built fishing vessels and engines.This decision was announced by the Minister of Agriculture in a writtenAnswer to a Parliamentary Question on 18th May.3.      The announcement has aroused a storm of protest.   The yardslikely to be most affected particularly for the smaller fishing boats,are mainly in Scottish areas of high unemployment, and have already be severely hit by a general curtailment of grants and loans by the WhiteFish Authority.    They claim that this further blow will be disastrous to them.   I, and other Ministers, have had a whole string of Parlia-mentary Questions, and there v/ill be an adjournment debate on &quot;WhitFriday.   An amendment has also been put down to the Sea Fish industry bill in the House of Lords to prohibit grants and loans for foreign-builtfishing vessels and engines.4,      The reply to the adjournment debate must clearly defend thedecision we have announced and I propose that this should be done by making the following points:-(a) That grants and loans are intended to help the fishing industry which clearly cannot lose and may gain by removal of res-restrictions on where they may purchase their boats;(b) That the restriction is open to challenge under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Convention of theEuropean Free Trade Association;(c) That there is no reason why British yards should not beable to hold their own in competition with foreign yards;and consequently that there is no reason to suppose thatremoval of the restriction will result in a substantial number of orders going abroad, or in itself seriously affect employment;  and-1-
(d)    That arrangements are being made to see that British yardshave an opportunity to compete in all cases.   In particular,the White Fish Authority and Herring Industry Board havebeen instructed that before authorising grant for a vesselto be built abroad, the applicant shall normally be requiredto invite tenders from four British yards;  and if he wishes to place the order abroad notwithstanding that there is a lower British tender, the amount of grant or loan payableshall not exceed that which would have been payable hadthe lowest British tender been accepted.5.      This however leaves open one important point on which ministers are divided, namely whether we should permit orders to be placed with foreign shipyards receiving subsidies from their own Governments,e. g. , in France and Spain.   It has already been stressed in the house and attention will certainly be focused on it in the debate;  it will therefore be necessary to give a clear indication of the governments position.6.      The Minister of Transport has suggested that the White FishAuthority and the Herring Industry Board should be told not to givefinancial assistance for orders placed in a specified list of countrieswhich subsidise their shipyards.7,      The Chief Secretary, Treasury and I understand, the Presidentof the Board of Trade think we should not withhold grants for boatsbuilt in subsidised yards because it is to the fishing industry&apos;s andthe Exchequer&apos;s advantage to get the boats at the lowest cost,irrespective of the cause of the low cost;   and because there are otherremedies open to us, e. g. , counteravailing duties, if we think theinterests of our shipbuilders are being adversely affected by subsidisedcompetitiono   The Chief Secretary has made the point that it will bedifficult to discriminate against foreign yards which receive subsidies,and particularly that blacklisting the countries concerned will be certain to lead to complaints.8.      I do not agree with this view.   The Economic Policy Committee&apos;decision was that the restriction should be removed &quot;on the under-standing . . . that British shipyards should be given an gsualppportunityto compete with foreign yards for the contracts&quot;.    The Minister ofAgriculture&apos;s reply of 18th May included the sentence:&quot;Any applicants for grants and loans who propose to have vesselsbuilt abroad will be required to provide evidence that british yards have been given an equal chance to compete-&quot;.To tolerate orders being placed with subsidised foreign shipyardscould not be held to give our shipyards an equal opportunity to compete;but would substitute, for an arrangement which discriminated in favourof British yards, one v/hich discriminated in favour of such foreignyards.   It would also deprive us of the only answer we can give toBritish yards v/hich may be affected by the decision, namely that ifthey are efficient they ought to be able to compete;  and it would be clearly contrary to what the Minister of Agriculture said in his reply.No new facts or circumstances have arisen since he gave it which would justify us in doing this.   It seems to me that in the adjournment debate-2-
CONFBDENT8ALit will have to be made clear that subsidised foreign shipyardswill be disqualified.   The alternative suggestion   which I understandhas been made that we should leave the question open and offer to re-consider it in the light of developments I do not think will satisfy theHouse.conclusion.     I therefore ask the Committee to agree:-(a) That the reply to the adjournment debate should be on thelines suggested in paragraph 4j  and(b) That it should also say that grants and loans will not beauthorised for ships to be built in subsidised foreign shipyard;J.S.M.Scottish Office, S.W.I.5th June, 1962-3-
