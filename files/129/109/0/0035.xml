SECRET -       JTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1962C. (62) 85 Copy No.  5925th May, 1962CABINETNATIONAL ASSISTANCE SCALESMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance1. By arrangement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer I am submitting forthe consideration of the Cabinet proposals for increases in National Assistancescale rates which the Chairman of the National Assistance Board has put to meinformally.2. As the Cabinet is aware the initiative for proposing a change in national assistance scale rates is placed by Section 6 of the National Assistance Act, 1948,upon the Board. This initiative is exercised by the submission to me of draft regulations. If I approve them they are laid before Parliament and require an affirmative resolution of both Houses.3. The proposals now put to me by the Chairman of the Board, as beingthose which his Board are likely to wish to put forward, are for an increase of 4s.a week in the rate for a single householder, and 6s. in the rate for a married couple,with appropriate changes in the other scale rates. These proposals would raisethe single and married householder rates to 57s. 6d. and 96s. a week respectively.4. The Chairman thinks that the Board will wish to consider specific proposals at a meeting next month and that the affirmative resolutions shouldbe taken during July so that the increased rates could be brought into effect inSeptember.5. As National Assistance sets the lowest standard on which people in thiscountry are expected to live, it is the duty of the National Assistance Board tokeep close watch on movements in prices. It is for that reason, and to permit ofswift action, that Parliament has provided that changes in National Assistancescale rates can be effected by Regulations approved by affirmative resolutions ofboth Houses.6. On the basis of the official Index of Retail Prices, which has already risen to 119-7 for April 1962, the sum required to give the main assistance scale rate(that for a single householder now 53s. 6d.) the same real value as in April 1961is 56s. 6d. (3s. more). So far as the married couple rate is concerned, the presentposition is even worse. The sum now required to give the same real value as inApril 1961 is 95s. Id. (5s. Id. more).7. In view of the increase of 1 - 6 points in the Index just announced anincrease which takes the rounded figure for it to the 120 which we had been advisedwas likely to be reached by July (when on the programme proposed below weshould be taking the regulations through Parliament to operate in September) thepossibility of further increases in the Index in the coming months cannot be ruled out. It would be most unfortunate if events necessitated the Board&apos;s having to propose further changes during the next 12 months. I would like to amplify thispoint orally. Previous changes occasioned by price increases have, moreover,since 1951 always aimed at providing for the scale rates as at the date of their60855
coming into operation to contain some allowance for price increases during somemonths ahead. For all these reasons the Chairman of the Board thinks an increaseof 4s. in the single scale rate would be appropriate.8. To give equivalent increases over April 1961 the increase in the married couple rate should be 6s. 6d. to go with a 4s. increase for a single householder.I understand, however, that the Board feel that the married couple rate was put up relatively rather more in the .1959 and 1961 operations considered together, andthat they will probably now wish to tip the balance rather in favour of the single person, who is in their view always the harder hit, especially by increasing fuelprices. To put the two rates in the same relationship as in the original 1948 scalethe sum required to correspond with a 4s. single rate increase would be 6s.9. So far I have described the position in relation to the official Index of retail Prices. The National Assistance Board also make certain calculationsrelated to the spending habits of a group of poorer persons covered by the household Expenditure Enquiry of 1953-54. These calculations have so far runvery close to the official Index, producing at March 1962 for the single householderscale rate a figure only 3d. less (an April figure is not yet available). What the relationship of the two will be in future is highly speculative, but the poor persons&apos;calculations seem unlikely to differ in any significant way from the official Index.In any case it would seem to be very difficult to give less than the official Indexwould justify, since this is the basis generally used in the House of Commons and elsewhere in defence of the value of the rates.10. It seems highly desirable that increases should be brought into operationnot later than the autumn, before the November increase in fuel prices takes effect.From the Parliamentary point of view this means taking the necessary affirmative resolutions in both Houses in July. It is well known that the Board require no more than seven or eight weeks from the date of such resolutions to put scale ratechanges into operation. In the light of this, and of the fact that these are changesnecessitated by a rise in the cost of living, it would not seem possible to postpone the operation beyond about the middle of September. If action is not taken inParliament in July, it would probably not be possible to make changes operativeuntil early in the New Year.11. Precise estimates of the cost depend upon the settlement of the subordinatescale rates. These include the rate for a person living as a member of someoneejse&apos;s household usually a son&apos;s or daughters-(now 49s. 6d. compared with53s. 6d. for the single householder) for which on this occasion the Board might beprepared for the first time to recommend an increase smaller by Is. or so thanthe 4s. proposed for the householder. The Chairman informs me that he has had no opportunity of testing the views of the present members of the Board on this point.But if this were done, and subject, within small margins, to what might be settledabout other subordinate rates, it is estimated that an increase of 4s. (single) and6s. (married) would cost about  22 million a year. Each sixpence, more or less,on the main scale rate would mean an increase or reduction in the total cost of between  2 million and  3 million; it is not possible to be more precise about this because adjustments in the subordinate rates cannot follow in exact proportionadjustments in the main rate; each rate must be looked at by the Board, both onits own merits and in its relation to each other proposed rate.J.
