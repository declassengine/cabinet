Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1962C. (62) 72 Copy No.   5$14th May, 1962CABINETFACILITIES FOR PASSENGERS AT THE MAIN PASSENGER PORTSMemorandum by the Minister of TransportPrevious Consideration. On 4th May, 1961, the Cabinet considered a note bythe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (61) 56), to which was annexed thereport of a Committee of Ministers appointed to consider means of increasing theUnited Kingdom&apos;s earnings from visitors to this country. It was noted that oneof the factors deterring tourists from coming to this country was the inadequacy of the facilities for passengers at the packet ports. It was suggested that theCabinet should have the opportunity to consider a report by Lord Chesham, theJoint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Transport, on conditions at the ports,and I was invited to circulate a report on the improvement of the facilities for passengers at the main passenger ports (C.C. (61) 26th Conclusions, Minute 7).2. Visits to the Packet Ports. With the appointment of Vice-AdmiralHughes-Hallett to my Department as Parliamentary Secretary responsible for shipping and ports, I handed over to him the task of visiting and reporting onthese matters. Admiral Hughes-Hallett visited the packet ports of Dover,Folkestone and Harwich on two weekends at the end of July 1961 and reportedto me on the conditions which he observed. A summary of this report and of the comments on it of the Home Office, Customs and Excise and the British transport commission is annexed. His general recommendations, he considers, would apply equally to the other packet ports. His report does not cover any of the majorports through which visitors enter or leave the United Kingdom, since facilities at these terminals, with the exception of Greenock, are generally considered to beof a reasonably high standard. (Greenock is a difficult problem, because theGreenock Harbour Trust have insufficient funds to carry out the major improvements required.)Admiral Hughes-Hallett&apos;s Report3. Admiral Hughes-Hallett&apos;s report specifies two main causes of congestion and delay at the packet ports which give rise to complaints.  These are:(a) The physical facilities for the reception of passengers and their luggage.(b) The customs and immigration controls through which passengers andtheir luggage have to pass.His report suggests ways which appear to him likely to improve these facilities and the operation of the controls, but he makes it clear that his suggestions forthe partial relaxation of the controls involve questions of policy on which heexpresses no opinion. I have referred the views and recommendations containedin the report to the Home Office, Customs and Excise, and the British transport commission for their comments. A summary of their main comments is includedin the Annex.4. Immigration and Customs Controls. The Home Office and Customs and excise on the whole consider that the suggestions contained in the report regardingways in which the controls operated by the immigration and customs authorities could be relaxed are unacceptable.   Our immigration and customs proceduresCONFIDENTIAL60813 a
have already been relaxed considerably, and the controls at present operated havebeen reduced to the minimum consistent with the enforcement of the legal and policy obligations placed on these Departments. Several of the suggestions madeby Admiral Hughes-Hallett have been carefully considered many times in the past,and the Departments concerned are satisfied that they would not lead to any improvement in the arrangements. The Home Office and the Customs are of theopinion that the situation could be improved if the physical space and facilities inwhich the immigration and customs examinations are operated were brought to ahigher standard. This is no doubt correct, though Admiral Hughes-Hallett pointsout that to secure a marked improvement in the handling of passengers throughthe controls a larger immigration and customs staff would be required to complement any improvement in space and physical facilities which could beachieved.5. Reception Facilities. The British Transport Commission (and the DoverHarbour Board) are responsible for the facilities for the reception of passengersat the packet ports. They are under no illusion that the present facilities fall short of what is desirable, but there are serious difficulties, mainly financial, in the wayof improving them. As Admiral Hughes-Hallett points out, they were constructedmany years ago, when the volume of passenger traffic was very much less than itis at present. There are serious limitations of space for improvements at all these ports, and large-scale rearrangement of layout or reconstruction of facilities wouldbe extremely costly. The report examines the possibilities of carrying outimprovements at three levels:(a) Large-scale improvements.(b) Medium-scale improvements (to provide more space for the handling of passengers).(c) Minor improvements (to provide better protection for passengers from the weather).The report recommends that large-scale improvements would not be justified, thatthe medium-scale improvements, costing between  100,000 and  200,000,recommended for each of the various ports should be carried out provided thatan assurance is given that additional immigration and customs staff to match the improved facilities would be forthcoming; and that the minor improvementsrecommended at the various ports costing between  20,000 and  30,000 shouldbe carried out in any case.Difficulties in Improving Reception Facilities6. The medium-scale improvements recommended at Harwich are either inhand or are being planned for the near future. Doubts are cast, however, by theBritish Transport Commission, and in certain respects by the Home Office andthe Customs, on whether the medium-scale and minor improvements recommendedat Dover and Folkestone are feasible or justified.7. Moreover, any major expenditure on improvements at the packet ports isinhibited by the uncertain future of the proposals before the British and french governments for the construction of a Channel Tunnel or a Channel Bridge. Adecision on these proposals is unlikely to be reached before the second half ofthis year at the earliest. The British and French Railways, who are associatedwith the Channel Tunnel proposals, envisage the withdrawal of the present shortcross-channel sea services operated by them in the event of the tunnel being constructed. This would involve the withdrawal of the whole of their sea services from Dover, Folkestone and Newhaven, and sea traffic through Harwich mightbe reduced by as much as half.8. Similar forecasts have not been made by the railways in relation to thebridge proposals, but the existence of a bridge for road and rail traffic would inevitably diminish the need for sea services to at least the same extent. In the face of this prospect, it would be unreasonable to expect the port authorities to invest any substantial sums in the improvement of the facilities at the packet portsat present. The Board of Trade, however, hold the view that, for the sake ofthe tourist traffic, improvements should be planned now to cover the period before a tunnel or bridge could be opened (should the decision go that way) and thatthe Government might consider providing some financial assistance towards suchimprovements.
9. Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962. Additional difficulties will begin to be caused this summer by the considerable increase in the number of arrivingpassengers who will have to be interviewed by immigration officers. This willbe required by the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962, which brings manyCommonwealth citizens within the scope of the control as from 1st July. this requirement will place a heavy extra strain on the arrangements at some of thepacket ports (notably Dover and Folkestone), especially at the busy weekendsin summer.Conclusions10. (a) Facilities at the ports for visitors arriving from long sea voyages are,with the minor exception of Greenock, reasonably satisfactory.(b) Facilities at the packet ports where passengers arrive by sea from theContinent are severely overtaxed at busy weekends in summer. Thisstrain will be considerably increased this year by the requirements ofthe Commonwealth Immigrants Act.(c) Significant improvements at the packet ports can only be achieved bysubstantial capital expenditure of the order of some hundreds of thousands of pounds. The partial relaxation of customs and immigration procedures would be a useful complement to suchimprovements if policy permitted.(d) The customs and immigration authorities see little scope for relaxing theirprocedures unless it is decided to make major changes in government policy and the existing law. (This was not recommended by theCommittee on Tourism, and their report was accepted in this regardby Cabinet.) On the contrary, the new procedures for controllingCommonwealth immigration may make matters seriously worse.(e) It would be unreasonable to expect the authorities concerned (the british transport Commission and the Dover Harbour Board) to incur anysubstantial capital expenditure before decisions have been reached inprinciple on the Channel Tunnel and Bridge projects.Recommendations11.  I recommend that:(a) The customs and immigration authorities should be invited to keep under constant review with the port authorities all possibilities of improving the present arrangements for passengers, either by minor capital worksor by improved procedures.(b) Until a decision is reached on the Channel Tunnel and Bridge projects,the port authorities should not be pressed to devote scarce capital resources to any more extensive improvements; they should, however,be invited to complete their plans for works of this nature which mightbe undertaken at once if it were decided that there were to be noChannel Tunnel or Bridge.(c) Further consideration should be given to the suggestion of the Board ofTrade that improvements should be undertaken to cover the next fewyears, even if a Channel Tunnel or Bridge is to be constructed, and themethod of financing such improvements.E.

annex summary of a Report by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Transport,on the Facilities for Tourists at Certain Packet Ports and of the comments of the Home Office, the Customs and Excise and the British TransportCommissionBasis of Report. The report is based on visits made to Harwich (ParkestonQuay), Dover (Dover Marine) and Folkestone (Folkestone Harbour) by the joint parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Transport, Vice-Admiral Hughes-Hallett,during the last two weekends of July 1961. Admiral Hughes-Hallett was accompanied on these visits by representatives of the Home Office (ImmigrationBranch), the Customs and Excise, the Ministry of Transport and British Railways(Eastern and Southern Regions).2. Reason for Present Difficulties and Delays. Admiral Hughes-Hallettconsiders that the basic reason for the present difficulties and delays at the packetports is the inadequacy of the facilities at these ports, present conditions being whollydifferent from those which prevailed when they were established.3. Conflict between Speed and Comfort. Admiral Hughes-Hallett notes thatthere is a conflict between speed and comfort in the handling of passengers at these ports. Passengers could be passed through the formalities at the optimum speedif there were no classes of rail and steamer accommodation, no reservation of seats on trains, no seats provided during the formalities and there was a constantexhortation to hurry along. Most passengers, however, wish the present facilities to be provided and this complicates and slows down the procedures of embarkationand disembarkation.4. Customs and Immigration Controls. So far as the individual passenger isconcerned the principal effects of the existing customs and immigration controlsare summarised as follows:(a) Except at Folkestone, they greatly increase the distance a passenger hasto walk between ship and train (e.g., 200 yards at Dover). This is also,of course, affected by the berthing arrangements for the ships.(b) They agitate and irritate many passengers.(c) They delay passengers in transit, but they are not the cause of all the delays, since even if there were no controls the transit of a full ship-loadof passengers would take much longer than is desirable on account ofthe restricted facilities.(d) The routines of embarkation and disembarkation have been developed overa period of time within the framework of the physical facilities available, so that it cannot readily be determined which part of thesystem is the limiting factor. The various stages in the procedures tend,in fact, to filter the passengers through the whole process at the ratewith which each part of the process can cope.Suggested Ways in which Customs and Immigration Controls could be relaxed5. Whether or not the present customs and immigration controls should be relaxed is a matter of policy on which Admiral Hughes-Hallett expresses noopinion. He considers it useful, however, to tabulate the actual ways in whichrelaxation could be provided in the interest of speed and comfort if this were held to be justified, as follows:ia) Immigration(i) By altogether abandoning the special checks on foreign visitors (TheParliamentary Secretary emphasises in parenthesis that so long as these special checks are considered necessary it is in everyone&apos;s interest to separateBritish passengers entering the country from foreigners).
Comment: The Home Office say that unfortunately this would not bepossible, because genuine tourists cannot be identified at a glance. TheCommittee on Tourism recommended, on security grounds, that the presentsystem of control should be retained unless the improvement of physicalfacilities permitted some modification.(ii) By confining the special immigration checks to persons who comefrom those countries from which undesirable refugees are most likely to beexpected. (For example, by allowing nationals of those countries belongingto the Council of Europe, together with United States citizens, to enter with no more formality than that required of British subjects.)Comment: The Home Office state that this also would be unsatisfactorybecause their experience shows that undesirables are not confined to particularnationalities (any more than they are confined to the refugee category). Thereare very few bona fide Italian tourists to this country, for example, thoughItaly is a Council of Europe country; and there are a number of undesirablesfrom the United States, 151 of whom were refused admission in 1961 out ofa total of 3,149 refusals.(iii) By conducting the control while on passage wherever feasible, as isalready done on some of the short sea routes.Comment: The Home Office say that the immigration examination isalready conducted on passage wherever feasible. The only possible scope for extension is on the day service from the Hook of Holland to Harwichor on one of the daytime Dover-Ostend services, but the operators (theZeeland Shipping Company and the Belgian Marine) display no enthusiasmfor the introduction of this facility, and it is debatable whether it would be tothe passengers&apos; advantage on these services.(iv) While preserving in theory the present standards of immigration control, nevertheless to regulate the time taken by the officers for examinationof foreigners to a speed necessary to ensure that the flow of passengers isabout as fast as the customs hall can cope with.Comment: The Home Office consider that they could not advocate a&quot; quick-slow&quot; method as a desirable practice, though they do sometimeshave to halt the flow of passengers because of congestion in the customs hall.The only effective methods of overcoming the difficulties would be either theprovision of adequate space in the immigration and customs halls or theconstruction of intermediate or &quot; buffer&quot; waiting areas between the twocontrols as at London Airport (Heathrow) Central.(v) By providing a special channel for wealthy and fussy passengers whoare prepared to pay heavily for V.I.P. treatment.Comment: There is no Home Office or Customs objection to theextension of the &quot; Golden Arrow &quot; procedure, provided that the carryingcompanies remained responsible for selecting the privileged passengers andpresenting them to the controls ahead of the remaining passengers. Aseparate and parallel channel for &quot; amenity&quot; passengers would, however,be extremely wasteful of staff and accommodation. The British transport commission do not, on the other hand, favour even the extension of the&quot; Golden Arrow &quot; procedure, because, apart from being difficult to operate and producing little extra income, the arrangement would give rise to adversepublic criticism.(b) Customs(i) By abandoning the check on outward bound passengers (if this is acceptable, every effort should be made, to reduce the distance walked bypassengers).Comment: The Customs and Excise are unable to agree to the complete abolition of outwards customs examination as long as export licensing andcurrency controls continue to exist and they are made responsible for theirpractical application. Outward examination for these purposes has alreadybeen reduced to the bare minimum; complete and overt abandonment of the controls would at present be unacceptable to the Board of Trade and theTreasury.
(ii) By allowing a percentage of incoming passengers to short-circuit thecustoms hall. (In other words, experienced customs officers would select thosewho were to pass through the customs hall and allow the remainder toproceed direct to the train.)Comment: The Customs and Excise see difficulties about this suggestion.The proposal would require a preliminary control at the entrance to thebaggage hall; as a customs officer cannot fairly appraise a passenger merely by glancing at him but must observe his manner and demeanour in response to a certain minimum amount of questioning, the preliminary control mightwell become a bottleneck. The discrimination would be clearly evident to alland would probably cause some irritation and complaint among passengers.There might well be difficulty in reuniting passengers with their baggage; this at present takes place in the customs hall.(iii) Alternatively, by giving passengers customs declaration forms in theship and passing those with &quot; Nothing to declare&quot; through a separatechannel, with liability for heavier penalties if it were found that thedeclaration was false.  .Comment: The feasibility of a written declaration has been consideredmany times, and the Customs and Excise are satisfied that it would slowthings down rather than speed them up. There would be little enough time during the Channel crossing to ensure that all passengers were supplied withdeclaration forms, much less to ensure that they had been filled up completelyand intelligibly; many of them would have to be adjusted on arrival. Thereis a certain amount of flexibility and discretion in oral questioning which itwould not be at all easy to preserve if things were written down in blackand white. There would also be legal difficulties about the proposal as thelaw now stands.(iv) Or again, while preserving the present system whereby all passengerspass through the customs hall, by instructing the customs officers to regulate the thoroughness of their examination as requisite to ensure that the flowthrough the hall is as fast as the practicable rate of boarding the train. (Itis noted that this is in practice already done at Dover and Folkestone duringthe peak periods.)Comment: The Customs and Excise say that this is done at present and,in any event, passengers are normally cleared by Customs before the scheduledtimes of departure of trains.Suggested Ways in which the Physical Facilities could be Improved6. Admiral Hughes-Hallett suggests that the physical facilities could be improved on three different scales:(a) By Bringing them to the Air Travel LevelThis would involve sub-dividing each ship-load of passengers intogroups not exceeding 200 and providing a separate channel for each.The cost of this would be reckoned in millions of pounds and it would necessitate a great waste of customs officials, immigration officers,police and porters.Admiral Hughes-Hallett recommends that expenditure on the elaborate facilities which this would entail should not be entertained,as the packet services do not lend themselves to air travel procedures.(b) Medium-scale Developments to Ensure(i) That the platforms and railway lines will permit of sufficient trainswaiting at each berth to accommodate all the passengers on anyone ship.(ii) Sufficient channels and waiting rooms to ensure that entraininginto each of these trains can proceed simultaneously. Inpractice, this would mean two channels at most berths, with a third and smaller emergency channel for use when three boattrains are needed for any one ship. A rough indication of thecost of intermediate improvements of this nature is between 100,000 and  200,000 at each port.   Admiral Hughes-Hallett
emphasises that improvements of this nature would only bejustified if the customs and immigration controls were relaxedand speeded up or, alternatively, if the necessary number ofadditional officials were employed to match up to the improvedfacilities.(c) Minor Work (measured in tens of thousands of pounds) to provide bettershelter from the wind and weather to obviate the need for queueing inthe open. Admiral Hughes-Hallett states that the desirability of theseminor works is quite independent of any changes in customs and immigration controls.Recommended Improvements at Harwich, Dover and Folkestone are summarised in the AppendixMedium-scale Improvements (Comment)7. The British Transport Commission state that, in their view, the estimatesgiven in the report for medium-scale developments are on the low side. In anycase, the Commission indicate that they could not contemplate expenditure of this order at the Channel packet ports until a decision is reached on the proposals fora Channel Tunnel or Channel Bridge, since any extension of the existing facilities at Dover and Folkestone would be wasted if a new fixed cross-Channel link wereconstructed. The Harwich services would not cease to operate, but they wouldbe considerably affected by the existence of a Channel Tunnel or Bridge.However, medium-scale improvements here are already in hand-. Authorisationhas been given for the extension of the customs and immigration hall, and thisshould be completed in the autumn of 1962; plans for a new island platform onthe lines recommended in the report are being developed, and it is hoped that thiswill be completed by the end of 1963.8. The medium-scale improvements recommended at Dover are contingent on the abolition of the outward customs inspection, and the Customs and Excisehave stated that such abolition is unacceptable. Moreover, the Home Office doubt whether the controls could be rearranged, to permit the simultaneous handling oftraffic in both directions without a considerable expansion of floor space. TheCommission consider that the probable future use of Folkestone would not justifythe expenditure involved in duplicating the present customs and immigrationfacilities.Minor Improvements (Comment)9. Admiral Hughes-Hallett recommends that minor improvements to give better protection from wind and weather should be carried out whatever else maybe done. The Home Office, however, are doubtful whether it would be practicable to cover over the quaysides completely at the packet ports to provide protection from wind and weather and still leave room for cranes to operate, and they fear that any form of light construction would have a very short life in the Channelgales. The Commission say that experiments are being carried out at Dover witha new design of covered gangway for embarkation and disembarkation but that provision of covered ways for passengers between the ship and the customs hallsat Dover and Harwich would entail alterations and expenditure on a major scale.General Conclusions10. Admiral Hughes-Hallett concludes that if it is intended to retain the searoutes to the Continent for all types of traveller he would advise medium-scaleimprovements as at paragraph 6 (b) above. He stresses again, however, that theseought not to be undertaken unless there is a definite assurance that customs and immigration control could be speeded up as requisite, either by employing moreofficials or by relaxing the controls, to take advantage of the money spent.11. He does not consider that these medium-scale improvements need be linked to the future of the Channel Tunnel project because, even if the Tunnelwere begun at once, it would be several years before it came into service, and, even when it was in service, it by no means follows that public demand for a sea routewould entirely vanish. If the railways stopped their service on the existing searoutes a private enterprise service might be started in their place.
12. If, on the other hand, it is felt that no expenditure beyond that requiredfor the minor improvements (paragraph 6 (c)) is justified, Admiral Hughes-Hallett considers that the sea routes should be advertised as being intended duringthe peak periods primarily for those who wish to economise and are willing toaccept austerity. Logically this means the adoption of single class travel with noreserved seats at peak periods. But, if this is thought to be too drastic, herecommends a smaller proportion of first-class passengers than at present, whowould pay rather more and who, in return, would precede the second-classpassengers through a special channel and leave ahead of them in a small first-classtrain. (The British Transport Commission do not accept this conclusion. they state that very seldom even during the summer period do carryings approach thevessels&apos; maximum capacity it does not happen at more than a few weekends and that first-class passengers enjoy a reasonable standard of comfort.)AppendixRecommended Improvements at Particular ports the report lists the following possible medium scale and minor improvementsat the various ports:(a) Harwich (Parkeston Quay)Minor Improvements (estimated cost about  20,000)(i) Provision of better protection from the weather betweengangways and the inspection halls.(ii) Provision of a waiting room on an available site at the Easternend.Medium-scale Improvements (estimated cost between  100,000 and 200,000)Provision of extra platforms so that two or three boat trains couldbe in the station simultaneously.(b) Dover (Dover Marine)Minor Improvements (estimated cost about  30,000)Provision of better protection from the weather between gangwaysand the inspection halls.Medium-scale Improvements (estimated cost about  100,000)Re-arrangement of control facilities to permit the simultaneoushandling of traffic in both directions when required. (N.B. in order to achieve this the outward customs inspection would have to be abolished.)(c) Folkestone (Folkestone Harbour)Minor ImprovementsNil.Medium-scale Improvements (estimated cost between  100,000 and 200,000)Provision of a second immigration and customs hall as an upperstorey to the existing one.
