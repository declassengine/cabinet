CJ&amp;SLZI COPY NO. .JP15th May, 1962CABINETGRANTS TO STUDENTSMy reasons for asking my colleagues to accept the proposals made by the Lord President, the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself and reproduced here in the Annex were:-(i)     The Lord President of the Council, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and I appointed the Standing Advisory Committee onAwards to Students (the Hill Committee) to make an objective survey of the whole field of student grants.(ii)     The Committee have made this objective survey and their conclusion is:-(a) That there should be parity of treatment betweenuniversity, advanced technical college andteacher training students.(b) That the standard grants should be increased byahout 20 per cent from next October.(iii)     Parity is manifestly just and is pressed on both sides of theHouse.(iv)    On grants the Committee acted responsibly and their proposals were not unreasonable;  four years have elapsed since the lastreview.(v)    Nevertheless, our economic situation demanded a most search-ing examination of the Committee&apos;s proposals;  our revised proposalsinvolve increases in the basic rate of grant of 10 per cent to 14 per cent,or roughly Zj per cent to 3/ per cent per annum since the last review.(v;l)    Increases of this order, plus the cost of applying the rates tostudents on comparable courses, would increase the total bill onawards in England and Wales in a full year by 15 per cent, and a littlemore including Scotland.(vii)      Even if these revised proposals are now agreed by mycolleagues they lead to strong protest from the student body which thedons will support.    I think, but am not too hopeful, that we mightMFIDENTSAL
succeed in presenting them to the Hill Committee as being modelledupon, and not a complete rejection of, their Report.     But the resigna-tion of some or all the members is a possibility.(viii)    Comparison with salaries, even of university staff, is notvalid.    A student&apos;s grant is based on a limited range of essentialexpenses.    If comparison is to be made, however, it must beremembered that: -(a) University staff had a rise of about 13   per cent from January, I960.(b) The 3 per cent award from April, 1962, has beencommuted to provide a rise of about  100, ormore than 10 per cent, for the lowest paidlecturers.     This compares with the proposedaverage increase for students of  35.(c) University staffs have been promised furtherconsideration of their salary claim next year,whereas the student grants do not come intoforce until next October and would, in thenormal way, be expected to remain in force for perhaps three years.D.

CONFIDE NTS ALANNEXPROPOSALS MADE BY THE LORD PRESIDE NT, OQljECOUNCIL AND THE EDUGATION MINISTERS TO THECOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION policy. The Standing Advisory Committee on Grants to Studentsrecommended:-(a) The, removal of differences in the rates for students atfurther education colleges and training colleges in orderto ensure parity of treatment with university students.We support this.     It accords with the recommendations of the AndersonCommittee and with Ministerial statements during the passage of theEducation Bill in Parliament and elsewhere.):     /&apos; :&apos;-  : ! &apos; .     &apos;   &apos;       .   &apos; -    .-      :\- &apos; &apos;/&apos;/- &apos;    ... .&quot;;        &apos;&apos; &quot;:     :&apos; .&quot;&apos; ,,;&apos;:&apos;.&quot;v\ -(b) A maintenance allowance during the vacation in place ofthe present &quot;contribution&quot; towards vacation expenses.We reject this. It is costly and unlikely to achieve the Committee&apos;s aim off discouraging students from working in the vacation. Instead we would raise the vacation allowance from  25 to  30.(c) A general increase in the existing maintenance grants.The Committee recommended increases up to, and in some casesexceeding, 20 per cent.   Their proposals were based on careful examination of existing charges and can hardly be faulted.   Neverthelessin view of the need for economy and the total cost of the proposals we donot feel able to accept a basic increase of more than ten per cent,(rising exceptionally to 13 or 14 per cent in cases markedly out of line)even though on a strict examination of rises in subsistence costs agreater increase would be justified.   In the four years since the lastreview, the cost of living index has risen by 8 per cent, but if the elements are counted in the proportions in which they occur in astudentrs budget the rise is 14 per cent.2.
