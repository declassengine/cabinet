f &apos;(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (62) 77 COPY NO. SP.cabinet national ASSISTANCE SCALESMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance in accordance with the Cabinet decision of 29th May (C. C. (62) 38thConclusions, Minute 5) I have discussed further with the Chairman of theNational Assistance Board the proposals which he has in mind to putforward for improvements in National Assistance scale rates.2.      The Chairman is very unhappy at the suggestion that the improve-ment in the scale rate for single householders should be at no higher rate than 3s. 6d.    He feels that an increase limited to this amount would notonly involve, a substantial departure from what has been the practice ofthe Board for a good many years - see my memorandum C. (62) 85, para-graph 7 - but would involve the risk of fresh pressure on the rates at anearly date.    He also feels that recent and impending changes, e.g. ,increases in fuel prices, cause particular hardship to the single house-holder on National Assistance.    In the light of these considerations andof the virtual erosion of the value cf the.increases granted in April,1961, he would feel great difficulty in commending to his Board an increasein the single householder rate of less than 4s.3.      On the other hand he does feel, as indicated in my earlier paper,that recent changes in scale rates have tended in some measure to favour the married householder.    He would therefore be prepared to recommendan increase of 5s. 6d. only in the married householder scale rate, asagainst the 6s. which he originally put forward.4.     In deference also to the Governments wish to keep the cost of theincrease on this occasion to the lowest reasonable figure he would,provided that the 4s. single householder rate is acceptable, be prepared tomake a substantial departure from past practice in respect of the singlenon-householder rate.    Since 1948, when the single householder and singlenon-householder rates were fixed respectively at 24s. and 20s. , both havebeen successively increased by the same amount with the result that the single non-householder rate now stands at 4 9s. 6d. compared with53s. 6d. for the single householder.    On this occasion, on the basis of a4s. increase in the single householder rate, the Chairman would beprepared to recommend to his Board an increase of 2s. only in the singlenon-householder rate.    He emphasises, however, that he does not feelthat he could reasonably be expected to put forward at the same time tworestrictive departures from past practice, that is, both a single house-holder rate with virtually no provision for increases in prices in thefuture and an increase for the non-householder at a lower rate than forthe householder.1991 kt si
5.      I also discussed with the Chairman the question of the operative date.    As the Cabinet will recall, his original proposal was 10th September.On the assumption that the affirmative resolutions of both Houses havebeen obtained by the end of July, this date would allow plenty of time on past precedents for the Board to bring the new scale rates into operation.The Chairman emphasised the great difficulty of appearing deliberatelyto delay implementation and so denying the poorest section of the popula-tion an increase in rates required in order merely to restore the real value of the scales to what they were rather more than a year ago.     If,however, they did involve some measure of provision for the future, a modest further delay, though embarrassing, is one which he feels that hecould face.    On the basis, therefore, of a 4s. single householder rate,the Chairman could be persuaded to put forward 24th September asoperative date.    I should add that he does feel that in any event anOctober date would be most unhappily received.6.      The effect of these changes in the chairman s original proposal is to reduce the annual cost of the improvements from the approximately 22 million a year given in my earlier paper to  20j million (as againstthe Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals costing  17 million).     The postponement of a fortnight in operative date would additionally save, in the current year, something of the order of  800,000.7.      My own judgment is that, while the proposals in their present form are at a level which is liable to expose the Board and the Govern-ment to some criticism on the grounds of severe treatment of the poorestsection of our population, they   are on grounds of social policy and ofeconomical administration sensible when taken together,,    My own experience is that the Board are right in their view that it is the singlehouseholder, often an old person living alone, who finds things most difficult.    On the other hand I think that it would be of value for thefuture to establish a precedent for making a smaller increase in theprovision for the non-householder than is made for the householder.    I agree, however, with the Board&apos;s view that it would really not be practicable to do so unless we can make at the same time for the singlehouseholder an improvement which it can be argued is at any rate in line with our practice over the last ten years.    I also endorse theBoard&apos;s view that an October date is simply asking for trouble.    Even24th September, as suggested above, will involve a good deal of criticism.8.      I have discussed this matter with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,who, in the light of the views expressed by the Chairman of the Board,is prepared to acquiesce in these new proposals for the respectiveamounts and the date.    He thinks, however, that, if the single house-holder^ rate is raised now by 4s, , it should not be assumed that nexttime it will be necessary to raise this further by more than 2s. 6d. or3s.J.A.
