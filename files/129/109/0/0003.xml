CABINETKENYA CONSTITUTIONAL conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the purpose of the Conference has been to agree on a con-stitution which could be introduced with self-government arid would continuebasically unaltered into independence.   In this purpose it is clear, after five weeks of discussion, that the Conference has failed.   I have triedas hard as possible to find a basis for agreement as I thought this tobe the only way to proceed, but the gulf between the main partiesremains too wide to be bridged.   There is however in this failure one important consolation, namely, that there can be no question of fixingnow a date for independence.   Although everyone will protest when Itell them this - and the extremists will protest with genuine passion - Ido not think that any of them in their own hearts really expect me to dootherwise.2.      (i)   The Kenya African National Union (KANU).    KANU, led by Mr. Kenyatta, represent a combination of the Kikuyu, Luo andKamba tribes.   They also have some support amongst some of theother tribes.   These three main tribes represent just over half the total population of Kenya and at the last election their candidates received just over two-thirds of the votes cast.  rWithin KANU there are dissensions:the Luo and the Kamba are not natural allies of the Kikuyu, who   aregenerally regarded as being the most able - as they are the most numeroustribe in Kenya.   The political leaders are divided between the moderatesled by Mr. Mboya, who in my view genuinely desires to see a civilisedKenya, and the old guard of thugs and ex-detainees who work withMr. Oginga Odinga, the main beneficiary  from Communist money.Mr. Kenyatta is the accepted leader of the Kikuyu, and although hismental powers are clearly declining (and his colleagues openly acknowledgethis) his hold over his tribe and its terrorist organisation remains strong enough for him still to be a most formidable figure, particularly inalliance with Mr. Oginga Odinga.(ii)  The Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU).   KADU, led by Mr. Ngala together with Sir Michael Blundell&apos;s New Kenya Party,form the present Government of Kenya.   They represent a number of smaller tribes.   In some cases, such as the Kalenjin, they command the entire loyalty of the group:  in other cases they command a sub-stantial proportion.   At the last election their candidates obtained betweenG.(62) 53 COPY NO. jjjP19th March,.....1962
one-fifth and a quarter of the votes cast, although they did much better inthe number of the seats which they obtained.    They are basically friendlypeople gexiuinely opposed to terrorism and fearful of domination bythe Kikuyu, and particularly by the thug element in that tribe.   unfortunate-nately, they are as a political party far less well organised or effective than KANU and I fear that if anything they are losing ground in Kenyaas a whole.(iii)  Other Participants:  Apart from one or two representativesof special interests the only other main party to the Conference is the kenya Coalition Party, who represent the European farming interests.It is difficult to be sure how much support they have among the european community, where generally they would be regarded as too moderate.At this Conference they are being very helpful and sensible.The Proposals and Tactics of the Participants3.      KANU have put forward from the start a fairly orthodox con-stitution of a centralised character.   Their proposals differ from theso-called Westminster model in that they provide for a written con-stitution with special safeguards for individuals and for some local interests, together with substantial safeguards against changes in theconstitution to the detriment of minorities.   From the point of viewof efficent government I have no doubt that their proposals are on theright lines - and indeed they would take over most of the existing system -but it is questionable whether their safeguards for individuals wouldin practice be adequate, and certainly they are not thought to be adequateby KADU.   In the course of the Conference KANU have shown themselvesconciliatory and willing to negotiate.   They have made two major con-cessions to the KADU point of view - first, the acceptance of a second chamber, and second, the acceptance of governing authorities, with powers of their own entrenched in the constitution, at a level higherthan existing local authorities.4.      KADU have based their ideas on what they call &quot;federalism&quot; or&quot;regionalism&quot;.   In detail their proposals have been much influenced bythe fact that they are advised by a Swiss constitutional expert;   andmany features of their proposals, while no doubt workable in Switzerland,make no sense in Kenya.   They have been determined to erect what theycall &quot;defence in depth&quot; by dividing Kenya into six regional states withlegislative andadministrative powers on a large scale, and further by insisting on a second chamber with powers equal  to that of the federallower house.   While their proposals might protect local interests,this is not to my mind certain:   on the other hand, it is quite clear that,from the point of view of practical administration, they make little sense.Unfortunately, KADU&apos;s tactics throughout have been to be as intransigentas possible, and such concessions as they have made have been very smalland wrung from them only by a process like extracting teeth.5.      The Kenya Coalition Party have concentrated mainly on theprotection of European lives and property.   On the whole they shareKADU&apos;s views on the Kikuyu tut recognise the unpra.ctica.lity of KADU&apos;sproposals and have been trying to improve them.
The ^^e^^nt^ijuation6.      If it were possible to strip away phrases like &quot;Federation1&apos;,&quot;Regionalism&quot; and &quot;Unitary Government&quot;   and to look dispassionatelyat the reality of the problem, namely, powers of government and rightsof individuals, and how they are to be exercised and safeguarded, theijit would be possible to discern a good deal that is common to both parties.It is agreed that the freedom of the individual and the rule that noproperty shall be taken without due compensation should be written intoa Bill of Blights and that there must be an independent judiciary to enforceit.   KANU now agree that there should be a second chamber, not basedmathematically on country-wide adult franchise, which will act as somecheck on a majority in a lower house.   It is agreed that some of the powersof government must be decentralised, including particularly controlover land tenure in native areas, education and a number of other matters.Local authorities must have clear powers of administration and of makingthe necessary laws or bye-laws, and these powers must not just devolvefrom the central government but must be entrenched in the constitution.Finally we must provide that the constitution can be changed only by amost rigorous process and that the use of emergency powers must be controlled,7.      So much has been agreed and provides a broad framework.   Muchmore remains to be agreed.   Who is to control the security forces ?Who is to hold the purse strings ?   On these and on many other mattersno agreement has yet been possible.   But even more important is thefact that there is as yet no agreement in temperament or emotion.The two main parties have publicly aligned themselves for and against&quot;Regionalism&quot;, often with as much intellectual understanding as smallboys choosing Oxford or Cambridge for the boat race, and unfortunatelythey are liable to struggle for their particular colour with equallyunthinking vigour.   Finally, KADU and many of KANU believe, in myopinion with justification, that Mr. Kenyatta and his followers haveno intention of being bound by any undertakings or any constitution ifever they can get power into their hands.8.      My conclusion is that it is possible to devise a constitution whichwill provide effective safeguards against its overthrow by constitutionalmeans.   No guarantee can be given against a coup d&apos;etat but the dangercan be minimised by decentralising command of the security forces and by preventing the Kikuyu, and their allies, from establishing apredominant position in the armed forces.   This is what we must seek to do.The Government of Kenya.9.      When this Conference opened it was widely hoped that a splitbetween the moderates and the old guard in KANU could be achieved.This, I fear, is not now possible at this stage.   The reasons are twofold.First, the intransigent tactics of KADU have tended to unite KANU.Secondly, Mr. Mboya and the moderates do not feel strong enough atthis stage to. break with Mr. Kenyatta and his Kikuyu and terroristfollowing, nor can they yet persuade Mr, Kenyatta to break fromMr. Oginga Odinga and his money.-3-SEC&amp;ET
10.    In these circumstances I believe that it is most important tomake a strenuous effort to achieve a coalition government.   My reasons are the following: -(i) It is only by working together that the rival politicians willlearn to live together in Kenya.(ii) Strong security measures will have to be taken, particularlyagainst some of the Kikuyu, and it will be salutary if this is done bya coalition government.   This will tend to drive a wedge between the younger Kikuyu leaders and the old guard.(iii) It seems to provide the oiily chance of avoiding the defeat ofKADU at the next elections by a united KANU party under Mr. Kenyattawhich could then hardly be denied the right of forming a Government.(iv) There is much to be negotiated about the future constitution and this can best be done between us and a coalition government.11.     It must be recognised that a coalition at this stage is impossible without Mr. Kenyatta.   No member of KANU will be prepared tojoin a coalition which excludes Mr. Kenyatta for the simple reason that his own life would then immediately be in great danger.   Equally,it is to my mind very hard to contemplate Mr. Kenyatta at this stageleading a government (though if he won an election it would be verydifficult to see how this could be prevented).     I therefore envisagea government of which the Govenor remains the head and with Mr. Ngalaand Mr. Kenyatta holding leading positions.   This will be a bitter pillfor many  people to swallow in England as well as in Kenya but without it I see no prosj^ect of a coalition;  and without a coalition at  thisstage the immediate prospects of progress and the long-term chances of a civilised Kenya will grow much dimmer.   I have spoken toMr. Ngala about this and he recognises  the position.   Pie would, I believe,be prepared to co-operate in a coalition if he believed that the nextconstitution would contain an adequate degree of regionalism.The European Interest12.     The principal European interests are the preservation of lawand order and the protection of their property.13.    A constitution containing the best safeguards which v/e can devise,combined with a coalition government, seems to offer the best protectionof law and order.   Eritish forces will remain until independence, andI hope for some time after.   In any case I am not proposing to namea date for independence now and I should hope to defer naming one until a government has been elected and installed  under the new constitution.14.      So far as land is concerned KAD U&apos;s proposals might offer come degree of protection.   KANU on the other hand clearly intend to take overa good proportion of the European la.nd in the White Highlands.   (Theyundertake to pay compensation though they expect the compensation tocome from us, a view which I have firmly discouraged. )  It is true thatthe existence of growing numbers of landless and unemployed, particularly among the Kikuyu, represents the major menace to the future of Kenya
and the major source of strength to Mr. Kenyatta and the terrorists.I am forced to the conclusion that Kenya will never be a stable oountryif so many landless Africans have to live alongside so few landedEuropeans.   I accept that a compensation scheme covei&apos;ing Europeanproperty-owners generally would be financially disastrous for us and   -that it is difficult to compensate the people who have a special claim on us (and there are a number of them) without opening the doorswide, but I have reached the conclusion that a much larger effort mustbe made to resettle landless Africans.   The fact that many Europeanswish to sell their land now if they could only obtain even a tolerableprice provides us with an opportunity of securing our objectivewithout commitment to a compensation scheme.   I am afraid that even so this will involve the provision of substantial finance from thiscountry, but I am now convinced that the alternative will involvea mass exodus of frightened and embittered Europeans combined with a free-for-all seizure of -European land by Africans, probablyleading to tribal warfare.   The present resettlement schemes are ahelp but they are nothing like enough.   My Department are examininga number of schemes and I should like in the near future to discussthe whole problem with the Chief Secretary, Treasury.Recommendations15.    I should like immediately to put to the Conference the broad outline of a constitution which would include all the matters on which agreement has been reached and, in matters still disputed, would go as far as might be practicable towards the strengthening of regional authorities.    Such a broad plan would not be difficult toput forward, leaving the details to be worked out subsequently.   Iwould then like to give the Conference a few days to consider my proposals and give me their reactions, making it clear that when I have receivedthese I would, after consultation with my colleagues, announce how we intend to proceed.   In the meantime I should like to proceed with dis-cussions about the formation of a coalition government.   My object would be, by admitting KANU to government, to obtain their acquiescence in a degree of regionalism which KADU might be brought to accept.The next step would be for us to work out with the Kenya coalition government then formed the details of an &quot;internal self-government&quot;constitution which would be introduced immediately after elections basedon agreed new arrangements.   It is difficult at this moment to be clearas to a time-table but I cannot see how elections could be held untilthe last quarter of the year at the earliest, and I propose that the questionof the length of self-government before independence and negotiations on the future position of British forces should be held over and not disr-cussed until self-government has been introduced.16.     I must warn my colleagues that this programme is likely to provoke violent reaction from KANU and to produce a serious security situation.   But I believe that these risks must be faced.   To go faster now would be inexcusably reckless.   The consequences of slowing down may be serious, particularly as regards calls upon our limited resources ofmoney and military manpower, but the consequences of going full steamahead straightaway into independence might well be catastrophic.R.
