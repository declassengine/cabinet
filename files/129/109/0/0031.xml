C. (62) 81 COPY NO. J^f22nd May, 1962CABINETUNITED ARAB republic memorandum by the Secretary of State for for sign Aj f aijr sAt. the Cabinet meeting of 15th May my colleagues invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself to consider in the lightof their discussion the form of instructions which might now be sentto H. M. Ambassador in Cairo about the United Arab Republic request for bilateral assistance to help them with their balance of paymentsthis year, and to make a further report to the Cabinet (C. C. (62) 33rdConclusions, Minute 2).2.        It seemed to me right to consult H. M. Ambassador in Cairoas to the presentation of any proposals which might be decided on, whichI accordingly did in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.My colleagues will have seen my telegram No, 440 of 16th May to cairo, and the Ambassador&apos;s reply No. 313 of 17th May.   (Copies ofthe texts are attached at Annex A. )3.        I have considered the matter further with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, and he has agreed that I should circulate a fresh paperso as to enable my colleagues to take a decision.4.        It seems that we have three possibilities(i) To offer the United Arab Republic the equivalent of$8 million all of which would be used to settle outstanding claims under the Financial Agreement.(ii) To make a loan of $12 million, of which $8 million would beused as above and $4 million would be at the free disposal of theUnited Arab Republic Government to finance imports from this countrythis year.(iii) To make a loan of up to $12 million as &quot;bilateral assistance&quot;of the sort requested, but to make this conditional on the acceptanceof the proposals which I instructed H. M. Ambassador to put forward in March for settling outstanding questions under the Financial Agreement.These proposals involved the offer of a small loan of  360, 000 to clear the &quot;backlog&quot; in transfers and to finance future transfers in excessof  El, 000 by using the local currency to cover Embassy expendituremonth by month.-1-
5.        I think we must accept the view of H. M. Ambassador, which Ishare, that the first course is essentially a continuation of the negotiationon the execution of the Financial Agreement and would have to be pre-sented as such.   It offers a fair chance of settling outstanding questionsunder the Financial Agreement provided that our loan terms are not considered unduly harsh and that some hope of additional assistance inthe future could be held out as a consequence of a settlement on theselines.   I understand from the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the normalTreasury rate of interest for a loan of this sort is 6 5/8 per cent for a loan of between five and ten years.   This does not compare well withthe terms offered by the United States, i. e. ten years with a three yeargrace period and interest at Z\ per cent.   My colleagues may however be opposed to a concessionary rate of interest.     The additional assistance and inducement could be some offer to help with the united arab Republic&apos;s long-term plans.   It would not have to be assistance for this year, which is what Dr. Kaissouni, Minister of economy and the Treasury, recently asked for.   This course would have a beneficial effect in that it would remove the irritants generated by theFinancial Agreement but would not improve Anglo-United Arab Republicrelations in a wider sense.6.        The second possibility would make it easier to obtain asettlement of Financial Agreement questions and would also make amore effective contribution to the improvement of Anglo-United arab republic relations.   It would require careful presentation both here and in Cairo co as not to lose its effect.   Although such an offer would of course be conditional upon a satisfactory settlement of financial agreement problems, I think that we should have to avoid using theword conditional in public.   The formula suggested by H. M. ambassador in paragraph 7 of his telegram is I think on the right lines.   this alternative also does not give the Egyptians very much in the way of bilateral assistance, but it would be helpful to them if they couldrepresent the whole sum as a British contribution to the  Germans,Italians and Japanese and so use it to obtain similar aid from those governments and a further matching contribution from the Americans.7.        I have no doubt that the third line would have the most widelybeneficial effect on Anglo-United Arab Republic relations as a whole.In his paper (C. (62) 74) the Chancellor of the Exchequer criticised the limited proposals put forward in March for settling outstanding problemsunder the Financial Agreement, in particular the use of local currencyfor Embassy expenditure.   The gist of his criticism was that there wouldbe no guarantee of the United Arab Republic Government keeping theirword.   I think that this criticism would be largely met if exact terms were agreed with the United Arab Republic Government whereby they undertook to make specific payments by set dates.   One of the reasons why transfers under the Financial Agreement have been made so slowlyis that there is no definite obligation on the Egyptians to make setpayments by set times.-2-
8.       Nevertheless in view of the Chancellors criticism and theviews expressed by my colleagues on 15th May I am reluctantlyprepared not to pursue this last possibility.   I think, however, thatwe ought to aim for the second.   For the additional loan of $4 milliontied to the purchase of British goods we should stand a good chanceof achieving a real improvement in Anglo-United Arab Republic relationswhile at the same time securing our main objective which is a final settlement of the tiresome and politically damaging difficulties underthe Financial Agreement.   It would seem a pity to let this opportunityslip.9.        My proposal, therefore, is to instruct H. M. ambassador to approach the United Arab Republic Government on the lines of thecourse described in paragraph 4(ii) above.   The necessary machineryfor giving effect to the details of the settlement of Financial Agreementproblems will need to be carefully worked out.   This can be donebetween my Department and the Treasury.10.       I attach supplementary notes at Annex B on three related matters, viz:-(a) The  20 million private credit.(b) Egyptian behaviour (e. g. , propaganda).(c) Compensation for 1951 officials.H.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.2 2nd May, 1962
ANNEX AT^^tS,^X.9^iM.n.9mce telegram No. 440 dated 16th May, 1962to H. M. Ambassador in CairoThis matter has now been considered by Ministers but theChancellor and I will need your urgent advice on presentation before final instructions to you can be approved.   These instructions wouldprovide for a possible loan to the United Arab Republic Governmentof $8 million equivalent, to be used to settle oustanding United Kingdomclaims.   It would be necessary to represent to public opinion here thatthe loan was conditional on a settlement of all outsanding difficulties arising out of the Financial Agreement (including a reasonable offer for the 1951 officials) but at the same time to avoid as far as possiblegiving offence to public opinion in the United Arab Republic as one ofthe objects of making a loan would be to improve Anglo-United arab republic relations.2.        We do not exclude the possibility of providing a somewhatlarger amount of aid than $8 million.   But we should be more inclined to do this if the United Arab Republic Government were to providesomething in return.   This might be a marked improvement in the tone of their propaganda and the adoption of a more helpful attitude in other ways.   As to this, see paragraph 8 below.3.        The figure of $8 million is based on estimates of the amount required to make transfers up to  E5, 000 per claimant.   It is calculated as follows:-(a)  300, 000 for backlog;(b)  if million for claims now waiting adjudication;  and(c)  21&quot; million in respect of claims not yet submitted tothe United Arab Republic Government.Total:    4,300,000Deducting the first  El, 000 of claims under (b) and (c), which the egyptians would be expected to continue to meet themselves, the figurecomes to  2.9 million equivalent to $8 million.4.        We recognise that the United Arab Republic&apos;s immediatetroubles are mostly due to the failure of last year&apos;s cotton crop, andthat the United Arab Republic has accepted the need for measuresto redress the balance of the economy;   also that the Egyptians aregenuinely anxious to reduce their dependence on the Soviet bloc and thatthe present moment may be a turning point in Anglo-United Arab Republicrelations.   On the other hand Commonwealth countries have a greaterclaim on our available resources and it is considered that the united arab Republic&apos;s professions of goodwill have not yet been matched by its actions;   in particular, Cairo Radio still broadcasts anti-british propaganda and the United Arab Republic is subsidising extremenationalist and anti-colonial movements in Africa and the Middle East,-4-
5.         It has been noted that the -Egyptians have not yet utilizedthe commercial credit of  20 million granted them last year.   Theexistence of this unused credit detracts somewhat from their requestbut it is clear that a governmental loan of $8 million, even though itwas to be used to settle outstanding claims, should facilitate theirobtaining loans from other Governments and help them in their forth-coming discussions with the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment, which has made it a prior condition for the setting up ofa long-term aid consortium that the United Arab Republic Governmentshould first have honoured its international obligations.6.        Clearly the grant of either $8 million reserved for the settle -ment of outstanding claims or of a somewhat larger amount, out ofwhich &amp;8;million would have to be set aside for settling claims,presents a difficult problem of presentation, both here and in Cairo.I think the stage has been reached where you could soon discuss thisfrankly with Kaissouni, and I shall welcome your recommendations on how we should now proceed.   You should  of course meanwhile take no action whatsoever beyond giving me your views on the shape our final instructions might take.   If pressed, you must say that we shallnot be ready for another few days;7.        Our present thinking, on which we should like your comments,is that when the time came you could tell Kaissouni that Her majesty&apos;s government are prepared to consider favourably a loan of $8 millionequivalent.   In view however of the difficulties which the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Lord Privy Seal explained to him personally,this loan would have to be used to settle United Kingdom claims and suitable machinery would have to be devised for this purpose.   Werealise that this is not what Kaissouni asked for, but it could nevertheless be of considerable advantage to him.   Not only would it enable us to dispose of Financial Agreement problems to our common benefit,but it would also help him in negotiations with other Governments andthe International Bank, as indicated above.8.        You might also possibly be authorised to say that Her majesty&apos;s government do not exclude the possibility of providing aid somewhatabove $8 million, without however mentioning a definite figure.   Thisaid would be available in addition to the $8 million as a contribution tothe stabilisation loan, but before giving it Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould wish to have seen some reciprocal action on the part of theUnited Arab Republic Government,   (We must of course be careful to avoid appearing to demand a change in United Arab RepublicGovernment policy in return for money and we realise that you maysee difficulties in anything suggesting the attachment of political conditions.   But the improvement in relations which we both genuinelydesire must be worked for from both sides. )9.        As regards the Financial Agreement, you could say that ourloan proposal should take care of the transfer problem although we shouldnaturally expect the Egyptians to continue to finance the first  E, 1, 000of each transfer from their existing resources.   As Dr. Kaissouni toldyou there is already general agreement on most other points except pre-sale dividends.   As part of a satisfactory general settlement of all out-standing problems, you could indicate that we might be prepared toaccept the Egyptian view of pre-sale dividends.-5-
Text of H. M. Ambassador1 s telegram No. 313 dated17th May, 1962 from Cairo ,The proposal in your telegram is essentially a continuation of the discussions on the Financial Agreement, and would have to be presented as such.   It would give Kaissouni what he has asked foron transfers, in return presumably for:-Immediate signature of the Exchange of Notes;Revision of Annex E;Compensation for the 1951 officials;Production of bank statements;Tax-free pensions;R.elease of securities held abroad to the order of egyptian banks.In this connexion it would help me to know what you would consider a &quot;reasonable offer&quot; for the 1951 officials.   This is apolitically-charged issue   here, and I think it unlikely that in practicewe could hope for more than about  60, 000.   It is conceivable thatwe might be able to push this figure somewhat higher if it could beincluded in the $8 million loan.   In any case I hope such inclusionwould be acceptable to you, at least as a fall-back condition.3.        I think the chance of settling the outstanding issues under theFinancial Agreement on this basis would be good, given the following conditions :-(a) That the terms of the loan (rate of interest and repaymentperiod) were considered reasonable by Kaissouni.   It would not bepossible to involve Kaissouni in serious discussions before v/e had shown our hand on this.(b) That I could tell Kais souni that, if the United Arab Republicmet our requirements on the matters listed in paragraph 1 above,we would relinquish our claim on pre-sale dividends.(c) That I could hold out the hope of some additional assistance as a consequence of a settlement on the above lines.(d) That nothing was said at this stage about political require-ments, such as a moderation in the tone of Cairo propaganda.4.        On this last point, it is my view that to state political conditions for our assistance in any form would tend to defeat ourobjection of improving relations with the United Arab Republic.Moreover, it is virtually certain that any such conditions would be rejected.   On the other hand, I think there would be advantage inBaying to Kaissouni (and others) that, in view of the evidence of ourgoodwill shown in the proposal I v/as putting to him, it was your hopethat the United Arab Republic would reciprocate in the ways indicated(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)(f)
in your telegram under reference.   I do not exclude the possibility that this would have some effect, although I consider that it is more realistic to hope for a long-term improvement of the Egyptian attitude as the result of growing confidence here in our own attitude towardsthe United Arab Republic.5.        Yfhile I consider, therefore, that there are reasonableprospects for a successful outcome of negotiations on these lines, i must at the same time emphasize my view that such a conclusionwould not have the generally beneficial effect on Anglo-United arab republic relations  which I foresaw as a likely consequence of a sub-stantial United Kingdom contribution to a stabilization loan.   It stillseems to me that we should reap much greater benefits from a response to Kais sound&apos;s request for a loan to meet his immediate needs, evenif we could offer no more than say $12 million, coupled with youroriginal proposal for settling transfers through the Embassy account.I hope you can reconsider this in view of the political advantages to which it could lead.   We may never have so good a chance againof radically improving our relations with this country.6.        The argument in my preceding paragraph is based in parton the assumption that the German and. Italian Governments are likelyto grant Kaissounirs request for loansc   I have no information on this,beyond an Egyptian assertion that the Italians are prepared to offer$15 million.   It would be most helpful to me to know before I seeKaissouni what our latest information is on the response of otherGovernments to his appeal.7.        Subject to the above, I agree with the form of presentationsuggested in your paragraph 7.   As for presentation in public, thiswould not present any great difficulty if ourloan was related exclusively to the Financial Agreement.   But, if our loan was directed either in whole or in part to the immediate support of Egypt&apos;s balance ofpayments, a problem would of course arise.   In the latter case,Kaissouni might wish to make it appear for local consumption thatthe whole of Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s loan was related to thebalance of payments position, and in that event I would hope that itcould be so presented in London as to avoid controversy on this point.It could perhaps be said that in view of the needs of the United arab republic and of the arrangements undertaken for the settlement of herexternal obligations,  she was receiving aid from the international monetary Fund and a number of Governments;  that the arrangementsincluded a settlement of outstanding obligations to the United Kingdom;and that Her Majesty&apos;s Government consequently felt free to express their goodwill towards the United Arab Republic by participating in the measures adopted by the Fund and other friendly Governments.
ANNEX B(a) The-  20 million Private CreditAt the meeting on 15th May it was asked why the united arab Republic Government should attach so much importance to  aGovernment loan which would be tied to the purchase of British goodswhen they had already negotiated a commercial line of credit of 20 million which had hardly been used.   The answer is that the agreementreferred to between the private firm of Messrs. C. Tennant Sons &amp;Co. Ltd. and the General Organisation for Executing the Five-YearIndustrial Plan provides specifically for the credit to be used for investment goods for this Organisation of a sort for which five years&apos;credit or more is normally given.   The credit is not available tocover  current imports of a general nature, which is what the Egyptiansrequire for the remainder of this year.(b) EgyptianFj ehaviourAt the meeting on 15th May my colleagues also referredto the anti-British propaganda still being put out by Cairo radio and the subsidising of extreme nationalist and anti-colonial leaders and movements in Africa and the Middle East.   These activities areindeed serious.   There has, however, been a recent dirrJLnution ofthem in the last three or four months, no doubt as a result of a numberof representations made by the Embassy in Cairo.   I have also been glad to learn that the Governors of the territories concerned do not thinkthat Cairo Radio is now listened to nearly as much as it used to be.Broadcasts to the Persian Gulf haveslso lessened somewhat, although not to the same extent as those to East Africa.   In general I feel bound to agree with H. M. Ambassador that to state political conditions for our assistance in any form would defeat our object, although Iwould tell him to make it clear to the Egyptians that if we are to haveimproved relations they must drop their hostile actions against us.On the whole I believe that the Egyptians are making a serious attemptto mend their fences with Her Majesty&apos;s Government,   This should notbe dismissed purely as self-interest, arising from straitenedfinances, but represents a.n effort to achieve a relationship ofconfidence with the West to counteract any undue dependence in thepast on the Soviet bloc.   We know that the United Arab Republic hasthe pov/er to damage our interests in the area, should the United arab republic Government be rebuffed.(c) Compensation for 1951 officials the elements in a satisfactory settlement of outstandingproblems of the Financial Agreement are listed in the first paragraphof Cairo telegram No. 313.   There is one point on which I would welcome my colleagues&apos; views.   This is compensation for the 1951officials.   Originally  100,000 was advanced to these officials by her Majesty&apos;s Government.   This sum was repaid by the united arab Republic Government under Article 111(f) of the financial agreement of 1959.   By this same article the Egyptians undertook-8-
that the Commission provided for in the exchange of notes of 1954should make a final assessment of the compensation due and permit the payment of the balance thereof &apos;n sterling.   The Egyptians are under no obligation to pay any particular sum.   It has been indicated to H. M. Ambassador that the figure the Egyptians are thinking of is between  E. 50, 000 and  E. 60, 000.   H. M. Ambassador thinks it unlikely in practice that we can hope for more than  60, 000.   Onthe other hand, Her Majesty1 s Government made a further advance toth.ese officials of  100, 000 in December, 1961, and it may be thoughtthat we should try to obtain at least this sum   from the United arab republic Government.   It might be possible to obtain this as part ofthe general arrangement which I propose.   There is, however, no guarantee that we shall succeed and we may have to accept somewhat less.     The officials themselves claim an even larger sum   of money in compensation, but their claim   seems very inflated.   1 propose thatwe should do our utmost to get a further  100, 000 from the Egyptians,In view, however, of that fact that there is no obligation on the united arab Republic Government to pay any particular sum I do not think we should make this a breaking point.   This might mean writing offthe difference between what we obtain and the sum of  100,00.0 alreadyadvanced.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.May, 1962
