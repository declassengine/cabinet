Oj62)J55 COPY NO.      ^cabinet future OF THE AIRCRAFT.industry memorandum by the Minister of A.viationI am called upon on Thursday afternoon, 22nd March, to defend the Governments record in carrying out our pledges to the aircraft industry.   I shall be under considerable attack, not simply from theOpposition, but from our own back benches.2.     My colleagues v/ill recall that I placed these problems beforethe Cabinet, on 19th October, 1961 (C. C. (61) 57th Conclusions, Minute 2).1The position has deteriorated since that date.3.     Apart from an order for a military version of the privatelydeveloped Avro 748 which has been awarded to the Hawker SiddeleyGroup, no decision has been taken to develop new aircraft to meetthe future requirements of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.4.      I cannot and will not sustain the case in the House of commons that we should keep the industry at its present size and level ofemployment.   I must accept and frankly state that I foresee a run-down both in design staff now, and at a later stage in employment.So far from a policy of growth this is a policy of contraction.   Thereal danger however lies in the possibility of this retreat turninginto a rout.5.      I annex a graph showing the prospective decline in the designstaff of the two aircraft groups.   The forward load of orders forthis type of work   just does not exist and the main groups which areour creation are running into serious difficulties.6.     Against this background and recognising that we are not readyor perhaps willing at the moment to place an order for any major new project I wish to announce a small project study for a so-calledvariable geometry aircraft at the cost of half a million pounds.   this study has been approved by the Defence Reasearch Policy Committeeon which the Treasury are represented and is within my approvedEstimates.7.      The idea of variable geometry is to enable the aircraft to fly economically at subsonic and supersonic speeds by sweepingits wings back for supersonic flight and forward again for subsonicflight.   Much preliminary work has been done upon it with treasury approval and there is no doubt that any nation which falls behind in-1-CONFJDENT1AL
this field of research will be greatly handicapped in both the militaryand civil field.   Such a study commits us in no way to build aprototype, let alone a production aircraft.   It will, however, be apiece of invaluable research and will provide badly needed work forthe design staff of the British Aircraft Corporation - and give mejust the minimum advantage which I need to indicate in debate thatwe recognise that wd have a policy and are taking some steps to honour it.P. T.Ministry of Aviation, W. C. 2.20th March, 1962
