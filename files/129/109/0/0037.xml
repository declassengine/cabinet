C. (62) 87 Copy No.     ^u29th May, 1962CABINETFUTURE OF THE CUNARD COMPANVS PASSENGER services memorandum by the Minister of transport the Cunard Company have brought to the Governments attention the serious position of their North Atlantic sea passenger services. They have not explicitlyasked for a subsidy. Nevertheless it needs to be decided whether the Governmentshould do something to help.. 2. The facts are set out in the Annex to this paper, which takes account of theviews expressed in the Economic Policy Committee.3. Without a subsidy the &quot; Queens &quot; will probably have to be withdrawnfrom service within the next year or so. Cunard&apos;s other North Atlantic passenger services may also have to be withdrawn, but there are possibilities of reorganisingthem.Arguments for a Subsidy4. If we do not keep Cunard&apos;s services going, we shall have to face thefollowing consequences:(a) Our prestige will suffer.  Foreign subsidised lines (particularly american and French) will pick up our traffic and so will be held to have wona victory.(b) There will probably be a net loss to the balance of payments (seeparagraph 10 of Annex).(c) The Government may be held responsible, not only because we havewithheld a subsidy for Cunard, but also because we have positivelybuilt up air competition (see paragraph 9 of Annex).Arguments against a Subsidy5. If, on the other hand, we keep Cunard&apos;s services going by means of a subsidy, it can be said that:(a) We shall be wasting the taxpayer^ money on an old-fashioned type ofservice in a futile subsidy race. This is not the way either to nationalprosperity or to national prestige in any worthwhile sense.(b) The objections made to the earlier offer of assistance for building areplacement of Queen Mary have even more force now, in view of thedecline in Atlantic passenger shipping.(c) It would be inconsistent to subsidise Cunard without subsidising otherpassenger lines.Air services. The Minister of Aviation has reported (C. (62) 86) that agreement inprinciple has now been reached by the Chairmen of the British Overseas airways corporation (B.O.A.C.) and Cunard on the formation of a jointly-ownedSECRET60869 - printed for the Cabinet.

subsidiary airline, to operate on the North Atlantic route. In my view thisreinforces the case against a subsidy, since:(a) it is looking to the future rather than to the past;(b) it may make it easier for Cunard to spread their overheads and thus keepsome of their sea passenger services going. .recommendation. I propose to tell Sir John Brocklebank that the Government is not preparedto subsidise their services. We hope he will nevertheless find some way of keepingsome of his North Atlantic sea passenger services in operation, particularly inview of his impending agreement with B.O.A.C. I also propose to ask him to keepthe Government informed as to his negotiations with the French Line, and onhis plans for the disposal of his ships, in view of the interests of other Britishshipowners.E. M.Ministry of Transport, S.E. 1,25th May, 1962.
ANNEXCunard&apos;s Present PositionIn spite of vigorous retrenchment in the Cunard shore organisation to the lowest level (the Company say) consistent with current obligations, all the Cunardsea passenger services are operating at a loss. The &quot; Queens &quot; express service isestimated to show an operating loss of  613,000 in 1962 (making no allowance for depreciation, since the ships are fully depreciated already). The loss on theother passenger services, including cruises, is estimated at  1,161,000 after allowing for depreciation.   Detailed figures are given in the Appendix.2. These figures show an improvement on the operating losses for 1961 forthe ships other than the &quot;Queens &quot;. This is due in the main to the retrenchmentin the Cunard shore organisation, to an estimated increase in passenger receipts from Caronia and Mauretania cruising, and to the withdrawal of the Media andParthia, which were losing money. Nevertheless the Company see little or no prospect of further improvement on the basis of their existing pattern of services.Their views are summarised in the following paragraphs.Cunard Company&apos;s Comments on Future Prospects for their Passenger services . (a) North Atlantic passenger carryings have deteriorated sharply since the&quot; Q. 3 &quot; project was submitted. The expectation that 1961 would prove to havebeen an abnormally bad year may well turn out to be wrong. Ships on the new york/Channel route are continuing to lose passengers, particularly first class,to jet aircraft and to the shipping lines serving the New York/Mediterraneantrade.(b) The Queen Mary has little prospect of operating profitably. The queen elizabeth could only do so if large-scale alterations were carried out to enable her to carry more third-class passengers. The Company say such alterations wouldnot be a commercial proposition in view of her age.(c) Cruising in American waters and in the Mediterranean, combined with a passanger service designed to take advantage of the increasing trade on theMediterranean route, might prove a commercial proposition. But to do thiswould require major conversions of the other ships of the Cunard fleet. Cunardhave announced that the &quot; Queens &quot; will do some short cruises next winter, butthey are not really suitable for this type of employment.(d) Cunard&apos;s shore organisation expenses could be reduced by effecting somemutual arrangement between Cunard and the French Line. Sir John Brocklebankhas discussed this with them but he is not hopeful that they wil! collaborate, atany rate in the immediate future. Apart from, this, no further retrenchment intheir shore organisation is possible, unless the &quot; Queens &quot; service is withdrawn.(e) The withdrawal of the North Atlantic licence for the Cunard Eagle AirLine has also seriously affected their finances.Courses of Action Open to the Cunard Company in the Absence of GovernmentAssistance4. The Cunard Company consider that, in the absence of direct government assistance, they have only two choices:(a) To abandon their passenger business altogether.   Sir John Brocklebankcomments that &quot; any dispassionate accountant would advise us thatthis would be the best course in the interests of our shareholders &quot;.(b) To abandon the &quot; Queens &quot; service. The remainder of the fleet would beredeployed as follows. Caronia would cruise all the year round. Thefour ships at present on the Canadian service (Saxonia, Ivernia,Carinthia and Sylvania, all of about 22,000 gross tonnage) would be modified for hot weather cruising. They, with the Mauretania, would maintain a New York/Channel service in the summer and would otherwise be used for cruising and in the Mediterranean.The idea of their finding money for a new &quot; Queen &quot; is, of course, now out of thequestion.SECRET60869 a 2
5. The Company consider that Course (b) might be made to work particularly if, at the same time, the Cunard Eagle Airline could make its contribution tooverheads on the London/New York route.6. The Company have not made it clear when these changes would beintroduced, but they do not contemplate any drastic changes this year.Alternatives, if a Subsidy were Available7. If the Government were prepared to give a subsidy, the following are amongthe possible alternative courses:(a) The &quot; Queens&quot; service might be maintained for the next few years,Cunard&apos;s other passenger services being reduced to an economic levelor, if this was not possible, being withdrawn entirely. Cunard estimate that for both &quot; Queens &quot; they would need not less than  800,000 perannum. Moreover this would be no more than a short-term expedient,since the Queen Mary would have to be replaced in, say, five years&apos; time if the weekly express service was to be continued, and the Governmentwould have to find most of the cost of any such replacement.(b) The Queen Elizabeth might be kept in service, but not the Queen Mary.This might be done by an operating subsidy (at least  400,000 per annum)or a capital subsidy towards the cost (about  5 million) of convertingher to carry more third-class passengers. Either course would bepossible only if the co-operation of the French Line were secured, whichis doubtful.(c) The &quot; Queens &quot; could go and Cunard&apos;s other sea passenger services be assisted to continue, if indeed they cannot manage without help. this might be the least costly course.Foreign Subsidised Competition8. The &quot; Queens &quot; direct competitors in the express service are the UnitedStates and the France. The United States had a 58 per cent, construction subsidyand receives an operation subsidy of about 28 per cent. The France had a 20 percent, construction subsidy, and the Company&apos;s operating losses are made up bysubsidy. Smaller foreign ships (United States, French and Italian), which compete with Cunard on the North Atlantic directly or indirectly, are also subsidised.Air Competition9. Cunard&apos;s plight is largely due to air competition. The Government itselfhas encouraged this. (Air line companies have in the past received direct subsidies,and are currently enjoying Government loans. In addition the Government paysheavily for the maintenance of navigational aids, airfields, etc., whereas shippingpays for its lighthouses and ports and is now being required to pay a larger part ofthe cost of Government expenses on law enforcement in connexion with safety, etc.)On the other hand, private enterprise air lines, financed by shipping companies,have not in practice been allowed as much opportunity as. in their opinion, theyhave been led to expect.Foreign Exchange Earnings10. In 1958 and in 1959 the &quot; Queens &quot; earned about  7 million worth of dollars (net of dollar disbursements) and  4 million in sterling. About another 9 million was earned by Cunard&apos;s other North Atlantic ships, making a rough totalof  20 million. The current figure would clearly be lower. Also, some of theseearnings would continue to be earned or saved e.g., by B.O.A.C. if the Cunardservices were abandoned.Future Scope for Passenger Liners11. The indications are that passenger liners generally, and particularly the express luxury type, have a very limited scope in the future except possibly forcruising. Neither the Americans nor the French have yet decided to build sister-ships for their present super-liners on the North Atlantic route. It is conceivable that nuclear-powered liners might be made to pay some time in the future, but
secret     168this is purely conjectural. It is also possible that, if Cunard withdrew from theNorth Atlantic it would not inevitably be the end of British operation there. Someother British company might possibly step in and operate without subsidy duringthe summer (though it would still be the end of the &quot; Queens &quot;). &apos;Cunard&apos;s other Interests12. Cunard themselves are by no means firmly wedded to their passenger services. They clearly wish to develop their interests in the air, so far as they are allowed to do so. They have also recently invited tenders for four new cargo-liners(embodying latest techniques) suitable for North Atlantic container traffic, whichis an expanding element in seaborne trade.25th May, 1962.
