C. (62) 56 COPY NO.21st March, 1962CABINETFUTURE OF THE AIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster-general in his memorandum C.(62) 55, the Minister of Aviation sets out the reasons why he wishes to announce in the course of the debate on the aircraft industry on 22nd March that the Government havedecided to place a project study with the British Aircraft corporation for a variable geometry aircraft.    I received a letter from him on20th March asking for my concurrence.    I am less concerned aboutthe  f million which the project study will cost than for the vastlylarger expenditure to which we may then find we have a kind of moral commitment when the project study is completed.    experience suggests that these projects, once started however modestly, havea momentum of their own, and I would find it very helpful to be givenrather longer notice when as important a decision as this isrequired. .2.      The object of the project study, as I understand it, would beto lead in later to a major development programme for an opera-tional aircraft.     The first version of this aircraft might replace the Royal Navy&apos;s Buccaneers and Sea Vixens, and an altered versionmight replace the T.S.R. 2. of the Royal Air Force.     This conceptinvolves major problems concerning the future harmonisation of theneeds of the two Services, and the future of the T.S.R. 2. whoseestimated development cost has increased alarmingly:  from 90 million (or  100 million allowing for price changes)to 140 million since full development was authorised in September,I960.     These crucial questions must be properly considered;  withour limited resources, there can be no greater mistakes than to goin for two expensive aircraft where one would do, or to fail to plan to get the maximum usefulness out of each type we build.    It alsoraises in an acute form the problem of the size of the defence budget in the late 1960&apos;s and early 1970&apos;s.     We shall not be able toreach any informed view on this until the Defence Review costingsbecome available in the summer.3. I recognise that, as C.(62) 55 points out, the placing of a project study would not of itself commit us to build prototypes orIproduction aircraft.    I believe, however, that to make a point of announcing it in the debate would create a general impression thatwe shall in fact do so.     Indeed, an announcement would hardly be helpful to the Government1 s case unless it did give this impression;the expenditure of  jjr million will seem a minor matter unless it
holds out the hint of much greater sums to follow.     It is this hintthat I do not think we should give at the present stage.4.      I understand the difficulties of the Minister of Aviation overthe aircraft industry, and the anxiety he feels about its futurelevel of work.    At the same time it must be remembered that very big orders not only for production but for development of aircraft and guided weapons have been placed with the industry during thepast two years.     It is true that since October, 1961,  only one largeorder for a new military aircraft has been approved.     But that order was for 31 aircraft and is worth  14 million.     It could hardly be expected that more than one order of this size would be placedduring five months.    Military orders on hand in the aircraft industry are at a very high level -  435 million in September, 1961,as against  360 million in September, I960, and  301 million atthe end of 1959.   We have authorised development expenditure on aircraft and guided weapons to the tune of about  150 million sincethe rationalisation of the aircraft industry at the beginning of I960.On the civil side we have raised the level of assistance to transport aircraft from  5 million in 1959-60 to  8 million in 1961-62, andthe estimate for 1962-63 stands at  11 million.    I do not believethat any complaint   that the Government are not honouring their undertakings to the industry could stand up to impartial examination.5.      This is not to say that I am not prepared to accept new projects which have been properly worked out, and for which thereis a clear need.     There are a number of projects in various stages of consideration which will presumably, if they are approved, makea considerable difference to the curve of the graph annexed toC. (62) 55.    It is in the nature of this aircraft business that thelevel of commitments which have already been approved at any onetime should show a decline over future years.     But if we hurry intostarting new projects before they have been fully considered, any hope of proper financial control in this very difficult and costlyfield will be lost,6.      This is not, as I have said, a big project in itself.     But itis a step forward from the research which we have done hithertointo the principles of variable geometry.     It is a study aimed atbuilding aircraft.     For the sake of allaying the fears of the industryabout its future, are we right to announce this new step - which frompast experience is only too likely to lead to a moral commitment to develop - by announcing it before we have given it the thorough examination it deserves?.
