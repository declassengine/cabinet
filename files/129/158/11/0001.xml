DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTfi1CP(71) 86 COPY NO      u A19 July 1971CABINETVOLUNTARY SOCIAL service memorandum by the Lord Privy seal. When the Cabinet on 29 June considered my paper (CP(71) 72) I was invited, in consultation with the Departmental Ministers concerned and theChief Secretary, Treasury, to prepare detailed proposals for additional expenditure of  4 million over the period 1972-73 to 1975-76 indicating the extent to which the Ministers concerned were prepared to meet theirshares within their existing public expenditure programmes and suggesting the terms In which such an increase, if approved by the Cabinet, might be announced (CM(7l) 34th Conclusions, Minute 2).2,        The annual sums will not be large as far as Individual DepartmentalVotes are concerned: even so, the total would represent a significantaddition to the amount spent by central Government on voluntary social service and it would be reasonable to plan In terms of a phased additional programme which would not reach Its full size until 1975-76.    I accordinglysuggest that this might be broken down as follows:1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 0.6 million    0.8 million    1.1 million    1.5 million3.        For the breakdown of these annual figures between DepartmentalVotes I have concentrated on 1973-74, the middle year of the currentreview period.    departments  suggestions as to possible ways of spendingthe allocation of  0. 8 million in that year are shown in some detail in annex A.    The main emphasis has been placed upon additions to the urban programme to make possible the encouragement of more voluntary social service projects in socially deprived areas, on transport services in rural areas and on environmental improvement, new expenditure on voluntarywork on the after-care of offenders, and on improved arrangements forthe organisation of voluntary work both centrally and locally through the promotion of voluntary service bureaux.1
4.        The figures for 1973*-74 can be extrapolated for planning purposesto give the following table of additional public expenditure on voluntary service.    Not all the figures for the earlier years lend themselves tostraight extrapolation and a small margin is left for later allocation.1972-73       1973-74      1974-75     1975-76Home Office?

An announcement of an increased Government financial commitment to voluntary social service will however stimulate further proposals and fresh ideas from the voluntary world and any final programme for any oneyear would need to be drawn up after consultation with the voluntaryinterests affected.    To this extent therefore the suggestions set out above should be regarded as tentative and I think that any additional programme should be announced in sufficiently broad terms to allow for substantialadjustments within the totals as we went along.6. I understand that the sums set against the Department of the environment could by reordering priorities all be accommodated within their existing expenditure programme (as carried forward to 1975-76) andfurthermore some  25,000 of the amount allocated to the Department ofEducation and Science could be found through redeployment of resources2
already available.    The remaining sums would need to be additional to existing programmes (though the amounts allocated to the Department ofHealth and Social Security could be contained within the additional expenditure for which the Secretary of State has asked).    The additionalbid under the expenditure review is therefore reduced to one of  0.5 million in 1972-73 rising to some  1.25 million in 1975-76, or  3.1 million in all.7.        At Annex B is a draft announcement of an increase in expenditureof the order indicated in paragraph 4.    In CP(71) 72 I mentioned the greatimportance which I attach to our Manifesto pledge &quot;to encourage the flow of private funds to charities, including voluntary social service, sportand the arts&quot;.    In view of what the Chief Secretary said about this in committee on the Finance Bill, lam suggesting that a short paragraphreflecting his words could desirably be included in the announcement ifthis were to take the form of a Written Answer.    We can consider later in the light of the voluntary bodies1 response and subsequent discussionwith them what further initiatives the Government should take and whether in particular a discussion document such as I mentioned in CP(71) 72 wouldbe desirable.J civil  Service Department SW119 July 19713
Annex ACONFIDENTIALADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE ON VOLUNTARY SOCIAL SERVICE IN  1973/741    Departments have put forward the following proposals for anadditional expenditure of  0.8 million in this year.2    The Home Office have in mind additional annual grant to theNational Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offendersto strengthen its regional structure and work in the field,   startingat about  10,000 and building up to about  25,000 in 1975/76,together with some  40,000 a year more for marriage guidance.    their main additional expenditure would however be on extending the experimental voluntary work on the care of long-term and personallyinadequate offenders.    The total bid on this side of the Home 0fficefswork for 1973/74 would be about  200,000.3    An additional  205,000 might be spent through the Urban programme in England, and Wales in 1973/74 so that (while avoiding a preciseearmarking of funds) it would be able to put more emphasis on voluntary social service and to channel more money to localvoluntary projects in areas of high social need.    The cost ofGovernment help (in the form of a 75% grant towards the cost of approved commitments incurred by local authorities in the areas concerned) is borne on the Home Office vote but this covers theinterests of all the Departments concerned with voluntary social service and they have given their general support for this method ofchannelling further resources to voluntary work.    Some of the money would go towards the local development of voluntary service bureaux.The Treasury would not welcome an extra commitment to the urban programme on the grounds that this would not be appropriate when the longer term future of the Programme had still to be decided and thatit would mean restricting part of the extra support of voluntarysocial service to only one sort of area.An additional  10,000 might be spent by the Home Office on the localvoluntary projects financed by the Community Relations Commission.4     The Department of Health and Social Security has already providedfor a threefold increase in spending on voluntary social service froma starting figure of about  300,000 a year over the years 1970/71 to1974/75,  and is taking a large share of the additional annual expen-diture of about  1 million planned by all Departments by the end ofthe current Public Expenditure Review period.    The field in whichthis Department sees the greatest need for further expenditure on voluntary social service is that of aid to local projects especiallyin areas of special social need and it would like  100,000 to be allocated to the Urban Programme for this purpose (this is includedin the  205,000 proposed in paragraph 2).    In addition,  in view of probable future demands not at present foreseeable in detail, theDepartment would want to set aside  25,000 to meet them in 1973/74.(In CP(71)69 the Secretary of State for Social Services proposed thata small part of the extra provision sought in that paper should bedirected towards voluntary organisations).
5     The Department of Education and Science do not anticipate any significant additional expenditure on voluntary social service butaim to achieve some redeployment of grants within the existingceiling for expenditure.    There are problems of definition here butthe Department believe that they might spend an additional  50,000in 1973/74 of which about half would be found from redeployingresources from the voluntary field generally towards what might morestrictly be regarded as voluntary social service.6     The Scottish Office would spend an additional  80,000 in 1973/74with priority for the Urban Programme in Scotland.7     The Department of the Environment propose additional expenditureof about  30,000 in that year on supporting the improvement of the environment by voluntary bodies.    Following two rural studies,  theyplan expenditure of about  150,000 by 1973/74 in grants to voluntary bodies (such as the WRVS or local community groups) to organise andrun voluntary car transport services in rural areas left without trainor bus services.    The grant to the National Council of Social Servicemight be increased for specific organisational purposes,  in particular the development of voluntary service bureaux (this would be similarto the existing Department of Trade and Industry grant for developing the Citizens&apos;  Advice Bureaux Service).    The total additional grant to voluntary social service in 1973/74 would be about  220,000.The Department would by re-ordering priorities find this sum from within their existing public expenditure programme.8     The Welsh Office would expect to see an additional  40,000 spent in Wales in 1973/74.    Directly, they would wish to spend  10,000,mainly to encourage the appointment of voluntary help organisersin hospitals.    Most of the remainder would be the Welsh share of an expanded Urban Programme.    In addition,  Departments responsible for services in England and Wales would need to apportion some of theirextra money to Wales.Cabinet OfficeLondon SW1July 19712
confidential annex BVOLUNTARY SOCIAL service     The Government wish to encourage voluntary effort which is ofgreat value in helping to meet social problems.    Their election manifesto promised active support to create new opportunities in co-operation with the local authorities for all those who want to dovoluntary work.2    Voluntary effort itself is freely given, though it should look for sympathetic encouragement and advice from the statutory services.But financial help is needed to promote and organise such work inthose fields where it can valuably complement the statutory services or where it can desirably fill gaps and pioneer new initiatives.Considerable help is already given by the local authorities and bythe Government in this way.3     The Government now propose that  4 million more should be madeavailable in- England, Wales and Scotland in the period up to 1975-76for voluntary social service and community self-help.    More thanmillion extra will become available next year and more stillin the three years after that.    This is a significant addition topresent expenditure.4    The Government will wish to consult voluntary bodies and localauthority associations about the way this extra money is spent:they will welcome ideas and proposals for innovation and experiment.For their part they would like to encourage more local voluntaryprojects in socially deprived areas through the Urban Programme;to encourage voluntary effort in rural areas; to assist and make more effective the central organisation of voluntary bodies and also to stimulate locally the extension of simple clearing house machinery to match offers of voluntary help with the jobs that need to be done;to give more help for counselling services and for the care of groupswithin the community whose needs and problems are of a special nature.S    Necessary though some help from public funds will be to release the springs of voluntary effort a healthy voluntary movement will need to continue to attract private resources.    The encouragement ofprivate giving is another of the Government1s stated objectives andthey are studying now how best to give effect to it.6     The Government.are confident that this initial practical expression of the value which they attach to voluntary social service willevoke a ready response,  not least from young people and from theretired who have so much to offer.    They intend to keep developments in this field under continuous review and to make available such advice and guidance as may from time to time be helpful.Cabinet OfficeLondon SW1July 1971
