HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 98 COPY NOhi30 July 1971CABINETFINANCING OF STUDENT UNIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for education and ScienceOn Friday I put before the Home and Social Affairs Committeethe attached paper on the financing of student unions.2. Some members of the Committee thought that this was not thetime to risk political trouble in the  .student world.    But I have beenunder considerable pressure from our own side to find a way of checkingthe abuses that occur, and the local education authorities are anxious that they should be relieved of the obligation to meet whatever unionsubscription is determined by the university.    Moreover when financial difficulties arose at Kingston Polytechnic in March, I changed theRegulations to deal with the immediate difficulty but made it clear thatthe amendment was only intended for a limited time until the major issues had been considered.3. If we postpone action for a further year it may be difficult to putnew arrangements into effect much before the next Election.4.        I have considered possible palliatives that would avoid thethorough overhaul of the finance of student unions that I think is needed.&quot;We could decide to appoint a Registrar of Student Unions, but this wouldtake a long time, require legislation, and in my view exacerbate studentopinion as much as, if not more than, my own proposals.    Alternatively,we could freeze student union fees at their present level; but this wouldbe arbitrary and unjust, and would cause trouble without solving anything.5.        I ask my colleagues agreement to opening discussions with thelocal education authorities, Vice-Chancellors and students on the basisof these proposals.    When discussions are complete, I will report back.Decisions will have to be taken by the end of the year if they are to be implemented in autumn 1972.M H t department of Education and Science, Wl30 July 1971
(restricted)ItFINANCING OF STUDENT UNIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and    science the way in which some student unions conduct their affairs and use their funds.    I have carried out an inquiry into the financing of student unions and I now propose, in conjunction with the Secretaryof State for Scotland, to introduce radical changes in the presentsystem of financing the unions.    The purpose of this memorandum is to seek approval for    these proposals.Present situation.        There are two main problems (a) the financing of studentorganisations and (b) the control of student activities.3.        On (a),  the main source of funds for student unions are thesubscriptions paid by their members.    The majority of full-timestudents receive mandatory awards from their local educationauthorities;    union membership is normally obligatory,  and the unionsubscription is then paid direct to  the Union as part of the award.The level of the subscription is determined by agreement between theacademic institution and the student union,  and varies considerably from institution to institution.    Local authorities are thereforefaced with a financial burden (currently estimated at about  3m per year)  over which they have virtually no control.k.        Unions are also supported by the provision of accommodation and services and sometimes cash from the college or university,  and byprofit from their own activities.11 .Over the last few years there has been increasing concern about
(restricted)5.        On (b) - control of student activities - there is concern bothabout the purposes to which some student unions apply their funds andthe apparent disregard of constitutional procedures.Proposal for a Registrar of Student Unions6.        I have considered the possibility of setting up a Registrar of student Unions, but it would require legislation.    I do not proposetherefore to pursue this further for the time    being, but the proposals outlined below do not exclude the possibility of setting up a Registrarlater on.Suggested scheme7.        I propose that the present provision for including the unionsubscription in the fees payable to colleges and universities shouldbe abolished;  that responsibility for providing and maintaining studentunion facilities should be placed on each academic institution;    andthat the student maintenance grant should be increased slightly toenable students to join particular clubs or societies on a voluntary basis.    The physical facilities of each union would be open to allstudents, whether or not they were members of the union.    These changes would require an amendment to the student grant Regulations, and would otherwise   be implemented through administrative and financial measures.No legislation would be necessary.    The new scheme would come intoeffect at the beginning of the academic year 1972-73.8.        I am examining the implications of enabling students to contract out of their local and/or national student associations.9.        The proposed scheme will involve a number of administrative difficulties, which will undoubtedly be controversial.    I anticipate that it will:(a) be welcomed by the local authorities as meeting their objections to the present arrangements;(b) be received with strong reservations by the Vice-Chancellorsand other academic heads on the grounds that it would place on them the burden of negotiating annual allocations to their localunions;(c) provoke strong opposition from the student organisations.2(restricted)
RESTRICTEDI intend to start consultations with, these groups in September, with aview to announcing a detailed scheme before the end of the year.10.      It is not intended that there should be any net increase in public expenditure.    But the transfer of responsibility of student unionsubscriptions for university students from the local educationauthorities to the universities&apos; recurrent grant will mean that thefull amount will have to be met by Vote expenditure instead of partly by rate support grant and partly by local rates.    The increase inthe recurrent grant would,  subject to the outcome of the negotiations,be of the order of  1 .5-2m.11.      While my proposals for reforming student union financing will not prevent irresponsible or undemocratic student behaviour, they will con-siderably reduce the scope for such behaviour.    The main advantages ofthe scheme are that it   would:-(a) abolish the union subscription as such and the need toinclude it in a student&apos;s award:(b) relieve local authorities of this financial commitment;(c) encourage closer scrutiny by academic authorities of student union activities;    and bring most student unionexpenditure under the examination of the Comptroller and auditor General or District Auditor.12. I ask my colleagues to approve these proposals and authorise meto consult with the local education authorities, the Vice Chancellorsand the students.MHTDepartment of Education and Science20 July 19713RESTRICTED
