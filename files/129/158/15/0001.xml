DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71)90 COPY NO       gi23 July 1971CABINETCIVIL SERVICE NON-INDUSTRIAL manpower memorandum by the Lord Privy seal. The Cabinet invited me on 30 June 1971 (CM(71) 35th Conclusions,Minute 6) to discuss with Departmental Ministers the savings which couldbe made in Civil Service non-industrial manpower and to report backbefore Recess.    These discussions are not yet complete and I proposeto continue them.    So far Ministers have undertaken to make reductionstotalling nearly 4, 000, as shown in the Annex.    I am grateful for these undertakings, but am bound to point out that, in sum, this is equivalentto less than 1 per cent compared with the 2 per cent accepted by theCabinet as a planning target.2.        This means that the number of non-industrial civil servants,using the present categories, can be expected to rise to over 506, 000 bythe end of the financial year, an increase of nearly 10, 000 since theElection.    I have twice recommended to Cabinet across the board cutsto hold down numbers, but the judgment of my colleagues is plainly thatthe essential requirements of their policies make a steep rise unavoidable.The Government as a whole will have to face the resulting criticism forfailing to implement our pledge.    I am, however, still hopeful that ministers will agree to further small additional reductions which would,with the transfer of the Civil Aviation Authority outside the Civil Service,ensure that we reduce the number below 500, 000 again on 1 April 1972.But this will require continuing personal interest and taut control.3.        Even if we can manage this we face the difficult task of explaining the rise in numbers before the end of the year, and this underlines thenecessity for early decisions to reduce requirements estimated at529, 000 by April 1975 on the basis of present policies.    Some decisionscan be taken at once, for example, to transfer the Ordnance Survey outsidethe Civil Service and to wind up the Directorate of Overseas Surveys.Others should be taken before the beginning of October by when the PrimeMinister requires reports to be made to the Civil Service Department.I hope these will include decisions on the departmental reviews of research and development in the Ministry of Defence, Department of the environment and the Department of Trade and Industry;  the extension of the Estainsprocedure; vehicle licensing;  and the transfer outside the Civil Service of1
the Public Trustee Office and the Land Registry.    Finally, there are other possibilities on which a conclusion cannot be reached by October,such as the future of the Department of National Savings.    For these we need by October a considered judgment on the prospect of significant change.4. I have undertaken to make proposals later in the year for improvements in the presentation of requirements.    I shall do so by theend of September.    No form of presentation can fully conceal a steepincrease in the number of staff, but I intend to set the number of staff employed by Government Departments into its context as a small part ofthe manpower employed in the public sector.    Apart from this my aim isto direct attention from the total number of non-industrial civil servants to numbers of staff of all categories engaged on different kinds of work.In particular we should distinguish between staff at headquarters andthose employed on work of an executive nature, and between those employed on civil activities and those on defence work.5. I ask the Cabinet -i.       to note that the reductions in staff promised byDepartmental Ministers are insufficient to prevent a rise in numbers of non-industrial civil servants before the end of thefinancial year;ii.       to agree to my continuing discussions with a view to ensuring reduction of the number below 500, 000 on 1 April 1972,assuming that the Civil Aviation Authority is then transferredoutside the Civil Service;iii. to agree that decisions should be taken as quickly as possible,either immediately or at least before October, on proposals forthe transfer of work outisde the Civil Service or the abandonmentor reduction of functions.    Where decisions cannot be reached by october, precise assessments of the prospect of makingsignificant change should be included in the reports required bythe Prime Minister&apos;s Personal Minute of 27 April 1971;iv. to note that I shall make proposals by the end ofSeptember for a new system of presenting manpower requirements.Civil Service Department, SW123 July 19712

NOTESa. There are major problems which may give rise to additional staff requirements not yet quantified but possibly ofthe order of over 1,000.I am discussing with the Secretary of State for education and Science the practicability of a proposal she has madefor hiving off the National Lending Library at Boston Spato provide the required reduction.The Secretary of State for Employment will try to managewithin his previous estimate despite the higher level ofunemployment;    he may need up to 300 extra if unemployment is not moderated this winter.1 have asked the Secretary of State for the Environmentto consider increasing his reduction to 600.e. I have asked the Secretary of State for Scotland to accepta reduction of 126 which would be a 2 per cent reductionexcluding the Prison Service in Scotland.    We are discussingfurther the possibility of reductions in the smallerDepartments in Scotland.f. I have accepted that the Secretary of State for social services cannot make a reduction due to unforeseen work,but I have not felt able to accept his application for anincrease of 700.    The reduction in the Office of population censuses and Surveys is subject to confirmation.g. Most of the organisations within this category are verysmall, many having less than 50 staff,  and they cannot therefore sustain a 2 per cent reduction.11
