document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government cp(71) 83 COPY NO        f12 July 1971CABINETPRESCRIPTION charges memorandum by the Secretaries of State for Social Services,for Scotland and for wales,        At their meeting on 29 April when we reported progress on our proposals for graduated prescription charges, the Cabinet asked for afurther report when we had seen the professions (CM(71) 23rd Conclusions,Minute 7).1 j2.        We have now had meetings with representatives of the doctors and dentists and of the chemists.    It is clear that all 3 professions areirrevocably opposed to the general principle of graduated charges, and weare satisfied that there is no possible modification of our proposed schemewhich would have any prospect of securing the professions1&apos; acquiescence.In principle, it is open to us to impose graduated charges; but we are in nodoubt that it would be most unwise to adopt this course, not merely becauseof the very serious difficulties with the professions which we should have to face, but also because, without the professions1 co-operation, the scheme would scarcely be workable and would in any event arouse the strongestpublic resentment and criticism.3.        It thus remains to find an alternative method of increasing the yield from prescription charges, and at the same time of rendering it buoyant,without departing too far from the objective we set ourselves in Cmnd 4515.The intention then was that the graduated charge should yield about another 15 million a year; and this, together with the increases In prescription,dental and opthalmic charges and the abolition of cheap welfare milk, helped to finance the extra  110 million expenditure on the National Health Service(NHS) which was announced in the White Paper.    We now suggest that thebest course would be to provide for a flat-rate prescription charge, larger than it is at present, which would bear a fixed relationship to the average cost (Great Britain) of a chargeable prescription to the NHS and would be adjusted at yearly intervals.    The forthcoming charging legislation willenable us to seek power to make regulations prescribing the relationship between the charge and the average cost of a prescription, and thereafter to make annual adjustments in the charge by administrative action.    Thiswould result In annual increases which would normally be of the order oflp - 2p.
4. The new Bill may not have become law by the time we wish to makethe first increase in the charge from its present level.    In that event, wecould increase the charge by means of regulations made under existing powers; regulations under the new powers could be made a year later, withannual adjustments by administrative action thereafter.    The initialincrease should, we suggest, be to 30p per item, as compared with 20pnow and 12fp up to 31 March last.    This would produce an estimated netsaving of some  17 million a year.5.        Arrangements on these lines may not be welcome to the professions,but we do not expect any serious difficulties, and would not think it necessaryto carry out any further consultations in advance of an announcement.6.        A flat-rate charge of 30p per item will be regarded as very high, andwe must find means, additional to the proposed increase from 30p to  1 inthe income limit for exemption or refund, of showing our concern bymitigating its effect on the sick at moderate income levels.    We proposethat this should be done by an extension of the prepayment certificatearrangements.   At present, patients can limit their liability to charges bypurchasing a prepayment certificate (or &quot;season ticket&quot;), valid for 6 or12 months, which during its period of validity entitles them to all theprescriptions they need without further payment.    We propose that 3-monthseason tickets should in future also be available, to help people sufferingfrom short-term illnesses requiring considerable numbers of prescriptions.The detailed arrangements are being discussed with the Treasury, but wehave in mind that the charge for the 3-month season ticket might be of theorder of  1. 50.    The cost of such a concession would be small - we shouldnot expect it to reach  1 million a year.    Chemists in England and wales have indicated their willingness to sell season tickets for a small handlingcharge and Scottish chemists would probably follow suit if graduatedcharges are dropped.   At present, the tickets can be obtained only byapplication to Executive Councils.    We think that, in relation to the proposed3-month season, the greater availability thus secured would be valuable,and we should like to pursue further this and any other ideas which may beput forward for enabling the public to buy season tickets more easily.7.        We had hoped to introduce graduated charges at the end of 1971, but would urge that the arrangements we are now proposing should be deferred until 1 April 1972.    Any earlier date would require an immediate announcement.    This would be highly embarrassing politically, seeing thatthe recent increase in the flat-rate charge from 12to 20p took place only about 3 months ago; and it would mean that opposition to what will be a veryunpopular measure would build up during the summer months.    It would be far better if any announcement were deferred until late October, after theParty conferences; and we see no real difficulty in holding the presentposition until then.    We therefore strongly urge that the operative date should be 1 April next, with an announcement in the autumn.    informal discussions about arrangements to secure the more ready availability ofseason tickets could no doubt take place meanwhile.    In fact, we estimate that the immediate financial loss arising from deferring the date of operation(about  5 million) will be fully recovered by the end of the year 1974-75owing to the greater buoyancy of this type of charge as compared with the graduated charges we originally had in mind.2
8.        We therefore seek our colleagues agreement to:i. The replacement of the proposed garduated prescription charges by a flat-rate charge directly related to the average costof chargeable NHS prescriptions and subject to annual adjustment.ii. The preparation of legislation enabling the annualadjustments to be made by administrative action.iii. An increase in the available range of season tickets.iv. An operative date of 1 April 1972, with an announcement ofthe Governments intentions in the autumn.K JG CP t department of Health and S 1 Security SE112 July 19713
