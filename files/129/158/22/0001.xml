HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government cp(71) 97 COPY NO      U130 July 1971CABINETROLLS-ROYCE M45H ENGINE FOR THE GERMANvfw 614 aircraft memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. The old Rolls-Royce company were partners with SNECMA, theFrench engine company, in developing the M45H engine for the VFW 614,a small passenger aircraft being developed by the German firm VFW in partnership with Fokker.    The German Government contributed 50 per cent of the original estimated engine development costs of  20 million, withRolls-Royce and SNECMA each providing 25 per cent.    Her Majesty*sGovernment were not directly involved.2.        Costs have now increased to an estimated  37 million and, In theview of the Ministry of Defence (Procurement Executive) might go as high as  45 million.    Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd have not yet assumed contractualresponsibility for the project; no longer believe that it will becommercially viable; and have asked for a Government indemnity against any loss on development or production.3.        Up to a few weeks ago Rolls-Royce were prepared to continue,provided the Germans and SNECMA contributed their share of the develop-ment cost increase and a higher engine selling price was negotiated.    they now realise that the project will make profits only on the most favourableassumptions of sales, costs and prices, and none are likely to accruebefore 1980.    The aircraft is from a new stable.4.        The Minister for Aerospace has told Rolls-Royce he is not preparedto recommend a full indemnity.    Their latest (informal) suggestion Is thatwe should instead cover their extra development costs since 4 February(the date of the Receivership) up to a maximum of  9 million throughlaunching aid, leaving them to finance production ( 5- 10 million) and tobear the remaining risks of the project.5.        SNECMA also have now been moved, presumably by the FrenchGovernment, to say they will make a further limited, but yet unspecified,contribution.    There are indications that the Germans may agree tocontribute  7 million.6.        My colleagues will however wish to consider whether we should become involved at all.    It is clear that Rolls-Royce will not continueunaided, although their reputation would suffer badly if they withdrew.The main arguments for giving them some financial support are:-1
a. International repercussions.    The VFW 614 is GermanyTsfirst post-war civil aircraft? it has just made its first flight and agood deal of prestige hangs on its success; it might be possible, atunknown cost and perhaps 12 months1 delay, for VFW to fall back onan American engine.   Our hopes for increased European collaborationon aero-engines would suffer a setback if the M45H is dropped.b. Claims for damages against the Receiver of the oldRolls-Royce company might mean a loss of foreign exchange ofat least  10- 15 million and perhaps considerably more.c. If difficulties arise on the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft(MRCA) then our withdrawal from the M45H would carry a good dealof weight in determining the German attitude towards continuedcollaboration on the MRCA.    A note by the Ministry of Defence isat Annex A.7.        Against this, if only commercial criteria were relevant, the projecthas no merit and should be stopped (and should never have been started).To go on must, directly or indirectly, place a charge on public funds anddiminish the prospects for supporting worthwhile aerospace ventures.    Itcannot be good for a new commercial company to undertake furtherunprofitable work, on top of the RB 211.8.        Despite these formidable objections, my colleagues may feel that thepolitical considerations preclude dropping the project altogether at thisstage.    If so, the best course would be to offer Rolls-Royce launching aidwithin a maximum of  5 million, on condition that theya. negotiate satisfactory terms with the Germans and SNECMAas to the additional contributions needed from them, and b. obtain German agreement to a substantial increase in the engine selling price, a review of delivery dates, and to fund anystretch of the engine they may require.This would put commercial pressure on the company to keep within theirpresent estimate of  37 million.    It is as far as we ought to go.    But therecan be no guarantee that Rolls-Royce will be prepared to negotiate on this basis.   An assessment of the contributions required on various assumptionsfrom the Germans, SNECMA and Rolls-Royce is at Annex B.9.        Since these negotiations would take place during the Recess, we also need to decide what should be done if Rolls-Royce fail to reach a satisfactory agreement with SNECMA and the Germans in the next two months, in theterms of the preceding paragraph.10.       I invite my colleaguesa. Co decide whether we should continue to support Rolls-Roycein the M45H project;b. if they wish to continue, to agree to Rolls-Royce negotiatingon the basis outlined in paragraph 8; and2
c.        to decide whether, should Rolls-Royce fail to achieve this position, they would wish to reconsider the matter, or leaveRolls-Royce to exercise their commercial judgment on the basisof no further Government support for the M45H.J d department of Trade and Industry SW130 July 19713
MRCA PROGRAMMENOTE BY MINISTRY OE defence     The arrangements agreed between the three countries(Germany,  Italy and the UK) on the MRCA development programme provided for a review of progress at 1 July 1971and November 1972.    The results of the review at the Julyreview point are being assessed and will be considered by german Ministers in mid August.   A genuine and close collaboration has been established with the Germans andthe major doubts they had about the engine (RB199) arisingfrom the Rolls-Royce collapse have been largely removedbut they are watching the position very closely.   Neverthe-less, all augurs well for them continuing in the MRCAprogramme.2     In the short term lack of support for the M45H couldaffect their decision in mid August to proceed with theMRCA programme: it would give ammunition to those GermanMinisters who oppose it. - The longer term effects if theMRCA proceeds would be serious.    German goodwill will bea very important factor over the coming months especiallyin our efforts to achieve the lead for British firms on anumber of important avionic equipments and in solvingremaining problems in the engine development contractnegotiations.    It has been a difficult task to achieve the present good relationships, which are so necessaryfor the long-term future of the MRCA and in re-establishingGerman confidence in Rolls-Royce&apos;s future.
