DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON EUROPEPART ONEThe Decision Now Before us i.     Since I96I it has been the declared policy of successive british governments that the United Kingdom should become a full member of theEuropean Communities, provided that satisfactory arrangements could be negotiated for our entryc   The first 2 rounds of discussions with the Sixmember countries of the Communities about arrangements for entry, in1961-63 and 1966-67 respectively, proved in the event to be fruitless; butin the third round of discussions initiated early in 1970, arrangementscovering the main problems which would arise from our entry have now been negotiated.,   The opportunity to join the Communities is now open to us:we have now to decide whether to take it,2o     On an issue of such historic importance as the entry of the UnitedKingdom into the European Communities, Parliament and the public shouldhave full opportunity to assess the 3 sets of considerations which govern the decision -io     Whether we should be economically stronger and more prosperousif we were.to join the Communities than if we remained outside them,iio   Whether our position and influence in the world would be greateras a member of the Communities than it would be outside them,,iiio Whether the arrangements for our entry agreed in the negotiations would enable us, and the other countries affected, to adjustsatisfactorily to our now position as full members of the Communitieso3o     It is the firm and considered intention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government,in the light of all the considerations set out in this White Paper, to seek the approval of Parliament in the early autumn for a decision of principle totake up full membership of the Communities on the basis of the arrangements which have been negotiated with them,,   This White Paper accordingly sets out, as a basis for Parliamentary and public discussion of this great issue,
the origins, purposes and nature of the European Communities, the broadpolitical arguments for British entry, the nature and advantages of theeconomic system into which we should be entering, and the detailed agreementsarrived at in the negotiations.Origins of the^ Cjpmmunjjbies4o     The European Communities have their origin in the fundamental changes which have taken place in the position of the countries of Western europe in little more than a generation.,   In 1945 the main continental powers ofEurope emerged from the second of 2 world wars, in which millions of liveshad been lost, enormous material damage had been done and their economieshad been strained and distorted to breaking point by the efforts anddislocations of war, to find that their position in the world hadfundamentally changed within little more than a generation.   It was not justthat they had been weakened by war.   They had lost or were in process ofshedding their imperial links, as former colonies loosened their ties withthe mother countries and sought their independence.   And they found theworld dominated no longer by the Great Powers of Europe of nineteenth centuryhistory, but by new super-powers outside the heartlands of Europe, whoseresources and capacity to support the momentum of technological change none of them could match.5*     The end of the war saw the creation of a new framework of world organisation designed to re-establish the fabric of international co--operation for peace, security and economic collaboration and recovery.The United Nations came into being, with all its subsidiary organisations, .and the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for reconstruction and Development, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.In all these one or both of the new super-powers played, as was fitting, alarge part; and the post-war struggle for reconstruction and recovery in western Europe could never have been carried through as successfully or as quickly as it was without the massive and generous assistance thai; came from across the Atlantic.6.     But the countries of Western Europe felt the need for something morethan this, for closer co-operation among themselves, to re-establishcollective defence arrangements against threats from outside Western Europe,l/2
to prevent future wars between European nations, and particularly toreplace their economic rivalry with a more productive collaboration.   Thisdeeply-felt need for closer co-operation amongst European nations gave risesuccessively to the Brussels Treaty Organisation (later known as western european Union)*, the Council of Europe, and the Organisation for european economic Co-operation, all established in the 4 years after the war.7.     These new European organisations provided a new security and new meansof consultation and co-operation among sovereign European states; but theydid not meet the need of the continental nations of Western Europe for thegreater security and prosperity which could spring from a more effectivepooling of their economic resources.   It was to meet this need that in1951 the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and in 1957 the european economic Community (e.c.) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom)were founded by Prance, Germany, Italy, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg.In establishing the Communities as the means for increasing economic integration and unity of action by the member states, provision was also made for the overseas countries associated with them to have associatestatus with the Economic Community with preferential advantages in thedevelopment of trade and aid.   The Communities together formed a european economic grouping of some 180 million people, with a further 70 million people in the associated states, mainly in Africa, in close economicrelationship with them.Pjirgoges of the Communities8.     These, broadly, were the origins of the Communities.   Their purposes are set out in their basis documents, notably the Treaty of Rome, by whichthe major organisation, the e.c. was established.   The preamble to theTreaty of Rome lists the basic objectives of the Community.   These includethe establishment of the foundations of an ever closer union among Europeanpeoples, the furtherance of economic and social progress by elimination ofthe barriers which divide Europe, improvement of the living and working conditions of its peoples, progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade and development of the prosperity of associated overseas countries.   The second Article of the Treaty affirms that the domestic task*WEU soon merged its defence arrangements with the North Atlantic treaty organisation, the basis of the Western Alliance.: :ret
of the Community is &quot;by setting up a common market and progressivelyapproximating the economic policies of member states, to promote throughoutthe Community a harmonious development of economic activities, a continuousand balanced expansion, an increase in stability, an accelerated raising ofthe standard of living, and closer relations of the member states belongingto it&quot;,9.     The Communities were thus founded to ensure the peace and prosperity ofthe 6 member countries and, as the preamble to the e.c. Treaty stated, ofany other European countries who wished to join them, by a gradualelimination of the economic barriers and differences which had divided themin the first half of the century and before.,   The member states retainedtheir national institutions and identities, but established the institutions of the 3 Communities to formulate and administer common policies.   At first,each Community had its own institutions, but in 1967 they were merged sothat there is now one Community Parliament, one Court of Justice, one Councilof Ministers and one Commission or Executive, whose members are nominated by the member states, though the staff of the Commission is in part recruiteddirectly.   It is the intention of the member states to oomplete the mergerof the Communities into a single European Community in due course.Development of the Communitiesmm*mif -iawMWimiwfnniim..... i m a mini.....mni ii10.   The communique issued after The Hague Conference of the Six in 1969called for the completion, the deepening and enlargement of the Communities.This would help them &quot;to grow to dimensions more in conformity with thepresent state of world economy and technology&quot;.   In the communique themembers expressed their &quot;common conviction that a Europe composed of states,which, in spite of their different national characteristics, are unitedin their essential interests, assured of internal cohesion, true to itsfriendly relations with outside countries, conscious of the role it has toplay in promoting the relaxation of international tension and therapprochement among all peoples, and first and foremost among those of theentire European continent, is indispensable if a mainspring of development,progress and culture, world equilibrium and peace is to be preserved,&quot;
11.   Since the foundation of the Communities, their domestic programme forthe establishment over a 12 year transitional period of a common marketwith free movement of persons, goods, services and capital and thedevelopment of common agricultural and commercial policies has unfoldedsteadily.   The internal cohesion of the Communities and the functioning oftheir institutions has been maintained, despite severe strains imposed on them by internal and external difficulties; and the influence of the communities in the economic councils of the world and the prosperity oftheir members has increased impressively.The, United Kingdom*s part in European Developments12.   The United Kingdom participated in some of the European co-operativeventures x^hich were started in the immediate aftermath of the war: in western European Union, in the Council of Europe, in the OEEC (now theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and above all inthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,,   But the realities of our positionin the world, and the similarities between that position and that of other western European countries, were masked, partly because our physical assets and our economy had suffered less disastrously than those of most other western European countries, partly because our relationships with thedominions and colonies of the British Empire had largely survived the war,and partly because we emerged from the war as one of the main partners inthe victorious alliance.   We were thus less immediately conscious of the implications of the development of the super-powers, of the changing natureof our relationships with the Commonwealth, and of the loss of much of our overseas investment.13.   For these reasons we were not ready to go as far and as fast as theother countries of Western Europe in the move for a more integratedEuropean economy, though in the early fifties we should have been welcomedas partners by all the 6 countries, and the reserves of economic strengthwith which we emerged from the war would have given us a leading positionin this development.   During the 1950s the realities of the transformationof our position were increasingly borne in upon us, in terms of recurringeconomic problems at home and in the balance of payments, of the quickeningmove to independence among former colonies, and a diminishing sense of1/5
influence in world counsels.   By the end of the decade the need toparticipate more closely in European economic integration had alreadybecome powerful.   It had been thought from 1956 onwards that &quot;when theCommunity of Six came into existence it would be possible for other european countries which did not become members of this closer grouping to join withthe Community in establishing a wider European free trade area.   but although this plar. had earlier had the support of the Governments concerned,in 1958 it became apparent that the basis of general agreement did not exist.   Subsequently, Her Majesty*s Government, together with a number ofother European countries who had not felt able to join the Communityestablished the European Free Trade Association.   Prom the outset efta had as its objective not only the establishment of industrial free trade between the signatories of the Stockholm Convention which established theassociation but the removal of trade barriers and the promotion of closereconomic co-operation between all the members of the OEEC including themembers of the Community.   Prom the outset, however, it was recognisedthat some members of the EFTA might eventually wish to join, and others to seek other arrangements with, the European Communities.Negotiations with the Communities14.   In I96I the Conservative Government decided to apply for negotiations to determine whether satisfactory arrangements could be made to meet theneeds of the United Kingdom, of the Commonwealth and of the European free trade Association.   The statement to the Six introducing this applicationsaid that this decision was reached &quot;not on any narrow or short-termgrounds, but as a result of a thorough assessment over a considerable periodof the needs of our own country, of Europe, and of the Free World as awhole .............   We desire to become full, whole-hearted and activemembers of the European Community in its widest sense and to go forward with you in the building of a new Europe&quot;.**&quot;The United Kingdom and the European Economic Community; Statement bythe Lord Privy Seal at the meeting with Ministers of Member States of theEuropean Economic Community at Paris on 10 October 1961&quot; (Cmnd 1565sNovember 1961)1/6
15o   In 1967 &quot;the Labour Government, in setting out their reasons forrenewing the application for membership of the European Communities, spoke of &quot;the long-term potential for Europe, and therefore for Britain, of thecreation of a single market approaching 300 million people, with all thescope and incentive which this will provide for British industry, and ofthe enormous possibilities which an integrated strategy for technology ona truly continental scale can create&apos;t**   They stressed that &quot;theGovernments purpose derives above all from our conviction that Europe isnow faced with the opportunity of a great move forward in political unity and that we can - and indeed we must - play our full part in it ........&quot;**The statement went on to say that the Government intended &quot;to pursue our application for membership with all the vigour and determination at ourcommand&quot;.**16.   Both Governments wero baulked in their objective so that it was notpossible for either to determine whether satisfactory conditions of entrycould be obtained.   Nevertheless both decided not to withdraw our applicationbut to leave it lying on the table.   The third round of discussions   flowedfrom the decisions of the Six at The Plague Conference in December 1969?which was convened on the initiative of the President of the french republic.   These decisions envisaged the completion and strengthening ofthe arrangements to establish a common market and the enlargement of the communities by admission of new members.   This opened the way for thelatest negotiations to take place in more promising circumstances and amore constructive atmosphere than those of 1961-63 and 1966-67.   The labour government declared in May 1970 that they wanted to start negotiations assoon as possible, and the Head of the United Kingdom Delegation to theEuropean Communities was able to say, when the formal invitation to open negotiations on 30 June 1970 was convoyed to him on 11 June, that he was confident that the date proposed would be acceptable to Her Majesty*sGovernment.17o   When the present Government took office, they confirmed their predecessors&apos; decision to open negotiations at a first Ministerial meetingon 30 June.   They picked up the hand which their predecessors had preparedfor the negotiating table, accepting as the basis of negotiations that they i**MMembership 0f -the European Communities: Statement by the Prime Ministerto the House of Commons on 2 May I967&quot; (Cmnd 3269: May I967)
would be prepared &quot;to accept the Treaty of Rome subject to the necessary adjustments consequent upon the accession of a new member, and providedthat we receive satisfaction on the points about which we see difficulty&quot;,*They accepted also that those points were the limited number of major issues defined in their predecessors&apos; statement of 4 July        .**   In thenegotiations on these major issues, initiated by one British administration and carried on by another, the 6 Governments of the Communities recognising the historic importance of the outcome, have consistently sought with us thatcommon ground on which both British and Community interests could besatisfied.   Though much work remains to be done, and some important issueshave still to be resolved, we can now see both that it is open to us tojoin if we wish to do so, and what are the major elements in the arrange-ments, both long-term and transitional which would be available to us.l8o   The negotiations for the entry of 2 fellow members of EFTA, norway and Denmark, and of the Irish Republic, who as on the previous occasionsapplied to join the Communities at the same time as we did, are also well advanced.   Discussions have also been started between the Communities andthe other members of EFTil who for either political or economic reasons feelunable to seek full membership of the Communities.   The decisions of theother European applicants about their negotiations for membership of offassociation with the Communities depend to some extent on those of theUnited Kingdom.   The agreements now reached between the United Kingdom andthe Communities on virtually all major issues of substance mean that our negotiations have reached the stage where it is both necessary and possiblefor us to take a decision of principle whether to enter the Communities.The time has therefore come to review the whole range of relevant considerations? the broad political considerations, the nature and advantages of the long-term arrangements in which we should be participating and the transitional mcasxires which xrould be available to us.^&quot;Membership of the European Communities&quot; (Cmnd 3269:   May I967)**&quot;The United Kingdom and the European Communities:   Statement made byThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the Meeting of the Councilof Western European Union at The Hague on 4 July 1967&quot; (Cmnd 3345s July I967)
THE CASE FOR BRITISH MEMBERSHIP OF a community OF EUROPEAN NATIONS19.   The historical perspective sketched earlier demonstrates that theEuropean Communities have been established because the member countries have far more interests in common than differences.     They all live inone of the great centres of world events, but individually none are nowpowerful enough to exert a decisive influence.     They have a mutualinterest in each other security;   they are determined never again to goto war with each other, and recognise that a threat to any of them threatensall.    They have similar economic and social interests and standards of life.    Their industries cannot operate efficiently with different policies and standards.     No single member country can afford more than a limitedpart in the full range of modern technological and industrial advance.The position of the United Kingdom is similar to that of our neighbours.20.   Recognising these facts, the 6 countries have already shown in theyears in which they have built up their Communities, that by harmonisingtheir economic policies and developing their economic resources in commonthey have been able to increase their prosperity, to provide a strongerbase for their security, and to exert a major influence in world economic affairs.     The contrast between their experience in recent years as members of the Communities and ours outside them, when our resources havenot been growing sufficiently to do all we should like to do at home andabroad, suggests that they chose the right road.     If we remain outsidethe Communities we shall have to develop our national resources on anarrower base;   and the competition will become progressively strongerss European political and economic unity proceeds without us in a Communityseveral times our size.The economic case21.   A fuller analysis of the likely consequences for the United kingdom economy of our entry into the Communities is given in paragraphs (      )to (        ) below.     The broad conclusions of this analysis are that despite the costs of membership, namely those arising from our contribution to the enlarged Community&apos;s budget and from the increase in our food import billlikely to follow from our adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, we
should derive substantial and growing economic benefits.     The combinedeffects of wider market opportunities and greater competition can beexpected to lead to a marked improvement in the efficiency of Britishindustry, thus enabling the costs of membership to be fully met, a higher rate of economic growth to be sustained and a more rapid improvement incur living standards to be achieved.22.   There is no alternative grouping which could offer us the sameopportunities to improve our. economic performance and to develop industriesTihich can hold their own with others in a competitive world.    A north atlantic Free Trade Area has been suggested from time to time;   but theUnited States with its great business corporations would be so dominant apartner in any such arrangement that we as members should find our economyincreasingly tied to theirs and our political choices therefore increasinglydetermined by theirs as well.     This is not a prospect which has interestedsuccessive United States Administrations who have made it clear that theywould prefer to see us as members of a strong Europe rather than as asatellite state of the USA.     Nor does the Commonwealth by itself offeralternative opportunities.     Commonwealth countries for the most part look to us to provide them with investment and new technology;   and with the attainment of independence, they have developed and are still developingwith other countries trading relationships which accord with the require-ments of their basic geographical and economic circumstances.     The UnitedKingdom&apos;s share of the trade of the Commonwealth has declined sharply overthe last decade.    In absolute terms United Kingdom exports to theCommonwealth have grown only slowly whilst our exports to the e.c. haveexpanded much more rapidly.     In 1970 for the first time United kingdom exports to the e.c. exceeded those to the whole of the Commonwealth.     Eormany Commonwealth countries, too, the e.c. will have growing attractions:for some at least it will be a more attractive trading partner than theUnited Kingdom.    It is significant that the East African commonwealth countries have now given the Communities trade preferences over us.23.   All this in no way implies that in joining the Communities we shouldincreasingly trade and invest only with the member countries.     It is their declared objective that the formation and enlargement of the Communitiesshould lead to increasing overseas trade and investment, and their experience1/10
bears this out.    When the changes agreed in the Kennedy Round ofinternational tariff negotiations are fully implemented the average level of the external tariff of the e.c. on industrial goods would beabout 85- per cent, and that of the United Kingdom about 10 per cent.The Community already accounts for 30 per cent of world trade, and itsmembers1 trade with the outside world has increased more than 2-g- times inthe 12 years since its formation - about the same as the increase in world trade as a whole.    The Common Agricultural Policy has come underconsiderable criticism, but even in the case of agricultural trade theCommunity remains a very large market for third countries&apos; foodstuffs.The Six are large investors in other countries, both developed and developing, and the enlargement of the Communities should enable all their members to achieve a rapid increase in trade and investment overseasas well as in Europe.The political case24..   The political case for joining the Communities is related to theeconomic case in one respect.    The increasing economic strength whichwe expect, and our release from the constraints of chronic balance ofpayments weakness associated with slow growth will make us stronger toprotect a wide range of important British interests.    National influencehas always declined in the absence of economic strength;   Britain cannot expect indefinitely to be an exception to this rule.     But even if wecould achieve the same degree of prosperity outside the Communities,our size would still leave us at an increasing political disadvantage.The world has grown accustomed to the military predominance of two super-powers j   but economically Europe and Japan are both well on the way tosuper-power status also.     The consequences for Britain are alreadydiscernible.     In the IMF, and the &amp;ATT and in many other ways, our economic life is increasingly affected by international decisions:increasingly and inevitably the three economic super-powers that are
emerging in the non-Communist world will be the decisive influencesin those negotiations! Individually no European country can ensurethat its voice is heard; collectively, as the Six have shown already in the Kennedy Round, the voice of the Communities cannot be ignored.If we join, therefore, we shall be making sure that British trade and manufacturing intereste are represented at the summit of the negotia-tions where the terms on which we earn our living are decided.25.   The political implications of joining Europe are clearest inthe economic field, because it is with economic policy that theCommunity is primarily concerned.    But it is inevitable that thescope of the Communities&apos; external policy should broaden as membercountries1 interests become harmonised.     That is the Communities&apos;clear intention;   and they started work towards common externalpolicies less than a year ago.     So over an increasing range ofinternational questions there will be a &quot;European&quot; policy;   andwhether or not we are associated with it, it in bound to have muchgreater impact than any individual member could achieve alone.    Inthis wider context, as in the purely economic field, Britain1sinternational influence in the future will be much greater if weexercise it inside and through the Community.
Community26.     This will mean no sacrifice of national interests or identity:Britain&apos;s sovereignty and independence will remain intact.     Like anyother treaty, the Treaty of Rome restricts the freedom of its signatories;but the restriction represents the voluntary undertaking of a sovereign state.     In practice every member generally acts in the Community spirit and observes the collective policy;   but in the experience of theCommunity hitherto that has not been a matter of the imposition of amajority view.     In practical terms the working of the Community reflects the reality that sovereign governments are represented round the table.That means that on a question where one government considers that vitalnational interests are involved it is established that the decision hasto be unanimous-   otherwise the fabric of the Community would not survive.27.     But in the political, as in the economic field, the strength ofthe Community lies not so much in the safeguards limiting its operation,as in the common interests which member countries share.     What makes theeconomic structure work is the decree to which present-day realitieshave made national competition between Europeans obsolete and self-defeating.    Economic survival calls for national efforts and resources to be deployed on a continental scale.     The same is true of the non-economic aspects of national security and strength.     The countries of western Europe no longer represent potential threats to one another.In a world where so much power is concentrated outside Europe, and wherein international terms Europe has become one region among many, the differences between European neighbours seem insignificant compared with what we have in common.     In history and culture, in our political and legal and social framework, in our standard of living and our expectations,the countries of Western Europe have a clear and common identity.     so if one half of the political case of joining Europe is that it will makeus stronger to defend our own national interests, the other half is thatit will let us work together with our European neighbours for the objectives which we share with them.    As the then Prime Minister put inhis statement to the House of Commons on 2 May 1967:   &quot;Together we canensure that Europe plays in world affairs the part which the Europe oftoday is not at present playing.     Por a Europe that fails to put forwardits full economic strength will never have the political influence which.......it could and should exert within the United Nations, within the
Western Alliance, and as a means for effecting a lasting detente betweenEast and West:    and equally in contributing in ever fuller measure tothe solution of the world&apos;s North-South problem, to the needs of the developing world&quot;.28.     These are also the common objectives of the Six and they can best be pursued by common endeavour.     Our presence in a Europe which isbanding together to end ancient rivalries and to find a new strength inunity of purpose and action will help to cement the newly formed ties.This will reinforce our security, which throughout history has beenbound up with events on the other side of the Channel and the North Sea.Because of the weakness of Europe after 2 World Wars the defence of Europe,including Britain, has greatly depended since l%-5, as it did not before,upon the strongest member of the North Atlantic Alliance.     The USAhave played and are playing a great and generous role:   but it is aburdensome one, and they feel it is now time for Europe to play a greaterpart in maintaining her own security.     It is for that vital reason - the strengthening of the Western Alliaice and the Free World - that successiveAdministrations in the United States have consistently supported thedevelopment of unity among the Yfestern European democracies, includingBritain, in a more self-reliant community of nations, even though they recognised that such a development will from time to time give rise to differences of view and interest in particular fields of policy.29.     Not only our security and our material interests, but also the ties of history and the ideals and values which we share, compel us, as theycompel our European neighbours, to pursue wider political purposes in theworld outside Europe.     The aid given to the poorer nations by our european neighbours is proportionately greater than ours, and the Communitywill be the first of the major aid donors to introduce a generalisedpreference scheme which will provide for duty free access for a wide range of products from the developing countries.     To provide new markets andaid for the less prosperous countries on a scale anything like adequate to their needs, Europe must be united, strong and wealthy.    We in britain think particularly of the countries of the Commonwealth, vjho have much to gain from close association with a wider European Community ofnations, just as other European countries think of the lands with which1/34SECfftET
they have particular ties of history and of culture, and which are alreadyassociated with the Communities.     The divisions of Europe in the presentand past centuries played an undoubted part in building up the tensionsand troubles of the developing world:    the unification of Europe in a stronger Community can play a constructive and sympathetic part in relieving those troubles.30.   At present the Communities&apos; institutions are purely economic.     Butif the developments of &quot;European&quot; policies in non-economic fields calls for new institutions, then as a member Britain will play a full andequal part in devising whatever additions to the institutional frameworkare required.     But nothing in the nature of the present Communities orthe way they are developing suggests that Britain faces now, or willever face in the future, a choice involving the sacrifice of nationalidentity or sovereignty.     The European Communities of 190 million people are no federation of provinces, counties, or cantons;   they constitute a community of great and established nations, each with itsown personality and traditions.     The Six have not lost any of their national identities or their national institutions.     They retain theirown ways of life:   as any tourist knows, France and the French are no less French, Holland and the Dutch are no less Dutch, after 20 years of community life.     They retain their own monarchs and Heads of State,their own G-governments, their own Parliaments, Courts and local adminis-trations.     Where the members reach common agreement to pool resources and authority, it is done because it is in their interests to do it.In the same way, for both economic and political reasons, successiveBritish Governments have believed that Britain&apos;s vital interests and our national prosperity and strength require us, if the terms are right, tojoin the new, powerful and outward-looking Europe that is growing upbeside us.1/15sicm si;
31,   It is in these historical perspectives that successive governments have concluded that the right choice for the United Kingdom would hoto join in the making of a wider and stronger Europe provided that satisfactory arrangements for our accession to the Communities could be negotiated.     The agreements which have now been reached in the negotiationsenable a fuller economic assessment to be made of the consequences ofUnited Kingdom membership.ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF MEMBERSHIP &apos;Effect of the Agreements32.   First, we shall be required to pay a contribution to the community budget which - after allowing for estimated receipts - would involvea net cost to the United Kingdom balance of payments of some  100 million in the first year.     The cost in later years will depend primarily on whether it becomes possible grad^ially to reduce the predominant shareof the budget which agricultural expenditure at present takes up.     Ifthe structure of the budget were to remain unaltered the net balanceof payments cost would rise to some  200 million in the fifth year%   and perhaps as much as  300 million a year in the 19S0&apos;s.33.   Secondly, the gradual adoption of the Common Agricultural policy will stimulate British agricultural production and open Community marketsto our food exports, but at the same time raise food prices in the UnitedKingdom and the cost of our food imports.     The extent of the increasein food prices and import costs will depend, of course, on the differencebetween Community and world food prices.     This difference has narrowedsignificantly over the last 2 or 3 years and for this reason the effectsare likely to be much closer to the bottom end of the range of possibilities in the 1970 White Paper.     Assuming the present price gap and allowing for the likely changes in patterns of United Kingdom production and consumption,the additional cost -to the balance of payments on account of food importsseems unlikely to amount to more than  50 million a year bjr the ond ofthe transitional period.     On the same assumption about world and Communityprices, it is estimated that adoption of the Common Agricultural policy would cause average retail food prices to rise during the transitional period by approximately 2-jr per cent per year, with the result that thecost- of living would increase by about \ per cent a year.     At the sametime, tariff reductions should lead to lower prices for manufactures, whichwould go some way to offset this increase.1/16
34.   Thirdly, there are the effects of membership on British industry.     our exports will, of course, enjoy duty-free entry to the markets of the enlarged community, so that by the end of the transitional period British cars,for example, will be able to compote on equal terms with German cars forthe French market.     And in addition to gaining a new free-trading, preferen-tial position in the markets of the Six, British exporters will also benefit from preferential access to the markets of those countries which will either be associated with the enlarged Community or will have concluded specialtrade arrangements with it.     In return, the Six will enjoy duty-froo entry for their exports to the United Kingdom, and will share with us our presentpreferential position in the other EFTA countries and the Irish Republic.Whilst, we can hardly expect to maintain indefinitely after we have joined the Community all our existing preferences in Commonwealth markets, it mustbe remembered that those preferences have already boon eroded in recentyears, and that this erosion would no doubt continue in future even if we remained outside the Community.     The cost to our balance of payments ofthese tariff changes is estimated at about  150 million a year by the endof the transitional period.     The influence on wage movements of an increaseof -p- per cent per annum in the cost of living is not expected to have any significant effect on the costs of industry nor therefore on the balanceof payments.35.   The total cost of our not contribution to the Community budget, of the extra cost of food imports, and of the tariff changes is put at about 140 million in the first year of entry, rising to about  400 million bythe end of the transitional period, and perhaps to  500 million in the1980s.     In order to set these costs in perspective it is necessary toconsider also the benefits to tho balance of payments and to tho economy as a whole which may be expected to stem from the increased opportunitiesand competition provided by membership of the enlarged Community.     Thisis considered below.The Economic Environment36.   Thus the central question in this assessment is how membership of theCommunity would affect the structure of our economy, and the prosperity of our people.     For many years we have faced familiar problems:   difficulties with tho balance of payments, an inadequate rate of economic growth, adisappointing record in industrial investment.     Tho result is that wehave begun to drop seriously behind other countries, and particularly themembers of the Community, in progress towards a higher standard of living,
37.   The Government believe, and the studies made by the confederation of British Industry show that this belief is shared by a substantial majority of British industry, that membership would provide the most favourable opportunity for achieving the progress which we all desire.Of course membership would not be a panacea for our difficulties;   itwould not bring about of itself some automatic improvement in our performance.Whether we join the Community or continue to remain outside it, our future will depend in tho last analysis upon our own exertions.38.   Growth and prosperity in any country, including of course each ofthe Six Community countries, depend first and foremost upon the size and most effective use of its resources of manpower, plant, equipment,and managerial skill.     It is essential to deploy these resources to themaximum benefit, and this requires the pursuit of appropriate policies.This requirement would bo mandatory upon the United Kingdom in any event.However, the general economic and commercial environment within whicha country oporatos is also a vital element in its success in creatingwealth and promoting welfare.     The environment can be conducive togrowth, or it can bo unfavourable to growth.     It is generally agreed thatfor advanced industrial countries, the most favourable environment isone where markets are largo, and are free from barriers to trade.     Theseconditions favour specialisation, the exploitation of economics of scale,the development and marketing of now products, and a high level of investnentin most modern and up-to-date equipment.     Through increased competition,they foster the moro efficient uso of resources over a wide area of industryand help to check tho trend to monopoly positions on tho part of large-scaleorganisations.     If wo enter tho Community, xve shall have the opportunityof profiting by those conditions;   outside it, we should forego thostimulus to efficiency and growth which they provide.Experience of tho Six39.   The economic growth of tho Six countries had already boon considerablein tho 1950s, as thoy recovered from the disruptions of war and occupation.The formation of tho European Economic Community then created an environmentwithin which they have each made further and striking progress over thepast decade.     In considering tho likely effect upon our economy of membership of an enlarged Community we must first examine the evidence of that docado.
SctCKET40.   The members of the Community created a common market in industrialgoods by steadily eliminating the tariffs on imports from one anotherover the years 1959-68.   The abolition of tariffs provided a strong and growing stimulus to the mutual trade of Community countries.   It isestimated that by 1969 the value of this &quot;intra-trade&quot; in manufactured products was about 50 per cent higher than it would have been, had theCommunity not been formed; moreover it appears that the stimulus tointra-trade is continuing.   The abolition of tariffs and this consequent increase in intra-trade were accompanied by important changes in the performance of manufacturing industries in the Six countries.   those industries which competed with imports faced an intensification ofcompetitive pressure as tariffs fell, obliging them to seek ways of raising efficiency and reducing costs.   By the same token, prospects forexporting dramatically improved.   The opening up of new markets createdopportunities for the introduction of new products, the exploitation of economies of scale, and the rationalisation of production methods.Import competition and export expansion were closely associated with a growth in investment.   The outcome of all these processes was a significantimprovement in the rate of growth of manufacturing productivity, and,therefore, higher national incomes in the Community than the member countries believe they would have enjoyed otherwise.   Moreover, theincrease in productivity was accompanied by a low level of unemployment,despite the absorption of large numbers of workers from agriculture.41.   The rate of growth of manufacturing output per head in the five majorCommunity countries had already been at a generally high level over the1950s and early 1960s, faster than in nearly all other comparableindustrial economies.   In the latter half of the 1960s, however, theirgrowth rate showed a further marked increase (with the one exception ofItaly, where the very high rate achieved in the earlier period was not quite maintained).42.   The rapid growth in manufacturing productivity in the Six was a keyfactor in their impressive economic record in the past decade.   But otherindicators also show clearly the extent of the advances made.   For example,in 1958 average earnings in Britain were similar to those in France,germany, Belgium and the Netherlands and well over half as high againas those in Italy.1/19
By 1969 average earnings in Italy had caught up with British earnings,and in the other Community countries, earnings are now &quot;between a quarterand a half higher on average than those in Britain.     In real terms, theaverage British workers1 earnings had increased by less than 40 per cent between 1958 and 1969* while in the Community countries average real earnings had gone up by nearly 80 per cent.     Similarly, all the community countries enjoyed rates of growth of gross national product per head of population and/or private consumption per head which were roughly twiceas great as britain&apos;s.h-3&apos;   Moreover, at the same time a high proportion of the Community&apos;output continues to be channelled into investment, so providing the basis for continued rapid growth in the future.     In the period 1959-69, the six devoted 24 per cent of their GNP to investment, whereas the figure for Britain is 17 per cent.44.   Finally, the Community as a whole maintained a strong balance ofpayments position during the 1960s, so that their combined holdings ofgold and foreign currency reserves increased between 1960 and 1970 bysome jT J billion dollars or          per cent;   the United Kingdom4 reserves      J over the same period by   J billion dollars or &quot; J per cent.Prospects for our Economy45.   This, then, has been the experience of the Community.     It is the conviction of the governments, of the industries, and of the trade unions,in the Six countries that their economic progress has been promoted in large measure   by the changes brought about by the creation of the Community.In the light of that experience and that conviction the Government are confident that the wider market opportunities and greater competitionprovided by the enlarged Community will lead to much improved efficiency and productivity in British industry with beneficial effects on our balanceof trade, a higher rate of investment and of growth of real wages.     the study made by the Confederation of British Industries show that this beliefis shared by a substantial majority of British industry.     The Governmentare confident that, as a result, the United Kingdom will be able to achieve a higher rate of growth in output which will provide the additional resources required to pay for the costs of entry as well as providing for1/20
a more rapid improvement in our national standard of living.     For example,if the rate of growth of real national income were to rise by a ^ per cent by the end of the first 5 years, our national income in the fifth year would be ^81,100 million7 higher as a result of our membership.    A more efficient United Kingdom industry will also be more competitive not only within the enlarged Community but also in world markets generally.     these improvements in competitive power should enable the United Kingdom tomeet the balance of payments costs of entry over the next decade as theygradually build up.46.   The Government recognise that it will take time for British industry to adapt to the new situation opened up by our entry.     In particular byexpanding its capital investment to take full advantage of the new opportunities.     The economic benefits of entry must be expected to developgradually, and it is for this reason that it has been agreed with the Sixthat the build-up of the costs of membership should also be gradual overthe period up to 1930.     But on the other hand, we can look for substantialeconomic advantages, which have also been described.    We can win theopportunity of a substantial increase in our trade, a stimulus to growth and investment and a greater rise in real wages and standards of livingthan we have experienced in recent years.     In the outcome, the costs of membership should be fully met, and we should achieve a higher rate of growth in output and therefore e more rapid improvement in our nationalstandard of life.CONCLUSION47.   The Government consider that the arrangements agreed for our entryensure that the processes of adjustment would be supportable for us and forour trading partners, especially for those in the Commonwealth.     they constitute a fair balance of mutual advantage and meet satisfactorily allthe problems which the Government and their predecessors considered itnecessary to resolve.     Beyond these economic considerations are the broaderpolitical considerations.     If we have confidence in ourselves, we have nothing to fear from economic competition or from political co-operation.In an enlarged Community we can serve our own interests and those of others.Together we can all do more and better than any of us could do alone.Together we can tackle problems of technological innovation and developmentthat would be too big for any of us alone.     Together we can compete in international markets more effectively than if we remain economicallyseparate.     Together we can do more to help the developing world moregenerously and more effectively than if we are all working on our own.
48.   Our joining the Communities will lead, as this White Paper shows,to more fruitful and more settled political and economic relationshipsboth within the enlarged Communities and between them and other nations,than would be possible if we were to reject the opportunity to enter and take part in shaping a wider, stronger and more united Europe, and to seek instead to maintain our interests from the narrower base we have held in recent years.   The United Kingdom in Europe would have morepower to influence events than the United Kingdom on the fringe:   Europewith the United Kingdom in its councils would have more influence thanEurope without the United Kingdom.kS.   A decision not to join, when at last we have the power to do so,would be a rejection of an historic opportunity and a reversal of thewhole direction of British foreign policy under successive Governmentsover the last decade.   It is not easy to predict what the consequences of such a reversal would be in terms of international confidence in thefuture of the United Kingdom; they could hardly be comfortable.   Withina single generation we should have renounced our imperial past and rejected a European future.   We, and our friends in Europe, in the commonwealth and in the United States would be uncertain of our future role and placein the world, and of our capacity to sustain it.50.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government have concluded that the arrangementsnegotiated enable us to take advantage of a unique opportunity to join the Communities, when the members of the Communities all wish us (andour fellow applicants) to join, and when there is a high degree ofidentity of view on the needs and policies of Western Europe.   They will accordingly invite Parliament to approve a decision in principle thatthe United Kingdom should take up full membership of the Communities onthe basis of these arrangements.   They believe that such a decision willbe in the beet interests of the peace, security and prosperitjr of thewhole of the British people.51.   The choice which Parliament will be asked to make is indeed historic.All historic choices involve challenge as well as opportunity.   If we accept membership of a wider and stronger European Community of nations,we shall be creating new perspectives of prosperity, influence and security:   we shall be enlarging our own horizons and widening ourchildren&apos;s prospects.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that theright decision for Britain, for Europe, and for the world is that weshould seize the opportunity, accept the challenge, and join the european communities.
PART TITOTHE OUTCOME OF THE NEGOTIATIONS1.    The negotiations with the Communities opened on 30 June 1970.   Inthe 12 months of intensive discussions which have taken place since then,the crucial issues have now been dealt with.   The following paragraphs setout the agreements which have been arrived at and also the stage reached ona small number of matters which remain to be settled.2.     A considerable amount of work however remains to be done before aTreaty of Accession can be signed, including detailed elaboration of certainagreements already reached in principle and the drafting of the Treatyitself.   In addition, we shall be continuing to examine closely with theCommunity their detailed rules and provisions in order to determine whatadaptations may be necessary to meet the circumstances of this country andof the enlarged Community.   A number of adaptations have been agreed to suit our needs and in certain cases appropriate transitional provisions ordelays to the entry into force of Community rules have been decided upon.It now seems most improbable that any significant problems remain to be identified.   English texts of all the instruments by which we should beaffected, including the agreed adaptations, would be made available toParliament at the time that any legislation was introduced to give effectto the obligations that we should be assuming under any instruments of accession to the Communities.PARTICIPATION AND VOTING IN THE COMMUNITIES&apos; INSTITUTIONS3.    No problems arose over Britain&apos;s participation in the institutions ofthe Communities.   It has been agreed that from the moment of accession   theUnited Kingdom should have a position in the institutions of the Communityequal to that enjoyed by France, Germany and Italy.4. The Council of Ministers is the body which takes all the major decisions about Community policy. In the Council the appropriate British Minister willbe present together with representatives of the nine other member states. as has been made clear in the section on sovereignty (paragraph above),Il/l
where member states vital interests are at stake, it is Community practice to proceed only by unanimity.   Most Council decisions are taken on the basisof a proposal by the Commission.   It is already provided in the Treaty thatcertain Council decisions have to be taken by unanimous vote.   In those cases where qualified majority with weighting of votes is provided for inthe Treaty, the votes of the members of the Council would have the followingweighting -Prance 10United Kingdom 10Netherlands 5Denmark 3Norway 361In these cases, where the Council decision follows a proposal by theCommission, the decisions of the Council are to be effective if at least43 votes are cast in their favour.   In some cases the Treaty provides thatvoting shall take place by qualified majority without the Commission having made a proposal.   In these cases decisions are approved if 43 votes are castin favour by at least 6 members.   In those cases in which a simple majorityis provided for, the majority will, of course, be 6 out of the 10 States.5.    The European Commission is the body responsible for executing thedecisions of the Council, for putting forward proposals which take intoaccount the interests of the Community as a whole, and for safeguardingthese interests.   In an enlarged Community, the European Commission would be composed of 14 members, 2 members from Germany, France, Italy and theUnited Kingdom and one from each of the other states.   The members of theCommission are nominated by the member Governments,   There would be appropriate-ate British representation in the staff of the Commission.   This staff is ineffect, the civil service of the Community.Germany 10Italy 10Belgium 5Luxembourg 2Ireland 3
6. The European Parliament*s present role is largely consultative, thoughit has certain powers of control over the Commission.   In the european parliament the number of members will be as follows -G-ermany 36 Prance 36Italy 36 United Kingdom %Belgium 14 Netherlands 14Luxembourg 6 Denmark 10Ireland 10 Norway 10At present nembers of the European Parliament which meets at Strasbourg arenominated by the respective national Governments.7.    The Economic and Social Committee is also a consultative body consistingof representatives from employers, trade unions, professions, farmers, etc,Membership of the Economic and Social Committee will be as follows -Germany 24 Prance 24Italy 24 United Kingdom 24Belgium 12 Netherlands 12Luxembourg 6 Denmark 9Ireland 9 Norway 98. Provisions have been agreed for equal representation of Prance, Germany,Italy, and the United Kingdom in the organs of the European Investment Bank,9.    The Community*s official languages are French, German, Italian and dutch.   On enlargement, English would also be an official language.10.   The arrangements outlined above will ensure that the United Kingdom willbe able from the moment of entry to play a full part in the management of future development of the Community.   It has been agreed that in the period between the signature of the Treaty of Accession and its entry into forcejoint procedures will be established to ensure that decisions taken by the institutions of the Community take due account of the interest of theUnited Kingdom as a prospective member of the Community, and that to this end
consultations will take place before such decisions are taken.   This will ensure that the British Government will be able to influence Communitydecisions during this period.   This procedure will apply equally to any decisions to be taken by the United Kingdom which may affect the obligationswe shall have undertaken as prospective members of the Community.TRANSITIONAL ARRMGEMBNTS FOR INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE11,   At the outset of the negotiations we made it clear that we acceptedthe Community&apos;s common external tariff (CET), subject to special arrange-ments for the 12 industrial materials dealt with in paragraph      ^below.We also accepted that the common agricultural policy would apply throughoutthe enlarged Community, subject to the arrangements now negotiated for new Zealand and for sugar, and to clarification on a number of issues.However, we required adequate transitional arrangements.   Our objective in seeking these was twofold.   On industrial tariffs we wished to secure as quickly as possible the advantages for British industry of integration withina single European market, while providing an adequate period of adjustmentfor our Commonwealth trading partners.   For agriculture and horticulture,we needed arrangements which would permit an orderly adjustment by ourproducers to the Community^ system of support and marketing;   avoid sharpincreases in food prices;   and prevent abrupt dislocation of the exports ofour Commonwealth and other third country suppliers,12.   These objectives have been achieved by the arrangements described inparagraphs   J  below.Industrial Tariffs13,   There are 2 main processes involved here.   First, all tariffs on trade between the United Kingdom and the Six have to be eliminated.   This is tobe done in 5 equal stages, starting 3 months after accession.   Second, subjectto the special tariff arrangements referred to in paragraph A&quot;       J below,we have to apply the CET to all countries neither belonging to, nor enjoyingHA
any special arrangements* with, the enlarged Community.   For those countriesaffected which at present have no preferential position in our market, thiswill involve only fairly minor adjustments to the duties we apply to theirgoods:   in general the GET is rather lower than our own tariff.   However,for the countries affected which currently enjoy free entry to our market,this will mean the gradual application of the CET to their exports to thiscountry.   It has been agreed that our move to the CET should be carried outin 4 stages, starting a year after accession.   The table below shows how these arrangements would work out if we join the Community on 1 January 1973-Table &apos;         JAbolition of tariffs betweenthe Six and theUnited KingdomCumulativereductionAdoption ofthe CET bythe UnitedKingdomCumulativemovement towardsadoption ofthe CETApril 1 1973January 1 1974January 1 1975January 1 1976*July      1 197720%20%20%20%20%40%60%80%100%40%20%20%60%80%100%14.   These arrangements have for us 2 substantial advantages.   In the firstplace they will ensure that within 3 years of entry (when the Community*stariffs will have been out by 80 per cent) our exporters will have virtuallyduty free access to the large and rapidly growing market of the Six,   the opportunities this represents will be considerable.   The GET is not on* The countries expected to have special arrangements with the enlarged community include:   those members of the European Free Trade Associationwho do not become members of the Community;   the independent Common?/ealthcountries in Africa, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific;   ourdependent territories, except Hong Kong (for which see paragraph  &quot;       Jbelow);   and the countries with which the existing Coinmunity have special arrangements, which include the countries associated under the YaoundeConvention, the dependent territories of the Six and the countries mentionedin paragraph   below.   The enlarged Community will also be offeringpreferences to most developing countries under the United nations conference on Trade and Development Generalised Preference Scheme,n/5
average high;   hut tariff averages can be misleading;   in several sectors of importance to British industry the tariff barriers we face are stillsubstantial - 22 per cent in the case of commercial vehicles, up toIS per cent in the case of organic chemicals, 16-18 per cent in the caseof plastics, 18 per cent on tractors and 14 per cent on diesel engines.In the second place, the delay of a year after entry before our first move to the CET should usefully lengthen the period of adjustment for our commonwealth trading partners,,Agricultural Transition15o   Under the common agricultural policy the level of market prices forthe main agricultural commodities is maintained in 2 ways0   The price ofimports is kept up to a minimum level or threshold price by means ofvariable import levies;   and the internal market is supported at anintervention price, slightly below the threshold price, at which anysurpluses are bought by the Community^ agricultural fund.   These arrange-ments apply to cereals, milk products, beef and veal, pigmeat and sugar and (except for support buying) to poultry and eggs, though they vary indetail for each commodity.   The agricultural fund also pays restitutions on community exports to third countries when these are sold at prices belowCommunity levels,16,   We shall adopt this Community system of support in the first year of membership, though not Community prices.   We shall introduce threshold andintervention prices of our own.   These will be lower than the full Communitythreshold and intervention prices - the difference corresponding to thedifference between our market price levels and those of the present members.We shall then increase our threshold and intervention prices gradually tothe full Community level by 6 steps over the 5 years of the transitional period.   These will be equal steps subject to a 10 per cent tolerance up ordown if this is needed in the interests of flexibility.   As market prices are increased, the deficiency payments which at present make up producers1returns will be phased out.

17.   There will he free trade with the Six in the products concerned,subject only, throughout the transitional period, to arrangements to compensate for the difference in price levels.   These will take the formof fixed levies on our exports to them aad fixed restitutions on their exports to us0   These levies and export restitutions will be graduallyreduced by 6 steps over the 5 years, as prices come into line.   There willbe comparable arrangements for trade between the present members of theCommunity and the other applicant countries, and between the applicantcountries,,18.   The operation of the levy system will give producers in the enlarged community preference over imports from third countries whenever market prices are below the threshold.   British producers will share in thispreference throughout the Community and will have the safeguard of the intervention prices to support their market.19.   For those agricultural commodities for which the Community has acommon external tariff instead of, or in addition to, levies, the transitional arrangements will take the form of tariff adjustments similar to thoseagreed for industry (paragraph /&quot;     J7).   Our tariff will gradually be adjusted to the common external tariff and eliminated against other membersof the enlarged Community,   The precise arrangements remain to be worked out in detail.   For horticulture, which depends on the tariff as its mainform of protection, there will be a slower rate of tariff adjustment with no change at all in the first year of transition.    For apples   and pearsour existing import quotas will be replaced by compensatory import leviesoffsetting the difference between British and Community prices.   Theselevies will be phased out over 5 years so as to bring prices gradually into line, with the same provision for flexibility as in the case of agricultural prices.   The horticultural industry is subject to some climatic andstructural disadvantages but there are many sectors in which it is competi-tive and in all sectors there will be opportunities for efficient growerswho can adapt to the new situation.   Assistance for new investment is
already given under the Horticulture Improvement Scheme (HIS) and theGovernment have recently announced a high rate of grant for grubbing upold orchards to improve the market for commercial producers.   Where efficientgrowers face special problems of adjustment they will be given the necessaryhelp to adjust to them,,   The Government will consider with the industry how this can best be done.20.   It has further been agreed that the enlarged Community will be readyto take prompt and effective action   to remedy any difficulties arising outof the transitional arrangements for agriculture and horticulture or any threat of abrupt dislocation to Commonwealth and other third countrysuppliers.21,   The transitional arrangements provide a sound basis for a smooth and orderly transition for our farmers and growers under conditions of faircompetition and stability.   They also allow time for the adjustment oftrading patterns, with safeguards against dislocation.   In general, Britishfarmers can expect steadily increasing prices and better overall returns fortheir produce despite higher feed costs.   There will also be much betterprospects for our exports of agricultural and food products in the markets of the enlarged Community at progressively higher prices,   British farm out-put is on a rising trend, and it has been the policy of the Government toencourage this.   But the wider e.c. market and higher returns will give afurther stimulus.,   Thus, as a result of our entry, home agricultural outputcan be expected to expand more quickly, and the Government estimate thatfor this reason output will go up by some 7 per cent above what otherwise would be the case0   With these prospects, the industry can plan ahead andinvest with confidenceaEffect of Entry on the Cost of Living21a, The effect of entry on the cost of living would be only about -g- per cent per annum over the 5 year transitional period.   Pood accounts for about one-quarter of total consumer expenditure, and it is estimated that theII/8
increase in retail food prices will amount to an average annual income ofabout 2-g- per cent.   The full effect will thus not be felt until the sixthyear.    The effect on food prices would vary from commodity to commodity.Seme such as butter, cheese and beef are likely to rise by significantlymore than the average and others such as bread, flour and eggs by aboutthe average.   Milk fish, oils and fats, tea and coffee should show little change in price.   For some fruit and vegetables there should be price reductions at certain times of the year.   Moreover, the increase in food prices will be offset to some extent by lower prices for other consumer goods as a result of tariff reductions.22e   These estimates compare with an estimated increase of 18-26 per centin food prices over the transitional period set out in the 1970 white paper,*     Since that White Paper was published, however, the gap between united Kingdom and Community food prices has continued to narrow becausewhile world prices have been rising, those in the Community have remainedrelatively stable   for several years.23.   Retirement pensioners and other low income groups will be protectedfrom the effect of the increase in food prices through adjustments of social benefits, including those for family support.   The Government are committed to maintaining at least the purchasing power of basic pensionsand related benefits through a system of regular reviews every 2 years:the next will take place a few months after the target date for our accession ie 1 January 1973.   Supplementary benefit rates are kpet underregular review.   The Government undertake that in these reviews full allowance will be made for the effect on prices of joining  theCommunity,*   &quot;Britain and the European Communities:   An Economic Assessment&quot;(Cmnd 4289 February 1970),
CONTRIBUTION TO THE COjJprcTY BUDGET24.   The Government recognised from the outset, as did their predecessors,that it would not be possible to seek to make fundamental alterations inthe system of providing funds for the Community, because the existing members had finally agreed among thomsolves oarly in 1970 only after ccnaidorabledifficulty and regarded as an essential part of the process of &quot;completing&quot;the Community envisaged in The Hague Communique.   (This system is described in Annex A).   The negotiations have therefore been directed to finding a method to enable us gradually to adapt to the Community system over aperiod of years, without placing an undue burden on our economy.25.   The solution which has been reached is as follows.   A percentageor &quot;key&quot; has been set, broadly corresponding to our present share of thetotal gross national product (GNP) of the 10 countries likely to form the enlarged Community, and this will represent the proportion of the budgetwhich we should nominally be expected to pay in the first year of membership.This key will then increase marginally in each of the 4 subsequent years,under similar arrangements to those agreed by the Six for themselves(see paragraph 5 of Annex A).26.   If our membership of the Communities became effective on 1 January1973, our key would be 19.19 per cent for 1973, rising to 20.56 per cent for 1977*   These nominal contributions mil, however, be reduced duringeach of the first 5 years of membership by a gradually diminishing amount,so that our actual contributions, as a proportion of the budget would rise from 8.64 per cent in 1973 to 18.92 per cent in 1977*   In practice,therefore, our contributions will gradually build up over the transitional period until by 1977 we are meeting a share of the budget broadly comparable to our proportion of the enlarged Community&apos;s GNP.27.   The actual gross payments which we will be  required to contributeunder these arrangements will, of course, depend on the size of theCommunity budget; and our net contribution will depend also on the size of the payments made by the Community to the United Kingdom. The table below sets out what our contributions might amount to in the first5 years of membership assuming that we enter on 1 January 1973 and that11/10
the budget amounts to  1,400 million in 1973, rising to  1,600 million in 1977.   The table also provides estimates of our net contribution inthese years assuming we receive back from the budget the sums indicatedin column 6. 9Year19731974197519761977UK key(fo OfCommunitybudget)19.1919.3819o7720,1620.56fo of key tobe paid455667o579.592UK con-tributionas f0 ofCommunitybudget8.6410.8513.3416.0218.92PossibleUK grosscontri-bution  m120155195245300PossibleUKreceipts m20405575100PossibleUK netcontri-bution  m10011514017020028.   After the first 5 years there will be a further period of 2 years during which our contribution will be determined as a percentage of thebudget.   He shall not be expected to move fully to the unrestricted directincome system described in Annex A until 1980.   The exact percentage figuresfor 1978 and 1979 will be fixed in 1977? on the basis of a calculation bythe Commission of the proportion of the budget we would then have beencontributing had wo already been applying full tho direct income system.Our 1978 contributions will be set so as to measure by two-fifths anygap revealed between our actual percentage contribution in 1977 and thefigure calculated by the Commission; and there will be a further reductionof two-fifths in 1979.29.   The settlement which has been negotiated will thus require us - asall who have studied the matter seriously will have expected - to make asubstantial contribution to the Community budget from the first year of accession - possibly  120 million gross and  100 million net (after deductingreceipts).   This is expected to rise to  300 million gross and  200 millionnet in 1977.30,   In 1980 and subsequent years we shall be requied to contribute90 per cent of our levy and customs duty receipts and such value added taxcontribution (not exceeding the yield of a 1 per cent VAT) as is necessary from each member country to close any gap between Community expenditure and community revenues from levies and duties.   In the February 1970
White Paper 90 per cent of levy receipts in the late 1970s were estimatedat  15O- 20O million; 90 per cent of United Kingdom customs duty at 240 million and 1 per cent VAT at about  230 million, making a maximumcontribution under this system of  670 million.   Since then the gap between world and Community food prices has narrowed considerably andlevy receipts are expected to be correspondingly less - perhaps of theorder of [SA2^J million.   In an enlarged Community no VAT contribution would be required while expenditure remained around its present level.   Afull 1 per cent VAT contribution would only be required from each memberif the budget were tc double its present size.   Such an expansion wouldinvolve major new programmes of Community expenditure on, for example,industrial and regional development from which we could reasonably expectreceipts commensurate with our additional contribution.   Thus our grosscontribution in the 1980s, under the Conii,lunity * 3 direct income system,might lie somewhere between  350 million and  600 million.   But since,as explained, our receipts from existing schemes of Community expenditure are expected to be of the order of  100 million and since new forms- ofexpenditure will bring us commensurate receipts, the maximum estimatednet contribution in the 1980s can be put at around  300 million.   this estimate can, of course, be little mere than a guess.   And for this reason the Community declared to us during tho course of the negotiations that ifunacceptable situations arose &quot;the very life of the Community would require that tho institutions should find equitable solutions&quot;.   For an overalleconomic assessment of the effects of membership on the United Kingdom,see paragraphs /      J above.THE COMJDNWEALTHThe Commonwealth Assessment31 .   As it has been made clear, the interests of Commonwealth countries have been a major concern of Her Majesty&apos;s Government throughout thenegotiations.32.   For all British dependent territories with the exception of Hong kong and Gibraltar (see paragraph     ) and for all independent Commonwealthdeveloping countries with the exception of those in Asia, arrangements havebeen made which provide the opportunities of association - or in the caseof the independent developing countries the alternative of a trade agreement11/12
with the enlarged Community, thereby permitting these countries access onfavourable terms to the markets of the enlarged Community.   Sugarproducing countries in the developing Commonwealth have the assurance that within the framework of an association agreement or a trading arrangementit will be the Community*s firm purpose to safeguard their interests.Independent Asian Commonwealth countries will not only benefit from thegeneralised preference scheme of the Community but have an undertaking from the enlarged Community that it is their continuing objective to expand and reinforce existing trade relations and that the Community willbe ready to examine trade problems which might arise in future with aview to finding appropriate solutions.-33.   For the more highly industrialised members of the Commonwealth -Australia and Canada - it has been recognised since 1Q67 that special arrangements would be inappropriate.   The Common External Tariff will beapplied to their industrial exports into the United Kingdom gradually overthe transitional period, and their exports of agricultural produce to theUnited Kingdom will also be affected by the arrangements made with theCommunity.   But they stand to benefit from the agreements on tariffs on-certain industrial materials (see paragraphs and       above;5 and ithas been agreed that, in the case of agricultural products the Communitywill ta3.ce speedy and effective action to deal with any abrupt disruptionof trade.34-   Frovision has been made to safeguard New Zealand exports of dairy products.   Both the British Government and the New Zealand government consider that the position which will obtain on entry into the community in respect of trade in New Zealand lamb is satisfactory.New Zealand Dairy Products and Lamb35.   Butter accounts for nearly 12 per cent of New Zealand1s totalexport earnings, and cheese for about 4 per cent.   About 68 per cent ofthese earnings come from exports to the United Kingdom market.   Our aimhas been to secure satisfactory arrangements for continuing access for new Zealand exports of these products to the markets of the enlarged-Community.   This was particularly important in the case of butter whereII/13SECftiT
New Zealand currently enjoys certain guarantees on quantity and where shewill he in direct competition with suppliers within the enlarged Community.,New Zealand cheddar cheese is not a type of cheese of which existing members are major producers,36.   It has been agreed that there will be a special derogation fromthe CAP to guarantee New Zealand a market for agreed quantities of dairy products.   For butter, the guaranteed quantity for the first 5 years willbe reduced by 4 per cent per annum so that in the fifth year of the transitional period New Zealand will be able to sell 80 per cent of the -present quantity she can sell to the United Kingdom market.   For cheese,the quantities guaranteed will gradually be reduced to 20 per cent by the fifth year.   This means that in terms of milk equivalent New Zealand canbe assured of selling at least 71 per cent of the present quantity in1977*   Moreover, New Zealand will under these arrangements enjoy a guaranteed price for these sales at the average of prices on our marketduring the 4 years 1969-72.   We estimate that this will result in prices to New Zealand substantially higher than the average of recent years,when New Zealand has not had a guaranteed price in our market.37-   During this first 5-year period, it will be open to the Council ofthe Community, on which we would of course be fully represented, to makeadjustments as between guaranteed quantities of butter and of cheese,provided that the tonnage expressed as milk equivalent corresponds to thetotal quantities approved for the 2 products for the year in question.38.   During the third year after our accession, the institutions of the enlarged Community would review the butter situation in the light of thesupply and demand position and trends in the major producing and consumingcountries of the world, particularly in the Community and New Zealand.There will be no guarantee for cheese after 1977&quot;39*   Among the considerations of which account will be taken during this review will be the progress made towards an effective world agreement on milk products and the question of New Zealand&apos;s progress toviardsdiversification of its economy and its exports.   The Community haveII/14-    secret
undertaken to make every effort to promote the conclusion of aninternational agreement on dairy products.,   The enlarged Community hasmoreover undertaken to pursue a trade policy which will not frustrateNew Zealand&apos;s efforts to diversify.,   This should help New Zealand toincrease her earnings in other markets.,40.   We sought in the negotiations to secure continuing arrangement for new Zealand., subject to review in the light of developments.   Given the rapid changes which have taken place in the dairy products market it wouldnot have been reasonable to ask the Community to look further ahead.   Wehave secured our objective.   The enlarged Community will, in the light ofthe review, decide on suitable measures for ensuring beyond 1977 the continuation of the derogation system for New Zealand.41o   The effect of these arrangements is that New Zealand will be guaranteedfor not less than 6 years hence minimum sales of 136 thousand tons of butter and 15 thousand tons of cheese.   These are minimum guarantees, anddepending on market requirements New Zealand may have the prospect of selling more under the normal Community arrangements, especially in thecase of cheese.   Since we estimate that the price which New Zealand will receive will be substantially above the level of recent years, this willgive her the prospect over the 5 years of total export earnings in our market at or above the level of those which she has enjoyed in recentyears.42.   These agreements have been accepted by the New Zealand Government asadequately safeguarding her interests and as a major concession by theCommunity.   Although they have some reservation about the basis for determing the guaranteed price, they have expressed their confidence thaton the basis of this settlement New Zealand can meet the challenge ofBritish membership of the Communities and have described the agreement ashighly satisfactory.43o   The Government have recognised that New Zealand also depends heavily on the British market for its exports of lamb, which, like dairy products,play an important part in her economic and social well being.II/15sec kit
44&apos;   There is no common organisation of the market in the Community forsheepmeat and each member state at present sets its own conditions for entry from third countries.   There is however one common elemento   Thisis the CET set at a level of 20 per cent and we have agreed to adjust tothis tariff over the transitional period.   Both we and New Zealand considerthat an acceptable volume of trade in New Zealand lamb will continue toflow over such a tariff.   Forward estimates of production and consumptionindicate that the United Kingdom in the enlarged Community will remain asubstantial importer of New Zealand lamb.   Both the United Kingdom andNew Zealand are closely concerned with arrangements for sheepmeatfollowing British entry as the United Kingdom will be far the majorconsumer ?of sheepmeat in an enlarged Community.   The Government has there fore been able to express to the New Zealand Government its confidence that there will continue to be adequate and remunerative access for lambfrom traditional sources of supply.Sugar45-   Our aim has been to obtain a firm assurance of a secure and continuing market in the enlarged Community on fair terms for the sugarexports of the developing countries which are members of the commonwealth sugar Agreement (CSA).46.   The Government1s contractual obligations to buy agreed quantities of sugar under the CSA from all participants, including Australia, until theend of 1974 will be fulfilled and domestic beet sugar production will accordingly continue to be limited until then.   Thereafter it has beenagreed that the arrangements for sugar imports from developing commonwealth sugar producers should be made within the framework of an associationagreement or trading agreement with the enlarged Community^.   It hasfurther been agreed that the enlarged Community will have as its firmpurpose the safeguarding of the interests of the developing countries concerned whose economies depend to a considerable extent on the exportof primary products and in particular of sugar.   After consultations heldin London on 2-3 June 1971? this solution was accepted as satisfactory*The arrangements for India are dealt with in paragraph [ ].
&quot;by the countries concerned on the basis of the following statement whichhas been placed on record with the Community:&quot;The Governments represented [United Kingdom, Antigua, Barbados,Fiji, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Mauritius, Swaziland, trinidad and Tabago, Uganda,, St Kitts-Hevis-Anguilla and British Honduras]expressed their satisfaction at the Community^ readiness to offer the Governments concerned a choice of forms of association or atrading agreement; and also at the readiness to recognise the UnitedKingdom&apos;s contractual commitments to all the CSA member countries upto the end of 1974^They noted that, in negotiations with the enlarged Community onassociation or trading agreements, it would be open to theGovernments concerned to act individually or collectively.   they further noted that the negotiations were due to be concluded by1975 j and that pending conclusion their existing patterns of tradewith the United Kingdom would be maintained-There was a full discussion of the Community^ offer made on sugarafter 1974.   The British Delegation assured other delegationsthat the Community^ proposals constituted a specific and moralcommitment by the enlarged Community, of which the United kingdom would be a part.   The British Government and other commonwealth governments participating regard this offer as a firm assurance ofa secure and continuing market in the enlarged Community on fairterms for the quantities of sugar covered by the Commonwealth sugar agreement in respect of all its existing developing member countries.The developing Commonwealth countries will continue to plan their future on this basis.&quot;Trade Relations with Developing Members of the Commonwealth andDependent Territories47. We made it clear in the negotiations that we needed to ensure that trade relations between these countries and the enlarged Community shouldbe safeguarded either by the establishment of association arrangements,comparable with those already accorded to developing countries enjoyingsimilar traditional relations with members of the present Community or,where this was not appropriate, by alternative solutions.
48.o   There are various ways in which developing countries are at presentassociated with the Community.   Under the Yaounde Convention certainAfrican States end the Malagasy Republic enjoy preferential or duty-freeaccess to the markets of the Community, usually in return for preferenceswhich they grant on exports from the Community in their markets; they receive development aid from the European Development Fund; and theyparticipate in a Council of Association.   The present Yaounde Conventionexpires on 31 Janaury 1975 and the negotiations for its renewal are dueto begin in 1973.49&quot;   Other association arrangements providing for mutual rights and obligations, particularly in matters of trade, are also possible.   As an example, 3 Commonwealth African countries already have a form of associationunder the Arusha Convention, which is similar to the Yaounde Convention,except that the range of goods covered by the preferential arrangements ismore limited, and there is no provision for development aid from theCommunity.50.   Dependent territories of the existing members of the Community are associated with the Community under Part IV of the Treaty of Rome.   Thebenefits, in trade and aid, enjoyed by countries so associated are broadly the same as those provided under the Yaounde Convention to independent states associated with the Community.51.   It has been agreed that the Commonwealth countries in Africa, andthe independent Commonwealth countries of the Caribbean, the Indian Oceanand the Pacific^ will be able to choose between 3 options: associationunder a renewed Yaounde Convention (the renewed Convention will have tomake provision for development aid both to the existing Associates andto new associates); some other form of association, of the kindexemplified by the Arusha Convention; or a commercial agreement tofacilitate and expand trade with the Community,   The countries concerned will not need to make their choice immediately and it has been agreed that until 1975 (when the present Yaounde Convention expires) the presenttrading arrangements between us and those countries can be maintained.*The countries concerned are;Barbados, Botswana, Fiji, Gambia, Ghana, Guyrna, Jamaica, Kenya, LesothoMalawi, Mauritius, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Tanzania, trinidad and Tabago, Tonga, Uganda, Western Samoa, Zambia.
52.   All British dependent territories (and the Anglo-French Condominiumof the New Hebrides) have been offered association under Part IV of theTreaty of Rome, except for Gibraltar and Hong Kong*.   Gibraltar will bocovered by Article 227(4) of the Treaty of Rome which enjoins that theTreaty provisions should apply to the European territories for whoseexternal relations a member state is responsible.   But, since Gibraltaris not a part of the United Kingdom*s customs territory, it has beenagreed, at Gibraltar&apos;s request, that she should not be included in thecustoms territory of the enlarged Community.   As regards Hong Kong, theCommunity agreed, as a result of the negotiations, to help the Colons&apos; by including her within the scope of their scheme of generalised preferencesfrom the date of its implementation.53.   In the case of India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Malaysia and Singapore we and the Community have said that it will be our continuing objective to expand and reinforce existing trade relations with, these countries.   TheCommunity will be ready after enlargement to examine with these countriestrade problems (including the question of Indian exports of sugar to the enlarged Community) which might arise, taking into account the scope ofthe Generalised Preference Scheme, from which they will derive considerablebenefit.   The continued suspension of the Community tariff on tea whichhas been secured in the negotiations, is also of considerable importance toIndia and Ceylon.54&quot;   Malta already has an association agreement which offers preferentialtrading arrangements but not aid; Cyprus is currently negotiating for asimilar agreement.*The dependent territories to whom Part IV association has been offered aresBahamas, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Honduras, BritishIndian Ocean Territory, British Solomon Island Protectorate, British VirginIslands, Brunei, Cayman Islands, Central and^Southern Line Islands,Falklands Islands and Dependencies, Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony,Montserrat, New Hehrides (with France) Pitcairn, St Helena and Dependencies(Ascension and Tristian da Cunha), Seychelles, Turks and Caicos Islands,West Indian Associated States (Antigua, Dominica,, Grenada,, St Lucia.,St Vincent, St Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla).A
THE CHANNEL ISLANDS AMD THE ISLE OP MAN55&quot;   The Channel Islands and &quot;the Isle of Man have for centuries enjoyeda special constitutional position in relation to the United Kingdom.   Theyhave their own legislatures, and they have their own fiscal systems and special customs arrangements.56.   Their inclusion in the Community would present constitutionaladministrative and economic difficulties.   Accordingly, after full consultation with them, we are seeking for the Islands arrangements short of full membership which would provide for an exchange of reciprocalrights and obligations between the Community and the Islands.   We have proposed that a form of association under Article 238 of the Treaty of rome might be an appropriate way of dealing with the question.II/20
SECRETiFINANCIAL AND MONETARY ISSUESSterling57. Following discussion with the member countries of the Community inthe margin of the negotiations early in June 1971 the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster made the following statement to them -I put on record at our meeting in May a number of statements v/hichhave been made on behalf of Her Majesty1s Government on thesequestions.   I would now like to add the following statement,   weare prepared to envisage an orderly and gradual run-down of officialsterling balances after our accession.We shall be ready to discuss after our entry into the Communitieswhat measures might be appropriate to achieve a progressive alignmentof the external characteristics and practioes in relation to sterlingwith those of other currencies in the Community in the context of progress towards economic and monetary union in the enlarged community,and we are confident that official sterling can be handled in a way which will enable us to take our full part in that progress.In the meantime we shall manage our policies with a view tostabilising the official sterling balances in a way which would be consistent with these longer term objectives*I hope that the Community will regard this statement as disposingsatisfactorily of the question of sterling and associated matters,leaving only the arrangements for United Kingdom compliance withthe directives relating to Capital movements under the Treaty of rome to be settled in the course of the negotiations.58,   The Six replied that the Community had taken note of this statement with satisfaction, and proposed that it should be the subject of an exchangeof letters to be annexed to the Treaty of Accession.
59.   In amplification of this exchange, the Prino Minister nade the following statement to the House of Commons on 10 Juno 1971:11.....sterling is not an issue in the negotiations but is a matter tobe discussed in the context of the negotiations.    So  when it was raised bythe Six earlier in the year we readily agreed to discuss it.At The Hague in December 1969 the Community declared its intention of moving towards economic and monetary union.     That raises understandable and proper questions, put to us in good faith, about the adjustments that mightbe required for a currency in an enlarged Community which had an appreciablerole as an international reserve currency.We have said three things to the Community.    We have said that as members of the enlarged Community we would play our full part in the progress towards economic and monetary union.    That was confirmed in my talk with president Pompidou and in my statement to the House.    We have said that weare prepared to envisage a gradual and orderly rundown of official sterling balances after our accession.   We have said that after accession we would discuss measures by which a progressive alignment of the external character-istics of sterling with those of other Community currencies might be achieved.Both of these developments would be viewed in the context of progress towards economic and monetary union.    But let me make absolutely clear thatwe have given no undertakings as to how fast or by what means these developments could or should be brought about.    These would be matters for discussion after our entry, when we should be a full member of theCommunity with all the rights of a member.    As I emphasised at the press conference following my meeting with President Pompidou and in the statement to the House, both President Pompidou and myself agreed that no country&apos;svital interests would be over-ruled by other members.    We have made clear the three conditions which any proposal for reducing the official sterling balances would have to satisfy:   notably, of course, the protection of theinterests of balance holders and the avoidance of unacceptable burdens on our balance of payments.11/22
Progress towards economic and monetary union and the future of sterling in an enlarged Community do involve enormously complex problems.   It hasto be considered, for example, what alternative asset would be generally acceptable for sterling holders, what arrangements would be needed forholders to acquire such an asset, and what form and maturity of correspondingliability might be undertaken by us.    These are not matters to which theCommunity has clear and agreed answers.    They would need a great deal ofdiscussion, both within the enlarged Community and with others concerned.It would be impossible to settle these problems in the context of these negotiations.      It is an advantage to us, not a weakness, that they arenow left for discussion after our accession, when we should contribute as members of the enlarged Community to the processes of discussion and decision-making.Two things have happened in our discussions with the Six..... First,the Six have become clearer about the size and complexity of the problems to be dealt with in this area.   Secondly, they have accepted that, if webecome members of the Community, we shall be ready to discuss the whole subject in a fully Community spirit, without preconceptions or prejudicesabout how to deal with the problems.      That is why we are not asked forand have not entered into any specific undertakings or commitments on methods or timetables, and that is why my right hon. and learned Friendfs^the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster/   statement of our position hasbeen accepted as disposing of the whole question in the context of thenegotiations.&quot;60,   In the Governments view, it will be to the advantage of the UnitedKingdom as well as of the others concerned if in due course arrangements canbe worked out which meet the    conditions stated.     The prospect of doing this will be enhanced by our membership of the Community.II/23
jFiscal Harmonisation64,       The Community countries have all adopted, or will shortly introduce,a VAT.     Initially, we sought to ensure reasonable transitional arrangementsfor moving over to that system after entry.     Subsequently, in the 1971Budget the Chancellor announced the introduction of a VAT in this country in1973 as a means of improving our own tax system.     There is therefore nolonger any need for a transitional period.     It should be noted that members of the Community are at present free to determine their own ratesand coverage for VAT.gj.        During the course of the transitional period our present customsduties (on hydrocarbon oils, beer, spirits, wines and tobacco) will need to be converted into internal taxes in order to conform with the Treatyof Rome.     As with the VAT, members of the Community are at present free todetermine the rates of these duties,European Investment Bank 6^     The Bank provides loans for economic development, principally in-member countries;   it has provided finance for such things as road con-struction and factory building.   Development projects in the United kingdom would, after our accession, be eligible for such assistance from the Bank.Capital Movements61,     The Treaty of Rome provides for the progressive abolition of restrictions on movements of capital between member countries, and theDirectives made under it have applied this to most of the main categories.62.     At present the United Kingdom operates certain exchange controlrestrictions in respect of capital movements to all Non-Sterling area countries including those in the Community.     We have put forward proposalsfor making the necessary adjustments in our Rxchange control policies inconsultation with member countries, so as to move by stages to fullcompliance with e.c. obligations by the end of a transitional period of5 years.    We propose to adjust our rules first on direct investment andthen on personal capital other than portfolio investment;   portfolio investment would be dealt with later in the transitional period.     Thus thecost to the official reserves of these changes would be spread over the transitional period, during which we may expect some additional inwardinvestment which will help to offset that cost.63,       Our proposals on this &quot;matter are still under consideration by theCommunity.
 -^     The Bank&apos;s finance is supplied by the subscriptions of member countries and by borrowing on capital markets.   It was agreed that weshould make the same subscription to the capital of the Bank as france and  Germany ( 187.5 million, of which  37.5 million will be paid up).The subscription will be vrholly payable in sterling and will fall due in instalments over a period of 2-g- years from our accession.   It isexpected that the greater part of this sum will remain in theUnited Kingdom and will not be transferred across the exchanges.Negotiations on a United Kingdom contribution to the Bankfs statutoryreserves etc have not yet been completed.gg^      lie will be represented on the Bank&apos;s management on the same footing as France, Germany and Italy. .OTHER INDUSTRIAL QUESTIONS69.Duties on most industrial materials are zero in both the United Kingdomtariff and the CET of the Community, but there are a number of items of particular importance to British industry which are dutiable underthe CET, and we have sought to ensure that our membership of theCommunity will not lead to a new charge on supplies of these materials.yO,       In some cases, after a careful examination of the situation, it hasbeen concluded that the enlarged Community will be self-sufficient.   Forthe rest, we have agreed on arrangements which will ensure that about90 per cent of our imports from outside the enlarged Community willcontinue to be imported free of duty.   These arrangements will be particularly beneficial to Canada and Australia, who are importantsuppliers of several of the materials concerned.   The agreements reached are summarised in Annex jT j7.71M      In addition, the Community has agreed to continue indefinitely itssuspension of the duty on tee-.The liroo Movement of Labour7^* Under the Community&apos;s regulations nationals of member countries mayenter the territory of another member State to look for a job or to takea job already arranged.   In practice the provisions for the free movement11/25x   SECRET
of nationals of the Six to seek or take up work has had only a limitedeffect on the actual movement of workers.     The Community as a whole hasbeen consistently short of labour and large numbers of workers from outsidethe Community have moved into it in order to take up unfilled jobs.     inside the Community movement of workers between member countries actuallydiminished between 1965 and 1?69.     The movement of labour within an enlarged Community will probably continue to be dominated by economic and social factors, rather than by regulations, and the position in practiceis likely to be similar to that which now prevails.     For these reasons theGovernment have not asked for any transitional safeguards for our national labour market as a whole;   nor was this question among those raised by theprevious Government.     Certain technical questions arising from theCommunity1s regulations (eg the definition of nationality) are being discussed with the Community.75.   For Northern Ireland, however, we have sought a 5 year transitional period before the application of the Community1 s requirements on free movement of labour.     During this period any available work there shouldbe reserved, as it now is, for residents of Northern Ireland in the firstinstance.     We have also stated that it may well be necessary towards theend of the 5 years to consider whether, and if so what, further special measures will still be needed to meet Northern Ireland&apos;s special problems.Third Country Agreements7h-.   The Community has negotiated association agreements or preferentialtrade agreements with Greece, Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Israel, Spain and malta.75.   We have agreed to accede to these agreements, subject to transitional provisions and any other adaptations that may need to be made in consultationwith the third countries concerned.     Detailed discussions have begun, and ithas been agreed that the aim is to settle all these questions before the endof the accession negotiations, without however delaying the conclusion ofthese negotiations.76.   Gaining preferential access to the first 6 of these markets, with atotal population of just under 100 million, should be of substantial benefitto British exporters.
OTHER AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS77o   At the outset of the negotiations, in addition to the transitionalproblems described in paragraph    J 9 we raised a number ofagricultural questions which have now been satisfactorily resolved.There will be annual revievs-s of conditions and prospects for agricultureboth nationally and on a Community basis, including meaningful and effective consultation with producers&apos; representatives.   It has alsobeen established that adequate supplies of milk for domestic consumptioncan be assured throughout the year under the Community&apos;s price system,and the Milk Marketing Boards, like the other Marketing boards, areexpected to continue their essential marketing functions.   For pigmeatand eggs the Community have fully recognised the special importance of market stability and a close watch will be kept on developments in an enlarged Community,78.   Good progress has also been made in adapting the detailed provisionsof the common agricultural policy and other Community legislation inthe agricultural and food sector to the circumstances of an enlargedCommunityr   Detailed discussions are still continuing on a number ofimportant aspects, notably about food manufacturing.     A number ofadaptations are called for to reflect the special circumstances of theUnited Kingdom food trade, and to ensure that our food manufacturers can take maximum advantage of the wider market which will become available tothem.Hill Farming79o   We have explained to the Community the problems of our hill farmingareas, and the policies which have led us to give special assistance to farmers in these areas.   Similar conditions obtain in many of the member countries and within the framework of the common agricultural policy they have adopted a variety of methods to deal with them.   The need for similar action in these areas of the United Kingdom where these special conditons obtain has been recognised,   We shall therefore be able togive the continuing assistance needed to maintain the incomes of farmers in the hill areas.11/27
secretAnimal Health80.   There are differences between the animal disease situation here and in the Community and in the methods of control employed.   Inparticular the Community requires that cattle passing between member states must have been vaccinated against foot and mouth disease whereaswe are able to rely on a slaughter policy.   Our aim is to ensure thatthe progressive improvement of animal health standards will continue in the enlarged Community.   We have accordingly proposed that an expertworking group including the other applicants should be set up to assess the technical and commercial considerations and the possible measures that might be taken.Fisheries81.   We and the other applicant countries have made clear that we do notconsider the common fisheries policy, decided upon at the time our negotiations began, to be appropriate to the needs and circumstances ofan enlarged Community, particularly in respect of access to fishinggrounds.   &quot;We have proposed first a recognition by the Community of theneed for change in the common fisheries policy and secondly a clear indication of what would be necessary as respect access to fishinggrounds in particular.82.   Just under a third of our catch comes from inside the 12 mile limit and three-quarters of this is taken within the 6 mile limit.   the six and the other applicants already have extensive fishing rightsbetween the 6 and 12 mile limits round most of our coast.    We havesuggested or. exclusive right of fishing up to 6 miles from existingbaselines for vessels genuinely fishing from home ports.   This remains ourposition.     The Community accept that the common fisheries policy must take account of the regional, economic, social and structural factors andthe nature of the fishery situation in the various parts of the enlarged community and agree that the arrangements governing access to coastalfisheries will have to be reconsidered in the perspective of enlargement.It has been agreed that will be held in the near future.   The Governmentis determined to secure arrangements which will satisfactorily safeguard the interests of British fishing and especially those in the inshoreindustry.11/28
EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY83.   The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was the first Communityestablished by the Six.   It dates from the Treaty of Paris signed in1951s   It is designed to ensure an orderly supply of coal and steel tothe Community, whilst at the same time taking account of the needs of third countries; to promote the orderly expansion and modernisation ofproduction; and to provide better conditions of living and employment for the workers in the industries.   The Community has at its disposalconsiderable funds which derive from levies on the coal and steel production of Community undertakings.   These funds help the developmentof the industries, provide cheap loans for workers&apos; houses, and helpfinance new employment opportunities and retraining schemes for any coal and steel employees who become redundant. They also provide grants for coal and steel research.84.   We have undertaken to adhere to the provisions of the ECSC treaty and in the course of the negotiations have secured terms which are acceptable to British coal and steel interests.   The Community haveassured us that they have no intention of calling into question the sizeor the legal position of the British Steel Corporation or the national coal Board.85.   We have undertaken to comply with the Treaty of Paris either onaccession or very soon after.   As regards transitional measures it hasbeen agreed that tariffs for steel products covered by the Treaty of paris will move at the same rate as has been agreed for industrialproducts generally.   We have also secured a transitional period of2 years during which we may, if we wish, maintain control over the exportwithin the enlarged Community of certain high grades of scrap.86.   As regards the reserve funds of the Community, which amount toabout  90 million, we shall gain access to these immediately uponaccession and will be able to enjoy benefits from them on an equal footing with other member states.   Accordingly we have agreed to make an investment in them amounting to  24 million, to be paid in three
equal annual instalments starting from the date of our accession.This is rather loss than would be called for on a strict applicationof the ratio of the value of our coal and steel production to: thatof the Community.   The money will be banked and spent primarily,probably wholly, in the United Kingdom.87.   We shall bo appropriately represented by producers, consumers and workers on the ECSC Consultative Committee.EUROPEAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMUNITY88,   The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) is the third of theEuropean Communities.   It was set up by a separate Treaty which, likethe Treaty setting up the Economic Community, was signed in Rome in1957o   It is concerned with the peaceful uses of atomic energy, promotesnuclear research and ensures the dissemination of technical information.89.   We have agreed to accept this Treaty and the rules made under it without any transitional period, except in the case of tariffs, wherethe necessary changes will be made one year after accession.   this movement in tariffs, which is more rapid than is being applied in thecase of industrial products generally, is potentially beneficial toour interests.   The balance of trade in nuclear items between thiscountry and the other members of the enlarged Community is already inour favour and could improve further.90.   We have assured the Community that we shall play a full part inthe future of Euratom and have agreed to participate in its researchprogrammes.  &quot;The Community have assured us that these programmes can be modified to take account of our entry.   We expect some contracts for nuclear work to be placed in the United Kingdom.91.   Euratom operates a system of control and inspection of civilnuclear installations which is designed to ensure that nuclear materials are not diverted to purposes other than those for which they are intended.   We have agreed to accept the Euratom control system.   Thiswill not, of course, impede tho military nuclear activities of the/30
United Kingdom; nor should it occasion to nuclear operators in thecivil field any greater inconvenience than they could expect to experiencebecause of the offer made by the United Kingdom, in connection with thoNon-Proliferation Treaty, to accept certain safeguards in relation toits civil nuclear programmee   Nor would we envisage any difficulty forthe United Kingdom arising from any agreement between Euratom and theInternational Atomic Energy Agency pursuant to the Non-ProliferationTreaty.92,   The Euratom Treaty is also designed to ensure that all users in theCommunity receive a regular and equitable supply of ores and nuclearfuels.   But this part of the Treaty is at present under revision.The Community have agreed to let us have their proposals before adoptingthem and we will have the opportunity of commenting on them.93.   It has also been agreed that we shall pay no entry fee in returnfor our access to the capital assets and scientific information held bythis Community.   At the same time, in recognition of the fact that we will have access to the complete stock of nuclear knowledge acquired byEuratom during its life, we have agreed to deposit knowledge of equivalentvalue with Euratom immediately after our accession.THE OTHER APPLICANTS AND THE EFTA NON-APPLICANTS94e   The negotiations between the Community and the other applicants for membership, Norway, DeciiHrk and the Irish Republic, have made considerable progress.   All concerned hope that it will be possible to conclude the negotiations with these countries in time to allow all4 applicants to join the Community simultaneously,-95.   The non-candidate members of EFTA (Austria, Iceland, Portugal,Sweden and Switzerland), and Finland (an associate member of EFTA) are seeking arrangements with the Community which would vary, country bycountry, depending on their economic and political position.   All ofthese countries are at present engaged in discussions with the Community.
96.   Wo and our EFTA partners have stated in communiques after severalMinisterial meetings that we have a strong interest in maintaining, aspart of the enlarged Community, the free trade already established inEFTA and in avoiding the re-erection of tariff barriers between members of EFIA.97.   EFIA Governments have expressed their desire that the arrangementsfor the non-candidate members of EFTA should come into force at thesame time as the enlargement of the Community.   So has the Community.
2.    On 21 April 1970, following agreements reached at the Submit meetingof the Six at The Hague in December 19^9, ami1, the submission of proposals by the Cor-xdssicn, the Community&apos;s Council of Ministers adopted a nowsyston designed to make the Cotinunity self-financing and to bring its expenditure into one central budget.3.     Under the nev/ system, which came into effect on 1 January 1971, theCommunity will progressively draw a greater proportion of finance for itsbudget directly from the revenue of customs duties and of levies on agricultural imports.   Except for a 10 per cent rebate to covercollection costs, all levies on agricultural imports will be handed overby member states to the Community; in the case of customs duties, an increasing proportion will be paid over until, from 1 January 1975, allcustoms duties will be handed over, less tho 10 per,cent rebate.   Theremaining proportion of the necessary revenue will continue to be made upuntil 1975 by contributions from member states according to this agreedfixed scale -%Belgium 6.8Prance 32.6Germany 32.9Italy 20.2Luxembourg 0.2Netherlands 7*3The contributions from these courri-ries in an enlarged Community would,of course, be different.THE COMMUNITY&apos;S DIRECT INCOME system.     During the period up to 1970, the Community&apos;s expenditure wasfinanced hy a combination of the proceeds from levies on agriculturalimports which were made over to the Community, and financial contributions from the member states.   The Treaty of Rome establishing the european economic Community envisaged the replacement, in due course, of thenational contributions by the Community&apos;s &quot;own resourcesj
A..     From 1 January 1975, in addition to the revenue from levies and customs duties, the Community is due to receive directly a proportion(eauivalent to up to a 1 per cent rate) of the proceeds of a Value AddedTaj;, which by this time will be in force in all member states to the extent necessary to meet any deficiency.5.     All these financing arrangements are subject, until 1978, to what are called &quot;correctives&apos;, which will ensure that no country&apos;s share ofthe budget will increase or decline by more than a relatively small amountfrom the so-called &quot;key1 level fixed for 1970.   From 1971 &quot;to 1974, nocountry&apos;s budget share may rise by more than 1 per cent or fall by more that 1-g- per cent of its share in the previous year.   For the years 1975until 1977 these annual limits will be 2 per cent of the previous year&apos;s share in either direction.   Thus Italy, whose 1970 key was 21.5 per cent,would have a maximum contribution of about 23.75 per cent in 1977*6.     The revenue raised under these arrangements finances the common agricultural policy, the administrative costs of European institutions,the European Social Fund (to promote the employment and mobility ofworkers), research and investment through the European Atomic EnergyCommunity, the Community&quot;s Food Aid Programme for overseas, and refundsto member states to cover the cost (assuned to he 10 per cent) of collectingthose levies and custn;-s duties -.*bich arc paid to the Community.   TheCommunity&apos;s budget for this expenditure in 1971 totals 51,273 million,made up as follows -  millionEuropean Agricultural Fund	1,096Community administrative costs	62Repayment to member States to cover costs of	56collecting levies and duties	Euratom research and investment	28European Social Fund	23Food Aid	8	1,273ii	SECRET	
SOLUTIONS AGREED FOR THE TARIFF TREATMENTOF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS1.   For wood pulp and lead bullion (both key materials for industrialprocessing in the United Kingdom) the CET will either be completely suspendedor equivalent arrangements made so that we are assured of continuing dutyfree access to these products even beyond the end of the transitional period.2.   For newsprint we shall share in a Community duty free quota upto the full extent of needs not covered by domestic production.   This means that our newspaper publishers will.be able to buy the balance of their requirements duty free from the sources they choose including both canada and Scandinavia.   Agreement was also reached on widening the definition of newsprint to include lighter weight newsprint:   otherwise some of ournewspapers who use this type of newsprint would have had to pay a CET of12 per cent.3.   For phosphorus it h&amp;s been agreed that we shall not start to apply the CET even at a reduced rate until 1977 and that it would be open to usthen to apply for either suspension of the tariff or duty free quotas.4-   For aluminium it has been agreed that we shall not start to applysuspended from its current level of 8.8 per cent to 5.5 per cent.   Importsof alumina into the United Kingdom would be free of duty until 1 January 1976,would as from that date pay half the suspended rate, and would from1 July 1977 pay the full 5.5 per cent rate.   But it has been recognised thatin the particular circumstances of the aluminium industry we should be ableat any time after entry to apply in advance for a duty free Community tariffquota for the period after 1 January 1976.5.   The remaining products on our list fall into two groups.     Forplywood, arrangements have been made, including a duty free quota forcertain specialised types of coniferous plywood which should continue toallow in most of our imports duty free.   And for the wattle extract used by our tanners the CET vdll be cut by two-thirds, down to 3 per cent.These arrangements for plywood and wattle extract are not limited to the transitional period.iii
6.     For the remaining products, silicon carbide, ferro a chromo,ferro silicon, refined lead and zinc and aluminium it was established thatwe should be able to secure all or nearly all our needs duty free either from increased United Kingdom production or from other suppliers in the enlarged Community.   And in the case of lead and zinc we shall be particip-ating in existing Community tariff quotas which it has been agreed to adjustto take account of enlargement.   Moreover in the case of certain of these products it has been agreed specifically that if the supply position wereto change it would be open to us to apply for duty quotas.ivSiCHEY
