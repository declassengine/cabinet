DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY5S government cp(71) 85 COPY NO15 July 1971CABINETAARMED FORCES&apos; pay memorandum by the Secretary of State for defence. The Cabinet agreed on 29 April to consider my proposals in cp(71) 52 further in the light of the progress achieved in bringing the pay Review Bodies into being and of the strategy adopted in relation tothe next round of wage increases (CM(71) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 5),2. The Pay Review Bodies are now at work, and we could, ifnecessary, ask the Armed Forces Body to comment; but I do notmyself see any necessity for this.    Our current wages strategy is directed to restraint within the bracket 7^--8^- per cent.    In conformitywith this strategy I should now be prepared to accept 8 per cent for theForces.3.        I believe that there is a measure of support for the view which i expressed in Cabinet on 29 April that, in order to avoid an embarrassinglylarge increase when the recommendations from the two-yearly review ofService pay emerge in April 1972, we should make an interim payment onaccount now.    A figure of 5 per cent has been suggested; but I do notconsider that this would be sufficient, bearing in mind that there is evidence (as I pointed out in CP(7l) 52) that betv/een April 1970 and theend of the year Servicemen^ pay had already lagged behind by about10-14 per cent and that we must therefore expect a very substantial increase to be indicated in April 1972,4.        I originally put forward my proposals mainly on equity and manpowergrounds.    In the light of the awards recently made in other parts of thepublic sector I believe that the case on grounds of equity is very strong -sufficiently so to justify modifying the two-year basis of the 1970 payscales with an interim award (a possibility envisaged by NBPI and forwhich there are parallels).    In this context an award as low as 5 percent for the Services would be regarded as discriminatory and totallyat odds with our claims that this Government attaches importance to defence and the role of the Forces.
5. This would be damaging to our already difficult manpower position.Recruiting is better than it was, but the papers which the Ministry ofDefence have circulated for the Programme Analysis Review DefenceManpower Study show that grounds for satisfaction with the position areillusory.    We are not getting enough recruits.    Too many of those wedo get leave prematurely.    We are confronted by the prospect of criticaland cumulative shortages which may call in question our ability to fulfilour pledges on defence, once the shortages cease to be masked by therundown of the Forces which at the moment is still in progress,6. I believe it to be of real importance that my revised proposalfor an interim pay increase of 8 per cent from 1 April last should be approved and put into effect without further delay,7. My revised proposal would reduce the cost to about  47. 7 millionnet, after taking into account concurrent increases in food and accommoda-tion charges.    I remain unable to offer offsettings in 1971-72, withoutconsequences to our defence policy which we could not defend, and I must continue to press that the increase should be allowed to count as a pay/price increase, in the same way as has already been agreed for the larger increase in which it will be absorbed with effect from April 1972.c ministry of Defence SW115 July 1971
