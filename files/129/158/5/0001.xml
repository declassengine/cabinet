On 30 June, the Home and Social Affairs Committee agreed that draft White Papers on the Reform of Housing Finance should be brought before the Cabinet.2. I attach the draft White Paper for Scotland.    It sets out the policies for Scotland previously agreed in Home Affairs Committee and Cabinet(CM(70) 34th Conclusions, Minute 9, CM(7l) 17th Conclusions, Minute 7).3.        The proposals for rents in the private sector are the same forScotland as for England and Wales.    They provide for the conversion of theremaining controlled tenancies to rent regulation and for the payment of rent allowances to private tenants with low incomes.    The average rent of controlled tenancies in Scotland is at present only 25p a week, and theaverage fair rent of the properties concerned may be about  1 a week.Any increase of more than 50p will be phased over up to two years.    for employed tenants with gross incomes below supplementary benefit level,rent allowances may be paid amounting to the whole of the fair rent.    the rents of other low income tenants will be covered by supplementary benefit.4.

DRAFT WHITE PAPER - scotland the FINANCE OF HOUSTJIG IN scotland.    As announced in Parliament on 3 November 1970, it is the Government&apos; intention to reform the system of housing finance so as to ensure that Government;assistance is directed to those authorities and tenants in greatest need.   Inaddition, the Government&apos;s aim is to relieve the very heavy burden of housing expenditure borne by Scottish ratepayers - many of whom are themselves tenants of public authority houses.   There have been   detailed discussions with thelocal authority associations about the most satisfactory way of achievingthese objectives, and this white Paper sets out the basis for legislation onTjiiich the Government has decided in the light of these discussions.TEE EXISTING system.    The present system of housing subsidies originated in 1919 because of theneed for houses to relieve the very bad housing conditions of the lower income groups which was revealed by a Royal Commission in 1917-   The chosen method ofproviding the houses was by Government financial assistance to local authorities,to enable them to build and let the houses at below cost rents.   After the SecoHtlvtorld &quot;Tar, council houses were made available to all sections of the community.Houses provided by public authorities now represent about half of all houses inScotland, and the financial circumstances of council tenants vary greatly.3.    These changes in the character of public sector housing have not however been reflected in the financing of it.   Rents have been kept artificially lowby Government subsidies heavily augmented by contributions from the rates;   andthese subventions have not been related to authorities&apos; or tenants needs.   Ofthe total expenditure on local authority housing in Scotland in 1969-70) only40/. was met by rents andjSQ^ by other payments (37p from ratepayers, 23&apos;i fromtaxpayers).   These   ^arneyts represent a large and rapidly growing burden onthe ratepayer and the taxpayer;   in 1969-70, for local authority houses, theyamounted to  42m from the rates and  28m from taxes.   In addition. Governmentsubsidies amounting to over $7.5m were paid to New Town Corporations in Scotlandand to the Scottish Special Housing Association.4.    These large subsidies are indiscriminate in two respects.   In the firstplace they are not distributed so as to relieve the housing problems of the1.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALworst sir^ag;    -the amounts paid to paj^i^lar local authorities depend largely on the history of council house hi1 -miing in the area and do not necoeoarilybear any relation to ci-oTc-nt needs.   Secondly, the rents paid ty tenants are notrelated to their   capacity to pay:   help is given through low rents to some who do not need it, but is not available to all who do.   In Scotland, the averagelocal authority rent in 1970 was  74 per annum (31.42 per week) compared withan average of  116 per annum&apos; ( 2.23 per week) in England and 7ales.5.     The artificially low rent level in the public sector discourages the supplyof modem houses in Scotland for purchase or for private letting.   There has there fore been increasing dependence on public sector housing, which isdistorting the housing pattern and is a discouragement to new firms and new industry which are needed for Scotland&apos;s industrial development.   Also, due tothe low rental income, it has necessitated ever growing charges falling bothon the ratepayer and the taxpayer.   The present system of rent control in theprivate sector is creating new slums at the very time when local authoritiesare replacing existing slums by new houses.   In addition, there is at present no help available in the form of rent rebates to the tenants of privately rented accommodation.TEE EE7 SYSTEM6.    The Government&apos;s proposals are designed to alter this indiscriminatesubsidy sjrstem so that assistance is directed to areas with housing problems and to tenants who need help.   A new system for fixing the rents of public sector houses vri.ll be introduced;   rents will be increased over a, period by aseries of reasonable annual steps, and a national rent rebate and allowance scheme will be introduced to ensure that those who cannot afford the new rentswill not suffer.   Rent allowances under this scheme will also be availableto tenants of privately rented unfurnished accommodation who need help.7.    The additional rent income from local authority houses will be used in part to relieve the ratepayers of the heavy payments they are at present makingtov/ards deficits on housing accounts.   At the sane time the basis of Governmentsubsidies will be altered.   Existing subsidies will be extinguished over a transitional period and will be replaced by subsidies to meet the greater partof the cost of the rent rebate and allowance scheme, and by new subsidies toassist those authorities with continuing housing needs who must incur heavy2.
expenditure in the future.     These will consist of a housing expenditure subsidy to assist authorities whose costs are increasing     rapidly;   a high cost subsidy^for authorities with high overall housing costs;   and a slum clearance subsidVoThe various grants for the improvement and conversion of houses by localauthorities and by private persons will be unaffected by these arrangements,and will continue to be dealt with separately.DETERMINATION OP KENT8.    It is proposed that each local authority should be required to fix thestandard rents of its houses in such a way that by the end of the transitional period the total rental income obtained by the authority, together with the subsidies on housing expenditure described below, meets the total expenditurefalling on the housing revenue account.   Within the framework set by this levelof rental income, each local authority will be free to fix the individual rentsof its houses to take account of differences in situation, age and amenity.   Thissystem will ensure that tenants vrtio are able to pey the full standard rent withoutthe need of a rebate will not be subsidised unnecessarily by the ratepayer and the taxpayer. They will however be protected against rising building costs through thenew subsidies on housing expenditure (see paragraphs 15* 16 and 17).   The pooling of costs over the whole of an authority&apos;s housing stock, together with the freedom to fix individual rents, should ensure that tenants do not pay a higher rent than is justified by the equality of the houses they occupy.   Also, the amount by whichrents may rise each year will be limited (para 13)*9.  The Secretary cf State intends to keep this arrangement under review and toconsider, not later than the financial year 1975-76, the possibility of moving toa &quot;fair rents&quot; basis for local authority houses.BENT REBATES10,   It is an essential part of the Government&apos;s plan that no tenant should berequired to pay more rent than he can reasonably afford.   Local authorities inScotland will therefore be placed under a duty to operate a rent rebate schemewhich will be prescribed by the Secretary cf State.   In considering the form and content of such a scheme, the G-overnment have been greatly assisted by the ScottishHousing Advisory Committee report &quot;Rent Rebates for Council Tenents&quot;, and bydetailed discussions with the local authority associations.   In the light of3*
these considerations, and of the relationship with other income-related benefits,the Secretary of State proposes that the rebate scheme should take the form givenin Appendix A.   In general this will mean that all those with bolow averageincomes will be protected by rent rebates which will be largely financed by theGovernment.   Provision will be made in the legislation for the scheme to be kept under review and adjusted from time to time in consultation with the localauthorities.11.     The cost of rebates will be eligible for Government subsidy and this svibsidywill be one of the main means of redirecting Government assistance towards thosein need.   In 1972-73* the first year of the new arrangements, the subsidy will represent 90;S of the cost of rebates;   in 1973-74 85vb; in 1974-75 80fb; and in1975-76 and subsequent years 75/^*   The remainder of the cost will be met by a specific charge on the rates, and not from the housing revenue account.   Thenumber and size of the rebates given in any particular authority&apos;s district willconsequently not affect the standard rents charged in that district.THE EiTjECT ON TI2TMTS12.   In 1970 the average standard rent of a local authority house in Scotland was 74 per year ( 1.42 per week).   If local authorities had balanced their accountsin 1969-70 the average standard rent (ie before talcing account of rebates)in 1970 would have been about 2160 a year&quot; ( 3*10 per week) with the figuresfor the major housing authorities lying between  145 a year ( 2.80 per week)and  185 a year ( 3*55 per week).   The subsidies described in paragraphs 16 and 17below, had they been in operation, would have reduced these figures substantially.The tenant in need would have had his rent further reduced by rebate.   For example,a married tenant with 3 children, earning  1,300 a year ( 25 a week) would havehad a rebated rent of  90 a year ( 1.75 per week).13.   There will be transitional arrangements to ensure that the tenants who can reasonably a,fford the new rents without requiring a rebate do not fa.ee unreasonablysharp increases, but have time to adjust their family budgets so as to ahsorb theincreased rents.   It is proposed that increases in standard rents should belimited to an average of  26 per annum (50p per week) in any one year and that noindividual tenant should have his rent increased by more than  39 per annum (75pper week) in any year.4.
On the increased expenditure Until                     Rate of Subsidyarising in1972-73 1931-82                      90$1973-74 1901-82                            85$1974-75 1981-82                            80$1975-76 1981-82                            75$1976-77 1981-82                            75$1977-78 1982-83                       1%Subsequent years For five shears                      75$The purpose of this subsidy is to delay the impact of increased hotising expenditureso that it does not have an immediate effect on the level of standard rent.   The 6 per house element will be met from rental income (see paragraph 21), and thebalance which is not met by Government subsidy, from the rate fund.5.14.   Special provisions will be required for the first year of the new system -1972-73.   In that year, the average increase in standard rents will be limitedto  24 (about 4-6p per week).   Local authorities will have to adjust their rentsby 1 October 1972, but will be able to take credit for any increase made on or after 1 October 1971.   Local authorities which delay action until 1 October 1972will face their tenants with a &quot;bigger weekly increase than those which adjust their rents earlier.   A formula which ensures that the necessary additionalrental income is obtained, but which leaves local authorities complete freedom to choose the time of year at which to adjust their rents, is set out inAppendix B.13377 SUBSIDIES15.   In addition to the rebate subsidy there will be three new Government subsidies,related directly to the expenditure of local authorities on housing.   These willbe a housing expenditure subsidy, designed to assist those authorities which,because of a heavy &quot;building programme, have rapidly rising expenditure on thehousing revenue account; a high cost subsidy, to assist authorities, particularlyin the remote areas, which have considerably higher costs to bear; and a slum clearance subsid?/-.16.   The housing expenditure subsidy will be payable towards the amount by which expenditure on the housing revenue account rises by more than an average of  6per house in any one year.   That sun will be paid as an annual subsidy for theperiod and at the rates set out below:
17.   V/here a local authority, because cf a consistently high level of expenditureon its housing revenue account, would, have to charge unduly high standardrents the high cost subsidy will be paid.   This subsidy will be equal to 75$of the amount required to reduce the rents to a fixed amount above theScottish average, the remaining 25$ of the difference being contributed by therates.   The standard rent level at which the subsidy will become payable willinitially be  39 above the Scottish average.   It is unlikely that anyauthorities will in practice qualify for this subsidy within the next two orthree years and it is intended to review this threshold figure in 1975-76 whenthe Secretary of State will be reviewing the rent basis for local authorityhouses (paragraph 9)*18.   The slum clearance subsidy will give direct financial help to those authorities which still have to close or demolish houses that do not meet thetolerable standard laid down in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1969.   Slum clearanceexpenditure will be accounted for separately from the housing revenue account;and the subsidy will be calculated on expenditure incurred in demolishing propertycomprising houses below the tolerable standard and on the cost cf making pajiaentsfor well maintained houses (under section 11 of the 19&amp;9 Act) and payments toowner occupiers (under section 18 of that Act).   The amount of the government subsidy will be 75$ of such expenditure, the remainder being met from the rates.Land transactions, both expenditure on the purchase of land for clum clearance and income from the sale of cleared land, will be excluded from the grant calculation,but expenditure incurred in paying compensation for disturbance etc to owners ofcommercial premises necessarily demolished will be included.   So that immediateencouragement is given to local authorities, it is proposed that this subsidywill be paid in 1972-73 on slum clearance expenditure incurred in the current financial year (1971-72).TRMSITIONAL AiuWGLMONTS19*   The new arrangements will start to come into operation in the course of thelocal authority financial year 1972-73.   In that year the first rent increases willbe made and the new rent rebate scheme will be brought into operation.   At the sametime the first instalment of existing subsidies and rate fund contributions will be withdrawn and the initial payments of the new subsidies will be made.   This willbe followed by a transitional period during which the standard rents will berising, by stages indicated in paragraph 13, to the level necessary to balance6.
housing revenue accounts after talcing account of the new subsidy payments which will be established; and during which the existing rate fund contributions and subsidies will be extinguished.   The length of this transitional period will vary between authorities, depending on the time required for each to balance itsaccounts.   In the majority ox cases balance will be reached in 1975-76 0^ 1976-77*but a few authorities will roach balance earlier and some will take a year or twolonger.20.   In order to establish the rate of reduction of the existing subsidies (as theyare replaced by the new subsidies), a calculation will be made for each localauthority at the end of the financial year 1971-72 to establish its total entitlement to all housing subsidies (except Improvement grants - see paragraph 7).   Includedin this amount will be the subsidy entitlement under the Housing (financial provisions) (Scotland) Act 1963 for all houses included in proposals submitted tothe Secretary of State before 1 December 1971 *   &quot;Phe subsidy entitlement for anyhouses submitted before that date which a?e not completed when the new arrangementscone into operation will be calculated as if they had been completed in thefinancial year 1971-72.   The total entitlement to existing subsidies established in this way, less an amount equal to  9 per house, will be r;aid to local authoritiesin 1972-73.   3n subsequent years the amount will he reduced aiimially by  10 perhouse until it is extinguished (paragraph 7)*21.    The additional rental income resulting from the progression to the newlevels of standard rent (paragraph 13) will be available to reduce rate-bornedeficits on housing revenue accounts in addition to covering the reduction inparticular subsidies referred to above and up to  6 per house of normal increases in expenditure.     Any further inoreases in expenditure will be met by thearrangements for housing expenditure subsidy set out in Paragraph 1b.OVERSPILL22.    Overspill receiving authorities will be able to include in their subsidyentitlement, described in the paragraphs above, the amounts to which they areentitled of Government overspill subsidy and of the matching contributions fromexporting authorities, both of which will cease under the new system.     For thefuture local authorities will be able to reach agreements on a voluntary basis for payments from exporting to receiving authorities, the precise nature of whichthey will be free to determine.     In certain circumstances these might, for example,. 7.   .&apos;.
cover the rate-borne costs of rebates to overspill tenants.   2% of the amountof any such contributions will qualify for housing expenditure subsidy(paragraph 16) to the exporting authority.   Town Development grants will remainunaffected.m TOWNS AND J5333 SCOTTISH SPECIAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION23.   Similar arrangements applying to their special circumstances will be madefor the finance of housing built by the New Town Development Corporations andthe SSHA, and their tenants will be eligible for rent rebates on the same scale.In the case of these tenants, however, the whole cost of rent rebates will beaet by the Government and no part of the cost of rebates will fall on the localauthority in whose area the tenant lives.   The system of fixing rents will alsobe kept under review (see paragraph 9) &apos;TEKART3 OP PRIVATE LANDLORDS2/f.   Until now rent rebates have generally been available only to council tenants.The Government propose to extend .this principle by giving help through a new system of rent allowances to the tenants of private landlords.   These allowanceswill be calculated on exactly the sane basis as rent rebates for council tenants(Appendix A).   The cost of allowances including the cost of administering them willbe shared between the local authorities and the Government on the same basis as thecost of rent rebates:    that is, in the first year, $0&apos;r, of the cost will be met bythe Government, reducing by 5   each year until the grant is at 75.  by 1975-76.25.   In order to ensure that rent allowances are not paid to assist tenants tomeet excessive rents, it will be a condition of their payment that the rent of thehouse had been registered by the Rent Officer, or that the local authority is satisfied that the rent does not exceed a fair rent.26.   The introduction of rent allowances for the tenants of private landlords willmake it possible to speed up the conversion of the remaining controlled tenanciesto rent regulation.   The averaga rent of controlled tenancies in Scotland is stillas low as 25 pence a week, and there has been no opportunity for the landlords of controlled tenancies to receive any increase in rent since that provided for in theSent Act 1957 -   This situation has caused stagnation and decay in the case ofQany houses where the owner has limited resources, because such owners have been unable to maintain them in proper condition.   As a result, the living conditions ofHany tenants have seriously deteriorated. The Government therefore propose toprovide for controlled tenancies to be converted to rent regulation in stages, according to rateable value over a period of about 3 years.   The resultantincreased rents will be phased over a 2 year period.8.
27,     The Government consider that, as recommended by thePrancis Committee, itshould be possible for a landlord and tenant to agree a rent if they wish to do sotdthout going to the Rent Officer.   They therefore propose that for regulatedtenancies for which no rent has been registered, or for which the registered rentis more than three years old, a new rent can be charged following an agreementbetween the parties.   It will be necessary to ensure that such an agreement isfreely made and there will therefore be safeguards.   In the case cf controlledtenancies converted under the arrangements outlined in paragraph 26 above, theagreement will have to be in a prescribed form and lodged with the Rent Officer,who Yri.ll have power to look into the case if the agreed rent appears excessive.   Inthe other cases the agreement will have to be in writing, and in every case, either party will retain the right to apply to the Rent Officer, at any time, for a fa-ir rentto be fixed.HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS28.    Housing associations in receipt of subsidy through authorised arrangementsrath local authorities under section 153 of the Housing (Scotland) Act I966 atpresent own about 2,000 houses in Scotland.   Their subsidies, like those paid tolocal authorities, will be progressively withdrawn over a period.   To replace these,associations will be able to increase their rents up to the &quot;fair rent&quot; as determinedby the Rent Officer, and their tenants will become eligible for the same rent allowance as tenants of private landlords.   If in any year the costs of an associationexceed the income derived from fair rents, the rate of subsidy withdrawal will bereduced.   For housing associations building in the future there will be a subsidyrelated to any deficit arising where the income from fair rents does not cover the initial annual expenditure.MISCELLANEOUS29.    It is also proposed to introduce a number of miscellaneous minor changes.These will include a relaxation of the conditions attaching to the payment ofimprovement grants to private persons, and the ending of grants for new housebuilding by private persons for members of the agricultural population.30.    So that policies remain responsive to changing conditions and circumstances the Secretary of State intends to review all the proposed new provisions at thesame time as he reconsiders the basis of rent fixing for local authorities, not later than 1975-76.9.CONFIDENTIAL
THE NEW POLICIES IN THEIR SE:I&apos;TING31,   These reforms, important in themselves, are only one part of the Government&apos;plans for raising the standard cf Scottish housing.   They will progressivelyeliminate the financial distortions which over the years have tilted the balanceagainst owner-occupation; and, along with other measures which are being and will betaken, they will give an increasing number of families greater freedom in the choice of their home.   At the same time, the remaining heritage of bad housing will bestrenuously attacked, by accelerated slum clearance, by new public authoritybuilding where it is needed, and by the improvement both of individual houses andof whole housing areas.   Taken together, these policies are calculated as best to meet the urgent housing needs of Scotland today and the expected requirementsof the next decade.10.
BENT EEBATE AND ALLOWANCE scheme&apos;,    The Scheme will be prescribed by the Secretary of State and all localauthorities will be under a statutory duty to operate it both for their own tenants and, as a rent allowance scheme, for tenants of private unfurnished accommodation.Subject to the consent of the Secretary of State local authorities will be able ifthey wish to vary the provisions of the scheme to be more favourable to tenantsprovided that the cost is not thereby increased by more than 10$.*   The cost ofsuch a variation will not count for subsidy.   The major provisions of the schemewhich it is intended to prescribe are set out below.2,    Assessment of eligibility for a rent rebate or allowance will be based on -a. the aggregated gross income of the tenant and where applicable of his wife;b. the number of dependants of the tenant; andc. the number of non-dependent adults in the tenant&apos;s household.3. From the aggregate gross income of the tenant and his wife the following fixedamounts will be deducted. (These amounts will be prescribed in the scheme but willbe variable by order.)i.   for a single tenant  9.50 per weekii,   for a married couple  15.50 per weekiii.   where the wife is earning - First  2.50 per week of her incomeiv,   the first  2 per week of any pension paid to the tenant or his spouse onaccount of disablement: or of any excess of war/industrial injurieswidows1 pension over national insurance widows&apos; pension,v.   for each child under the age of 18 or in full-time education 2.50 per weekWhere the tenant or his spouse is blind the deduction from income will be increasedty  1.25 (where both are blind, the increase will be  2.00).4.    After adjustment of the aggregate gross income under paragraph 4 above, the resultant net figure (&quot;reckonable income&quot;) is the basis of the calculation ofrebated rent.   Every tenant will pay a minimum rent (see paragraph 6 below); if thetenant&apos;s reckonable income is nil, he will pay only the minimum rent; in all other cases, the amount of rent payable (subject to paragraph 8 below) will be theminimum rent plus 17$ of the reckonable income.footnote:   For example, local authorities may wish to disregard the full amountof war pensions.
ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-DEPENDANTS5,    The following fixed amounts will be added to the rebated rent (but not so as to exceed the standard rent of a council house or the fair rent of a privately let house)for each person living in the tenant&apos;s house who is not dependent on him:-i.   for each person aged 18 or over not undergoing full-time education or training  1.50 per weekii.   for each person of pensionable age and not in receipt of supplementary benefit  1.00 per week(except that where two such non-dependants are husband and wife the combined amount for both is to be  1.50)iii.   for each person in receipt of supplementary benefit -  0.65 per week(for this purpose a husband and wife will count as one non-dependant).iffillMJH SENT AND MAXIMUM REBATE6,    The minimum rent for a house (payable both by tenants whose reckonable income is nil and by other tenants as a component of rebated rent) will be the higher of 1.00 or IfOjt of the standard rent of a council house or of the fair rent of aprivately let house.   No rebate or allowance vdll be payable if the amount is less than 20p per week, and the maximum rebate cr allowance payable will be 6.50 per week.ADDITIONAL REBATE FOR LOW INCOME TENANTS7.    Hrhere a tenant in employment has a gross income which is less than the sum ofhis allowances under paragraph k-t the minimum rent will be adjusted by an additionalrebate of 23fo of the difference between these income allowances and the aggregategross income.   Any additions for non-dependants will be added to the adjustedminimum renteSUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT RECIPIENTS8.    The rebate and allowance arrangements will apply to tenants in receipt ofsupplementary benefit.   Arrangements for dealing with such tenants at present vary,but many local authorities do not give them rebates at all.   Under the new arrange-nents, where the cost of the rebate scheme will be shared by the Government andthe local authority this would be inappropriate.   The intention is that the lecalauthority should charge a tenant in receipt of supplementary benefit the appropriateminimum rent (para 6),   That amount of rent, together with the relevant rates, will betaken into account by the Supplementary Benefits Commission, in the allowance they pay.Suitable administrative arrangements vdll be made so that the tenant does not have toaPply separately for his supplementary benefit and his rent rebate or allowanceo

1.APPENDIX BBENT INCREASES IN THE FIRST Y75AE OF THE NEw system.    The special arrangements for the first year of the new system - 1972-73 -referred to in parasraph Ik- are set out below.   They will require authoritiesto adjust rents by October 1, 1972 but enable them to take credit for any rent increases made from 1 October 1971 and so plan ahead in the interests of their tenants.   Authorities who take no action until 1 October 1972 will face their tenants with a bigger weekly increase at that date than those who adjust rentsearlier.   These arrangements also leave local authorities free to choose thetime of year at which to adjust their rents; once the increase date is chosen,it will apply in each subsequent year until the housing revenue account is balanced..2.    The requirements are as follows:i.   The local authority must adjust its rents before 1 October 1972 in orderto obtain in the period from 1 October 1971 to the end of the financialyear 1972-73j rental income which exceeds by  2J+. per house the income which would have been obtained if the rent charged had been that passingbefore 1 October 1971.ii.   At the end of 1972-73 the rents must be at a level which, with a furtheraverage increase of 50p per week made on the anniversary of the previousincrease, would produce rental income in 1973-724. which exceeds by  50per house the income which would have been obtained then if the rentcharged had been that passing before 1 October 1971.iii.   All rent increases made on or after 1 October 1972 must be one year after the preceding increase and must be an average of 50p per weekuntil the authority reaches balance.3.    The effect of these arrangements will be that the time of year at which localauthorities may make rent rises during the transition to the new system will be effectively determined by the date of their last increase before 1 October 1972.Local authorities wishing to make rent rises between October and May in 1972-73and subsequent years will require to meet the requirements outlined above duringthe latter half of 1971-72o   Authorities wishing to make rent rises in the period from May till October may either make increases in the latter half of 1971-72followed by an increase on the chosen date to a level which meets the requirements,or may take no action until 1972-73 and meet the requirements by one or more increasesbefore 1 October 1972
The sequences of rent increases involved in these three broad options wouldbe as follows:a. A rent increase between 1 October 1971 and the end of 1971-72 sufficient toproduce  24 per house of extra rent income by the end of 1972-73*   Theauthority would then be required to make a further increase one yearlater to reach the required level.   A possible sequence of increases wouldbe about 32p in November 1971 followed by about mp in November 1972.b. A rent increase between 1 October 1971 and the end of 1971-72insufficient to produce the required  24.   The authority would then berequired to make a further increase before 1 October 1972.   A possiblesequence of increases would be 20p in November 1971 followed by about it-lpin September 1972.c. No increase between 1 October 1971 and the end of 1971-72.   The authority would require to make an increase before 1 October 1972.   An increase of4-6p in May 1972 or one of 75p on 1 October 1972 would meet the requirements.2.
