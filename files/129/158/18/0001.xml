EB21.1 - CONTINUING WORK BEYOND 8 AUGUSTMemorandum by the Minister for Aerospace1     In EPC(7l)5&amp;* I outlined the situation with which we arelikely to be faced by 8 August.    By then, we shall have spensome  from since the Receivership on keeping the RB211 goingfor the Lockheed TriStar aircraft.    In the view of the USTreasury, banks and Lockheed themselves, Lockheed cannot compthe TriStar programme and cannot avoid bankruptcy unless theUS Government guarantee of S250M of loan is forthcoming,though the company could survive until the end of Septemberwithout it.2     During the last few days, the prospects of Congressapproving a guarantee before they go into recess on6 August have brightened.    In this event, Lockheed&apos;s ami j.necustomers (see note at Annex A) are likely to confirm their orders and we shall have to honour our undertaking of 10 may to provide the remaining finance required for the EB211.3     If Congress fail to reach a decision before their recessthey seem more likely (though there can be no certainty on txpoint) to approve eventually than to reject, and the processshould be completed within a few weeks, and hopefully well before the end of October.4-     We must therefore consider what action to take if thereis no Congressional decision, before the recess.    Thealternative courses are:-(a) to continue out interim funding of the RB2I1for the TriStar.    The cost to the end ofOctober is estimated at a&apos;further  30M;(b) to drop the project.    This will mean the endof the TriStar,  and Lockheed will be insolvent.5     In considering these alternative courses, we must clearly take into account the progress made with the engineand the latest estimates of the cost of completion. BroadlyCONFIDENTIAL
speaking HOD(AS) do not believe that there is any evidenceat present to cause fundamental doubt about the wisdom of continuing with the engine if conditions on the US side are-fulfilled.6     Rolls Royce have provided revised estimates for the costof completing development and for the production of the 555engines for present customers.      These are summarised at annex 13 and total  17011 ( 125?! development cost and  45Hproduction loss).     These figures are substantially higherthan the estimate of  130/15OM given by Sir William,Cook inMarch, upon which was based the estimate of  l30M for the *cost to the Government quoted to the House of Commons on10 May.      They are more realistic than Rolls Royce&apos;s earlierfigure of&apos; 105, and it would be prudent to allow for therisk that the cost to the Government might rise to the levelof  20014 estimated by the Ministry of Aviation Supply inMarch.      In negotiating a contract with the company, theDepartments concerned would aim at providing an incentive forthe company to limit costs, but we shall have to meet whateverexpenditure Rolls Royce in fact incur.7     If we do not get a Congressional decision by 8 August,I think that the need to honour our undertaking with Lockheedand the US Administration, and to.avoid the widespread effectsthroughout the United Kingdom of terminating the RB211 programs:requires us to give the US Administration a further period oftime for Congress to reach a decision on the guarantees toLockheed.      A note on the employment effects in the UnitedKingdom if we drop the RB211 is at Annex C.8     Our further expenditure from 8 August onward may be wasted, either because Congress finally refuses to authorise a guarantee, or because airlines decide to drop out.      Evenif the TriStar goes ahead, sales may fall short of expectationsand Lockheed may run into further financial difficulties(despite the firm present view of the US Administration thatS250M will be enough).      But I believe that the policy uponwhich we embarked in. April means that we must accept these risk, and do our best to assist the new company to achieve the objectives of the RB211 programme.9     Unless there is a favourable Congressional decision beforethe recess, we shall need to tell Parliament of our agreement to carry on financing EB211 work for a further interim period,and the costs involved.      But we should not make this announcement until it is clear that Congress will delay its decision.     We may not know this until after Parliament rises,so that only some holding statement to allay misgivings willbe possible.     There will be every advantage in getting theUS Administration to suggest formally that we should fund theEB211 during the recess.10     I accordingly invite my colleagues : --(a) to confirm our undertaking to complete the RB211
project if the United States Government meets ourconditions and gives Lockheed the assurance of the funds which the company consider necessary tocomplete the TriStar;(b) to agree that, if our conditions are not met butthere still remains a reasonable chance that theywill be met after the Congressional recess, thepresent interim funding - of the RB211 should he continued, until the end of October if necessary,at a cost estimated at  JOIi.F.T.C.Department of Trade and Industry22 July 1971-3-

BEA&apos;conclusion is likely to be that, as their requirement will notmature for several years, they should defer a decision forthe time being.     This would not affect the conditions specifiedin Article 40 of the Rolls Royce/Lockheed contract, nor would it be likely to affect either way the chances of securing the fulfilment of any of these conditions.      The British Governmenthas repeatedly stated that it does not propose to exert undue -pressure upon BEA.     Any attempt to do so would arouse stronghostility from (among others) the European countries engagedin the AJOOB programme, and would be a severe blow to our general policy in favour of private enterprise.-4-

EFFECTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM of immediate CANCELLATION OF RB2111.      A decision to let the RB211 agreement&quot; with Lockheedlapse on 8th August would have widespread effects in theUnited Kingdom.     The Government1s interim agreement withRolls Royce covering the&apos; RB211 work would come to an end.The termination costs to the Government on this latter agreement would be  15/25M. -   //pir HTTNT) A Vn T Ep,2.      Rolls Royce (1971) Ltd. would, have to make redundant atotal of some 8,350 people.     The company would however needsome weeks to produce a detailed plan for redundancies anda consequential major reorganisation, and the outline givenin the following two paragraphs might not be the plan actuallyput into effect at the time.3. About 5,750 of the redundancies would occur between 1 and3 months following the announcement, distributed as follows:DERBY AREA -   2,400(including closure of     .      -likeston factory)BABKOLDSWTCK AREA 1,000(closure of 2 factoriesat Barnoldswick)GLASGOW AREA 900(including closure oftwo small factories)SUITDEELAND 700(closure of factory)DUNDONALD, NORTHERN IRELAND 750(closure of factory) ___5,7504.      The balance of 2,600 jobs would be lost over a periodof about 12 months through the transfer of work to Derbyfrom the main East Kilbride factory which the company suggested:would eventually be closed.5.      Rolls Royce estimate that about 19,000 workers areemployed by suppliers and sub-contractors on RB211 work, butthey do not know precisely how these firms would be affected.The severest impact would probably be on Joseph. Lucas at birmingham-! (4,000 jobs) and Burnley (1,000 jobs) and at short Brothers &amp; Harland, Belfast (1,200 jobs, with another200 on TriStar airframe work).     In addition about 6,800 jobswould probably be affected in the Midlands, about 2,800 inthe South East and up to 3,200 in other parts of the country,including less than 500 in Scotland.-8-
6.     The Department of Employment estimate that the joblosses mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 3 would result in about15,500 people joining the register as unemployed;    this represents an increase in the national unemployment rate of less than 0.1%.     There would however be particular difficulties in several of the areas affected, notablySunder landBarnoldswick and Northern Ireland.      The high level of unemployment in Northern Ireland is contributing to the present disturbances and the sudden loss of afurther 2,000 jobs would be likely to exacerbate thesituation.   .7.      The loss of output to the economy resulting fromunemployment following cancellation could amount to  16M.There would also be a net transfer from public funds to.theunemployed people of some  1211 in respect of social security and redundancy payments and loss of insurance contributions and. taxes.8.      The DTI will seek alternative occupiers for premises inassisted areas which may be vacated by Rolls Royce.      But in glasgow, East Kilbride and Sunderland the scope for further measures to attract new employment is very limited..      Atemporary relaxation could, be announced on idc policy inthe Derby area, which has strong locational advantages for industry, and development area status could, be given toBarnoldswick for a limited period.OTHER EFFECTS9*      The transfer of work on other engines than PJ3211 fromone Rolls Royce factory to another would cause difficulties ofvarious kinds with the projects in question.      The companyalso suggest that some  8.5^ altogether in overhead charges would have to be borne on other engine work (much of it for european collaborative projects) in 1972 and 1973-Cancellation 01 the RB211 would require very early considerationto be given to the scale of the new company&apos;s future operations..10.      The lapsing of the Rolls Royce/Lockheed agreement wouldmean that Lockheed and the airline customers were in a. positionto lay claim to damages against the old Rolls Royce company for the loss they had suffered, and this in turn would mean a severe reduction in the dividend which the Receiver could pay to the old company&apos;s creditors as well as a further delay inpaying any dividend.      Some of Roils Royce Ltd.1s tradecreditors might well in that event go into insolvency.-9-
