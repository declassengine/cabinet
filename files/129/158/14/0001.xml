DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 89 COPY NO      g j22 July 1971CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE; PAY OF DESIGNATEDAND GENERAL GRADESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The pay of the 45, 000 Administrative and Clerical staff in theNational Health Service (NHS) has for 9 years been based on agreedrelativities with certain non-industrial Civil Service grades; and eachincrease in Civil Service pay has been reflected 3 months later by a comparable award to NHS staffs.2. The NHS negotiating committee is due to meet on 28 July.    Strictobservance of the accepted procedure would require an offer of 10, 4 per cent from 1 April, in line with our recent awards, based on pay research, to non-industrial civil servants in comparable grades.    By departing fromexact comparability on the usual lines we might limit our offer to a littleunder 10 per cent and still present it as following the general pattern of theCivil Service settlement.    But we could not go below 91-10 per cent withoutbreaching the accepted procedures and risking an Immediate breakdown inthe negotiations and an arbitration which would be likely to go against us.In the context of our general pay strategy, an offer approaching 10 per centmade in July is, however, very awkward.3. The Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations are dividedin their views whether we should adhere to accepted practice or make aclean break from It, but they are agreed that there is no sensible middle course.4. Those who favour a break with practice argue that the Governmenthave adopted as their policy objective a range of ?f-8i per cent for public sector pay settlements in the second half of 1971.    To make an offer of nearly 10 per cent to the NHS would appear to breach that policy at a timewhen, following the Chancellor&apos;s statement of 19 July, the unions will bewatching closely the degree of resolve we show in the drive to get pay settlements down.    It might also have repercussions on other current pay negotiations, especially those with local authority non-industrial staffs and staff in the water Industry; these employers agreed to aim at settling in the range of 7f-8f per cent and have made opening offers accordingly.    The1
offers have been rejected and if we now decide to give the NHS the same kind of increase as the non-industrial Civil Service it may prove difficultto prevent the local authority and water employers, nationally and/orlocally, from settling at a level which exceeds our target range.    On thisview it would be a lesser evil to breach the previously accepted practice for settling NHS pay, by restricing our offer to 7f-8f per cent in line with thecurrent objective for public sector settlements, than to risk theserepercussions and face the damage to our policy which they might cause.5.        It is argued on the other hand that the Government have so faravoided breaching agreed procedures.    Although there is not in the caseof the NHS a clear written commitment, like that recently given to the non-industrial Civil Service, the present arrangements have been establised for 9 years.    To break them now at the start of negotiations, when noprior notice has been given, would cause ill-will and very probably provokestrikes in sensitive areas.    Since the pay settlement with the NHS is due totake effect from 1 April, and would follow a pay research exercise related to 1 January, It belongs to the old round of negotiations and not the new one?and it should be perfectly possible to defend an award approaching10 per cent as a catching-up settlement, as we did for the non-industrial civil Service.    Moreover, the forthcoming reorganisation of the NHS willin Scotland entail staff transfers from the Civil Service which will bedifficult to arrange unless it is clear that present pay links continue to be observed.6. The Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations considerthat the Government face a clear choice between two alternatives -a. To adhere to the pay links and procedures of the past9 years; to make the NHS an opening offer of at least 9f pes? cent;and to be prepared to settle at up to 10 per cent and to defend this as a catching-up award dictated by the need to observe agreedprocedures.b. To make a clean break with the past, which we would justify as being necessary in the national interest of reducingthe general level of pay settlements; and to restrict our offerwithin the range of 7f-8f per cent.I invite the Cabinet to decide between these two courses. The annex show show each of them might be publicly presented.R m home Office SW122 July 19712
PUBLIC PRESENTATIONa. of a settlement based on adherence to existing pay linksAgreement has been reached on a pay settlement for 45*000 administrative and clerical staff in the NHS to take effect from 1 April 1971.   Thesettlement adds[9*9 per cent] to the wages bill.   The pay of these staff has since 1962 been based on agreed relativities with comparable CivilService grades and the increases closely follow the pattern of the recentCivil Service settlement, which in turn was based on fair comparison withthe pay of similar workers outside the Service.   The present agreement istherefore based on levels of pay for comparable work elsewhere at January 1971 and will enable administrative and clerical staff in the health service to catch up with those levels.b. of a decision to break away from existing pay linksIn recent years pay negotiations for MS administrative and clericalgrades have been largely based on earlier settlements for the correspondingCivil Service grades.    In view of the over-riding need to bring about asubstantial reduction in the level of settlements, the Government do notthink it appropriate to continue to maintain this link, given the differences between the two services and the effective dates of their pay settlements.   The Governmenfs view is that an offer involving an overallincrease of [8 per cent] is a reasonable one in present circumstances.
