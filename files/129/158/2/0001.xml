DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 77 COPY NO      6128 June 1971CABINETCIVIL SERVICE NON-INDUSTRIAL manpower memorandum by the Lord Privy SealOn 8 April 1971 (CM(71) 20th Conclusions, Minute 7) theCabinet endorsed the political importance of reducing the size of theCivil Service and agreed that there was room for a reduction in numbers.The prime Minister has since discussed with several Ministers the scope for reductions in their Department.2. In view we need to take action under three heads:-(a) short-term;(b) longer-term;(c) presentationalSHORT-TERM (1971-72)3. Unless early and drastic action is taken, it will be too late to arrest the rise in numbers in 1971-72.    We inherited 496, 000 non-industrial civil servants in July 1970: in May 1971 there were nearly500, 000;  and by the end of the financial year there would be 510, 000(see Annex).    In my considered view, the only practicable means of holding numbers in check this year is a reduction in the staff estimates.I ask my colleagues to agree to a reduction designed to bring numbersby April 1972 down to around 496, 000.    It is necessary in order to win the time we need to consider further action to meet our politicalcommitment to reduce numbers, and to devise better methods of presenting manpower requirements.4. To achieve an adequate short-term reduction, we need to cut thetotal Civil Service non-industrial staff estimates for 1 April 1972 by aminimum of ijr per cent.    It will, however, be necessary to relax anygeneral cut in favour of the few Departments which are exceptionallyhard-pressed by increases in work unforeseen at the beginning of theyear, and to compensate for this by seeking reductions greater than-j per cent from the other Departments.    I propose that we should makea reduction of 2 per cent in the estimates of all Departments, other thanthe few in exceptional difficulties, and that Ministers who are able to doso should accept a larger cut.    If the Cabinet can agree to a general
2 per cent cut and some specific undertakings can be given to do more,I propose that it be left to me to negotiate relaxations with Ministersindividually.    I must make it clear, however, that at best the scopewill be extremely limited, and I shall not be able to exempt departments on grounds of the difficulties and inconvenience which we shall all share.5. Departments should be instructed to confirm to my Departmentwithin a month of the Cabinet decision that they are taking the necessary action to implement it.    Early impact is essential in order to prevent an interim rise in numbers and the consequent political criticism.6. We must expect criticism of this action from the Staff Side,who will represent it as arbitrary action in breach of pledges.    Iwould propose to tell them that we were not cutting existing staffarbitrarily, but that Ministers had agreed to reduce the activity of their departments so that they could reduce   their future staff requirements.There must be scope for reduction of activity:  for example, the numberof staff employed on information work has increased since the Election.LONGER TERM7. The estimates of manpower requirements of Departments in later years show that on the basis of present policies the number ofnon-industrial civil servants would rise to 529, 000 by April 1975(see Annex).    If we are to reduce this requirement and carry out ourpledge to reduce the size of the Civil Service it will be necessary to eliminate or reduce functions and tasks of Departments and identifyfunctions which can properly be hived off outside central Government.8. The review we have made of functions has so far yielded staffreductions smaller than the increase required for new tasks.    Thereare, however, a number of proposals under consideration for hiving offwork, and these could lead to significant reductions in Civil service manpower.    I ask all my colleagues to make an intensive study oftheir Departments to identify further work which could be reduced,abandoned or better carried out by a body independent of centralGovernment, and to include the results of this in the reports requiredby the beginning of October by the Prime Ministers Personal minute of 27 April 1971 on the Review of Activities of Government (M 28/71).In the light of this review, we must decide before the end of the yearwhether we can reduce numbers by these means or, alternatively,accept a controlled rise in the number of civil servants during theremainder of this Parliament.PRESENTATION9. Whatever decision is taken about the level of future require-ments, we must improve the system of presentation of them, so thatthey are better understood, and provide a better reflection of the newadministrative pattern which is emerging in Government.    I am puttinga study of this in hand, and will make proposals for a new system later in the year.2CON FIDE NTS AIL
CONCLUSION10. I ask the Cabinet: -i. to agree to a cut of at least 1% per cent in the totalnon-industrial staff estimate for April 1972, basedon a 2 per cent cut in the estimates of all Departments;ii. to invite those Ministers who can to make a larger cut;iii. to authorise me to agree to relaxations for Departmentsexceptionally hard-pressed by increases of workunforeseen at the beginning of the year, provided thatan overall cut of at least 1 jr per cent is secured;iv. to ask all Ministers to make an intensive study of thefurther scope for reducing or hiving off functions;v. to note that I shall make proposals for a new systemof presenting manpower requirements.Civil Service Department SW128 June 19713
