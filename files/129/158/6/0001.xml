S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 81 COPY no. 5 July 1971CABINETHOUSING FINANCE: QUESTIONS OF TIMINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Home department the Cabinet have before them draft White Papers on the reform of Housing Finance in England and Wales, and in Scotland.    Thismemorandum deals with questions of timing.    The Cabinet originallydecided against White Papers in advance of publication of the Bills;but there have now been consultations with local authorities and thereis an expectation of some detailed statement of the Governments intentions.In addition a means has had to be found of giving effect to the decision ofthe Cabinet on 25 March (CM(71) 17th Conclusions, Minute 7) to give localauthorities an opportunity to begin the progression towards fair rentsfrom 1 October 1971 or 1 April 1972 rather than waiting until the bills had received Royal Assent.    Otherwise the savings forecast could not berealised without excessively sharp increases from 1 October 1972.2. The Secretaries of State for Scotland and for the Environmentaccordingly proposed to the Home and Social Affairs Committee (HS) thatWhite Papers should be published in mid-July so as to give the authoritiesthis opportunity.    The further object is to remove the uncertainty that is causing authorities to delay necessary schemes and to rally support for the many features which will appeal to the Governmenfs supporters and to moderate opinion by presenting the reforms in their context.3.        However, when HS considered the draft White Papers, serious difficulties of timing became evident.    The publication of White Papers in mid-July would inevitably lead to demand for a debate;  Government timecannot be spared and some of tis thought that White Papers would simplyprovide an additional and premature occasion for controversy in advanceof the introduction of the Bills: and at a most untimely moment.    Thediscussion of any factor that would increase the cost of living, howeverbeneficial might be the reform of which that factor formed part, was bound to affect adversely the Government1 s efforts to contain and reducewage inflation, particularly at a time when a new round of wage claims fell to be negotiated.    Moreover, controversy over housing policies might well have a distracting or confusing influence on discussion on our accession tothe European Economic Communities.1
4. The choice of options is dominated by 1 October 1971.    To raiserents authorities must settle the increases for each house, pass them through their committees and give 4 week aotice to tenants.    So somecommunication must be made to them by about the end of July.Otherwise we shall have to enforce the rent increases within a moreconstricted period, and contrary to arrangements agreed with the localauthority associations following our March decision, unless we are willing to jeopardise the savings of  150- 175 million over 4 years which it was our object in March to preserve.5. If the Cabinet decide to preserve the 1 October 1971 optionthree courses appear to be open:-a. To publish the White Papers in mid-July, and thus givethe local authorities the longest possible notice.b. To publish them immediately before the Recess(assuming that the House will rise on 30 July).    This would avoid, although it might appear to be designed to evade, a debate.    The difficulties referred to in paragraph 3 above wouldbe reduced.    There would be less time for local authoritypreparation but the advantages of presenting the policy bymeans of White Papers would be preserved.c. To send (and publish) circulars to authorities immediatelyafter the House rises, announcing that intention in statementsimmediately before: a course which might affront Parliament.Even this would dangerously reduce the time available to localauthorities; the circulars could hardly be delayed beyond2 August.   Moreover since one cannot set out in a circular, as one can in a White Paper, the broad philosophy lying behind our policies, their unpopular features would tend to be publiclyemphasised and support for our reforms as a whole endangered.R m home Office, SW15 July 19712
