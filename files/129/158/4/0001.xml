MINISTRY OF DEFENCE ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIESCHAPTER 1INTRODUCTION1. We were appointed on 19 December 1968 by the Prime Minister and minister for the Civil Service with the following terms of reference &quot; To examine whether the existing organisation and systems of control and accountability oflarge-scale establishments in the Ministries of Defence and Technology, engagedin production, offer impediments to the achievement of full efficiency and torecommend how such impediments should be removed.&quot;2. The principal establishments falling within our terms of reference werethe eleven Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs) operated by the Ministry ofDefence (MOD), the two ROFs operated by the Ministry of Technology * and thefour Royal Dockyards in the United Kingdom and the Dockyard at Gibraltaroperated by the Ministry of Defence. There was also a small factory makinggauges for the Chief Inspector of Naval Ordnance.3. Service establishments such as the Royal Naval Aircraft Yards, RoyalElectrical and Mechanical Engineers, and other, Workshops and Royal AirForce Maintenance Units were excluded on the ground that their prime purpose was repair, not production. Also excluded were the research and development establishments of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Technology.4. We were told that organisational changes under discussion might affectthe two ROFs operated by the Ministry of Technology so we postponed con-sideration of their problems and began our enquiries in the MOD ROFs and theRoyal Dockyards. We soon learned, too, that important changes in the topstructure of the organisation in the Ministry of Defence concerned with theoperation of the dockyards and the support of the Fleet were in prospect. the changes included the appointment, in September 1969, of a Chief Executive ofthe Dockyards. We decided, therefore, after visiting the four dockyards inthis country, to allow time for the Chief Executive to &quot; work himself in &quot; beforeexamining the problems of the dockyards in depth. This arrangement wouldenable us to profit from the various studies in progress in MOD into the structure and the responsibilities of the dockyards, including the problems of management accountability.5. This first, interim, report is, therefore, concerned only with the Ministryof Defence Royal Ordnance Factories.* As a result of machinery of Government changes the Ministry of Technology ROFs becamepart of the Ministry of Defence on 1st May, 1971. (Ministers of the Crown, the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry Order 1970 (SI 1970 No 1537) and the Ministry of AviationSupply (Dissolution) Order 1971 (SI 1971 No 719) relate.)
SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND recommendations. We found the MOD ROFs were well managed and controlled and therewas clear evidence of cost consciousness and systematic cost control. We were impressed by the calibre of the management staff and found them stronglymotivated by loyalty to the organisation and the Armed Forces in the achieve-ment of a high quality, reliable and safe product.7.  We found they were operating under some constraints which derivedfrom the financial and staffing systems imposed on them by their place in theMOD and the Civil Service framework and, to a lesser degree, some which are inherent in any multi-unit organisation. We were initially attracted to the idea ofhiving the ROFs off from the MOD, on the lines suggested by the FultonCommittee, * but as we came to understand the nature of the ROFs&apos; task and the underlying reasons for the financial and organisational relationships betweenthem and the MOD, we gradually came to accept that hiving off was not feasiblefor this Organisation. Indeed we were inclined to believe that had we been askedto advise on setting up an organisation &quot; to satisfy the munitions requirements ofthe Services and undertake approved work of a defence nature for Common-wealth and other friendly governments &quot; we would probably have recommendedsomething very like the present arrangement.8.  We can summarise our reasons very briefly as follows:(1) As suppliers of munitions to the Armed Forces, the ROFs cannotrefuse an order, cannot determine the design of their product and cannot determine its quality.(2) Approval by the Government of overseas orders for ROF products isnecessary because of the nature of the product.(3) The ROFs provide the main national reserve of capacity for a sub-stantial range of munitions to meet foreseeable or unforeseen emer-gencies.These are constraints which would remain even for a hived off ROF Organi-sation and they are the main constraints which affect the commercial judgmentsof the ROFs. In addition, experience indicates that hiving off would do little toremove constraints due to the effect of the Civil Service staffing system. Controlsoperating while the ROFs remain in the Civil Service would have to be replaced by constraints which had much the same effect. But we think that it would be advantageous for the ROFs to be given a financial structure more like that of acommercial undertaking or a public corporation.9. It could be argued that they have already gone a long way towardsestablishing a commercial accounting system and that little more need be done*The Civil Service. Report of the Committee 1966-68. Chairman: Lord Fulton. Command3638.
except to require the ROFs to make provision in their prices for interest on capital employed and to set them a target of achievement in the form of anotional return on notional capital employed. And we note that it is the intentionto charge interest on capital from a date to be decided.*10. However, we are convinced that there are real benefits to be gained from moving away from the restrictions of Vote financing, buttressed up by asystem of notional Operating Accounts, towards the reality of a Trading Fund.The ROFs will be able to demonstrate their professional ability more readily ifthey are made responsible for managing their capital assets instead of operating on the basis of annual Votes. ROFs and MOD alike will be able to make betterinformed decisions in relation to the provision of capacity and the purchase ofmunitions and, in addition, the true resource costs of operating the ROFs will be demonstrated.11. For the rest, we recommend changes in relationships between the ROFOrganisation and the Ministry of Public Building and Works (MPBW)t and the stationery Office (HMSO) and between the ROFs and the personnel and labourbranches of the MOD civilian management organisation. These changes are designed to give the ROF management more positive control over the disposalof the resources allocated to them. During the course of our enquiry the MODincreased the ROFs&apos; delegated authority for the purchase of materials and disposal of scrap in order to mitigate some other constraints.12.  Our principal conclusions and recommendations are:(1) The constraints inherent in the nature of the ROFs and the nature oftheir principal customer would not be removed by hiving off.(Paragraph 118 et seq.)(2) The significant advantage of hiving off such a body as the ROF Organi-sation would be the change which could be made in the method of financing. However, this advantage could equally well be obtained in another way, namely, through a Trading Fund. We therefore recom-mend that the ROFs should remain under direct Ministerial control, aspart of the MOD, but that they should cease to be financed by Vote and,instead, should have their own Trading Fund.(Paragraph 135 et seq.)(3) The full benefits of a Trading Fund would not be obtained unless theROFs were given maximum possible discretion over the disposal of theresources allocated to them.(Paragraph 168 et seq.)(4) The Controller, Royal Ordnance Factories (CROF) should be recognised as the accountable manager and the dichotomy of financial and technicalcontrol should be eliminated.(Paragraph 144 et seq.)13. We have gone on to make further recommendations designed to securethe maximum benefit in the implementation of our major recommendation.*Defence Accounts 1968/69 Royal Ordnance Factories. Notes on the Operating account and Balance Sheet. Note 6 page 99.fThe MPBW became part of the Department of the Environment on 12 November 1970.(Ministers of the Crown The Secretary of State for the Environment Order 1970 SI 1970 No.1681.)
These are:(1) As the accountable manager, CROF should be given the maximum possible delegated authority in:(a) purchase and disposal of materials(b) personnel management and industrial relations(c) control of building and civil engineering new works and maintenance.(2) The principles of accountable management should extend throughoutthe ROF Organisation and a sense of financial responsibility should beinculcated in managers at all levels. Managers should be held fully-   responsible for the financial implications of their decisions.(3) The distribution of functions between ROF Headquarters and the factories should be reviewed with a view to concentrating authority atthe points where decisions need to be taken.(4) The management training programme should be reviewed to ensurethat managers are equipped to undertake the responsibilities implicit inthe new approach to management.(Paragraph 144 et seq.)
THE APPROACH TO THE TASK14. As a first step, we invited the MOD to provide us with brief factualstatements on the establishments under enquiry. We next had a general dis-cussion with the Controller, Royal Ordnance Factories (CROF) and hissupporting staff, the Master-General of the Ordnance (MGO), to whom CROFis responsible, and the Permanent Under Secretary of State for Equipment(PUS(E)), who is the Accounting Officer for the ROF Vote.15. We thought that we could gain a better understanding of the complexities of the MOD organisation and of the impact on ROF efficiency of the relation-ships between ROFs and other parts of the Ministry and other GovernmentDepartments by starting our enquiry at the factories. Our purpose was to learnhow they were operated and managed and what the managers, themselves,thought impeded them from achieving full efficiency.16. We considered whether we should employ consultants to do any part ofour fact finding but concluded that any consultancy work would be additional to and not a substitute for direct enquiries by the Committee. The MODthemselves had commissioned a management audit at ROF Birtley and offered to make the report available to us. We thought it best, therefore, to await thisreport before finally deciding whether we needed further help from consultants.In the event, we concluded that we did not.17. Between February and June 1969, each factory was visited by a group ofCommittee members. The visits to factories are described briefly in Chapter 5and the detailed analysis of the data collected is appended to this Report. Wefollowed up leads from the visits to factories by inviting MOD, and otherdepartments, to submit papers or nominate representatives to discuss with us the areas where impediments to efficiency were thought to exist. At Appendix Ais a list of papers which have been produced at our request and at Appendix Ba list of departmental representatives who have attended our meetings. Repre-sentatives of the Ministry of Defence Whitley Council Staff Side and of theTrade Union Side of the Army Department Industrial Whitley Council havealso attended meetings of the Committee (see Appendix C) and the former have submitted papers.18. Our task has been rendered significantly easier than we had anticipatedit would be by the admirable manner in which we have been served by our joint secretaries, Miss Joan Davison and Mr. B. C. G. Pearce. They have beenassisted by Mr. F. G. Dufty and Mr. D. W. Maitland. We are sensible that thework we have thrown upon their shoulders must have involved a heavy oftenan excessive load. Nevertheless our calls upon them have been met promptlyand cheerfully, and for their help we are indeed grateful.)
MOD ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIES IN 196919. The Royal Ordnance Factories operate as part of the Ministry ofDefence within the Civil Service structure. There are two features of thatstructure which have an important impact on the operation of the ROFs; thefinancial system and the staffing system. These are described respectively in thefirst and second parts of this Chapter. The rest of the Chapter describes the task and organisation of the ROFs and the way in which they operate against the background of the Civil Service system.THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM20. The activities of Government departments are financed by moneys Votedby Parliament and a designated Accounting Officer (usually the permanent secretary of the department concerned) accounts to Parliament for the money soVoted by submitting an Appropriation Account.21. The Accounting Officer is supported by a specialist finance branch(or branches) who build up the department^ Vote Estimate(s) on the basis offorecasts of expenditure produced by the operating divisions and branches;monitor the cash flow; prepare periodical statements of outturn for submission to the Treasury; and prepare the annual Vote accounts. Where there are severalbranches with delegated financial authority, or several Votes, there is usually a central branch which consolidates the annual Appropriation Account.22. Estimates are first approved by the Treasury or the Civil service department (CSD), as appropriate, before they are presented to Parliament bythe Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and accounts, in a form prescribed by theTreasury, are&apos;audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and submitted tothe Treasury to be presented to Parliament.23. The departmental finance branch (or branches) operate a system offinancial control which requires that commitments must not be incurred unlessVote provision has been made. Departments have general approval for ex-penditure on continuing services but new and unusual commitments requirespecific approval and capital expenditure is subject to specific approval by theTreasury, above whatever level of authority they have delegated to the depart-ment.24. Among the nine Votes for the Ministry of Defence, there is a separateone for the ROFs. This is one of the Votes for which the Permanent UnderSecretary of State for Equipment (PUS(E)) is the Accounting Officer. Althoughit covers the major part of the Organisation^ activities, the ROF Vote is notcomprehensive. It excludes, for example, expenditure met on the Organisation^behalf from the Votes of the Ministry of Public Building and Works and the
Stationery Office. The Estimate for 1970/71f showed expenditure against twosubheads, one for current expenditure on salaries, wages, materials and the like,another for capital expenditure on plant, machinery etc. This is offset by receipts from customers, the result being expressed as a net Vote. If either the gross orthe net Vote is exceeded, a Supplementary Estimate will be needed, or an ExcessVote if the additional expenditure was not foreseen in time. Receipts during theyear in excess of the amount approved by Parliament are paid to the Consoli-dated Fund. Savings in the net Vote are also surrendered to the consolidate fund at the end of the financial year.25. Although, as stated above, the expenditure of the factories for certain services is not included in the ROF Vote, it is fully reflected in ROF Accounts.Similarly the accounts include, as notional credits, sums in respect of regional employment Premiums, Investment Grants etc. which are available to private industry. An Estimated Operating Account is published with the annual VoteEstimate and an Operating Account and Balance Sheet are made available withthe Annual Appropriation Account.26. The current system of financial control means that the ROF Organi-sation has to seek Treasury approval for schemes involving investment in factoryplant estimated to cost over  50,000* and the MPBW has to seek treasury approval for building and works services it proposes to undertake for the ROFOrganisation if the estimated cost is expected to exceed  200,000.27. Government purchasing procedure is largely influenced by the financialsystem and the need for ensuring propriety in expenditure of Governmentfunds. It is, therefore, usually a specialist function and purchasing powers aresparingly delegated within Departments.28. Because the ROF has a separate Vote, it has been possible to incorporate the finance function in the Organisation but special arrangements are made tosafeguard the Accounting Officers control. The Director-General of DefenceContracts (DGDQ has delegated authority to the Organisation to makepurchases up to  5,000 in value. The arrangements are described later in this chapter.THE STAFFING SYSTEM29. There are two distinct systems, one for &quot; industrial &quot; and the other for&quot; non-industrial&quot; Civil Servants. Broadly speaking, the industrials are the manual workers on the shop floor, including charge hands and maintenanceworkers and (in the ROFs) some other ancillary grades such as messengers anddrivers.30. The non-industrials are the professional and technical staffs who super-vise the industrials and manage the factories, the factory directors and head-quarters staff and the administrative, executive and clerical staff who provideoffice support and perform the personnel, finance and accounting functions.31. In some respects, conditions are the same for industrials and non-industrials (e.g. superannuation and travel and subsistence allowances); in others, they are slightly different (e.g. sick leave). A much smaller proportiontSupply Estimates 1970/71. Class XII Defence. Vote 8 Royal Ordnance Factories (pagesxii 26 and xii 27). Appendix ix (pages xii 84 and xii 85). Appendix x (page xii 86)*We understand that the ROF Organisation has been invited by the Treasury to suggest ahigher figure.
of the industrial labour force is permanent and pensionable. The permanent andpensionable staff are those who are &quot; established &quot;. Industrials are normallyestablished on departmental nomination solely by seniority after a period ofunestablished service. Non-industrials can be appointed as established civilservants from the outset through competitions conducted by the Civil service commission or they can enter as temporaries and become established latereither by competition or by nomination.32. Industrials are represented by the Trade Unions which operate in industry generally, such as the Amalgamated Union of Engineering and FoundryWorkers, the Transport and General Workers Union and the General and municipal Workers Union. The industrials have their own Whitley negotiating machinery at all levels. Non-industrials are represented by Civil Service staff associations belonging to the National Staff Side of the National whitley council and also have their own Whitley machinery.33. If established industrial or non-industrial staff resign voluntarily before reaching the age of 50, they forfeit their pension entitlement. On voluntaryretirement after that age, their pension entitlement is frozen and pensionbecomes payable at the age of 60. Unestablished staff are entitled to gratuities onresignation after a minimum of five years continuous service.34. Established staff have an obligation to serve anywhere within prescribedareas, (usually the UK) so it is usually possible to find alternative employmentwithin the Civil Service for established staff who become redundant. If suchstaff refuse alternative employment, unless they have reached age 50 and electto retire voluntarily, they forfeit their pension entitlement and, as the scheme isnon-contributory, there is no refund of contributions. However, in the event of closure of an establishment, established industrial staff (and non-industrialsbelow the level of executive officer) who cannot be found suitable alternative employment within a reasonable travelling distance from their home are allowed the option of leaving the Civil Service with a terminal grant. Thisterminal grant is the equivalent of the lump sum element of the allowance theymight be granted under the Superannuation Acts by way of compensation for loss of office but no pension payments are included under the terminal grantscheme. Payments under that scheme attract rebate from the redundancy payments Fund.35. The main features of these two systems of personnel management as theyaffect the ROF Organisation are:(1) Industrial Pay. Basic time rates for all industrial grades throughout theCivil Service and certain other items of pay of general application (e.g.charge pay) are negotiated centrally on the Joint Co-ordinating Com-mittee for Government Industrial Establishments (the JCC). (The prin-ciples for determining industrial pay have recently been the subject of areport by the National Board for Prices and Incomes*). Other features,e.g. the grading of jobs within the pay structure and shift allowances arenegotiated on the Engineering Trades Joint Council for all industrials inestablishments classified as &quot; engineering &quot;. Piecework prices are ne-gotiated at factory level.*The MBPI Report No. 146 Pay and Conditions of Industrial Civil Servants. Command4351 (April 1970).
(2) Non-industrial pay. Pay for non-industrial staff is negotiated by theCivil Service Department with individual Staff Associations repre-senting classes or grades employed throughout the Civil Service (thegeneral service grades or classes). For example, the rates of pay forclerical staff are negotiated with the Civil and Public Services Association,for executive staff with the Society of Civil Servants and for the pro-fessional staffs with the Institution of Professional Civil Servants. pay of the main non-industrial, general service, classes is determined on thebasis of a regular pay research programme involving comparisons with pay in outside employment analogous to the generality of civil servants in these classes. (The pay of most other non-industrial grades is determined by pay links with other Civil Service grades of comparableresponsibility.) In practice, pay rates so determined are supplementedfrom time to time by central pay settlements. Pay for grades and classesof staff employed in a limited number of departments is determined by reference to the rates agreed for general service classes but is normallynegotiated by the employing department(s) with the Staff Associationconcerned. Agreements reached are subject to CSD approval.(3) Pay (general), (a) Whereas women and men have equal pay for equalwork in the non-industrial civil service, this does not yet apply in theindustrial civil service.(b) There is no departmental discretion to vary nation-ally agreed rates for either industrials or non-industrials.(4) Other conditions of service. These are similarly negotiated centrally bythe CSD through the two Whitley systems and apply throughout theGovernment service and cannot be varied at departmental discretion.(5) Grading, (a) For industrials there are at present two grades of craftsmenand a series of pay-bands (grades) for semi-skilled and unskilled workersdrawn up on the basis of central discussions.(b) The grading of non-industrial posts is governed by guidanceissued by the Civil Service Department and for more senior posts is directly controlled by that Department.(6) Complements. The Civil Service Department operates a system of manpower control for non-industrials and overall ceilings are fixedannually for the MOD as a whole. The CSD also authorises the creationof individual posts in grades with salary scales extending above approxi-mately  3,900. For industrials a somewhat looser form of control is exercised through the Estimates procedure.36. Although civil servants, industrial and non-industrial, can be appointed in an established capacity only with the concurrence of the Civil Service Com-mission, they are effectively the employees of the department in which they are serving. The employing department is responsible for career development,promotion, discipline and termination of service. The CSD, however, playssome part in co-ordination of career planning and selections for appointment atthe more senior levels.37. Each department has a Principal Establishment Officer who is responsible to the Permanent Under Secretary for the efficient organisation and manning ofthe Department. In the MOD the personnel function is divided between&quot;establishment&quot; branches concerned with non-industrials and &quot;labour&quot;
43. The role of the ROF Organisation, therefore, is reactive rather thaninnovative. Unlike manufacturers in the private sector, the Organisation is notfree to design and develop products which, in its judgement, will find a profitablemarket. In the main it has to organise and equip itself to respond to demands forproducts which have been designed elsewhere and which must be manufacturedto very precise specifications. And it has to provide the main reserve of capacity to meet possible emergencies.44. In 1968/9, export orders represented about fifteen per cent by value ofROF total sales. The larger orders are negotiated by the Defence Sales Organi-sation but the ROFs secure some export orders on their own initiative. To helpmaintain essential defence capacity not fully used the ROFs are permitted alsoto take on work (referred to as &quot; civil work &quot;) for non-Defence Governmentdepartments, the nationalised industries and private industry. In 1968/9 theROFs, by their own efforts, secured civil orders worth  1-5 million.THE ROF ORGANISATION45. The ROF Organisation, consisting of seven engineering factories, twoammunition filling factories and two explosives factories, is headed by a Con-troller (CROF) responsible (to the Master-General of the Ordnance) for theoperation and performance of the eleven active factories. There is also onefactory under care and maintenance. The staff numbered about 16,300 industrial and 4,000 non-industrial civil servants and the factories produced about  43million of sales and services in 1968/9. Details are given in Appendix D.46. CROF is assisted at Headquarters (ROF HQ) by two deputy controllers,(DCROF 1 and 2) who are concerned with technical aspects of direction and support of the factories and two directors (DOF (A and F) and DOF (Accts.))who are concerned with administrative and finance aspects. The latter areresponsible for the preparation of Estimates, the exercise of delegated authorities for authorisation of expenditure and the preparation of management andAppropriation Accounts. On the financial and Vote accounting aspects of their work they are responsible to the Assistant Under Secretary of State for Equip-ment (AUS(E)AD) who heads the Equipment Secretariat branches and whoseline of command goes up to PUS(E) as the Accounting Officer for the ROF Vote.On the rest of their work they report to CROF.47. The principal functions of ROF HQ are to decide and direct manu-facturing policy and to monitor achievement. The more important day-to-daymatters such as major production orders and major items of capital expenditure and certain general aspects (such as the forward planning of capacity) and thosewhich require a common policy and direction (such as Vote financing, pricing,accounting, staff and labour, training and safety), are dealt with by HQ. TheHQ staff (numbering about 190) include professional and technical staff whospecialise in the affairs of individual factories, or according to their professionaldisciplines e.g. chemistry, metallurgy, or according to subject e.g. safety; andadministrative and executive staff who specialise according to function, e.g.personnel and labour management, finance, accounts, etc.48.  Examples of the kind of decisions reserved to ROF HQ are:(1) Personnel decisions: determining the complement of non-industrial staffin lower grades and approving forecasts made by factory directors of the-b11
numbers of industrials required to meet the manufacturing programme;approving schemes for redundancies involving more than 25 industrialsidcJBo-^^ii-s^jr-^/iftfWWiwsmnIM&apos;  qctlwMfr(2) Finance decisions: authorising any quotations at less than full estimatedcost; authorising advance purchase of materials or production in anticipation of firm production orders; authorising purchase of smalloffice machines (or submitting approved demands to MOD office services Division); approving factory plant and works services capitalschemes estimated to cost more than  10,000. (Such approvals are subject to formal procedures which, in some cases, involve reference tothe ROF Headquarters Board and to the ROF Board. The Boards are described later in this Chapter.)49. ROF HQ keep in touch with the factories through a system of factoryboards. For each factory there is a Board, under the chairmanship of theDCROF concerned, comprising DOF (A and F), DOF (Accts.) and the FactoryDirector and Factory Secretary.50. The quarterly meetings of the factory boards serve several purposes.First, they provide a regular channel of communication between HQ and thefactory through which DCROF, DOF (A and F) and DOF (Accts.) can putforward and explain MOD and ROF HQ policy and the factory director candiscuss his problems and enlist HQ aid in solving them, particularly those which involve other divisions and directorates of MOD. Secondly, they provideopportunity for senior officers from the finance side as well as the technical sideof HQ to review progress on the basis of a detailed report submitted to theBoard by the factory director and the management accounts and statisticsprepared by the factory secretary and factory accountant. Thirdly, they providethe setting for joint factory and HQ decisions on factory plant and works services capital schemes up to an estimated cost of  50,000. Formal HQ approvalfollows the Factory Board approval of proposals for plant in this price bracket.Perhaps the greatest value of the factory boards is that they reinforce thefinancial authority of the factory secretary who is the representative at factorylevel of DOF (A and F), and through him of the Accounting Officer, as well asbeing a member of the factory directors staff.51. The need to associate PUS(E)&apos;s staff with financial decisions is also the underlying justification for the ROF Headquarters Board, which is chaired byGROF and includes the two Deputy Controllers, DOF (A and F), DOF (Accts.)and AUS(E)AD. The meetings of the HQ Board enable CROF with all hissenior staff to review progress at all the factories (on the basis of the reports from the series of factory board meetings) in conjunction with AUS(E)AD(representing the Accounting Officer) who is not in the line of command fromfactories through CROF to MGO. The approval of the ROF HQ Board isrequired for proposals for capital expenditure on plant or works servicesestimated to cost from  50,000 to  100,000.52.; The Master-General of the Ordnance, in discharging his responsibilities for the operation and efficiency of the ROF Organisation, is helped by anotherBoard, known as the ROF Board. This Board, under MGO as Chairman,consists of official and private members. The private members, one of whom isthe Vice-Chairman, are men of standing whose experience and knowledgeenable them to contribute to the running of industrial organisations. The official
members are: a representative of the Ministry of Technology, the MOD Deputy:Under-Secretary (Equipment) (DUS(E)), CROF, AUS(E)AD and DOF (A and). The MOD representation brings together the financial, technical and customerinterests and, with the non-MOD membership, the Board provides a forum fordiscussion of general matters of policy and performance and for the developmentof a collective view. The role of the Board is primarily advisory and it is expectedto ensure that ROF policy and production planning are co-ordinated with defence planning as a whole and that in the formulation of the latter the best use is made of the capacity and facilities offered by the ROFs. The ROF Boardformally approves schemes for capital projects estimated to cost over  100,000.53. Although the Board is expected to review progress and achievement, itis not intended to derogate from the responsibility of MGO, and under himCROF, for the efficient operation of the factories nor from the financial re-responsabilities of DUS(E) and, under him, AUS(E)AD and DOF (A and F). It islinked with the HQ Board by common membership: CROF chairs the HQBoard and AUS(E)AD and DOF (A and F) are members.factory directors54. The executive responsibility for implementing ROF policy and obtainingresults is vested substantially in the factory directors. They operate under HQguidance and with HQ support. They are fully responsible for planning and controlling the production processes of their factories, for programmingproduction, achieving delivery requirements and producing a product to meetthe specification and, of course, for discipline and safety in the factory.55,  Their delegated financial powers enable them to:(1) authorise schemes for the purchase of factory plant and to approveschemes for works services up to an estimated cost of  10,000 (without reference to HQ but subject, of course, to the availability of Votedfunds);(2) purchase plant and materials up to a value of  5,000 for any one order;(3) arrange disposal of surplus and obsolete plant and scrap materials up to 3,000 in any one sale;(4) enter into agreements for the supply of electricity, gas and water.56. In personnel management and industrial relations, the factory directorshave powers to:(1) recruit industrial workers up to the number required to meet theirforward programme, after approval of their labour forecast;(2) declare redundancies not exceeding 25 employees and discharge un-established industrials on disciplinary grounds (Employees so dis-charged have a right of appeal to the MOD &quot;labour&quot; branchconcerned.);(3) negotiate piecework prices having regard to the nationally agreedpiecework basis (Piecework, incentive bonus or other forms of payment by results are in operation in the engineering and filling factories.These schemes cover production workers and associated workers suchas maintenance men, markers out, crane drivers, slingers, stokers, etc.);(4) vary the grading of unskilled and semi-skilled industrials, within thecentrally negotiated pay-band structure;
(5) recruit non-industrial professional and technical staff in the basicgrades and junior clerical staff.In addition, they have some discretionary powers in respect of trainingmatters and disciplinary penalties as laid down in MOD Civilian Staff Regu-lations and Regulations for Industrial Employees.57. Factory directors determine the price to be quoted against orders placed with them by the Production branches, submit quotations in response to invita-tions to tender issued by the Directorate-General of Defence Contracts and to civil customers in the UK (up to a limit of  20,000 on any order) and overseascustomers (up to a limit of  25,000 on any order). But major new orders, and orders for items of political or military importance, must be referred to ROF HQ.Factory directors&apos; negotiations for orders from overseas customers requireclearance from the Defence Sales Organisation. Quotations for civil work and export orders above the limits of value indicated are submitted through ROF HQas are any cases where the factory director proposes that an order should beaccepted below the full economic price.58. Factory directors have authority to seek civil work needed to keep in being labour and management required for Defence purposes but which istemporarily in excess of the requirements of Defence work in hand.59. The factory administration staff, under the factory secretary and factoryaccountant, carry out the personnel, finance (including purchasing) and accountswork. They prepare the management accounts and statistics and the VoteEstimates and Accounts which are submitted through the factory director to theHQ directors. The finance, contracts and establishment procedures are laiddown in MOD codes of practice and promulgated by ROF HQ.60. On all routine matters, and matters within their delegated powers, the factories communicate direct with the MOD divisions and directorates concerned and go through ROF HQ only on those matters that are reserved to HQ or wheretJLJLV J   Cti C xxx uijlLlwuiixuo.61. Within limits, they also deal directly with MPBW on whom they dependfor provision and maintenance of factory buildings and with HMSO who providetheir requirements of stationery, books and office machinery. The relationships with these common service departments are described below.RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMON SERVICE DEPARTMENTS62. Expenditure on ROF buildings forms part of the Defence budget but thecost of provision of such buildings and their maintenance falls on an MPBWVote and not on the Ministry of Defence ROF Vote. Once completed, thebuildings vest in the Ministry of Defence and become part of the Ministry ofDefence estate.63. MPBW are responsible for submitting and getting approval of their annual Vote Estimates (which they do in consultation with the ROF Organisa-tion) and also for justifying the work done and securing value for money in its execution. This is what is known as an &quot; allied service &quot; arrangement and no payment passes between MOD and MPBW Votes. Allied services are availableto Government departments and also to certain other bodies that derive their income substantially from moneys Voted by Parliament. For bodies that derivea substantial proportion of their revenue from sources other than Voted moneys,
the common service departments provide services as agents. This means that the customer department takes responsibility for justifying the work commissionedand meets the cost. The common service department is responsible for gettingvalue for money in the execution of whatever work it undertakes on this basis and, as a contribution to its own administrative costs, adds a departmentalcharge to the cost of the work. This is known as an &quot; agency service &quot; arrange-ment.64. So that the full cost of the work done by MPBW for the ROFs is reflected in the ROF Operating Account and job costing system, notional entries are madefor the cost of the work done by MPBW and a departmental charge based onthe MPBW scale of charges to its &quot; agency &quot; customers.65. By arrangement between the two Departments, the ROFs undertaketheir own electrical and mechanical engineering maintenance since these functionsaffect the production process more closely than do the building and civil engin-eering works services.66. The requirements for specific authorisation of expenditure on works services involve the Treasury as well as MPBW and MOD as follows: MPBWitself may approve schemes up to a value of  200,000; schemes of higher valuemust be submitted (by MPBW) to the Treasury for prior financial approval.Within the MPBW the level of delegation of authority to approve schemes atregional level is limited to  20,000 with lower limits at the subordinate area anddepot levels. The parallel arrangements in the ROF organisation for authorisation-tion of works services have already been described in paragraphs 45 to 61.67. The factory directors and their staff are in close contact with the MPBWarea officers and local MPBW depot staff. In some cases the MPBW depot ison the factory site. Demands for day-to-day maintenance are made by juniorfactory staff. The MPBW area officers and senior factory staff discuss the timing and extent of major maintenance work with the factory directors. The finaldecision on the extent of maintenance, however, rests with MPBW who endeavour-vour to respect the directors&apos; requirements as to timing.68. Supplies of stationery, books and office equipment from HMSO are obtained onasimilar allied service basis. Specific approval of the ROFs&apos; demands,however, is required only for certain small office machines and there is ananomaly in that certain machines, e.g. desk calculators, required for use in con-nection with the production processes are purchased as minor items of plant andequipment (the cost being borne on the ROF Vote) whereas similar machinesrequired for office use must be obtained through HMSO in the same way asoffice stationery and the cost falls on the HMSO Vote. HMSO as the supplier,exercises control of expenditure (requiring a justification of the need for the more expensive items) and, in addition, there are departmental controls over certain items of equipment which require demands to be submitted through MOD.THE OVERALL PICTURE69. To sum up, although the ROF organisation is a clearly defined entitywhich has a distinct task to perform and a separate Vote, it is firmly embeddedin the MOD and the Civil Service structure. We thought it probable that therfore management might find these close ties restrictive and we, therefore,visited the factories in order to learn how they operated within the framework wehave described in this Chapter.
VISITS TO MOD ROFs70. For the purpose of visiting each of the ROFs, the Committee split intogroups of three. Each group included one Civil Service member and was accom-panied by one of the secretaries. The main purpose of the visits was to see whatthe factories did and how they did it. We also wished to discover the views of management at all levels on the problems they considered they had to meet in doing their respective jobs. It was never part of our intention, while making these visits, to make our own detailed or quantitative assessment of the efficiency of the factories.71. At each factory the visit extended over a full working day and startedwith a discussion between the Committee Members, the Director, and the senior management staff (a group of 5 or 6 people) covering all aspects of thefactory&apos;s activities. In all, we saw 90 members of senior management (directors,assistant directors, factory secretaries, and heads of departments). During theday other management staff were seen in groups covering different levels of management across the board, except at one factory, where they were groupedaccording to the divisions in which they were employed. At each level of manage-ment the groups included members of the administration staff. In all, we saw70 members of middle management (assistant managers and equivalent grades)and 150 junior managers (shop managers, foremen, assistant foremen, etc.).The length of time devoted to discussions varied considerably. In general wespent longer with senior management than with the managers at the other levels,but we were not consistent in the allocation of our time from factory to factory.72. In all our discussions we tended to concentrate on the simple theme ofwhat those present saw as the impediments to the achievement of full efficiency.We allowed discussion to develop naturally so the way in which it developedvaried from factory to factory. For example, some of us pursued particularaspects in depth throughout and this imposed something like a consistent themeupon the day&apos;s discussion. On the other hand, if time was pressing, a point might simply have been noted as reinforcing comment made elsewhere. although in all our interviews we were careful to emphasise, at the outset, that we wereinvestigating impediments arising because of the system of control and account-ability, it was noticeable that when the interviews were with middle and lower levels of management the comments made to us tended to refer to variousmanagement factors not directly related to those systems.73. The answers varied greatly in their degree of depth. At one end therewere specific statements such as &quot; The local purchase limit of  1,500 is too low &quot;and &quot; The Navy and the Army produce marginally different specifications foridentical products &quot;, while at the other end there were generalisations such as&quot; Low wages make the recruiting of good industrials difficult &quot; and &quot; The time taken by the Director of Contracts is excessive &quot;.
74. All the discussion sessions were recorded in full and the record agreed with the factory management. The data collected have an intrinsic value since they indicate what the staff believe to be impediments to efficiency even if itcould be demonstrated on further enquiry that these beliefs were unfounded.About 5 % could not be processed but the rest (just over 570 comments) couldT)e attributed to features of the present system as follows:(1) Those imposed by reason of the place ofthe ROFs in the Government machine 327 comments (57 %)(2) Those consequent on the &quot; customers &quot;requirements 87 comments (15%)(3) Those stemming from procedural require-ments and methods of MOD 121 comments (21 %)There was a fourth category (38 comments 7%) comprising those which in theCommittee&apos;s view, were attributable to local management practice.75. In order to assess the relative importance of the impediments in the minds of those interviewed, we asked that they should list the three (but notmore than three) impediments which, after more reflection, they regarded aspresenting the greatest hindrance. This was of assistance to us in reviewing the data. The detailed analysis of the data was undertaken by a panel of three members of the Committee and forms Appendix E of this Report.76. This part of the enquiry enabled us to experience the climate of manage-ment at factory level and provided the background against which we formed ourown view of the situation which we set out in the next Chapter.
THE COMMITTEES VIEW OF THE SITUATION77. We think it right, first, to record certain general impressions we formedafter our talks with the factory directors and management staff and then to offerour detailed comments on the information we obtained from the 11 factories,ROF HQ, and other MOD directorates and divisions.78.  The main features which prompt general comment are:(1) The degree of identification with the Armed Forces apparent in all the factories. This identification provided a strong motivation towards themanufacture of a high quality, reliable and safe product.(2) The evidence of cost consciousness and systematic cost control. Thiswas reflected in the management accounting and costing system and showed signs of having been further encouraged by the relatively recentintroduction of a system of &quot; fixed price &quot; quotations with the built-inincentive to economical operation which a target price provides.(3) The calibre of the management staff generally; the ability of the morejunior managers (foremen and assistant foremen) to express theirviews and the freedom with which they did so. They were articulate toa degree not often found in industry.79. Those of us who have spent our careers in industry and who, between us, have covered all aspects of industrial management felt that the factorieswere well managed and controlled. Our view was endorsed by our specialistcolleagues from the academic and staff association world. (Our Civil Servicecolleagues, as &quot; interested parties &quot;, left us to make this broad assessmentindependently.) That is not to say that ROF management and operations sufferno constraint. Some constraints on local management are inevitable in anymulti-unit organisation but the comments made by factory management staffindicated that they believed themselves to be hampered by more than the normalconstraints.80. Among other things, they criticised the financial restrictions on pur-chasing and disposal of materials and the arrangements for the supply of somecomponents. They considered central controls in the personnel field irksome ifnot restrictive and felt that there should be greater freedom to modify paystructures to meet their particular circumstances. In addition, the exercise ofcentralised functions by the Production branches seemed to them less helpfulthan they would have hoped and the requirement to use the services of theMinistry of Public Building and Works created problems. Some of their com-plaints pointed to conditions that arose from the place of the ROF organisation in the Civil Service environment rather than its place in the MOD.81. We sought to identify the real restraints on the freedom of managers totake sensible management decisions. In particular, we looked at the overall
context in which the ROFs operated and tried to establish what constraintswere imposed by the Civil Service structure and by the present requirements ofpublic accountability. Our findings form the first part of this Chapter.82. We were conscious, too, that our general assessment of the factorieshad to be subjective. Under the present arrangements there is no simple meansof measuring efficiency objectively. The management can only assess andmeasure performance of the ROFs by means of an adequate managementinformation and control system. We have, therefore, looked at the managementinformation and control system in some detail. Our particular concern was toestablish whether the flow of information was such as to provide a sound basis for management decision making. We set out our views on this in the second part of this Chapter.FREEDOM OF DECISION MAKING83.  The directors of the Royal Ordnance Factories derive their authority from the Controller, ROFs who, as we have noted earlier, is responsible for the efficient management and operation of the factories.84. The Controller, in turn, derives authority to exercise certain functions which are vested in other parts of the Ministry of Defence, e.g. purchasing, sales,personnel management, from the directorate concerned. The finance and accounts function is exercised within the CROF&apos;s organisation but by staff whohave a responsibility also to AUS(E)AD through DOF (A and F) and DOF(Accts.).85. For the most part the delegated authorities have been handed down tothe factory directors; for example there is now no HQ purchasing section but some work is done at ROF HQ on behalf of civilian management branches (e.g.arranging promotion boards). In the following paragraphs we discuss the effectof major constraints on the factory directors&apos; abilities to control the use of their resources of materials and manpower.constraints on the purchase and disposal of materials86. During the course of our enquiry, the level of delegated authority topurchase materials has been raised from  1,500 to  5,000. This means that the factories will be able to effect nearly all of their own purchases. The remainingorders, about 400 a year to a value of approximately  8Jm, which would haveto be placed by the Director-General of Defence Contracts (DGDC) would befor the more expensive materials and for factory plant. It might be argued thatthe degree of irritation apparent at factory level points to the desirability oftotal delegation of the purchasing function. In order to provide a firm basis fora recommendation on this matter we examined a selection of cases. It seemed that DGDC sometimes acted as a long stop for the ROFs where inadequateinformation had been supplied with requisitions. More important, DGDCcontributed expert knowledge in negotiating the acceptance of appropriateconditions of contract; arranging purchases involving foreign exchange; and timing purchases to take advantage of favourable market conditions. If the function were to be fully delegated, this expertise would have to be providedwithin the ROF Organisation at a possible increase in staff cost.87. On the other hand, the contracts process was lengthy enough to causedelay which could have affected the production programme. Serious delaysie-c19
could outweigh the cost advantages of using the DGDCs organisation. However,we think that, given prompt contract action which takes account of the special needs of the ROF, on balance, the advantage lies in using the services of DGDCfor the more complex and high value contracts.88. The problems of waiting for a central organisation to arrange disposalof surplus material and/or surplus plant are not so serious as delays in purchas-ing. The difficulty here is, rather, the nuisance of storing scrap, particularly highvalue scrap which must be kept secure. Here, again, the delegated authority hasbeen raised from  1,500 to  3,000 during the course of our enquiry. We do notconsider that there is any real impediment to efficiency in this area.control of embodiment loan items89. The MOD practice of arranging for the supply of standardised com-components of major equipments on a free issue or embodiment loan basis is appliedto the ROFs as it is to contractors in industry. The effect of this is that when aROF product (e.g. a round of ammunition) is made up of components manu-factured by several different factories, the orders for the several components are placed by the Production branches and not by the factory responsible forassembling the finished product, and the Production branches also arrangedespatch of the components from each factory to the point where they arerequired for further processing or assembly.90. The embodiment loan system has come under review during the courseof the past year by the Committee on MOD Equipment Inspection Policy (theRaby Committee) who recommended that the practice of issuing componentson embodiment loan should be reduced to the absolute minimum so as to con-concentrate responsibility for quality assurance in the hands of the main contractor.More recently, management consultants engaged by MGO to review theorganisation for co-ordination of production of the complete round of ammuni-tion have proposed that the ROFs should be treated as prime contractors forammunition orders and become responsible for placing their own sub-contracts,or orders, and progressing and co-ordinating the supply of components to the filling factories. We endorse both of these recommendations as means of reducingthe extent to which the responsibility of the ROF management is eroded by thefunctions of other parts of the MOD.constraints on personnel management91. The constraints in the field of personnel management are most significantin respect of non-industrial staff. These constraints can be divided into two main categories (a) those which stem from the central control of overall numbers,complementing of senior posts and postings and (b) those which stem from thecentral control of pay and conditions of service. The need to get headquarters and MOD approval for additional posts in the senior grades is certainly con-sidered at the factory level to impair their ability to operate at maximum efficiency. On the other hand, we are satisfied that if urgent action were needed to create an additional senior post at a factory, it would not be frustrated bythe overall manpower ceiling for MOD. Central control of senior posts is not peculiar to the Civil Service, even the larger organisations in the commercialworld impose some restrictions on the extent to which their subordinate bodies are allowed to create additional posts at above the level of, say,  4,000 a year.
We consider, however, that there are unjustifiable delays in the filling of approvedposts as a result of the somewhat cumbersome arrangements which we under-stand have been agreed with the Staff Associations for the filling of vacanciesat the middle management levels. We believe also that the ROF Organisationought to have greater freedom to recruit additional specialist staff on a shortterm basis in order to meet unexpected increases in the workload on the ROFs.We understand that the problems involved, both from the point of view of thetotal numbers employed in the factories and from the point of view of conditionsof service, are being studied by the Ministry of Defence with other Governmentdepartments in the light of the Fulton Committee recommendations.92. It has been suggested to us that there is an inherent difficulty in givingmanagers greater freedom in non-industrial staffing matters whilst retaining the concept of a career service for civil servants with its consequent commitment tomake it possible for staff to gain experience by a planned series of moves betweenposts to qualify for promotion. The possibilities of further delegation are being studied at present by all departments, led by the Civil Service Department. Wethink this is an area in which some changes are necessary if only because the close involvement of the Civilian Establishment branches* is bound to be seen as a potential impediment however efficiently these branches do their job.93. There is more local freedom in personnel matters affecting the industrialstaff. Individual factory complements are not controlled centrally in MOD butforecasts of factory strength requirements are agreed by ROF HQ. Recruitmentis wholly in the hands of the factory directors, but redundancy procedures are agreed at departmental level. Although basic pay and conditions of service arecentrally determined and incentive payment schemes require approval by MOD,factory directors are responsible for negotiating and determining pieceworkprices in accordance with the needs of their own factories. About 63% ofindustrial employees in the engineering and filling factories are covered by some form of payment by results scheme. All employees in the explosives factories areat present paid at timework rates which are negotiated for the Civil Service asa whole.constraints on investment decisions94. Decisions on investment in plant for ROFs are taken wholly within therfore Organisation, subject to approval of the financial provision in the VoteEstimate and, for schemes costing more than  50,000, specific approval by theTreasury. We note that it is customary for the Treasury to retain certain specificcontrols over public sector investment even when it is being made by an organisa-tion not financed from Votes (e.g. the smaller nationalised industries whereschemes costing more than  250,000 are vetted by the Treasury to ensure thatthey meet the established criteria of rate of return on investment), but we think the value of schemes requiring specific approval is pitched unduly low and thatthe ROF Organisation should be given authority to approve schemes estimated to cost up to  250,000.95. Investment decisions in relation to building projects are complicated bythe requirement to use the services of the MPBW for building and civil engineer-ing new works and maintenance and we discuss this constraint in the next partof this Chapter.*The Civilian Establishment branches were renamed Civilian Management branches duringthe period October to November 1970.
The requirement to use common service departments96. Although the whole process of planning and estimating for works services is carried out in consultation with the ROFs, the responsibility for determing the standards and frequency of maintenance and the quality andstyle of building rests with the MPBW. Moreover, the MPBW is responsible forthe oversight of the work and for progressing it and, since the MPBW costs are brought notionally into the factory production accounts, the directors feel theirproduct is bearing costs which are effectively outside their control. This reactionis heightened by the addition to the costs of a 20 per cent departmental charge.This addition is based on the arrangements operated by MPBW for someauthorities not entitled to allied services (see paragraph 63).97. We think there is scope for a reallocation of responsibility for building and civil engineering maintenance and minor new works between MPBW andthe ROF Organisation.98. There is, too, a sense of frustration engendered by the allied services provided by the Stationery Office but this arises from a different source. TheMOD departmental procedures tend to extend the interval between recognitionof the need for office equipment and its supply. The fact that the ROFs have beenable to use their delegated authority to purchase small office machines for production sections from their own Vote heightens the sense of frustration. Thearrangement may impede efficiency because of the emotional reaction ratherthan because of any inherent defect but it might well be an area where the normalallied service procedure could with advantage be replaced by an agency servicearrangement.the single customer situation99- The ROFs are not producing goods or carrying out services for publicconsumption; their customer is the Government and their non-UK customersmust be approved by the Government since their activities must be bounded by government defence and foreign policy. Although in peace time the demands on their services can largely be predetermined, any emergency must directly affect those demands and a major emergency could call for immediate expansionof their manufacturing capability. In practice this means that they must bemaintained at a level from which they can rapidly expand to emergency scale production. Thus there are restraints on taking decisions solely on the basis ofthe economics of operation because their range of products is decided by theirsingle customer. Moreover, the specifications to which they are required to adhereare aimed at producing the most effective weapon rather than something whichalthough less than perfect is still serviceable. In addition, their production pro-gramme is based on the annual ten year costing exercise for Defence service as a whole and is not within their own control. The extent to which they can accept work outside the scope of the defence programme is severely restricted by the possibility that any emergency may compel them to give absolute priority to Defence requirements, and by the embargo on installing plant and equipmentother than that required for Defence orders.the impact of vote accounting100. The ROFs are required to maintain a system of Vote accounts designedto bring to account all expenditure and receipts under the subheadings of the
Vote to which they are appropriate. Vote accounting entails monitoring the cashflow closely, particularly in the later months of the financial year when it isnecessary for the factories to submit monthly statements of the &quot; outturn ofthe Vote &quot; to ROF HQ, for onward transmission to the MOD and thence tothe Treasury. These are statements of the receipts and expenditure to date anda close forecast of the likely outturn at the end of the financial year. This closemonitoring is necessary to enable timely action to be taken to submit a Sup-supplementary Estimate when required to avoid significant divergence of the totalreceipts and expenditure from the Voted amounts under each subhead of the vote.101. The Vote accounts build up through the year to provide the material for the Appropriation Account. The Appropriation Account indicates only howsuccessfully the ROF Organisation has estimated its cash requirements over theyear. It cannot be used as a measure of operational efficiency.102. The comments made by factory managers suggested that the impact ofVote accounting on ROF efficiency could be discerned in several areas. First,the requirement to surrender balances at the end of the financial year precludedforward purchase of materials and the building up of stocks; secondly, ordersfor plant, etc. had to be carefully timed so that capital expenditure could becharged against the correct financial year&apos;s Vote; thirdly the need to presentSupplementary Estimates to secure the funds to finance additional orders madethe production programme less flexible than it should be. We were assured,however, that Treasury control of expenditure now rests mainly on the longterm costings and forecasts of Defence expenditure. Thus the annual Voteallocations are regarded as a target within the longer term forecast so that inpractice there is little difficulty in getting Supplementary Supply when it is needed.This assurance we accepted. There is, too, an arrangement operated by ROF HQfor forward purchase of difficult or scarce materials but this arrangement is either not well known to the factory directors or operated so restrictively thatthey seldom have recourse to it. This points to a failure in communications between HQ and factories.103. We pursued the possible effects of the inflexibility of the programme(point three above) in relation to its effect on export orders and were assured that these orders generally involve long term negotiations with the prospectivepurchaser and there is, therefore, ample time for account to be taken of themin the ROF Estimates for the relevant financial year.104. We concluded that, while the Vote accounting system does not preventthe ROFs from being efficient and is not an undue burden on factory manage-ment, it does not contribute to the achievement of efficiency.THE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND CONTROL SYSTEM105.  The Appropriation Account is accompanied by an Operating account and there is a reconciliation between the Appropriation Account and the operating Account which is published with the two accounts.106. The Operating Account is founded on a system of management accountswhich provides the basis of the management control system operated throughoutthe ROF Organisation. This system provides for the production, and use bymanagement at all levels, of weekly, or monthly, analyses of labour deploymentand productivity and an analysis of the use of direct and indirect labour. Expense
statements and statistics, prepared at six weekly intervals and consolidated intothe quarterly management accounts and statistics statements, provide perform-ance measurement statistics and a series of management ratios which permitcomparisons with past performance.107. The management information system permits a close watch to be kepton production and overhead costs and, if the factory organisation provides forthis vital information to be produced on the spot, regularly and promptly, itshould enable any necessary corrective action to be initiated soon enough to be effective.108. The system was the subject of favourable comment by management consultants who carried out a management audit at ROF Birtley. They recordedthat the critical and detailed analysis of production costs linked to a programmeof action (stemming from fortnightly &quot; cost meetings &quot;) was rarely seen in commercial engineering enterprises. This comment confirms our own assessment of the value and use made of the management control system.109. However, in the absence of simple targets based on competitive profit-ability it is not easy to establish whether the trends shown by historical com-comparisons of management ratios are as satisfactory as they seem. There is no wayof establishing whether the base line (from which progress towards or away from greater efficiency is being measured) reflected an acceptable level of efficiency.110. There is no doubt that the ROF Organisation has an in-built costdiscipline. There is ample evidence of cost consciousness enhanced by the intro-duction of the system of fixed price quotations; but the questions arise whether,in the absence of a competitive situation over part of the product range, the pressures on management to achieve optimum efficiency can ever be so sharp asthey are in the private sector and what incentive there can be to make a profitand beat the &quot; fixed price &quot; when any surplus earned is no more than a figure ina notional account.THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEM111.  To sum up, there are some restrictions on the discretion of ROFmanagers in the management of resources.112. During the course of our enquiry MOD have been moving towardsgiving the ROFs more management freedom. We have noted that changes inthe level of delegation of purchasing authority have been made, that the possi-bilities of further delegation in the personnel function are being considered andthat implementation of the recommendations of the Raby Report will resultnot only in giving more responsibility to factory directors for the quality of their products but also in reducing the range of embodiment loan items. these changes would remove some restrictions which derive from the MOD&apos;s internalprocedures for inspection and purchasing.113. As for those restrictions which derive from the fact that the ROFsoperate as part of the Ministry of Defence and are thus subject to the normalfinancial and personnel management procedures that apply to all Governmentoperations, we have suggested ways in which these procedures might contributemore directly to efficiency. These can be summarised as follows:(1) ROF authority to authorise capital investment should be increased.
(2) There is scope for reallocation between MPBW and the ROF Organisa-tion of responsibility for building and civil engineering maintenance andnew works.(3) The allied service arrangements with HMSO could with advantage bereplaced by an agency service arrangement.(4) There should be greater delegation of the personnel managementfunction.114. Before elaborating on these suggestions, all of which should help inthe pursuit of efficiency, we examine a more fundamental question, namelywhether the ROF Organisation should be &quot; hived off&quot; from the Civil Service:or whether the Organisation could operate within a framework of accountablemanagement within the Civil Service. Both forms of organisation were mentionedin the Report of the Fulton Committee on the Civil Service as likely to beconducive to greater efficiency. The Fulton Committee pointed out that theyhad not been able to make any detailed study to identify particular cases wherehiving off might be tried but they recommended an early and thorough reviewof the question of hiving off. The aim would be to make Boards or Corporationsresponsible for executive activities now forming parts of Government depart-ments. The Boards would be wholly responsible for carrying out the task assigned to them within the powers delegated to them. Although they would be outsidethe day-to-day control of Ministers and the scrutiny of Parliament, ministers would retain powers to give them directions when necessary. As examples ofwhat they had in mind, the Fulton Committee referred to the Post OfficeCorporation and the Atomic Energy Authority. (Report of the CommitteeVol 1. Cmd 3638-Paras 145-162 and 188-191).
GREATER FREEDOM FOR MOD ROFs115. Our first instinctive reaction was that the ROF Organisation was a natural candidate for hiving off in the sense described at the end of the precedingChapter. Our reasons were as follows. The Organisation^ task is much closerin kind to that of private industry than to the generality of Government depart-ments. The Organisation has already introduced a number of accountingconventions to enable accounts to be kept on commercial lines; an element forreturn on capital employed is to be introduced into ROF prices and the accountswill then differ little from those of a commercial organisation.116. Clearly it would be desirable to give the ROFs a financial structure whichwould enable the true resource costs to be established and it would be conductive to the efficiency of operation if the financial structure enabled them to retainsurpluses at the end of the financial year. In addition, it could be argued thatthere would be advantages if the Organisation were free to determine its ownmanpower requirements not only in relation to the alternative mixes of capital and labour resources but also in relation to the mix of the various professionalskills or other expertise required within the total manpower budget. Again, itwould undoubtedly be conducive to efficiency if systems of pay and gradingcould be related exclusively to the Organisation^ needs without regard to therequirements of other parts of the Civil Service. The same would be true ifrecruitment, staffing and disciplinary procedures could be speeded up by keepingthem entirely within the Organisation^ control. These considerations argue infavour of separating the ROFs from the Vote accounting system.117. Thus the main purpose in hiving the ROF Organisation off from theMinistry of Defence would, in our view, be to secure its freedom from:(1) Detailed accountability to Ministers and Parliament for its day-to-dayactivities.(2) The full rigour of the estimating and Vote accounting procedures inrespect of the ROF Organisation^ current and capital expenditure.(3) The manpower ceilings applied to the non-industrial Civil Service andany manpower controls imposed by the Ministry of Defence on indus-trials.(4) The obligation to conform to Civil Service procedures in respect of recruitment, pay, grading, promotion, posting, discipline and redund-ancy to cite the most important.(5) The obligation to use the common services provided by MPBW andHMSO.118. However, as our examination of the financial and organisationalrelationships between the ROFs and the MOD progressed, we became less sure
that hiving off was the right solution for the ROFs. The nature of their task andthe nature of the customer necessitate special relationships which may besummarised as follows:(1) Given that the purpose of a hived off ROF Organisation continued tobe to supply munitions to the Armed Forces, the MOD would remaintheir principal customer, and, as the design and development authorityfor armaments, would determine the kind of stores produced by theROFs and the specifications to which they were produced.(2) ROFs provide the main national reserve of capacity to meet foreseeableor unforeseen emergencies for a substantial range of munitions.(3) For reasons of national security their overseas orders would have to be approved by the Government and political considerations might dictatethat major orders should continue to be negotiated by the DefenceSales Organisation.119. We think these special features call for a degree of Government inter-vention that would be incompatible with commercial freedom. Experience ofhiving off other bodies (e.g. the UKAEA) suggests that the existing controls which impose standard procedures for staff recruitment, pay and grading wouldhave to be replaced by constraints that would have very much the same effect sothat freedom in this field would also be severely circumscribed. We have, there-fore, concluded that, except in respect of the system of financing, there would beno merit in hiving off the ROFs. We give our reasons below.THE FEASIBILITY OF HIVING OFF120. The major part of the  43 million (at 1968/69 level) expended on goods and services produced by the ROFs comes from Voted funds accounted for byMOD. This means that, whatever relationship existed between the ROFs andthe MOD, Parliament would have to be satisfied that value for money was being obtained and that the ROF Organisation was achieving the highest attainabledegree of cost effectiveness. At present, Parliamentary control of expenditurebears directly on the production process. If the ROF Organisation ceased to function as part of the Ministry of Defence, control would have to be exercised in the same way as for Government purchases from other sources. Where therewas no competition, the requirement for equality of information on prices would need to be applied and MOD would need to be satisfied that productionmethods were efficient.121. Indeed, it seems probable that in practice the MOD would want toexercise a closer control than that normally exercised by Government over itssuppliers; There are two main reasons for this. First, the level of activity of theROFs would be determined primarily by the resources allocated to defence expenditure. Thus the manufacturing programme in terms of the range of items,quantities and deliveries, would still be largely in MOD hands and out of therfore Organisation^ control. Secondly, it seems improbable that the MOD asvirtually sole customer would be willing to leave control over the cost of meetingits requirements wholly to the supplier. On the contrary, it is more probable thatMOD Production branches would wish to satisfy themselves in detail that costs were reasonable in terms of effectiveness of production processes, delivery datesetc. In short, the present direct controls over the use of resources, which derive from Parliamentary accountability and the associated financial procedures,
would, in practice, be replaced by indirect controls exercised by the Ministry ofDefence over costs and quality and hence over the use of resources.122. This would mean that the ROF Organisation^ level of activity wouldbe largely out of its control. The requirement to maintain a reserve of capacitywould mean that its level of capacity, too, was dependent on MOD decisions. Itseems to us self-evident that only the Ministry of Defence can determine whatreserve capacity needs to be maintained, and that this must limit the ability ofthe ROF Organisation to take decisions about the economics of its operationse.g. its investment programme.123. However the cost of reserve capacity might be treated (e.g. as an over-head to be brought into the cost of the goods and services provided or as a straight-forward subsidy from MOD), it would affect the profitability of therfore Organisation.124. It is true that a degree of formal independence of the ROF Organisationfrom MOD might ensure that the scale of reserve capacity was kept underfrequent review but we doubt whether it would solve the problems of reconciling the political and economic considerations that are inherent in any decision onthe level of reserve capacity. Indeed we think these are more likely to beexacerbated by removing the ROFs from MOD control. We believe that theneed to maintain reserve capacity points to the desirability of retaining theexisting organisational links.125. In addition, there seems a paramount need for the closest possibleassociation between the ROFs and the design and development authorities.These authorities exist to ensure that the Armed Forces are supplied withweapons which embody the highest degree of efficiency that technological skillcan devise. Modifications, to simplify and cheapen the process of production,can be accepted only if there is no loss in the effectiveness of the product. Thus,we see the main role of the ROFs in this area as being that of bringing productionexpertise to bear on the design and development of these weapons. At present,contact, particularly informal contact, between the design and developmentauthorities and the ROFs is facilitated by the freedom with which staff can betransferred from one to the other. This advantage might be lost if the presentorganisational links were severed.the implications of the staffing system126. We now come to the third and fourth freedoms listed in paragraph 117i.e. those which concern complements, industrial relations and personnel management: this is the area where we think that the advantages of separationfrom the Civil Service are most likely to be illusory or, at best, insignificant.127. The first consideration seems to us to be that the staff concerned would want substantial safeguards for, or reserved rights to, their present conditionsof service and rates of pay. This has been the experience in other statutory re-organisations. Since it is probable that the non-industrial staff would continueto be represented by the Civil Service Staff Associations, there would not onlybe a tendency for Civil Service attitudes to be retained by the staff but, in con-sequence, a need in practice to restrict the Organisation^ freedom to departfrom the centrally determined standards of the Civil Service.128. Constraints would be necessary, for example, to avoid a situation inwhich the standards of pay or grading set for the Civil Service as a whole could
be put at risk by the decisions of an organisation that existed purely to serve theneeds of Government, that was financed wholly in one way or another from public funds, and that was staffed largely by ex-civil servants. It is significant thatwhen the Atomic Energy Authority was hived off from the Civil Service, it wasstipulated by the Government that, except in respect of the most senior staff, theAuthority should continue broadly to follow Civil Service standards.129. The existence of such constraints is evidenced by the fact that we havebeen told by the representatives of the non-industrial staff that they would see no advantage in ceasing to be civil servants. This has been confirmed by our owncontacts with ROF management at all levels. In particular, it seems probablethat their career prospects would be worsened if they were confined to what therfore Organisation itself could offer even though for the few appointments atthe higher levels this might involve some enhancement of the present rates of pay. Thus, it might be more difficult to recruit and retain professional and tech-nical staff of the quality required. Moreover, if it were desired to maintain theexisting arrangements for the free interchange of staff between the ROF Organisa-tion and other parts of the Civil Service, the Organisation would have to maintainCivil Service standards of pay, grading and complementing to such an extent as to nullify the hypothetical advantages of freedom in these areas.130. We believe these considerations to have less force in relation to industrialpay since a hived off organisation ought to acquire an industrial identity quitedistinct from the industrial Civil Service. Even so, we doubt whether it wouldbe possible for the organisation to offer other conditions of service (e.g. super-annuation) that departed markedly from Civil Service standards.131. Finally, if the ROF Organisation were hived off it would have to be equipped to carry out those personnel functions at present done on its behalfby other branches of the Ministry of Defence or by the Civil Service Department.This would increase the costs of administration.financing a hived off organisation132. We assume that the main features of the financial structure of a hivedoff ROF Organisation would be similar to those applied to the nationalised industries. That is, the Organisation^ assets would be capitalised, provision would be made for loans of additional capital, surpluses earned in the courseof trading could be retained, subject to the usual controls, and the organisation would be expected to service its loan capital and produce a return on capital employed. The rates of interest and target rate of return would be set by theTreasury.133.  We think the important advantages of such a system would be:(1) Expenditure on materials and labour could be adjusted to respond to increased demands from customers, without the need to submit a supplementary Estimate.(2) The Organisation could hold reserves which could be used, among other purposes, for the advance purchase of materials against orders in the pipeline. It would also be possible for the ROF Organisation to anti-participate orders (e.g. for spares) which might be expected to follow on fromprevious production.(3) The proper capitalisation of the ROF Organisation, and the requirement to service that capital, would establish the true costs of the operations.
This should improve the general understanding of the use of resources and help to provide a discipline towards their economic use.(4) The conflict between the need to control cash flow for Vote accountingpurposes and the achievement of commercial objectives would be eliminated. In addition, the ROF Organisation would be relieved of theunnecessary burden of producing Vote accounts and managementcould concentrate on a single, more meaningful, accounting system.(5) Separation from the normal basis of Civil Service operation should help to create the conditions in which the industrial pay system could bemore closely related to performance.(6) The management accounting system would become vital to the manage-ment of the factories and not just a set of figures designed to record thesituation post hoc for the benefit of higher authority and posterity.(7) The commercial framework of the system of financing would promoteefficiency in production processes to the extent of encouraging the ROFsto challenge design in the interests of economical production. Thiswould create constructive tension between the MOD as customer andthe ROFs as supplier.(8) It would be possible to set simple targets of achievement in terms whichcould be generally recognised and understood.(9) In deciding whether to continue to use the common services providedby MPBW and HMSO, the Organisation could be guided purely by considerations of relative cost. (We are satisfied that the existingdemands made by the ROFs on these Departments are too marginal interms of their total services to Government to affect the efficiency oftheir operations if the ROF Organisation were to transfer its customelsewhere.)134. Although we decided that the hiving off concept was not appropriate tothe ROF Organisation, we were reluctant to discard the benefits that could besecured by this method of financing. We were advised, however, that for sometime past the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence had been considering thepossibility of a Trading Fund for the ROFs. Such a Fund would substantiallyreflect the financial arrangements which would apply to a hived off body and we discuss its possibilities in the next part of this Chapter.THE CASE FOR A TRADING FUND135. The Treasury proposals for a Trading Fund for the ROF Organisationare reproduced at Appendix F. These proposals provide for the value of the assets held by the Organisation, less liabilities, at the time of the creation of theFund to be regarded as commencing capital and for an initial injection of work-ing capital. Additional requirements for capital either for working capital orfor the acquisition of further fixed assets would be borrowed from the national loans Fund. Both the commencing capital and any subsequent additions wouldbe serviced by the ROFs at rates to be determined. Surpluses earned in the courseof trading would be retained, and possibly invested if they were in excess of immediate capital requirements. Surpluses ranked as an addition to capitalmight attract a liability to pay interest. Costs and receipts which are currentlybrought to account as notional entries in the ROF production accounts wouldbecome cash transactions.
. 136. This arrangement would haye all the advantages we listed in paragraph133 while preserving what we regard as the essential organisational links withthe MOD. It could be argued that while the ROFs remained in the Civil Serviceframework, Civil Service attitudes and traditions would remain and no benefits would in fact result from the change. Against this we would point out that already the managers have demonstrated that efficiency has been stimulated bythe introduction of &quot; fixed price &quot; quotations for MOD orders on factories eventhough this is only a management device which depends merely on paper trans-actions. The added reality imported by giving the ROFs hard cash to manageshould enhance the effect on efficiency. It should induce a greater sense ofresponsibility at each level from top management downwards and make it possible to set clear objectives for managers. Throughout our enquiry we have noted that ROF management show a strong desire to be allowed to demonstratetheir professional ability. A Trading Fund would give them their opportunity.In short, we believe that financing the ROF Organisation by means of a TradingFund would change the climate of management.137. In our discussions we attached importance to the fact that the ROFOrganisation and the Treasury, both of whom are well aware of the problemsencountered in operating under the existing system, would like to introduce sucha Fund. We think they are right and we recommend that the financial structure of the ROF Organisation should be changed and a Trading Fund substitutedfor Vote financing.138. We do not see the Trading Fund as a panacea nor do we expect its introduction to have an immediate effect on the level of capacity provided for defence purposes. The Defence sector is constantly subject to political pressures;strict control of manpower is constantly exercised and the size and shape of therfore Organisation is constantly under review. Although a Trading Fund wouldgive more point to commercial considerations these could scarcely affectdecisions on the amount of capacity to be maintained.139. We accept that introducing the Fund would have a good effect onmanagement morale but we do not delude ourselves into thinking that this will automatically extend down to the factory floor. We know that success in relatingthe industrial pay systems to performance would depend on the co-operationof the Trade Unions but we think that ROF management might be better ableto negotiate a satisfactory wage structure if they were less subject to central control and co-ordination with the rest of the industrial Civil Service.140. We know, too, that it is the wish of the non-industrial staff to remain within the Civil Service and that this would inevitably restrict the freedom ofmanoeuvre in pay and conditions of service. But we think that the existence ofa separate financial structure should facilitate delegation in the personnel management field. We discuss this further in the next Chapter.141. In making this recommendation, we have kept in mind two factors which might be thought to argue against a Trading Fund. These are:(1) The effect on the price of the ROFs&apos; products charged to the defence budget. If interest is charged on capital, the cost of ROF products willapparently be increased and the price charged to the MOD will auto-. matically rise. This rise in price will be reflected in the Defence budget., However, the interest paid by ROFs would be credited to the national loans Fund. Therefore no new additional burden would fall on the taxpayer as a result of the change in the method of financing the ROFs.
If the change brought any other increases in cost (e.g. costs of administra-tion), in our view, the ROFs should try to contain these throughincreased efficiency.(2) The fact that whatever steps are taken to give the ROF Organisationcommand of the resources at its disposal, it could never have command of its order book. The demands of its main customer do not permit itto seek civil work to any significant extent and we would not recom-mend that the organisation should attempt to create facilities to under-take more civil work. But we recognise that the return on capital employed could be adversely affected, and unit costs increased, by un-economic orders which could not be refused and by any falling off in defence demands. We think, therefore, that Defence contracts withROFs should provide for financial adjustment in the event of cancellationor reduction in quantities on the lines of the provisions made in standardconditions of Government contracts for stores purchases.142. We are not convinced that the scheme which the Treasury has producedis applicable in all its details. We hope that when the details are finally worked out the following points will be kept in mind:(1) In commercial practice, the revaluation of assets is a matter of companypolicy. The apparent profitability of many industrial undertakingswould look less healthy if their assets were always valued on an up-to-date basis.(2) The growth potential of the ROF Organisation depends on government policy and the interest rates determined for the organisation ought tobe adjusted to take account of this restriction on their activities.(3) Giving the ROFs a Trading Fund would be consistent with the applica-tion of the principles of accountable management. In our view account-able management means that management is given (or sets itself)objectives, delegates authority to achieve these objectives and monitorsits performance against these objectives. Authority, control and delega-tion are crucial to accountable management. Success can only beachieved through a flow of control information to the centre of decisionmaking. The requirements of Parliamentary accountability should bemet by the Treasury being satisfied that the management accountingsystem is soundly based and effectively operated. We accept that the purchaser should be allowed access to cost information on products which are a monopoly of the ROFs; but we would not expect detailedoversight by the Treasury of the ROFs&apos; operations. The onus shouldbe plainly on the ROFs to manage and account for their efforts and onthe purchasers to ensure that munitions purchased out of their Votesrepresented value for money.143. Finally, we should mention that we are aware that legislation wouldbe required to introduce a Trading Fund. If our recommendation is accepted,we would urge that in the interval between its acceptance and the enactment ofthe necessary legislation, the disciplines and accounting conventions applicableto a Trading Fund should be introduced on a notional basis on the lines alreadyproposed. This would ensure that the ROF Organisation could move smoothlyand promptly into the new system immediately legislative authority was given.The Trading Fund should set the scene for a new approach to management andwe discuss its implications in the next chapter.
IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT144. The essence of our recommendations is that CROF should becomewholly responsible for the disposal of the resources allocated to him so that his responsibility for carrying out the tasks assigned to the ROF Organisation andfor the efficient operation of the factories can be complete. At present this responsibility is eroded by the dichotomy of technical and financial control andby excessive dependence on other agencies.145. We would expect that CROF as the &quot; accountable manager &quot; would bemade responsible for the financial as well as the technical aspects of managingthe ROF Organisation. This would mean that the two HQ Directors (DOF (Aand F) and DOF (Accts.)) would no longer have divided loyalties to CROFon the one hand and AUS(E)AD on the other.146. We suggest that, on the assumption that PUS(E) would account forthe ROF Trading Fund, the necessary link with the Accounting Officer&apos;organisation should be at ROF Board level. It would be essential to ensure thatthe ROF Board had adequate financial advice and to provide also for such advice to be available to CROF in those instances where he exercised financialauthority separately from the Board.147. The shift of responsibility for financial management should ensure thatthe financial implications of investment and other decisions were built in fromthe start and not imposed as an external discipline at the higher levels of therfore hierarchy. It would also involve changes in relationships with other MODdivisions and directorates and with other Government departments rightthrough the ROF Organisation from Board level downwards, as described below.THE ROF BOARD148. The ROF Board, with MGO as the Chairman, is at the interfacebetween Defence policy and ROF policy. Customer and producer interests meet in the Chairman; producer interests, without financial responsibility, are represented by CROF; and finance interests by DUS(E) and AUS(E)AD andDOF (A and F). The latter is a member of CROF&apos;s staff. The new distribution would alter the balance by bringing finance and production interests together inCROF and, if CROF remained responsible to MGO on all aspects of managingthe ROFs, bringing customer, producer and finance interests together at MGOlevel. It is clear that new relationships between MGO, CROF and PUS(E)would have to be evolved.149. The concentration of financial and technical responsibility should give greater scope for a fully accountable ROF management to bring considerations of production policy to bear on Defence policy decisions. This is not to suggestthat production aspects are not already taken into account in decisions on the
level of production capacity which must be retained in MOD or in design anddevelopment decisions but the existing description of the function of the ROFs,which serves as a statement of their objective, does not suggest that they areformally committed to the pursuit of efficiency in the face of Defence require-ments. We suggest that their objective might better be expressed as follows:&quot; To satisfy the munitions requirements of the Services and undertakeapproved work of a defence nature for Commonwealth and other friendly Governments at the lowest practicable cost.&quot;150. It would follow that the role of the ROF Board should be redefined toemphasise the new range of CROF&apos;s responsibilities. If CROF were to be heldaccountable for all aspects of ROF management, it would be inappropriate forthe ROF Board to have the final say in specific investment decisions. Theyshould, rather, contribute to the development of an overall investment policy,in relation to Defence policy, and advise on specific decisions. The change would also cast doubt on the need for a ROF HQ Board. The prime function of that Board is to bring together, in a rather formal relationship, the parties concerned, respectively, with financial and technical management of the ROFOrganisation. The suggested arrangement would make this function redundant.No doubt there would continue to be some specialisation at ROF HQ in thefinance function but the aim should be to inculcate a sense of financial responsi-bility in line management at all levels and we would expect the financial responsibility at ROF HQ to be shared by the two Deputy Controllers andCROF and that DOF (A and F) and DOF (Accts.) would develop an advisoryrole and provide a service to line management.CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS151. Given that the recommendations of the Raby Committee were imple-mented, the ROF Organisation would emerge as a self contained unit within theMinistry of Defence, executing orders placed by the Production branches and/or the Contracts Directorate-General and delivering the product to the customerin accordance with the prescribed standards of quality. The stages betweenacceptance of the order and delivery of the product would be wholly the concern of the ROF Organisation and they would be committed to carrying out the taskat the lowest practicable cost. It would be expected, therefore, that they wouldchallenge requirements on grounds of uneconomic specifications and un-economic quantities and be constantly alert to the possibilities of applyingproduction expertise to the design of the product in order to achieve optimumreturn on capital employed.152. Failing agreement on rescheduling orders to permit the manufacture ofeconomic quantities of any given item, it should be understood that the addi-tional cost of manufacturing in uneconomic quantities should be passed on tothe customer.153. Where the price to be charged to the customer is less than the fulleconomic cost and the decision on pricing is to be taken by the MOD and not bythe ROFs, the ROF Organisation should quote the price at which they were willing to supply the product and the Defence Sales Organisation should buyat that price. Any profit the Sales Organisation might make on resale should be credited to MOD Votes and any loss borne on those Votes. Where the ROFsnegotiated an overseas sales order within their delegated authority, we would expect them to be credited with any profit or to bear any loss.
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER MOD divisions and DIRECTORATESpersonnel management and industrial relations154. Significant changes would have to be made in relationships between therfore Organisation and the other parts of the Ministry of Defence in the sphere of personnel management and industrial relations.155. If it were decided that the staff should retain Civil Service status, wethink that it would be inevitable that the rates of pay and conditions of serviceof non-industrials should remain consistent with those obtaining in the CivilService as a whole. However, if, as a result of the studies in connection with the implementation of the recommendations of the Fulton Committee, the ROFsbecame a separate group within the Civil Service for career management pur-poses, some relaxation of Civil Service procedures might be appropriate. Forexample, recruitment procedures might be adjusted so as to speed up the process:and special starting pay rules might be evolved to facilitate the recruitment ofspecialists to posts above the basic grade. It might be possible, too, for the placingand promotion of ROF non-industrial staff to be delegated fully to the Organisa-tion and for the Organisation to determine the grading of posts.156. If, on the other hand, it were decided that the ROF Organisation shouldbe associated for career management purposes with other staff in MOD (andpossibly other departments) some central control over grading would be necessary(to maintain consistency of standards) and over posting (to ensure equality of opportunity for staff in the group as a whole). But we would expect control overposting to operate only for those employees likely to achieve a career which went beyond the opportunities available within the ROF Organisation. Careerplanning for staff likely to reach their full potential within the opportunitiesavailable in the ROF Organisation should be a responsibility of CROF and hisline managers. Whether the ROFs were managed as a distinct group or their staff formed part of a larger group, we would expect that CROF or his Directorswould always have opportunity to interview possible candidates before postingswere made.157. In addition to easing the constraints relating to individuals we think itequally important that the constraints of the existing system of control of numbers of non-industrial staffs should be relaxed. The ROF Organisation is essentially one where it is possible to quantify work load and the relation of staffing to load can readily be demonstrated. We understand that problems ofcontrol of numbers are also under review and we would urge that the ROFOrganisation should be among the first to move onto a new system which,ideally, would permit quick reaction to changes in work load. Since staff costs will be carefully watched by a management required to secure a return on capital employed, we doubt whether there is any need for arbitrary control of numbers.158. So long as the present system of central decision on basic pay for industrial civil servants continues, we imagine that the industrials employed bythe ROFs would expect to enjoy parity with the generality of industrial civilservants as regards basic pay and conditions of service. Any advance towards aseparate and distinct pay structure more closely related to productivity shouldbe of advantage to the ROF Organisation as well as to the workers. We would urge, therefore, that the departments concerned should seek agreement with the
Trade Unions on steps towards a distinct pay structure and that management and unions should consider whether the present negotiating machinery is bestdesigned to serve the needs of either the ROF management or the employees.purchase and disposal of materials159. We consider that the detailed regulations for the purchase of materials and the requirement for competitive tendering are extensions of the system offinancial control since they are directed to propriety in the expenditure of Govern-ment money and achieving value for that money. The logic of the situationonce the ROF Organisation has its own Trading Fund is that it should under-take its own purchasing.160. However, it might be convenient and financially advantageous forROFs to draw supplies off running contracts placed by DGDC to cover ROFrequirements along with the requirements of other divisions and directorates;and the specialised expertise of DGDC might be valuable for those purchaseswhich involved foreign exchange or the negotiation of complex and unusualconditions of contract.161. Similarly there might be advantage if the ROF Organisation continuedto use the services of the Defence Sales Organisation disposals element. Pur-chases would be charged, and sales credited, to the Trading Fund and, logically,the administrative costs of the DGDC and the Defence Sales Organisationattributable to services performed for the ROF Organisation should be borneby the Fund.RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMON SERVICE DEPARTMENTS162.   Capitalising the assets of the ROF would mean that control of thebuildings and their maintenance must pass from the MPBW to the ROF Organ-isation. They could not manage these assets effectively while their maintenanceremained the responsibility of another Government department.163. At present some of the building and civil engineering maintenance is done by directly employed labour i.e. industrial civil servants supervised by non-industrial civil servants and employed by the Ministry of Public Building and works. Some maintenance and most new construction is done by contractorsselected by MPBW.164. We recommend that, before any steps are taken towards transferring the directly employed labour from MPBW to the ROF Organisation, the latter should carry out detailed costings to establish whether they should base their maintenance system on directly employed labour or extend the use of contractors.This is an important decision which might have a marked effect on ROF profit-ability and the exercise should be put in hand in advance of preparation for theintroduction of the Trading Fund.165. We are advised by MPBW that their area officers combine responsibilityfor maintenance with the professional and technical work arising on new con-straction, let to contract, up to a value of  5,000. Above that level the work ishandled by MPBW Regional or London Headquarters.166. We would not expect that the ROF Organisation would equip itself toundertake all its own building and it should be a matter for careful consideration at what point the services of consultant architects or of the MPBW should beused. The decision should have regard to the level of work, including work
connected with new construction, that could be absorbed by the professional and technical staff necessary to supervise the maintenance of these buildings and installations. We would expect a decision to use MPBW services to be based onan economic assessment of the relative costs and benefits of a contract withMPBW compared with the charges of other organisations.167. So far as the supplies obtained from HMSO are concerned we think the choice, again, should be governed by the relative advantages of using thecentral source of supply and buying in small quantities from other sources. we expect that for some bread and butter supplies HMSO would be able to offermore attractive prices, and perhaps service, but we think that in view of the low level of expenditure on small office machines (about  35,000 a year, on average),the advantage of getting the items required much more quickly might outweigh the cost advantage. In any event, the source of supply should be left to the choice of the ROF.ORGANISING FOR ACCOUNTABLE MANAGEMENT168. A consistent theme runs through our recommendations. All of them are designed to concentrate financial and technical authority and responsibilityfor personnel management in the ROF Organisation so as to give the manage-ment the maximum degree of control over the disposal of the resources allocated to them. Much of the success of a management operating in this new contextwill derive from the sense of freedom from tiresome constraints and the accept-ance by individuals of real responsibility for the decisions they take.169. Criteria of performance for the ROF Organisation as a whole will befixed by the rate of return on capital employed which the Treasury asks for andby the rates at which additional capital is provided from the National loans fund. The overall success of the Organisation depends, of course, on the performance of its constituent parts and it is therefore implicit in our recom-mendations that the individual factory directors, their deputies, assistants andmanagers should each have the authority needed to fulfil his responsibilities.The fusion of technical and financial authority and assumption of responsibilityfor personnel management and career development must be achieved rightthrough the ROF Organisation down to the levels where the day-to-day decisions are taken.170. We recommend, therefore, that in preparation for the introduction ofthe Trading Fund, the MOD should institute a thorough-going review of thedistribution of functions between ROF HQ and the eleven factories. The aim off such a review should be to create a network of centres of authority (oraccountable units) each with a defined task (or tasks), each with financial andtechnical authority to take the decisions needed to carry out its task(s) and eachanswerable to CROF as the accountable manager for the Organisation as awhole. Within the main centres of authority there might be sub-centres but these should each have the same characteristics, i.e. a task which they could achieveand authority to take the necessary decisions without depending on the interven-tion of other parties. And each such sub-centre should be headed by an individualanswerable to the individual heading the main centre in which the sub-unitoperated.171. The sort of organisation we have in mind differs from that now operating in that the &quot; headquarters &quot; function (which currently derives, in the &quot;main,from the separate line of financial responsibility) would disappear and be
replaced by an articulated structure of largely self managing units. Our conceptimplies that at factory level, and within factories, there would be the maximumdelegation of financial and technical authority and responsibility for personnel management and that the sinews of the articulated structure would be personalmanagement accountability for the disposal of resources (material and man-power).172. Greater delegation e.g. of personnel and purchasing functions shouldnot result in the build-up of central specialist sections at ROF HQ and we wouldequally deprecate the setting up of a buildings and works organisation at ROFHQ to replace the MPBW. The management consultants who recommendedthat the ROFs should be made prime contractors for the production of ammuni-tion made the point that this would involve transferring responsibility forprocurement action for components, packaging etc. to the ROFs. They suggested,however, that this work should be done at ROFs Blackburn, Birtley, Patricroftand Radway Green not at ROF HQ. This is an example of the application ofour concept of centres of authority for specific aspects of ROF operations. Wewould expect that the organisation review which we recommend would resultin some, or all, of the factories becoming centres for specialised functions. Thiswould ensure that none of these specialised functions would be operated remotelyby people unfamiliar with the needs of the factories. We would emphasise thatwe think there is a real danger of nullifying the effect of introducing the TradingFund by over centralisation within the ROF Organisation. Although we recog-nise that there may be a need for some adjustment in staffing or grading of posts in the Organisation following further delegation of authority from MOD, wethink there would not be any net increase in overall costs.173. It is self evident that an organisation based on a new philosophy of management would need to review its management training programme and,although we have not examined the existing training programmes, we make noapology for recommending that, alongside the organisation review, there shouldbe an equally fundamental review of the management training programme. the aim of this review should be to ensure that the whole training programme isreorientated to take account of the fusion of financial and technical responsi-bility and the assumption of a much greater responsibility for personnel manage-ment. Sufficient training effort must be available in the short term to secure thatall managers, right down to assistant foreman level, are rapidly and adequatelyacquainted with the new responsibilities they will have to assume when the trading Fund is introduced.174. To sum up, there is plenty of preparatory work to be done prior to the setting up of a Trading Fund which should engage and interest the enthusiasticmanagers we have met in the course of the enquiry. The level of efficiency therfore Organisation achieves under the present system makes us confident thatthe preparatory work will be done effectively. We believe that the ROFs will beable to move forward with their new financial system and their new approach to management to demonstrate conclusively that they are among the more efficientoperators in the fields of industry in which they are engaged.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeJ.

(paragraph 75)ANALYSIS OF THE DATA COLLECTED1. Chapter 5 describes how we collected comments from the ROF Managers. Wecould not regard these comments as reliable indicators of the impediments to efficiencythat actually existed because we did not collect them systematically in controlledcircumstances and their nature did not justify any attempt to substantiate or refute thebeliefs held. We nevertheless analysed them in various ways to see if there were anythreads which would lead us to identify the particular aspects of the organisation whichmight, in fact, impede efficiency.2. For the purpose of our analysis the perceived impediments were arranged undernine headings. These are used consistently in the first column of each of the Tables.The principal comments which have been grouped under each heading are as follows:Code Analysis category(a) Vote accounting and estimating procedures (24 comments)The belief that planning tended to be geared by MOD to the need to produceestimates on a Financial Year basis and that this inhibited effective productionplanning for more than a short time ahead was mentioned several times. Inaddition, two or three comments suggested that the need to adhere to Voteaccounting sometimes resulted in more pressure to produce at the end of theFinancial Year than at the beginning.(b) Use of common services provided by MPBW/HMSO (70 comments)About one third of the comments under this heading reflected the ROFs&apos; viewthat MPBW were not fully able to satisfy their particular needs and that delaysfrequently occurred in getting work done. About one quarter indicated thatthey felt they lacked influence on the priorities which were allocated by MPBWand the costs which MPBW incurred. Among the rest of the comments underthis heading the three which occurred most frequently were that the requirement that the ROFs should notionally include a 20 % agency charge in their produc-tion account added unnecessarily to the cost of their product; that communica-tion with MPBW was sometimes difficult because of the structure of theMPBW organisation; and that the procedures for the procurement of equip-ment via MOD and HMSO were complex and slow.(c) Centralised control by MOD (excluding personnel) (109 comments)It was strongly felt that the ROFs&apos; powers ( 1,500) to purchase machinery and materials were too low, but only three or four comments suggested that  1,500was too low for the disposal of unwanted machinery and scrap. It was also fely strongly that the MOD branches failed to comprehend and to make dueallowances for the ROFs&apos; particular character, abilities and needs. The ROFs&apos;limited authority to make speculative purchases of material and to start workin advance of receiving formal orders were also mentioned, but much lessfrequently.(d)    Centralised control by MOD of personnel matters (124 comments)Undoubtedly the principal volume of comments made in this area arose fromthe belief that central negotiation of pay rates, and the need to conform tothe pattern of pay which applied to the other establishments in the MOD andin the Civil Service generally, meant that pay levels and pay structure wereinappropriate for employees in the ROFs. Comment was equally divided between pay of industrials and non-industrials. Among the comments aboutnon-industrial pay, several referred to the rate of starting pay for juniorie-d43
technical and professional staff which made recruiting difficult. In addition, itwas believed that the staffing policies which the MOD Civil Establishmentbranches applied were inappropriate for the ROFs. Central control of thenumber of non-industrial posts was said to cause a lack of flexibility because it took inadequate account of fluctuations in the production work load. Underthis heading, too, it was said that there was failure on the part of MOD to appreciate the environment in which the ROFs operated and their particularneeds.(e)   MOD production requirements (54 comments)The comments under this heading were, in the main, directed to four points which were regarded as more or less equal in importance: the production programme was subject to changes at short notice and these created an un-settling effect in the ROFs; it was difficult to plan a production programme with reasonable assurance because of the late notification of actual requirementsby MOD; the Production branches were alleged to fail, on occasion, to co-ordinate small orders into batches which could be produced more economically;difficulties were experienced in getting embodiment loan items at the right time.(/)   Quality assurance arrangements (33 comments)It was suggested that the standards of the MOD Inspectorates were unneces-sarily rigorous and that the ROFs had to work to higher standards thanindustry for production of the same equipment. There were said to be too manyInspectorates and some duplication of the work they did.(g) Procedural requirements of MOD (112 comments)The general tenor of the comments under this heading was that unnecessarydelay was caused by having to rely on services provided by MOD branches andthat these branches (in particular those responsible for the purchase of materials,the recruiting of non-industrials and the disposal of unwanted machinery andscrap) operated rigid and unnecessarily complicated procedures.(h) Allocation of design work (9 comments)The ROFs believed that they could make a greater contribution than they were asked to do to design work, and that they had insufficient authority to make, minor modifications in design without reference to MOD branches.(j)   Local management practice (38 comments)This category included a wide variety of comments on matters which appearedto lie primarily if not exclusively within local managements control, e.g. factorylayout; materials handling methods; the content and flow of information andthe level of powers delegated within the factory.3. Having grouped the perceived impediments in the way described above, wefurther analysed them according to the level of management at which they were raised.The result is at Table 1.4. We expected that some of the matters we discussed would have greater impact on senior management than on the other levels and that variations in perceptive andcommunicative ability between the groups at the different levels might have some effecton the outcome of our discussions. However we consider it probable that the distribu-tion of comments between the three levels, revealed in Table 1, reflects the way in whichthe discussion sessions were conducted more than any other contributory factor.5. The three levels, senior, middle and junior, (described in Chapter 5) were repre-sented, by number, in the ratio 3:2:5 but their comments occurred in the overall ratio of 3:1:1. The outstanding variation from the overall pattern is the distribution ofcomments on local management practice (line (/) in the Table). These are clusteredin the column for &quot; other levels &quot; and clearly illustrate that problems thought to derive from the actions of superior officers tend to become more concentrated towards thelower levels of the hierarchy.6. Leaving aside the comments on local management practice the frequency withwhich perceived impediments occur in the remaining eight categories (lines (a) to (h)in Table 1) suggests that the three levels of management took somewhat differingviews on the causes of their problems.
7. Senior management reported over 80 per cent of all the impediments they perceivedin the following four categories in descending order of number of comments:Centralised control by MOD of personnel matters.Centralised control by MOD (excluding personnel).Procedural requirements and methods of MOD.Use of common services provided by MPBW/HMSO.8. As we would have expected, senior management showed a strong interest in theirrelationship with the MOD and the effect of central controls on their freedom to makedecisions about critical aspects of the running of tnt, factory. They apparently felt thattheir authority did not match their responsibility and that their freedom of decision and action was inhibited.9. Among the variations from the 3:1:1 overall ratio of impediments perceived atthe three levels of management was the ratio 7:3:1 for common services provided byMPBW/HMSO. Senior management appeared to feel relatively more strongly about this than junior management. This could be because senior management were more likely to remember the time when the costs of works services fell on Defence Votes andMPBW were employed only on an agency basis.10. Middle management directed over 80 per cent of their comments to the samefour features of the system but in a different order of frequency:Procedural requirements and methods of MOD.Centralised control by MOD (excluding personnel).Use of common services provided by MPBW/HMSO.Centralised control by MOD of personnel matters.11. From this it seems that middle management, whilst also concerned about theeffect of MOD control, were particularly affected by the way in which MOD controlswere exercised. Middle managers made frequent comments about the procedures forthe purchase of materials, and for the recruitment of non-industrial staff.12. The list of categories in descending order of the number of comments made byjunior management diverged much further from those for senior and middle manage-ment. Centralised control by MOD of the personnel and other functions still took the top two places but MOD production requirements and procedural requirements ofMOD, and equally, quality assurance arrangements completed the range covered by70 per cent of the impediments perceived at this level.13. In their comments on central control of personnel, the junior managersemphasised the alleged inappropriateness of levels of pay for industrials, and theyclearly also felt impeded in their work by small unco-ordinated production orders. Inaddition, the role of the MOD Inspectorates came in for much criticism.14. The exposure of junior management to the impact on the factories of the MODInspectorates, of changes in production programmes and difficulties in the supply ofembodiment loan items, was reflected in the ratio for quality assurance arrangements(2:2:3) and MOD production requirements (3:1:2).15. A further analysis was directed to establishing whether the perceived impedi-ments bore more heavily on some factory activities than others. The results are atTable 2. We have excluded features (b) (/) and Qi) from this Table because each ofthese bears directly on a single factory activity namely construction and maintenanceof buildings, inspection, and R and D and design work.16. The high number of comments on the construction and maintenance of buildingshas already been noted and this activity is one which was thought to be affected rather more than we might have expected. It may be that the incidence of works services is so high in the ROFs because of the programme of concentration which has been going on over the last few years and because of the age of some of the buildings which may need more maintenance than a modern building. But it is more likely that this topicwas at the forefront because it is work which used to be controlled by the factories.17. Similarly a large number of comments, and rather more than we might have expected, were received about the inspection function. In this context inspectionrelates to the role of the MOD Inspectorates and not to the ROFs&apos; internal qualitycontrol arrangements.
18. Turning to the features which are referred to in Table 2 it will be seen that factoryactivities are affected in the following ways.19. The Vote accounting system (line (a)) affects in particular the planning function(column 1). A similar number of comments was received in respect of the accountingfunction as such (column 9) but in general we think greater emphasis should be placedon the effect in relation to the allocation of orders and the ROFs&apos; inability to planahead for other than short periods with any degree of assurance. The effect on thepurchase of machinery and materials (column 4) can be seen to be slight.20. It will be seen that central MOD control (lines (c) and (d)) has an effect on allfactory activities. Those primarily affected are (1) personnel functions (columns 7 and), in particular recruiting of non-industrials and pay and conditions of service for allfactory employees both non-industrial and industrial and (2) the purchasing and sales functions (columns 4, 5 and 6).21. The next category i.e. MOD production requirements (line (e)) includes a MODcontrol element and, of course, the main effects bear on the planning and productionactivities (columns 1 and 2).22. It will be seen from the distribution of perceived impediments against proceduralrequirements and methods of MOD (line (g)) that a large number fall under the head-ings for machinery purchase (column 4) and non-industrial personnel (column 7). Inthese areas, delay and the operation of rigid and complicated procedures were the factors thought to cause trouble. Few comments were received in respect of the otherfactory activities mainly because in all other main areas (i.e. planning, production,industrial personnel, and accounting) the day-to-day work is done in the factories andthere is not the same reliance on MOD (or other Government departments) for theprovision of a &quot; service &quot;.23. We also related the perceived impediments in the categories used in Table 1 tothe organisational centre, in MOD or elsewhere, responsible for control of the functionsaffected. The results of this analysis are set out in Table 3.24. Since the comments made by factory managers were directed diversely to thefact of control, or the way in which control was exercised, or the centre in which thecontrol was vested for the time being, we have had to adopt some conventions inassigning the groups of impediments to centres. For example, where the perceivedimpediment results from the application of Parliamentary Supply procedure we haveassigned it to the Finance branches of MOD which are responsible for the applicationof those procedures. Where the impact of Government policy is reflected in the rules for the conduct of business within MOD we have assigned the perceived impedimentsto the part of the Ministry responsible for promulgating the rules, thus complaints about the need to seek competitive tenders are logged against the MOD Contractsbranches although the requirement is simply a reflection of Government purchasingpolicy.25. The most noticeable feature of Table 3 is the number of MOD divisions concernedwith the work of the factories. This is because the organisation of MOD is largelyfunctional and the various factory activities shown in Table 2 are the concern of distinctdivisions. The exceptions are that both planning and production functions (columns1 and 2 of Table 2) are the concern of Production branches; and the disposal function(column 6 of Table 2) is associated in the Defence Sales Organisation with sales tocustomers other than MOD (column 5 of Table 2). On the other hand, the MODfunction in relation to non-industrial staff is divided between three branches of the civilian Establishment division. Similarly, the production function is divided between three Production directorates according to the kind of product. In addition to the directly interested parties, the Treasury and the Civil Service Department are indirectly con-cerned but this does not show up in Table 3 because so far as the ROFs are concernedit is the intermediary that is important.26. The distribution of perceived impediments in Table 3 reflects the reaction of therfore management to their dependence on other organisational centres. Their belief that the existence of centralised control (lines (c) and (d)) and the way it is exercised(line (g)) impedes their efficiency is clearly evident; and the concentration of comments,under the two personnel functions (columns 2 and 3) and the contracts function
(column 5) was to be expected since this is where the MOD functions directly affectmanagers&apos; ability to control the resources they need to meet their production pro-grammes.27. The alleged impediments attributable to the Vote accounting and estimatingprocedures are split between column 1 (the finance function) and columns 8 and 9 (therfore HQ and the ROFs). This reflects the &quot; bedded out &quot; finance function in the ROFOrganisation and the greater number of the perceived impediments in this group are properly assigned to the Finance branches.28. We also considered the perceived impediments in relation to the individualfactories at which the comments were raised and the kind of work the factories were doing i.e. process work in the filling and explosives factories (four factories) and engineering batch production in the other seven factories. But we did not think theresult of sufficient interest to include the Tables in the Report. The difficulties which arose from the pay, conditions of service and personnel procedures for non-industrial civil servants were recorded at all factories, but over a quarter of the comments on thesematters came from the three heavy engineering factories and the emphasis was on pay and recruitment. Within this category of perceived impediment only two of the factoriesfailed to mention the problem of control of staff complements where action by MODcould directly affect the production function. The factories commented consistentlyon problems arising from the industrial pay structure and the levels of basic rates of pay but few referred to any difficulties in recruiting industrials. In considering therelative incidence of comments on non-industrial and industrial personnel matters itis relevant to point out that the staff interviewed by the Committee were almost without exception non-industrials and their own problems may have seemed more compellingthan those of their industrial colleagues.29. Not one of the factories was satisfied with the existing relationships with MPBW.Comment was evenly spread which suggested that neither the individual factory northe nature of its activities contributed significantly to the problem.30. All but one of the factories were concerned about the present inspection arrange-ments.31. The incidence of comments on the relationship between the Production branchesand factories indicated that this is a particularly sensitive area for the explosives andfilling factories. The filling factories feel they have too little say in the supply of embodi-ment loan items and seem to suffer particularly from fluctuations in MOD&apos;s require-ments which make difficult the job of planning and programming.32. The comment that the ROFs should be given greater delegated authority inrelation to the purchasing of materials and the recruiting of non-industrials wascommonly made throughout the factories.33. Although they were few in number, comments about the restricted involvementof the factories in design work were made in almost all the factories.34. We would emphasise that it is not necessarily accepted that these perceivedimpediments were real impediments but we are convinced of their importance in thatthey represent the beliefs of the managers with whom we had our discussions. Wetherefore classified all the perceived impediments according to the lowest level in theorganisation which had an interest in the problems and might be expected to have authority to remove them. In Chapter 6 of our Report we compare our own view of thesituation (and we have been assisted by discussions with the MOD branches concerned and the other departments to whom reference has been made), with the views of the managers of the factories as they are reflected in these analyses. In interpreting theresults of this final analysis which appears in Table 4, we have had in mind that thereis a tendency to overstate the extent to which an organisational centre has authorityto eliminate a problem, for example:(1) DGDC could possibly reduce the time spent on placing contracts but only atthe cost of increasing the number of staff employed which is not within hisabsolute authority. Postal delays and the time taken by firms to make theirquotations and to conduct their business are also outside his control.(2) Although MPBW might be able to remove many of the impediments attributedin the works services area, communication would always provide something
of a problem when work had to be planned and contracts placed in officesremote from the factories.35. Recognising the above it will be seen that a substantial number (over 70 per cent)of perceived impediments apparently lie within the control of the Ministry of defence and MPBW and 10 per cent lie within the control of ROF management.36. Elimination of the balance (under 20 per cent) would require changes in policyand procedure at Government or Treasury and CSD level. The principal difficulties inthis area were said to be:(1) Pay rates and conditions of service and the procedures for negotiating them(particularly for industrials) have to conform with those for the remainder ofthe MOD and Civil Service generally.(2) Procedures for the procurement of materials (including the need for competitivetendering and observance of other formal rules and standard conditions of contract) are complex.(3) There is an arbitrary ceiling on the numbers of non-industrials who may beemployed which results in a lack of flexibility in the factories.(4) ROFs must adhere to a Vote accounting and estimating system which is determined by Parliament and which is said to inhibit planning and production.The ROFs cannot determine what is to be done with &quot; profits &quot;.37. Having set out the analysis of the perceived impediments in these 4 Tables and rejected other Tables which have contributed to the examination, we turned to a furtheranalysis. This was based on papers sent in by factory directors at our request after ourvisits to the factories. The papers listed the three impediments which senior manage-ment considered, after reflection, to be the most serious. We found that they covered avery wide area of the total number of perceived impediments which we had recordedbut while they did not conflict in any way with the overall impression we had obtainedfrom the survey of all the material, they could not be correlated with that materialbecause of the way in which both sets of comments had been collected. On the whole,the written comments tended to be rather more specific than the ones we obtained in discussions.

(paragraph 135)A FORM OF TRADING FUND FOR THE ROFs1. The Fund would ultimately become fully self-supporting in the sense that it would pay and be paid for all goods and services which it received and provided, and thepresent arrangements for dealing with some of these on a notional basis would cease.As regards notional income (e.g. SEP, REP) the intention would be for these also tobe cash transactions with the departments concerned.2. Capital at formation. The assets, both fixed and current, relating to ROF trading,the relevant stocks, and the work in progress, would need to be valued at the startingdate and transferred to the Fund to establish its commencing capital debt. The basisof valuation would need to be considered.3. Initial working capital. An initial injection of cash would be required to coverworking capital requirements. If necessary, this sum would have to be assessed at thetime and provided as a specific loan, in addition to the commencing capital debt.4. Borrowing. To the extent that surpluses accumulated (after payment of interest)were insufficient, with depreciation, to meet the cost of replenishing existing assets andother necessary capital expenditure, additional capital might be borrowed from theNational Loans Fund.5. Interest. Interest would be paid by the Fund on the commencing capital debt atrates prescribed by the Treasury. Interest on subsequent injections of capital would beat the normal Treasury lending rates prevailing at the time.6. Repayment of loans. Loans would be repayable by equal instalments over periodscorresponding to the life of the related assets, but the Fund would be free to borrowat current rates of interest for this purpose if necessary.7. Strategic capacity expense. The Trading Fund would not be required to finance the cost of facilities and capacity retained for strategic reasons at the request of theMinistry of Defence, nor any substantial expansion of capacity requested from timeto time by the Ministry of Defence for reasons of strategic necessity. Its costs in respectof these, both current and capital, would be met by a direct subsidy from the Ministryof Defence Equipment etc. Vote in the same way as certain expenses of agency factories and other capital assistance are met at the moment. The data from the managementaccounting system, including the performance indicators would be available to the customer organisations when negotiating the level of subsidy.8. Disposal of surpluses. Initially, surpluses would be retained, possibly subject toCorporation Tax, to provide towards future capital expenditure, and might be invested in consultation with the Treasury; the Fund would also be allowed to retain income from the sale of obsolete assets. However, it would be necessary to ensure that theROFs took full account of the real cost of capital retained in these ways, and to avoid the weakening of the basis for financial control which would occur in the extreme case if the surpluses meant the ROFs had no need for fresh borrowing. Therefore it wouldbe for consideration whether some part of these surpluses should be matched by eitheran equivalent increase in the ROF debt to the National Loans Fund or some form ofGovernment &quot; equity &quot; holding. The disposal of surpluses earned beyond the Fund&apos;s immediate capital requirements would be the subject of consideration by the treasury and special arrangements would also be necessary in the event of the sale of an entirefactory or a substantial portion of a factory.
9. Charges. Charges made by the Fund for work done for the Ministry of defence and other Government departments would be at fixed prices assessed on the basis of cost, including interest on capital and depreciation. For other work, the Fund wouldsell at the best commercial prices it could secure.10. Financial objectives. The aim of the Fund would be to obtain sufficient income to cover interest on capital (5 above) and depreciation. A financial target over and above this would be a matter for consideration.11. Commercial accounts. The commercial accounts and balance sheet of the fund would be prepared and published annually, after audit by the Comptroller and AuditorGeneral and would be open to review by the Public Accounts Committee. The formof the accounts would be a matter for discussion between the Treasury and the Ministryof Defence; for security reasons, it might be necessary to modify the published materialrelating to individual factories.12. Management accounting and performance indicators. The form of managementaccounting and performance indicators used by the Fund would be prescribed by theTreasury and the Civil Service Department and summaries of the data produced wouldbe supplied annually to the Treasury and the Civil Service Department. It would beopen to the Comptroller and Auditor General to check and report on whether thesesystems were being properly used and also, to draw attention to performance as shown by them.13. Status of ROF staff. If it were considered desirable that the ROF staff should retain their status as civil servants under a Fund System, it would be necessary toarrange to include their pay in the Ministry of Defence Civil Pay Vote, and for an equivalent amount to be paid into that Vote from the Fund as Appropriation-in-Aid.Similarly, the Fund would be required to make an appropriate contribution to theCivil Superannuation Vote. If, on the other hand, Civil Service status were not consideredimportant, it might be simpler to convert the ROF Organisation to a &quot; public office &quot;whose staff could, if this were considered desirable, be paid at Civil Service rates,and superannuated within a &quot; Superannuation Act by analogy &quot; scheme. It wouldprobably be necessary to make provision for alternative arrangements of this kind inthe legislation.14. &quot; Allied &quot; Services. All relevant costs of services and supplies (Works, Stationeryetc.) met by other Government departments on the organisation^ behalf would bepaid by the Trading Fund into the Votes concerned.HM Treasury16th October 1969

THE ROYAL DOCKYARDSCHAPTER 1INTRODUCTION1. The terms of reference which we were given by the Prime Minister and minister for the Civil Service when we were appointed on 19 December 1968were &quot; To examine whether the existing organisation and systems of controland accountability of large-scale establishments in the Ministries of defence and Technology, engaged in production, offer impediments to the achievement of full efficiency and to recommend how such impediments should be removed.&quot;2. On 12 June 1970 we submitted an Interim Report on the MOD royal ordnance Factories. Our second report is concerned with the Royal Dockyards.We should explain that on 20 August 1970, the Parliamentary Secretary to theCivil Service Department invited our Chairman to interpret the terms of refer-ence more widely in the second stage of our enquiry. In studying the dockyards,therefore, we have given more attention than we did in the case of the royal ordnance Factories (ROFs) to the fundamental question whether the Ministryof Defence (MOD) need to maintain their own dockyards, and we have con-sidered, in depth, the possibilities of switching the task to the private sector.3. There are some similarities between the ROFs and the dockyards. Theyare both financed by moneys Voted by Parliament and staffed by non-industrial and industrial civil servants whose pay and conditions of service are determinedby the methods we described in our Interim Report. Each organisation is headed by a civilian (but this is a recent development in the dockyards) who is res-ponsible to a Service officer. Within these areas of broad similarity there are some differences e.g. in their day-to-day relationships the dockyards are muchmore closely involved with the Navy than are the ROFs with the Army. More-over, the basic task of the ROFs is to manufacture; that of the dockyards is to convert and repair.4. The atmosphere in which we carried out our task differed too. Changesin the top structure of the organisation in MOD concerned with the operationof the dockyards and the support of the Fleet (which we mentioned in Chapter1 of our Interim Report) have been taking place in the course of our enquiry.These have gone some way towards concentrating responsibility for the dock-yard task, but it is still difficult to define clearly the boundaries of the task andof the organisation responsible for it.* This is in sharp contrast to the closelyknit ROF Organisation. We were also struck by the difference in the attitudeof the staff. Compared with their colleagues in the ROFs who volunteered manysuggestions for changes which they felt would aid efficiency, dockyard manage-ment staff at middle and junior level were relatively uncritical of the system*In Chapter 3 we define the area we have taken to be within our terms of reference.
within which they operated. They stressed that there is no exact parallel to the dockyard task and emphasised the special relationship the dockyards must have with the Navy. This may be due to the essential differences in the tasks of thetwo organisations. The ROFs have a clear cut remit to manufacture firmquantities of closely specified items whereas the dockyards, predominantlyconcerned with repair tasks, often need to use diagnostic procedures to establish the extent of the task. Nevertheless, we were surprised by the extent of the differences in outlook which we found.5. We conducted our examination of the Royal Dockyards on much thesame lines as we followed for the ROFs. We invited MOD to provide us withbrief factual statements and these were followed by a formal presentation atwhich the Chief of Fleet Support (CFS), with the senior officers then concernedwith the management of the dockyards, explained the role and task of the dockyards, the organisation structure and proposals for future developments.Later we visited each of the four dockyards in the UK and made a secondvisit to Rosyth. We spent a day with the Dockyard Department at Bath and received papers from, and had discussions with, MOD representatives on specific aspects of our enquiry (details are given in Appendix A). In additionwe received a paper from the MOD Staff Side and talked with their represen-tatives. We also talked with representatives of the Trades Unions. We met thelatter at dockyard as well as departmental level (details of these contacts are set out in Appendix B). We also discussed possible changes in the financialsystem with the Treasury.6. During our enquiries into the dockyards we have been made aware ofthe activities of several MOD working parties. We understand that the Dock-yard Production Control Study Team has reported recently to the Chief Execu-tive, Royal Dockyards (CED); that recommendations made by the Ship UpkeepInformation Study Group have been accepted by the Admiralty Board and thatthe Defect List Working Party has also reported. In addition, we have seen an interim report of the Working Party on HM Dockyards Management Account-ability. There have also been two concurrent management consultancy exercisesin the dockyards. The first, a study by the Stanwick Corporation of USA onprogramme control, has been completed and we understand that the AdmiraltyBoard have put in hand a departmental feasibility study with a view to validatingthe principles of the recommendations. The second, a study by AssociatedIndustrial Consultants, is directed to establishing a viable productivity indicatorfor use primarily in the application of productivity bargaining schemes recentlynegotiated in the dockyards.7. Two more widely based studies also affect the dockyards. The first isan overall study of the size and content of the Fleet in the long-term and thesupport it will require. This has resulted in changes in the support policy. Sofar as Fleet deployment plans and the loading on individual dockyards will permit, a whole class of ships will be based on one &quot; typed &quot; dockyard, or onedockyard will be the lead yard for a large class. So far as possible, refits will be&quot; streamed &quot; (i.e. carried out at equidistant intervals). This will determine the major parts of the work undertaken by each dockyard in the future. The second is the review by the Headquarters Organisation Committee under the chair-manship of the Permanent Under Secretary of State which covers the MODorganisation as a whole.8.  In our next Chapter we summarise our main findings and recommendations.
SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS AND recommendations the PROBLEM9.  It has been difficult to reach conclusions because:(1) there is no exact parallel to the dockyard task;(2) there is no ready means of measuring output and productivity sincepublished and management accounts do not give a clear picture;; (3) the situation is changing following the appointment of the chief executive, Royal Dockyards and the introduction of a new organisation for the Dockyard Department in June 1970.However, there are symptoms of an unhealthy situation e.g. relatively high levels of overtime and waiting time, apparently low productivity, hints by theUnions that management could be improved and lack of self criticism bymanagers.(Paragraphs 70 to 72)10. Problems arise from the lack of a customer/supplier relationship betweenthe Navy and the Dockyard Organisation. The dockyard aim as defined by theChief of Fleet Support weights the scale on the side of operational requirements and this may be at the expense of dockyard efficiency and cost. The DockyardDepartment largely decides what should be put out to contract and it was difficult to discern the impact of dockyard costs on decision making in theprogramming of refits.(Paragraphs 73 to 81)11. A confusion of roles is even more apparent in the dockyards themselves.These are not clearly identifiable as civilian establishments owing to the high proportion of Naval officers occupying management posts, the involvement ofships&apos; Captains and companies in the dockyard task, the involvement of the dockyards in work for other establishments operating within the same base andthe role of the Area Flag Officer/Admiral Superintendent who is the basecommander with primary responsibility for co-ordinating the use of the resourcesof the base. Together these factors cloud relationships and detract from thestatus of the General Manager and the Chief Executive.(Paragraphs 82 to 84)12. Dockyard expenditure is fragmented over the Votes of MOD, and CEDhas full control only over expenditure on capital equipment. His control overdockyard pay is restricted by the constraints of the Civil Service staffing system.Expenditure on dockyard inputs should urgently be identified so that they canbe related to the value of output to permit comparison between one year andanother.(Paragraphs 89 and 90)\
STATUS13. There are various possible ways of changing the status of the dockyardsto secure more efficient and accountable management:(1) Reversion to Naval control but through a specialist branch. This was regarded as impracticable bearing in mind likely difficulties in recruit-ment, in developing an appropriate system of accountable management and in defining customer/supplier roles.(Paragraphs 93 to 95)(2) Transfer of work to the private sector by absorption into existingshipyards. While some parts of the work could be absorbed, insufficientfacilities are available at present to meet much of the Navy&apos;s needs andit would be hard to justify expansion which left Government facilitiesunused or underused.(Paragraphs 96 to 99)(3) A take-over of the Royal Dockyards by private enterprise, either asowners or major shareholders. The virtual impossibility of raising thenecessary capital from the private sector in the present circumstancesled to the rejection of this as a practical solution but there are other difficulties especially those concerned with separation from the naval base.(Paragraphs 100 to 102)(4) Retention of the dockyards in Government ownership but employingprivate contractors to operate them. This was rejected as unsatisfactoryon the basis of members&apos; experience of the operation of agency factories in time of war emergency.(Paragraphs 103 and 104)(5) The setting up of a public corporation. Like transfer to the private sector, this could lead to clear definition of aims, a separate financial structure and a recognisable trading relationship with the MOD andthe Naval Staff. However, in the absence of competition there wouldhave to be close controls over prices charged, access to information on production costs and make up of prices to enable MOD to ensure thatthey obtained value for money; there would also be constraints overpay and personnel policies. Such a change would have a disruptiveeffect and some of the freedoms gained would be illusory.(Paragraphs 105 to 108)14. The advantages of a separate financial system based on capitalisationof assets, loan financing instead of Vote financing and the production of fullcommercial accounts and balance sheets can equally well be secured by settingup a Trading Fund. We would leave the organisation under direct Ministerialauthority making it easier to control expenditure and costs. We recommend the implementation of this solution via a series of well prepared stages, of which one has already been taken with the appointment of CED.(Paragraphs 109 and 110)RECOMMENDATIONS15.  Our main recommendations are as follows:(1) The aim of the dockyards should be redefined to emphasise the need
to maintain a proper balance between the demands of Naval operations and economic considerations while still importing a sense of urgency.We suggest as a revised definition:&quot;To complete the authorised tasks to the required standards andin the minimum time permitted by the agreed estimate of cost.&quot;(Paragraphs 111 to 114)(2) The task of operating the dockyards should be delegated directly andin its entirety to CED by CFS. The detailed concern of the Area flag officer/Admiral Superintendent with those parts of the base that come under the overall authority of CFS should exclude concern with the dockyard. The title Admiral Superintendent should be eliminated, flag officer becoming the sole title. The exceptional circumstances in whichthe Area Flag Officer&apos;s view must prevail over the view of the general manager or CED, without prior reference to CFS, should be clearly defined.(Paragraphs 115 to 118)(3) The range of functions undertaken by the Dockyard department should be reviewed; the division of responsibilities between the naval staff and the Dockyard Department should secure the distinctionbetween customer and supplier.(Paragraphs 119 to 122)(4) The system for appointing Naval officers to the dockyards should be changed. Instead of an agreed proportion of posts being filled by such officers, there should be &quot; opportunity &quot; posts open to Naval officersand civilians to which appointments should be made on merit. CED andthe Civilian Management divisions should be associated with the selection of candidates for such posts.(Paragraphs 128 and 129)(5) The installation of the proposed new system of Operating Accountsshould be regarded as an essential preliminary to the introduction of aTrading Fund. Progress towards the latter should be planned on thelines sketched by the Treasury but the aim should be to resolve thedifficulties and achieve the changeover by April 1974.(Paragraphs 130 to 136)(6) The accounts of each dockyard should be used, where practicable, forthe purpose of comparing the performance and relative efficiency ofthe UK yards.(Paragraph 132)(7) As a spur to efficiency, there should, where possible, be greater corn-petition with outside yards. This might lead to reconsideration of the overall capacity required. Should a decision be taken to reduce capacityappreciably, it would be preferable to close one dockyard, which mightbe sold off for other purposes, rather than to continue with four under-used yards.(Paragraph 140)(8) A programme for the implementation of our recommendations shouldbe drawn up by MOD.(Paragraph 143)
16.   Further detailed recommendations are made as follows:(1) Wherever possible the physical area and facilities that are wholly underthe control of the General Manager at each dockyard should be precisely denned.(Paragraph 123)(2) The application of the existing Management Regulations to the dock-yards should be rescinded. Instead CED should issue instructions inhis own name on the lines of the practice followed by the Controller,Royal Ordnance Factories.(Paragraph 126)(3) The various sub committees and working parties concerned with the dockyard task should be reviewed with a view to expediting the com-pletion of their task.(Paragraph 127)(4) For all internal purposes MOD should follow normal commercialpractice in estimating, recognising the possibilities of price changes,particularly differential changes between alternative projects.(Paragraph 138)
THE ROYAL DOCKYARDS IN 197017. There are three categories of work involved in the maintenance of theships of the Royal Navy:(1) Maintenance, and the correction of such defects as are within their capacity, is undertaken primarily by ships&apos; companies.(2) A second line of support for maintenance and repair is provided by naval personnel operating from depot ships, or ashore, as FleetMaintenance Units.(3) Maintenance which is beyond the scope of both of these, togetherwith repairs, refits, modernisations and conversions, is undertaken by shore based, mainly civilian manned, organisations operating under aGeneral Manager.It is the task defined at (3) above that we mean when we refer to the dock-yard task and it is the General Managers&apos; departments that we mean when we discuss the dockyards.18. The four home dockyards, Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham andRosyth, each form part of a Naval base, under the command of an Area flag officer/Admiral Superintendent. The base may include, usually outside the dockyard walls, RN Barracks, Hospitals, armament, fuel and victualling depots,and Naval training establishments and, inside the dockyard walls, a FleetMaintenance base (in the process of development), alongside berths with ser-vices for running ships, storehouses, land transport, and port auxiliary craft aswell as berths, docks and workshops equipped with facilities for the refit and repair of ships. We have not covered the dockyard which MOD operates at gibraltar.19. The dockyard task spills over from the General Managers commandinto the other organisations operating in the base area e.g. the Director-Generalof Supplies and Transport (DGST(N)) undertakes the provisioning and storingof materials and certain equipments etc. required for the dockyard task. Con-adversely the General Managers staff provide services for shore establishments in the area e.g. the maintenance of plant and machinery and communicationssystems.20. The General Managers&apos; departments operate (under a headquartersdepartment located at Bath (the Dockyard Department)) as part of the MODin the Civil Service context. Together they employ over 37,000 people of whomabout 28,000 are industrial civil servants. Details are given in Appendix C.Much of what we said about the financial and staffing system in our InterimReport applies. In the following sections of this Chapter, therefore, we mentiononly those features of these systems which reveal differences between the dock-yards and the ROFs.
THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM21. Whereas the ROFs have their own Vote, dockyard expenditure, amoun-ting to approximately  100m per annum, is Voted by Parliament under a totalof eighteen sub-heads spread over four MOD Votes and accounted for by fifteendifferent Vote holders to PUS, PUS(E), or PUS(A) as appropriate. Details forthe financial year 1970/71 are given in Appendix D. In addition, as for theROFs, expenditure incurred by the Ministry of Public Building and Works,which has now been absorbed within the Department of the Environment(DOE), and the Stationery Office on behalf of the dockyards is borne on the votes of those Departments. Unlike the ROFs, there is no published estimatedoperating account. However, the actual expenditure in each financial year is brought together in a Production Account which is published with a balance sheet as part of the Annual Defence Appropriation Accounts. The ProductionAccount also includes the DOE and HMSO expenditure, the dockyards&apos; shareof MOD HQ expenditure, the cost of pensions and gratuities, the contribution in lieu of rates (borne on Treasury Votes) and an allowance for depreciation of buildings, plant and machinery. It also shows notional income from selective employment and Regional Employment Premiums and from Fleet, port and national and miscellaneous charges. The latter credits take account of theproportion of dockyard overhead expenses attributable to the use of the yardsas ports for the Fleet and include an allowance for reserve capacity. No provision is made for a return on capital employed.22. The current arrangements for financial control in relation to the pro-vision of capital facilities require the DOE to seek specific Treasury approval for building and works services undertaken for the dockyards if the estimatedcost is expected to exceed  200,000. A different system of control applies topurchases of dockyard plant. The MOD advise the Treasury, when they submit the annual Vote Estimate, of any individual items included in that Estimatewhich are expected to cost more than  100,000 each. In addition there arespecial procedures for control of expenditure overseas.23. Prior to June 1970 the finance function was undertaken by one of theMaterial Divisions of the Ministry of Defence but since that date it has beentransferred to the Chief Executive^ organisation with special arrangements to safeguard the Accounting Officers control. The organisation is described in a later section of this Chapter.24. As in the case of the ROFs, the Director-General of Defence Contracts(DGDC) is the purchasing authority for the dockyards. The General Managers&apos;staff are directly involved in the purchasing procedures only in respect of contracts in aid of ship repair work, up to  2,000, and orders for plant and machinery for dockyard installations. The rest of their purchasing requirements are handled through the design departments and/or the Director-General ofSupplies and Transport (DGST(N)). These arrangements are also describedlater in this Chapter.THE STAFFING SYSTEM25. The account given in our Interim Report of the staffing system for theROFs applies to the dockyards with two qualifications. The first is that the whitley Councils concerned with negotiating industrial pay are the JointCo-ordinating Committee for Government Industrial Establishments and the
Shipbuilding Trades Joint Council (STJQ. The second is that the dockyardsemploy two classes of professional staff who are found only in the MOD navy department and for whom there are special career planning arrangements.These are the members of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors (RCNC) andof the Royal Naval Engineering Service (RNES). For each there is an officerdesignated as Head of the Service who is concerned alongside the appropriateCivilian Management divisions to secure the maintenance of professionalstandards in recruitment and to oversee the career planning arrangements.These appointments are made on a personal basis and the holders at presentare the Deputy Director-General of Ships (DDG Ships) for the RCNC and theDirector of Engineering (Ships) (D Eng (Ships)) for the RNES. Similarly the dockyard Department at present provides the head of a Joint Personnel service which is concerned with the management of technical and drawing office grades.Details of these arrangements are given in Appendix E.26. Unlike the ROFs, which are wholly civilian manned, the dockyardsemploy some serving Naval officers. Although within the General Managersdepartment there are no posts specifically designated for serving Naval officers,such officers (about 90 at present representing 8 % of the professional manage-ment posts) are posted to dockyard duties* for periods of about three years inthe same way as they are posted to Naval appointments. During their time inthe dockyards they remain subject to the normal terms and conditions of naval service and are subject to Naval discipline. They occupy executive posts inwhich they may take over from and/or be succeeded by a civilian.27. The Dockyard Department, like the ROFs, holds some delegatedauthorities in the field of personnel management and industrial relations fromthe Civilian Management divisions of MOD. The extent of delegation hasrecently been extended by transfer of functions and staff from those divisions to CED&apos;s organisation. Details are given in later sections of this Chapter.THE TASK OF THE DOCKYARDS28. The Production Account for the Financial Year 1968/69 shows that ofa total expenditure of  91-9m, ship construction accounted for  4-4m; capitalwork for dockyard installations  2-2m; work for Fleet bases and shore estab-lishments  10-6m (about 11 per cent); repayment work  l-8m; manufacture and repair for stock  7-lm (nearly 8 per cent), and ship repair and maintenance 65-6m, or just over 70 per cent by value.29.   Thus repair and maintenance now comprises the major part of the dock-yard task. Of this some 60 per cent by value consists of:(1) modernisation and conversion of ships to new roles;(2) long and special refit of fighting ships and other units of the Fleet;the rest is made up of:(3) normal refits and the routine maintenance of the Fleet, (where thisis beyond the capacity of the ships&apos; companies and the Fleet Main-tenance Units) and of Marine Services vessels and Port AuxiliaryService and other MOD craft operating within the dockyard area;(4) accident and emergency repairs not only for the Fleet but also for ships of NATO and other allies (i.e. unprogrammed work).*Naval officers fill agreed proportions of the posts in the different dockyard specialisationse.g. electrical engineers, mechanical engineers etc.
30. Details of the task reach the dockyards from various sources. For new construction, major modernisation and conversions, and alterations and additions to be undertaken in the course of a refit, the Naval Staff definerequirements which are translated into designs and specifications by the designdepartments i.e. Director-General Ships and Director-General Weapons (Navy)and passed on to the dockyards. The design departments assess the require-ments for equipment and fittings and make provision for them through theDGDC. They notify the stores organisation, Directorate-General of supplies and Transport (Naval) (DGST(N)), and in due course, the dockyard eitherreceives the items direct or indents on the stores organisation. For defect andnormal refit work HM Ships prepare defect lists and the Naval Staff notifyoperational requirements. The dockyard assesses the materials requirements and passes details on, in the form of a Materials List, to DGST(N)&apos;s localrepresentative. The latter either supplies from stock or initiates provisioningaction. Thus, for the major part of their materials requirements the dockyardsare not responsible for the ordering and progressing nor for the specificationand inspection.31. As regards the total volume of their work, the periodicity of refits forthe different classes of ships and the timing of refits for any given ship, the dockyards are to a great extent in the hands of the Navy. There is, however,a good deal of negotiation between the Dockyard Department and the naval staff to produce a programme which takes account not only of the requirements for a given ship to be operational at a particular time and the desirability ofships being handled by the dockyard in their home port but also of the require-ments of the dockyards for an even spread of work. The dockyards also provide an advisory service to the Navy on the economics of refitting ships nearing thefinal stage of their useful life and on the necessity for additional defect worknot specified when a ship is taken in hand.32. Although new construction, refits, modernisations and conversions areplanned over a period of ten years, unprogrammed work (which representsonly about 5 % by value of the total dockyard task) can have a disproportionateeffect on dockyard planning and programme control. This kind of work isallocated to a particular dockyard by CED in consultation with the naval authorities.33. The work done for DGST(N), repairing and refurbishing stores andequipment, provides a buffer load in the dockyard workshops which existprimarily to aid the major task of refitting. Similarly, repayment work done for other Government Departments, firms or individuals is marginal &quot; fill-in &quot;work. Civil work is more or less limited to making available to local industriesfacilities which they need from time to time.34. In the main, ship refit and repair work is allocated to the dockyards.Generally it is put out to contract only if the dockyards are overloaded. Dock-yard Department, through DGDC, arranges the contracts with industry. Thetendency is to use private contractors for the Royal Fleet Auxiliaries and toretain in the dockyards the work on HM Ships and also, when geographicallypossible, work on other vessels and craft.THE DOCKYARD ORGANISATION35.  The Chief of Fleet Support (CFS) is the member of the AdmiraltyBoard of the Defence Council having responsibility for all aspects of Fleet
support. This includes the provision of armaments, stores,-fuel, food and clothing and accommodation and transport services in addition to the main-tenance of the Fleet in operational condition whether this is done by the ships&apos;companies, or in Fleet Maintenance bases, or in the dockyards. The chart at appendix F indicates CFS&apos;s range of responsibilities.the chief executive36. Under the CFS, the Chief Executive, Royal Dockyards (CED) has been responsible (since September 1969) for the overall management of the dock-yards. The post of CED replaced a post for a Director-General of Dockyardsand Maintenance whose wider responsibilities included all Fleet maintenance.The latter task now forms part of the responsibilities of a Director-General ofFleet Services, who also reports to CFS. CED is assisted by a headquarters staff of 294, comprising the Dockyard Department.37. CED introduced a new headquarters organisation as from June 1970and he is now supported by three directors as follows:(1) The Director of Dockyard Production and Support (DPSD) who is responsible for the overall planning and control of the programme ofwork in the dockyards and for co-ordinating development of the associated services needed to support that programme. The productionfunction involves deciding the allocation of work between dockyardsand industry; preparing the programme of ship refits for the variousdockyards and maintaining this programme in conjunction with the design departments, the Director-General of Supplies and Transport (N),and the Naval Staff and co-ordinating the repair, by the workshops, of equipment, particularly for the policy of repair by replacement. Thesupport function involves the long term planning of load and capacity and the adjustment of the industrial labour force as regards numbers and balance of trades to match the estimated load both in total and ineach dockyard. Also included is the responsibility for the upkeep ofthe dockyard ship refitting facilities and long term planning for thedevelopment and modernisation of the dockyards both as regardsbuildings and machinery.(2) The Director of Dockyard Manpower and Productivity (DMPD) whois responsible for the overall direction of personnel management andtraining of all personnel employed in the dockyards and for framingpolicies designed to achieve the most effective use of all types of dock-yard manpower and to secure improvements in productivity at all levels.(3) The Director of Dockyard Finance and Administration (DFAD) whois responsible for the financial management of, and accounting for,the dockyard programme (in which matters he is the representative of the accouting Officer-PUS(E)), and for administrative matters concerningDockyard Headquarters. DFAD&apos;s reporting line to the AccountingOfficer is through the Assistant Under Secretary of State for FleetSupport (AUS(FS)) whose role in the dockyard context is similar tothat of AUS(E)AD in the ROF context. In practical terms DFAD is responsible for the preparation of those Vote Estimates for which CEDis the Vote holder and of submissions on these to the Admiralty Board.
He is also responsible for submitting estimates of costs of conversions,modernisations and special and long refits both to the Admiralty Boardand when necessary to the Treasury and for seeking approval for otheralterations and additions to ships. In addition, he provides secretariatservices for the Director of Fleet Maintenance (DFM) and the Directorof Marine Services (DMS).* DFAD is also concerned with the scrutiny of the various management accounting returns submitted by the dock-yards. The consolidation of the Dockyard Production Account is theresponsibility of the Director-General of Defence Accounts (DGDA).38. CED&apos;s authority, which he derives from the Admiralty Board throughCFS, includes:(1) approving expenditure on capital facilities, plant and machinery withinthe limits of the Estimates provision and subject to the rules governingoverseas expenditure;(2) negotiating inclusion of proposals for major works (i.e. those estimated to cost over  20,000) in the seven year investment programme with theDirector of Quartering (Navy) (D of Q(N)).CED delegates part of his authority for expenditure on plant and machinery to the Admirals Superintendent through annual allocations to the AdmiralSuperintendents Machinery Fund and prescribes the procedures for applyingthese funds. Local delegated authority for expenditure on minor works rests with the Area Flag Officer/Admiral Superintendent also but derives from adifferent source. Details are given later in this Chapter.39. In the field of non-industrial personnel management CED&apos;s authority is limited to the recruitment of temporary clerical, technical and drawing officegrades. His powers in relation to industrial staff are restricted only by the requirement for approval of the Estimates for dockyard wages and industrialnumbers, the need to conform with conditions of service and basic rates of paynegotiated centrally for the industrial Civil Service, and to obtain CSD approval for productivity deals.40. DGDC has delegated limited purchasing authority to the dockyards.The Dockyard Department^ role is to authorise, or to make recommendations that DGDC should authorise, dockyard proposals to exceed their delegatedpurchasing limits, or to pass over the lowest tender, or to place orders within their limit of delegation which involve overseas expenditure in excess of  500.In addition, the Dockyard Department provides DGDC with specificationsand advises on the adjudication of tenders for dockyard plant and machinery and major contracts (over  2,000) for ship repair.41. CED has recently arranged to formalise the headquarters control of the dockyard operation through a system of management boards. There will be aDockyard Headquarters Board comprising the three headquarters directorsunder CED chairmanship and a Dockyard Management Board with the samemembership plus the General Managers of the dockyards. CED has indicated that the Dockyard Management Board will meet periodically on a formalbasis to discuss matters of mutual management interest. The Headquarters*Note: These two Directorates operate under the control of DGFS but they are thought to generate insufficient finance work to justify giving them their own finance branches.
Board will be charged with the responsibility of monitoring the performance of individual General Managers in relation to predefined policies and programmes.The best methods of carrying out that process are currently being worked out.the naval command structure42. Before discussing the organisation at dockyard level it may be helpful to describe briefly the Naval structure alongside which the civilian elements ofthe MOD Navy Department operate. Most of the supporting services in the UKunder the control of CFS operate at or near the main Naval bases. These areat the four dockyard ports, and at Faslane and Portland. These bases fit intothe Naval Shore Command structure under a Commander in Chief Naval(Home) Command supported by Area Flag Officers. The posts of Area flag officer and Admiral Superintendent of the base have been combined, except atRosyth where the two posts of Flag Officer, Scotland and Admiral Superin-tendent, Rosyth are due to be combined during 1971.43. The dockyards and other MOD civil establishments such as victuallingyards and store or armaments depots at or closely linked with ports in the command are defined in Queen&apos;s Regulations and the &quot; Management Regula-tions for HM Dockyards and other Admiralty Civil Establishments&quot; asoperational establishments which are functionally part of the Commander inChiefs Command and which exist primarily to meet the operational require-ments of the Commander in Chief and to support the forces under his command.The Regulations go on to state that in respect of operational civil establishmentsthe Commander in Chief has authority and control in regard to the generaltransactions of the Service but he should not interfere with the managementor internal organisation of civil establishments, for which the Superintendentor Head of Establishment is responsible to the Admiralty (now the Ministry ofDefence).the area flag officer/admiral superintendent44. The Regulations define specifically the role of Admiral Superintendent ofHM Dockyards stating that he is responsible for the administration of the dockyard, Naval store and Fleet refuelling, victualling and Naval armamentservices or other civil establishments placed under his authority and that all communications to the Ministry of Defence on matters of policy affectingdevelopment, safety and security and on matters which require local co-ordinationare to be forwarded through him.45. The Admiral Superintendent acts as the Commander in Chiefs re-presentative within the establishment and &quot; is to consider the meeting of Fleetrequirements of the first importance &quot;. He is subject to the Commander inChiefs directions but may make representations to him if he sees serious objec-tions to compliance with an order and report his observations to the MOD ifhe is instructed to comply with such an order. Similarly he is to report to theMOD if he is instructed to carry out any work which requires prior MODapproval in advance of such approval being given.46. The relationship between the General Manager of the dockyard and the admiral Superintendent has also been defined in the Management regulations which state that the General Manager will act under the authority and general direction of the Admiral Superintendent and that the Admiral Superintendent
will npt..pver744e;&amp;e..m^gpmerit functions of the General Manager;unless,fpr^particular and sufficient, cause, in which event he will forward a report tothe MOD. In addition, the General Manager is required to. keep the AdmiralSuperintendent generally informed of the progress of the work under his controland of its problems., ........47. The principal areas where other responsibilities vested in the AdmiralSuperintendent have an impact on the General Manager are:(1) Financial provision for maintenance and minor works for the dock-yard is made (as for the ROFs) in DOE Votes and block allocationsare made by the Commander in Chief to Admirals Superintendent tocover the work required within their segment of his command, thus the General Managers department has to compete for funds with theother establishments within the Area Flag Officer/Admiral Superin-tendenfs purview.(2) CED as the Vote holder for expenditure on dockyard plant and machinery has inherited a system whereby an allocation of part ofthe money available is made to an Admiral Superintendents MachineryFund at each dockyard port. These funds must be used to finance ailpurchases and contract repairs up to a cost of  1,500 per item (exceptfor items within this price bracket which are associated with a majorworks project) and may be used for items costing up to  10,000. Theprogramme for expenditure from the fund is subject to approval by theChief Executive and the General Manager operates purchasing pro;procedures within rules laid down by CED, but, by implication,&apos; the AreaFlag Officer/Admiral Superintendent is still the responsible authority.the general manager48. The context in which the dockyard task is organised and the constraintswithin which the General Manager operates have been changing over a periodof 10 years and the rate of change has increased since the appointment of CED.The present situation is that in the UK the General Manager is supported by a planning manager, a production manager, a yard services manager, an organi-sation and review manager, a productivity manager, a personnel manager1 anda finance manager. The yard services manager, personnel manager and thefinance manager provide services to other establishments within the base and toneighbouring establishments. On these matters they are responsible to the admiral Superintendent through the Head of the &quot; customer &quot; establishmentfor the execution of the work. In accounting matters the finance manager has afunctional responsibility to DFAD and a technical responsibility to DGDA.At Rosyth and Chatham there is also a nuclear power manager. .;, 1649. The day-to-day planning and control of the dockyard production taskis the responsibility of the General Manager who, within the overall head&apos;quarters policy and the programme agreed with the Naval Staff, has authorityto plan the stages of the refit programme and allocate and reallocate the available resources as necessary. His control is, however, subject to direction by CED inrespect of programme changes which may be agreed between the DockyardDepartment, the Naval Staff and Fleet authorities.50. The General Manager has substantial freedom in the field of industrial relations generally and productivity bargaining in particular. He may recruit
industrials within the total numbers approved by CED and apprentices withinthe numbers approved by CED trade by trade. Within the rules promulgatedas part of the Management Regulations for HM Dockyards and other CivilEstablishments (which are consistent with agreements on pay and conditionsof service negotiated centrally for Government industrial staff generally) theGeneral Manager may:(1) nominate industrials for establishment (dealing direct with the CivilService Commission on individual cases);(2) dismiss unestablished workers and declare redundancies up to a limit of 25;(3) decide the grading of industrials within the broad structure of thecentrally agreed pay system;(4) agree piecework rates and negotiate other kinds of incentive systems,including productivity bargains, subject to guide lines issued by CEDand agreements reached on the STJC and, in respect of new schemes and productivity bargains, subject to the approval of the Civil service department.51. At present the General Manager has no direct authority over the recruitment, promotion or dismissal of non-industrial staff except in respect of temporary clerical staff. But the General Managers are consulted on individualsposted in by the Civilian Management divisions and, with the exception of thestaff of the finance managers department (who are outposted staff of DGDA&apos;department) the placing of such staff is the responsibility of the General Manager.General Managers do not influence the selection of Naval officers and on occasion, the Naval authorities may specify the department in which a naval officer posted to the dockyards is to serve.52. The special career planning arrangements for members of the RCNCand the RNES result in their annual appraisal reports not being seen by CED.This is an accident of the system whereby a senior officer of eachservices is appointed on a personal basis as Head of the Service. The RCNCis always headed by an officer in DG Ships but the RNES may be headed either by an officer of that Directorate-General or by an officer of the DockyardDepartment. The system is reasonably satisfactory to the Dockyard Departmentwhen they provide the Head of the RNES but now both appointments are heldby officers in DG Ships and the top management of the Dockyard Departmentmay be bypassed they have less influence on the career development and postingof individuals.53. The General Manager has only limited purchasing authority. In respectof dockyard plant and machinery, tenders are issued by the dockyard for itemsexpected to cost up to  2,000. Those for which the quotation is under  1,000may be accepted locally, within the regulations for purchasing laid down byDGDC. Above that price, and if overseas expenditure is involved, or if it is desired to accept a tender other than the lowest, reference to CED is necessary.In respect of contracts in aid of ship repairs the local purchase limit is  2,000.Consideration is being given to increasing this to  5,000.project managers54. Because a functional system of basic organisation necessitates special arrangements for co-ordination of the various aspects of work to be done onie f75
any given project, from time to time, individual officers have been designated as co-ordinators of specific projects. These people have been described by various titles such as ship&apos;s superintendent, project co-ordinating officer,programme controller and, latterly, project manager. Their responsibilitieshave been as varied as their titles and have ranged from liaison and co-ordinationto supplement (or replace) the dockyard information system at one end of thescale to something approaching management responsibilities at the other end.55. In many instances their terms of reference do not make the projectmanager accountable for the resources he is allocated nor is he held responsiblefor any aspects of the work other than the completion of the task by the requireddate. In other words, the line management responsibilities for the variousdockyard functions remain undisturbed and the project managers&apos; functionsare superimposed upon the basic organisation. There is one exception, however,where the project manager is a deputy manager and retains line managementresponsibilities.RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE MOD56.  The principal contacts of the dockyards and the Dockyard Departmentfall into four groups:(1) the Directorates-General under the Controller of the Navy which,together with:(2) the Directorates-General under the Chief of Fleet Support; form the operational segment of the Navy Department within which the dock-yard organisation operates;(3) the functional administrative divisions of the MOD including the civilian  Management divisions,  the finance  divisions  and  theDirectorates-General of Defence Contracts and of Defence Accounts.These are the divisions responsible for ensuring that the requirementsof the Civil Service staffing, purchasing and financial systems areobserved throughout the MOD;(4) the Naval Staff, the operational commands and the ships&apos; Captainswho are the users of the end product of the dockyard effort.Less frequently the dockyards are in touch with the Directorate of naval officer Appointments in connection with the Service officers posted to the dockyards and, of course, the work of the research and development adminis-tration under the Chief Scientist affects their task indirectly.57. Contact with some of the groups is primarily a matter for the DockyardDepartment but with others the dockyards themselves are the main point of contact; some of the contacts are made formally through a system of committees;for Polaris projects there is a special group comprising representatives of eachof the parties concerned; in other instances the contacts are made in day-to-daydiscussions and exchanges of correspondence at the various working levels.58. CED is a member of, or is represented on, three major committeesconcerned with the dockyard task. The first of these, the Ship CharacteristicsCommittee which operates under the chairmanship of the Controller - of theNavy provides a forum for CED to express the dockyard view in relation tothe design and alteration of ships. The second committee, the Ship AvailabilityCommittee, chaired by CFS, is concerned with aspects of ship maintenance
policy affecting operational availability. A sub-committee of this Committee,under the chairmanship of CFS&apos;s Naval Assistant, keeps the Naval Staffinformed of progress of dockyard work. The third committee, the DockyardShip Repair Policy Committee, is chaired by CED&apos;s Director of Production and support (DPSD) and is charged with determining and examining the problems and making recommendations on the procedures to be adopted, the facilities and equipment necessary and the techniques and processes required for the efficient and expeditious repair of warships; on the support facilities and yardservices required for refitting and maintaining these ships and on the trainingof personnel.59. No less than nineteen directorates/divisions are represented on these committees. Details of the membership are given at Appendix G. Thesecontacts and the parallel day-to-day contacts, both formal and informal, atworking level concern mainly the section of CED&apos;s organisation under DPSD.In addition, the support element of DPSD&apos;s work involves formal and informalcontact with the Director of Quartering (Navy) (D of Q (N)) (within CFS&apos;sgroup of directorates-general and directorates) and DPSD&apos;s staff also formthe link between the General Managers&apos; departments and the Directorate-General of Defence Contracts.60. General Managers&apos; departments&apos; contacts reflect those of the DockyardDepartment but they have special links with the DGST(N) organisation atdockyard level and, at some dockyards, there is a designated unit of the PrincipalSupply and Transport Officers (PSTO(N)) staff (described as the MATCOG)which is concerned solely with processing the demands of the dockyards forstores handled by the DGST(N) organisation. There are close associationstoo, on building and maintenance work and with the other shore establishmentsfor which the General Managers&apos; departments provide services.61. Within the third category of divisions mentioned in paragraph 56, theprincipal contact is with Mat Co-ord (N) which, as its name implies, is con-cerned with the co-ordination of Estimates, etc. and overall control of expendi-ture on the MOD Production and Ship Repair Votes and with the presentation of consolidated figures to the Defence Council and the Treasury. DFAD himselfperforms a co-ordinating function within CFS&apos;s organisation for finance andsecretariat work for DMS and DFM.62. Personnel administration has been somewhat simplified since the labourmanagement function was taken over by CED from the Labour Division.DMPD&apos;s organisation will maintain contact with the Assistant Under Secretaryof State responsible for the industrial aspects of civilian personnel management,AUS(CM)I, to ensure that departures from common Civil Service practicerelating to industrial pay and conditions in the dockyards are made only inthe full knowledge of the differences and after consideration of the possible repercussions. The object is to allow the dockyards to develop an industrialpay structure suited to their needs while avoiding any conflict with the pay structure of Government industrial staff employed by other departments.63. The contacts on non-industrial staff still remain with the CivilianManagement divisions and the Heads of the RCNC and the RNES (see AppendixE). There is a different link at dockyard level where the finance manager andhis staff are outposted staff of the Directorate-General of Defence Accounts
and look to that organisation for their future advancement and not  to the dockyard Department. ,&apos; &apos;64. The most complex relationships are those in the fourth category. the dockyard operates in relationship to the Area Flag Officers role as AdmiralSuperintendent and also to his role as representative of the users of the ships which the dockyard repairs (i.e. the Commander in Chief Western Fleet whoseChief Staff Officer (Technical) represents him on the Ship Availability Committee(see Appendix G)). The commanding officer of a ship is responsible for thematerial state of his ship and he retains that responsibility during the time thatthe vessel is in dockyard hands unless the ship is decommissioned and placed under dockyard control. Ships are normally decommissioned only for moderni-sations and conversions and special refits extending over a considerable period.Therefore the greater part of dockyard work is done under the eye of the captain of the ship who remains responsible for the safety of his ship. The ship can been dangered while in dockyard hands principally by accident, when docking orundocking or being moved within the dockyard, and by fire. The respectiveresponsibilities of ships&apos; Captains and dockyard staffs are set out in detail inQueen&apos;s Regulations for the former and in the Management Regulations forHM Dockyards and other Civil Establishments for the latter. To guard againstthe second of these dangers the Captain of the ship posts fire patrols as a precaution when any dockyard activity with a significant fire risk is being undertaken.65. A ship&apos;s Captain is also responsible under Queen&apos;s Regulations forreporting to the Admiral Superintendent &quot; any negligent workmanship, idlenessor any other irregularity on the part of the workpeople on board which heobserves or which is brought to his notice by the ship&apos;s officers.&quot; In practice the Captain might approach the dockyard management in preference to goingto the Admiral Superintendent if he were not content with the way in whichthe work was being done. As the various parts of the work in hand are com-pleted the Captain accepts the work progressively from the dockyard and theship&apos;s company takes over responsibility for maintenance of the systems soaccepted.66. Inspection of new work and new systems is carried out by the Navalschools concerned with the various aspects of the ship&apos;s equipment, e.g. gunnery,navigation and so on. In addition DGW(N) supplies testing and timing teamsto set weapons systems to work and these teams carry out their task alongside the dockyard staff. This close relationship with the ship&apos;s company is peculiar to the dockyards where the management is responsible for quality assuranceand the Naval Overseeing Service does not operate. In a contractors yard theOverseeing Service is interposed between the builders and the ship&apos;s company and, in the early stages, the Overseers accept the work as it is completed. How-ever, when the task progresses to the point where systems accepted need main-tenance, the ship&apos;s company moves in, as in the dockyards, and progressivelyaccepts the completed work.RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT67.  Although the arrangements for the provision of building and works services for the dockyards follow the same pattern as those for the ROFsthere are substantial differences in the relationships. There are two reasons for
this.. First, the Director of Quartering (Navy) has responsibility, for all; building and works services questions for the MOD Navy Department and provides abuffer between the dockyards and the DOE. Secondly, the complex in whichthe dockyards are located is so much larger than that formed by individualROFs that there is always a local DOE depot or area office usually concernedsolely with building and works services for the adjacent Naval installations.68. The concentration of Naval installations within the work load of asingle unit of the DOE organisation makes it much easier to adjust prioritiesbetween the various &quot; customers &quot; of the depot and it is in this field that theArea Flag Officer/Admiral Superintendent can exercise a co-ordinating rolewhich is reinforced by his powers to approve estimates for maintenance workand authorise such work without reference to the CED&apos;s department..69. In order to smooth the path for the major modernisation programme,the local organisation has been strengthened under arrangements initiated byCED, by the appointment of joint project teams comprising dockyard, D ofQ (N) and DOE staff.
THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEM70. In making our assessment of the impediments to the achievement of full efficiency in the Royal Dockyards we have faced two problems whichwe did not meet in our study of the ROFs. First, there is no exact parallel tothe dockyard task in the UK so we had no frame of reference for pur judgementof their efficiency. Secondly, there is no ready means of measuring output and productivity in the dockyards. The published accounts do not crystallise thefinancial position and the various management and accounting returns do not give a clear picture of the situation. Thus we could say, with confidence, thatwe found the ROFs well managed and controlled and showing evidence of cost consciousness, but in relation to the dockyards we have had to rely mainly on general impressions as these emerged from our visits to the dockyards andto Bath and from our discussions with the MOD, the Treasury, and the staff associations and Trade Unions representing the dockyard employees.71. From the point of view of industrial efficiency we found a number ofsymptoms of an unhealthy situation. These included a relatively high level of overtime working not justified by the urgency of the work in hand; a level of waiting time assessed variously by management and the Trade Unions as 5 percent and 25 per cent; low productivity, albeit judged by a rather rough and ready method; hints by the Unions that management could be improved; anda surprising lack of self criticism on the part of the managers.72. These symptoms had been recognised by MOD and were being tackled.The resultant changing situation has complicated our task somewhat. We have tried, nevertheless, to identify the underlying causes.73. We asked ourselves what the dockyards should be trying to do andwhether the present organisational and financial structures enabled them to doit. In following this line of enquiry we kept in mind that the outline of the dockyard task emerges from the conclusions reached about the following:(1) the proportion of the total complement of ships that must be operationalat any given time;(2) the extent and timing of modernisations and conversions, alterationsand additions necessary to bring ships up to the required operationalcapability;(3) the requirement for overhaul that is inherent in the care of anymechanical device;(4) the defects that can develop in any sophisticated weapons or com-munication system;(5) the accidents that can happen to any ship.
THE DEFINITION OF THE AIM OF THE DOCKYARDS74. As we see it, the task of the dockyards is to effect such new construction,modernisations, conversions or repairs as the Navy may call upon them to execute, and their aim should be to carry out this task on the basis of resolvingan equation which would take into account:(1) the increased cost of carrying out the necessary work if the quickestpossible turn round was the only objective, and(2) the reduced cost of executing the work if greater latitude were to beallowed in turn round time.In our view, what is required is that a sensible and reasonable balance shouldbe maintained between these two conflicting factors. The point of sensible and reasonable balance will, of course, not be constant. Changes in foreign policyand domestic economic policy, advances in technology and crises in inter-national affairs are among the factors which may affect the balance at any time.75. The real efficiency of the dockyards will, in our submission, largely depend upon MOD&apos;s success in settling the correct value of each of these twoconflicting pulls and upon the dockyards carrying out their task efficiently onthe basis of the balance so arrived at.76. The difficulties of crystallising the aim of the dockyard organisation intounderstandable terms have been recognised by the Chief of Fleet Support.The conflicting pulls of industrial efficiency and the needs of the Fleet were referred to in our earliest discussions with the MOD. CFS indicated that thefinal determination of the aim of the dockyards must comprehend cost effectivemanagement of the Fleet and the dockyards but defined the aim for the timebeing as &quot;to complete the authorised tasks to the required standards in theminimum time &quot;. We understand that this has now been altered to read &quot; toprovide the optimum operational availability of ships for the Fleet&quot;.77. Both definitions weight the scale on the side of the operational require-ments and might, in practice, inhibit rather than promote the achievement ofdockyard efficiency. If the MOD were dealing with an outside contractor eachof the two conflicting pulls would operate to secure a reasonably balancedcompromise but in the case of the dockyards it was almost impossible to discerna customer/supplier relationship such as exists in industry and such as we foundin the ROFs.RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MOD AND THE NAVY78. The Dockyard Department organisation which we described in theprevious Chapter has been in existence only since June 1970 and represents thefirst stage of organisational evolution following the appointment of CED.79. The new organisation is intended to strengthen the management role ofthe Dockyard Department and, to this end, CED intends to introduce new techniques of control of the dockyards through a system of management boards and a comprehensive accounting and management control system. Until CEDwas appointed there was no formalised oversight of the dockyards&apos; performancefrom the Dockyard Department and the yards depended wholly on DGDA for guidance on costing and management accounting systems. The DockyardDepartment was concerned with the technical and professional aspects of theproduction task but it operated as an administrative headquarters departmentrather than as the apex of a production organisation.
80. Thus the planning function at headquarters seemed to be largely con-cerned with adjusting the programme to the changing requirements of theNavy and the restrictions stemming from political decisions about the size ofthe Navy and the labour force to be employed by the dockyards. It was difficultto discern the impact of dockyard costs on any of the decision making in this area. We gained the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the Dockyard Depart-ment was not over-ready, or perhaps not able, to influence the Navy&apos;s demands.Where this was done, e.g. in relation to the decision to undertake a final refit,we gathered that the effective argument took place at Board level and was putby CPS.81. Estimates of costs of major refits were approved formerly by theDirector-General of Dockyards and Maintenance as the head of a headquartersdepartment acting on behalf of the Admiralty Board. Again, as a headquartersdepartment advising the Admiralty Board, the Dockyard Department plays alarge part in making decisions on which refits should be put out to contract and which tenders for refitting should be accepted. These are the decisions of acustomer and to leave them with the Dockyard Department conflicts with thenew role of the Department which CED is developing and creates some confusionof role.82. The confusion of roles is more apparent in the dockyards themselves.They are not clearly identifiable as civilian establishments operating within a civilian command because of the high proportion of Naval officers occupyingprofessional management posts and the extent to which the dockyard functionis carried out alongside the ships&apos; companies and, in some instances, under theeye of the Captain of the ship. The division of responsibilities between the dockyards and the other establishments operating within the same Naval baseis not clear because the provisioning function is carried out by DGST(N)&apos;slocal outport staff and the rest of the civilian and Naval establishments withinthe base look to the dockyard for various services e.g. the maintenance of plant,telephone systems etc.83. Moreover, the Naval Shore Command which provides for an Area flag officer/Admiral Superintendent as base commander with primary responsibilityfor co-ordinating the use of the resources of the base (including those controlled by the General Manager), tends to place the Navy in the role of supplier as wellas customer. The arrangement detracts from the status not only of the general manager but also of CED. And it clouds the relationships between them.84. Although the relationships of the Area Flag Officer/Admiral Superin-tendent have recently been under review, we understand that he is still to retainauthority to intervene in the management of the dockyard if in his opinion aparticular and sufficient cause shall render it necessary. It may be that whilethe dockyards operated under a Naval head, like the other Fleet support unitsunder CFS&apos;s command, this element of dual control raised no problems that could not be solved by the observance of Naval protocol or reference to Queen&apos;sRegulations or the Management Regulations. However, while we understandthat interventions by the Area Flag Officer are likely to be very rare, we seeconsiderable risks that the residual powers he retains may strain relationships,at local and higher levels.85. We believe, too, that the staffing system which we discuss in the nextsection of this report is not well adapted to the new style organisation CED iscreating.
-aoo THE EFFECT OF:THE STAFFING SYSTEM   ^    1&quot;&quot;86. &quot;It seems to us that the advantages of short term secondment of naval officers to the dockyards are mainly those of broadening the experience and adding to the expertise of individual officers. We accept that Naval officers are often of unusually high ability and that appropriately qualified and highly trained officers have made valuable contributions in particular jobs in the dockyards. It is&apos; more difficult to accept that there would consistently be sufficientofficers so qualified to maintain a steady proportion of the professional manage-ment posts. CED has little or no influence over the selection of the Naval officersand it is not unknown for the Naval authorities to specify the type of post towhich a particular officer should be assigned.87. Although the rest of the professional management posts are filled by officers of the RCNC and the RNES whose training and qualifications arespecifically relevant to dockyard management, CED is not in any significantlystronger position in relation to their selection and career development becauseof the way in which these two groups of staff are managed for career purposes.In practice the RCNC and the RNES each has an agreed quota of posts in the dockyards but, again, these are not designated posts and like the Naval officers the RCNC and RNES rotate between dockyard and other postings in MOD at intervals.88. To fill the professional management posts in this way tends to run counter to continuity and the evolution of a dockyard orientated approach to management. We understand that as a result of the implementation of therecommendations of the Fulton Committee some change in the position asregards the RCNC and the RNES is in prospect. It is likely that they willbecome part of a larger group of staff whose careers will be managed with more regard to the need for the development of specialisations relevant to thejobs to be performed. We return, later in this report, to the arrangements for naval officers to serve in the dockyards.THE EFFECT OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM89. We have commented in paragraph 21 on the fragmentation of the dockyard expenditure over the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and on thenumber of Vote holders concerned in bringing this expenditure to account.CED has full control, only, of his expenditure on capital equipment. He isalso the Vote holder for industrial pay but can only influence the amount of pay by the incentive schemes and productivity bargains he is able to negotiate(through his General Managers). The starting point for industrial pay remains the rates agreed centrally for the industrial Civil Service generally.90. We accept that the approach to estimating dockyard expenditure andobtaining the necessary funds from Parliament is consistent with the determinedefforts that have been made in the recent past to regard the Defence service as a single entity and to eliminate the former separation of Defence expenditure between the Army, Navy and Air Force. But we think that, in presenting the overall picture and necessarily concentrating on inputs rather than outputs, theMOD Estimates have become less informative about dockyard expenditure.The task of the dockyards is readily distinguishable as an output which requires a mixed input of personnel and materials. In our view it is urgently necessaryto identify the expenditure on dockyard inputs so that the cost of inputs can beie g83
related to the value of the output. The two sets of figures should be presented in such a way as to permit some assessment, however limited, of the perform-ance of the dockyards in one year as compared with another.91. Whilst broad records of expenditure are maintained, the managementinformation systems generally are not yet sufficiently sophisticated to monitorindividual projects.CONCLUSION92. To suni up, we&quot; found the dockyards in. a half way&apos;stage &quot;between a naval management (with its background of Naval tradition which breedsparticular loyalties) and civilian management introduced advisedly &quot;with- theintention of changing the outlook of the dockyards and putting MSrS emphasis on operating costs. We have been kept in touch with the developing orgahisatitiriand we support the changes that CED has introduced. But managerHenf :carffifetbe held fully accountable unless the organisation can be given a clearly denrie;daim, freedom to manage the resources allocated to it, and clear-cut rel^tidfiShipwith its customers. We examine in the next Chapter the possible wa^s ofLigivni&apos;gthe organisation the new status it requires.
B    , A NEW STATUS FOR THE DOCKYARD ORGANISATIONir:93--; We^ojasidered whether the conversion of the dockyards into a civilianmanaged organisation was inevitable. We had in mind that both the Army andtbe-RpyakAh^ Force have substantial maintenance and repair organisations which;are under military control although at the working level they are mainly$y^Jijm manned. We invited the Army organisation, REME, to let us have someindorsation about the way they manage the repair and overhaul of fighting vehicles,, This task seemed to us similar in kind and content, if not in size and complexity, to ship repair and refitting. On the analogy of REME, a possible solution for the dockyards would be to create a specialist branch of the royal navy concerned only with dockyard management. This would meet ourcriticism of the present system of short term postings but at the expense of thefacility for familiarising serving Naval officers with the dockyard task and feeding recent operational experience into the dockyards. The Navy sets a highvalue on this facility.94. However there are already difficulties in obtaining sufficient suitablerecruits for the Navy and we think these would be greater in respect of aspecialised dockyard service. Even if the personnel could be recruited wewould have serious doubts whether a management, which would be subject to naval discipline and would no doubt be expected to operate the dockyardsaccording to detailed regulations, would be able to develop a system of account-able management with the appropriate degree of delegation of authority. this we regard as essential to the effective operation of the very complex task of the dockyards. Moreover without significant changes in the method of financing itwould be even more difficult than at present to define the customer/supplierroles.95. To sum up, we could not produce any serious arguments in favour of a wholly Naval management structure to sustain a recommendation that MODshould reverse the decision they made last year to move towards a civilianstructure for the dockyards. We see the right solution of the cost/time equation,which we spelled out in our previous Chapter, as the essence of efficient operationof the dockyards and the establishment of the right relationships as an essential preliminary. We believe the appointment of CED was an important step in theright direction. Indeed, we wonder if the MOD have gone far enough and we discuss the further possibilities below, starting with the extreme form of separa-tion which would be to switch the dockyard task to the private sector.THE POSSIBILITY OF SWITCHING THE WORK TO THE PRIVATESECTOR96.

We believe the appointment of CED was an important step in theright direction. Indeed, we wonder if the MOD have gone far enough and we discuss the further possibilities below, starting with the extreme form of separa-tion which would be to switch the dockyard task to the private sector.THE POSSIBILITY OF SWITCHING THE WORK TO THE PRIVATESECTOR96. Our terms of reference are concerned with dockyard efficiency and wehave therefore tried to test the various solutions we have considered in relation
to their possible effect on the dockyards. We have not looked at these possibility-facilities in relation to overall Naval efficiency: Thus, in considering the possibility-facilities of using private contractors in place of the dockyards we have ignoredpossible effects on Naval recruitment, morale, etc., of divorcing ships fromtheir home ports, and we have made.no attempt to assess any likely repercussions on the distribution of maintenance and repair work between the Fleet Main-tenance Units and the contractors for the dockyard task. We have simplyconcentrated on assessing whether, in principle, the work could be done in private yards and whether in practice the transfer to the private sector couldbe achieved.97. There are some essential differences between ship construction and shiprepair. These include the capital facilities and the balance of trades required and the relative difficulty of assessing the work package and quoting a price for repair work. The basic techniques of construction and repair and the craftsand skills employed are, however, the same and so are the materials. Construc-tion is extensively entrusted to private yards not only in the UK but also inother Western European countries and in the USA. We cannot see anythinginherent in repair work to prevent it, too, being done in private yards. Alreadythese yards undertake refits of commercial-type Fleet Auxiliaries. western germany, we understand, relies on contractors for repair work, organising the Naval yards exclusively to undertake work such as gunnery, radar andsonar which is outside the scope of the commercial yards.98. In theory there are two possible ways of switching the work to the private sector. First, by absorption into the existing shipyards and, secondly, by arranging for the Government owned facilities in the Royal Dockyards to betaken over by private enterprise as outright owners, major shareholders, or asagents who would operate the yards on behalf of the Government. In practice,we doubt if either of these is feasible.99. Our own view, which we have checked through a contact in the Industry,is that few docks of sufficient size to take the largest Naval ships are currentlyavailable in the United Kingdom. It is unlikely that the owners or operators of these facilities would be prepared to commit a large dock for the period(two or three years) which is needed for a modernisation, conversion or specialrefit. To do so would prevent the yards from meeting their normal commitments for work which involves only short term dockings and permits more intensiveuse of these facilities. The situation would be less critical in respect of workrequiring the use of smaller docks. Minor repair work would probably present no problems. It seems likely, therefore, that some parts of the work could be absorbed over a comparatively short period and the proportion might increase as time went on but it is clear that the private sector could not meet the wholeof the Navy needs for modernisations, conversions and special refits without some expansion of their existing facilities. This would be hard to justify if, asa corollary, Government owned facilities were left unused or under-used.100. We went on therefore, to consider whether it would be feasible for private enterprise to take over the Government owned facilities. In this con-text we have had to take account of the fact that the dockyards are physicallyintegral parts of Naval bases and that it is extremely difficult to visualise completeisolation of the dockyard and its installations from the port and Naval base
facilities. This would make it difficult, although not impossible, to have a privatecontractor operating in the port complex.101. In our view, a major problem would be that of raising the capital whichwould be required to operate the dockyards as a private venture. We could not envisage a prospectus for a ship repairing organisation sufficiently attractive to secure the necessary funds. But we did not wish to abandon the possibilityof such a transfer without some independent assessment. Our Chairmanaccordingly took advice informally from various financial institutions.102. As a result we came to the conclusion that, to all intents and purposes,it would be impossible to raise the necessary capital from the private sector inthe present circumstances. It seems therefore that it must be accepted that the dockyards must continue to depend on capital provided by the Government.103. This does not mean, of course, that they need to remain within theMOD organisation nor that they must be run by the present mixture of Navaland Civil Service personnel. There are two possibilities:(1) the Government could retain ownership and turn the enterprise overto commercial management;(2) the dockyards could be turned into a public corporation.104. We feel we must dismiss the first of these two almost out of hand. the agency factory arrangement has, we know, been used fairly extensively in times of war emergency but those of us who have had direct experience of itsworking are satisfied that this is the way to get the worst of both the commercial and the Government Department worlds. We would certainly not recommend it for the dockyards. We set out the arguments for and against a public corporation in the next section of this report.ACHIEVING A NEW STATUS WITHIN THE PUBLIC SECTOR105. In the main, the advantages which would be gained from switching the dockyards&apos; task into the private sector can be used to support a case for settingthem up as a public corporation. In our view, such a change of status for the dockyards would have the following beneficial effects:(1) there would be a clear definition of the aims and responsibilities of theorganisation;(2) the organisation would have a separate financial structure and move into a trading relationship with the MOD and the Naval Staff;(3) precedent suggests that the financial structure would involve capitalisa-tion of assets, funding by loan finance for normal trading activities andby Vote finance only in respect of any requirements of the MOD whichconflicted with the commercial interests of the organisation and tocover any trading deficits. Precedent also suggests that the organisation would be required to achieve a return on capital employed whichwould be fixed by the Treasury, and to service loan capital. This wouldreveal the true resource cost of the dockyards and make a contributionto realistic decision making in Defence (Naval) matters;(4) orders placed with the organisation would be on the basis of contractsnegotiated by MOD in the same way as orders placed with yards in theprivate sector.
106. These changes would enhance the ability of the managers to controltheir resources but some of the freedoms gained would be illusory. The dockyardtask is almost wholly on Government account and the costs are borne on theDefence budget. At present there is virtually no competition for Naval repair work. Thus there would have to be close control over the prices charged by apublic corporation because of the MQD&apos;s -responsibility for ensuring that theyobtain value for money. The MOD,&apos; as customer, would require to establish thatthe methods employed by the dockyards were efficient and to be able to enquire into production cdstsrand;the make up of prices.&apos;!? O niVTP. W&apos;3&apos;A A107. In the sphere of ship and weapons design and development and the impact on the repair task of new designs there would have to be the&apos;same close collaboration between the dockyards, the design authorities and thfe Navy%sexists today. If the creation of a hived off dockyard orgamsatioripreyeniteb;;thfefree interchange of staff between the design and development authorities1 jahdthe dockyards there would be some disadvantages on both sides. If arrangements were made to enable such exchanges of staff to continue, the hived off organisa-tion would effectively be tied to Civil Service pay and conditions;of seryice,thereby reducing its freedom to develop its own personnel policies. .,5 j032,3ia108. The Staff Associations would not welcome a proposal to make - the dockyards a public corporation although the Trade Unions would not objectprovided their members did not lose by it. We feel strongly, however^ that sucha change might have a more than usually disruptive effect because of the long period of vicissitudes the dockyards have suffered since the 1939/45iW&amp;clbM 0?109. We therefore consider that the advantages of a separate&apos; financialsystem based on the capitalisation of assets, loan financing instead of TOtefinancing and the production of full commercial accounts and balance sheetscan equally well be secured by setting up a Trading Fund. This would leave ihforganisation under direct Ministerial control making it easier to dperate^th^necessary controls over expenditure and costs and retain the bfettefifs. of, close association with the Navy virtually the only customer. This is the soiutibftwerecommended for the ROFs. But, in the case of the dockyards there is a difference of emphasis. A Trading Fund could be introduced by the ROFs speedily1 andwith some confidence that they would be able to put in a healthy profit arid-lossaccount at the end of the first year without unnecessary inflation of the costscharged to the Defence budget. But there are some difficult problems to be solved before the dockyards can reach that position. j :.; 5[i(0W si110. The first step towards greater autonomy having been taken by the;MODin the appointment of CED, we recommend that the dockyards should be given a separate financial structure in the form of a Trading Fund. They should move towards this new status in a series of well-prepared stages. We discuss these changes in the next Chapter.U. ( )
A NEW STYLE ORGANISATION WITHIN THE MODr, To operate effectively as a distinct entity within the MOD, and underCED as an; accountable manager, the dockyard organisation requires a clearly defined, aim, freedom to manage the resources allocated to it and clear-cutrelationships with the Navy as its customer.-fiaijissiVfic. ! A REDEFINED AIM^112: Although we have commented in Chapter 4 on the extent to which thepresent definition of the aim of the Dockyard Department overstresses theNaval! operational requirement at the expense of economic considerations, wethink that, so long as a proper balance is kept between these two conflictingpulls,: the definition should import a sense of urgency. In peace-time conditionswhere the dockyards are overprovided with capital facilities and under obligationto reduce their labour force a sense of urgency could be and, in our view is lacking^ We suggest, therefore, that the definition of the aim of the dockyardorganisation, should take account of the need for the task to be performed insuch; a.way as to satisfy the conflicting demands of speed of turn round andeconomics of operation. There should be a conscious decision on what is theTCStnointpf balance in the equation as applied to each ship. The prime responsi-bjBjty for establishing and bringing to notice the relative costs of minimum turn^ur^d time and economic turn round time must rest on the dockyards. Theyrnust^rbvide the information to enable decisions on turn round times to bejt^kenln the full knowledge of the cost of shortening the time scale.zadli&amp;s We offer the following revised definition:2jBo:j      To complete the authorised tasks to the required standards and in theod oj . minimum time permitted by the agreed estimate of cost.&quot;It would be implicit in the adoption of this aim that:(.tO (l&apos;);The dockyard organisation should assess the time and cost for eachjctovig oo major project on the basis of normal working practice and rational usesvbrn biiof ^dockyard resources. They would, thus, produce an estimate of thesasfij ;^.!.&apos;delivery date which would permit the work to be done at least cost,not an estimate of the cost of doing the task to a delivery date imposed by the operational requirement.(2) The estimate which formed the basis of a contract placed with a dock-yard for a major project should be produced by the dockyard concernedsince only the General Manager could determine the most economicaldeployment of resources to undertake the task.(3) If the Naval Staff could not accept the delivery time offered by the dockyard as meeting their operational requirements, the dockyardshould produce a revised estimate of the cost which would be incurred
to secure a shorter time scale. Negotiation between the Naval Staff andthe dockyard to resolve the conflicting demands of speed and cost shouldbe directed to satisfying the Admiralty Board that they had arrived ata time scale and cost which did least damage to the operational require-ments of the Navy on the one hand and to the dockyards&apos; operational efficiency on the other.(4) In the event of a need arising for an alteration in the established pro-gramme after an estimate had been approved, the same process shouldbe applied to ensure that changes in cost and time scale were made only after evaluation of the effect on dockyard efficiency as well as the effecton operational needs. The dockyards should not be required to acceptaltered requirements without being given full opportunity to explore themost economical way of doing the job.114. It might be said that the application of these principles would result ina procedure very similar to that which exists at present in relation to modernisa-tions and conversions and long and special refits. It seems to us that there wouldbe important changes in emphasis and in allocation of responsibilities. these changes would be directed to ensuring that:(1) cost estimates would be based on efficient and economical operationof the dockyards and not be simply reflections of the cost of meetingthe requirements of the Navy in the shortest possible time; and(2) the valuable concentration of advice on ship modernisation and con-version which exists in the dockyards would be used to the full in reaching decisions on Naval expenditure in this area.CHANGES IN ORGANISATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS115. We have endorsed the appointment of CED as a considerable step inthe right direction. But, unless he is given the right conditions for successfulmanagement he may be unable to achieve the results expected of him. Wesuggest that one important factor contributing to his success or failure in his task will be the extent to which he is able, and is allowed, to operate as anaccountable manager. For this purpose he needs to have clear terms of reference and clear lines of command, upwards to CFS and downwards to his general managers. We believe that the operation of the dockyards is a task which shouldbe delegated directly and in its entirety to CED by CFS. CED should himselfavoid undue centralisation of decision making and delegate as much authority as possible to his General Managers.116. As the largest of the establishments in the Naval bases concerned withthe support of the Fleet the dockyards have an important part to play. Thechange in organisation will not lessen their readiness to co-operate with theother establishments in making the necessary efforts to meet emergencies of any kind. In our view, there is no necessity for the Area Flag Officer/AdmiralSuperintendent to retain any residual powers of command in relation to the dockyard but we accept that there will be some occasions when the dockyard isnot best placed to decide overall priorities.117. It follows that, in our view, the detailed concern of the Area flag officer/Admiral Superintendent with those parts of the base which come underthe overall authority of the CFS should exclude concern with the general managers department. In particular:
(1) the Area Industrial and Non-Industrial Whitley Committees over which the Admiral Superintendent presides should have no locus inrelation to those staff that are employed in the General Managersdepartment or whose pay is negotiated by the General Manager;(2) the Fund now known as the Admiral Superintendenfs Machinery fund should be split between funds for expenditure on the dockyard (general managers department) and elsewhere in the base and the formershould be operated by the General Manager and be known as theGeneral Managers Machinery Fund;(3) the allocation of funds for maintenance and minor works to be under-taken by the Department of the Environment should be divided betweenmaintenance and minor works for the General Managers department and those for the rest of the base and the funds for the former should be operated by the General Manager;(4) there should be a clear definition of the exceptional circumstances inwhich the Area Flag Officer/Admiral Superintendenfs view must prevailover the view of the General Manager or CED without prior referenceto CFS.118. We think that the changes we suggest call for a change of title. Therewould be considerable advantage in eliminating the title of Admiral Superin-tendent. The dictionary definition of the word superintendent as &quot; a person whosuperintends; manager, overseer, director&quot; makes its use totally unacceptablein the context of the kind of organisation we think the MOD are trying to buildfor the Naval dockyards. We would urge that Flag Officer should be the soletitle. We believe this would make a real contribution to the establishment of anew relationship.119. Hitherto the emphasis in the relationship between the DockyardDepartment and the dockyards has seemed to be that the former concentrated in conjunction with the other interested directorates and divisions of MOD onthe programming and determination of the range and extent of work to beundertaken in modernisation, conversion, special and long refits, while the dockyards carried out the task allocated to them by the Department under theeye of the Admiral Superintendent. Since the appointment of CED the emphasishas changed (rightly we think) to a headquarters unit responsible for the manage-ment of the dockyards. The Dockyard Management Board and the DockyardHeadquarters Board should provide means of introducing a new style of manage-ment, bringing the Dockyard Department into closer association with the dock-yards and their problems than has apparently been the case in the past. the headquarters reorganisation recently effected should secure that directions onpersonnel management, industrial relations, finance and accounting principles and procedures will be promulgated by the Dockyard Department even though they may originate in, or require to be endorsed by, other specialist branches ofthe MOD.120. Taken together, these changes have resulted in the Dockyard Depart-ment presenting a much healthier aspect than it did when our enquiry began.But more changes are needed. We understand that CED has already put in handa study into the relationships between the dockyards and DGST(N) who is theirprocurement agent. We have therefore not pursued this matter in detail but weshould like to state that we think that the emphasis of CED&apos;s study should be
GTptieiextent&apos;toEwMcbtae;existing arrangement-detractsof the General Manager and impedes his- abihty. to operate efficiently.. This is an area where the criteria of efficiency:of. the system, as. a whole may not :be the sameas the criteria of its efficiency as an agent of the dockyard.121. We suggest, too, that-trJe^role^TJ^^Ships and DGW(N) (who, weunderstand,;are concerned:with ordering long-,leaddtems and.equipmentsi.notonly for work to be done by the dockyards but also for contractors constructingnew ships) should be investigated in order to establish whether the recbmmehdastions of the Raby Committee for concentration of quality assurance.responsi-bility on the prime contractor call for a revision of the range of Admiralty! SupplyItems and an adjustment of the role of these directorates.     nemi beta gniBeta122. There should also be a thorough review of the total range of fMet!ibh&apos;sundertaken by the Dockyard Department.

Just as we attach importance to the precise definitions of theresponsi-bilities of CED and of his General Managers so we attach importance to the precise definition of the physical area and facilities that are wholly under, thecontrol of the General Manager at each dockyard. - ! V-r; JuwOiw124. We realise that the Naval base installations and the dockyard&apos;ihstaila-tions are very closely intermingled. But we understand that buildings5 and installations are assigned to the various occupying units for security a&apos;M!nreprotection purposes. This system should be extended and wherever practicablethere should be some physical indication that an area, building or installatiofri!isunder the control of the General Manager. &quot; :&apos;: &quot;^&quot;P31125.

We accept that codes of practice are useful in maintainingprofessional standards e.g. in engineering and architecture and when commonstaffing and financial systems are to be applied. Specific instructions may be needed also to define the relationships between the Navy and the dockyards to complement Queen&apos;s Regulations. We would not expect however, that the approach, to management would be set out in Regulations issued by the defence council. Instead we recommend that CED should issue any necessary instruc-tions in his own name on the lines of the practice followed by the Controller,Royal, Qrdnance Factories. Such instructions would no doubt incorporate theestablishment and finance codes common to all civil servants and GovernmentDepartments, as they are applicable to the dockyards, and reflect the relevanth^structions contained in Queen&apos;s Regulations. It would be important toejnphasi,sp,.rthe distinction between any instructions initiated in CED&apos;s organisa- ion and the Management Regulations formerly sponsored by Mat 1(N).-i!d&apos;27:j.! ;We strongly recommend that the Way Ahead Committee should reviewthose of their sub committees and working parties which are concerned with the dockyard task. A firm date should be set for completion of their enquiries andthe committees should be wound up as soon as they have reported or on the terminal dates whichever is the earlier. The essence of accountable managementis thatindividuals should take responsibility for their actions and the prolifera-tion ;of committees suggests that the organisation may be suffering fromcommittee rule. If the role of the committees is a co-ordinating one it might beWell;worthwhile to consider whether the functions they are co-ordinating areappropriately organised and allocated. Many committees owe their existence tothe need to co-ordinate activities that should never have been separated,huiw-nos,-: ad; .:: :;.;M STAFFING SYSTEM128.  We recommend that the staffing system for the dockyards should be changed. Instead of having an agreed proportion of serving Naval officers in management posts, suitably qualified Naval officers should be allowed to com-tpfctejjwitb, suitably qualified civilians for dockyard management posts. These&quot;opportunity &quot; posts should be filled by the most suitable applicant, or nominee,without regard to his origin nor for maintaining a balance between candidatesfrom^ specified fields. The term of secondment would, of course, be taken intojaccbunt, in deciding whether to appoint a Naval officer. CED and the Civilian-Management divisions should be concerned in the selection. Naval officers.,accepted under the scheme like other occupants of such posts should be retained in&apos;the, dockyards only if they proved satisfactory. CED should have the right to request their removal if he so wished.oial2?^gj If by this means sufficient candidates to provide the required number of/dockyard trained officers for the purposes of the Royal Navy were not found,
additional officers might be drafted in to gain experience but these should besupernumerary to the dockyard establishment and would not be a charge ondockyard costs.A NEW FINANCIAL SYSTEM130. We have discussed the possible introduction of a Trading Fund withthe MOD and with the Treasury. In our view; because of the relatively lesssophisticated nature of the management accounting controls and systems, theintroduction of such a Fund for the dockyards would necessarily need to bespread over a considerably longer period of time than the ROFs will require.131. The Ministry of Defence see as the first step the development within each dockyard of a new system of Operating Accounts. Each of these is to bethe responsibility of a senior functional manager within the yard and will be designed to show clearly the cost of his activities compared with the value of thework and services which he produces. Differences between planned and actualcosts will appear in these accounts as gains or losses designed to provide themanagement concerned with a measure of performance. The accounts for individual managers will be collated to form an overall Operating Account foreach yard and the aim would be to produce a consolidated Profit and LossAccount analysing the gains and losses on dockyard production as a whole.132. We would emphasise the importance we attach to the accounts for eachyard being used for the purposes of comparing the performance and relativeefficiency of the four UK dockyards. Though to obtain true comparison with private industry may be difficult it can be obtained between the four yards inthose areas where there are no great differences in the class of work being under-taken. We believe nothing but good would result from fostering such com-comparisons.133. The MOD also propose that, in parallel with the system of functionaloperating accounts, separate accounts should be prepared for individual projectmanagers. These accounts would show the achievements of those managers asagainst the agreed budget for each project. The MOD accept that if the newaccounting system is to prove a useful tool of management a generally acceptablebasis for valuing production will have to be evolved and their ability to definework packages, assess costs before the work starts, and monitor those costswhile work is proceeding will have to be improved. They consider that progress towards these ends will be dependent upon staff availability, computer capacity and learning time. They hope that the system could be fully operational within two or three years.134. The Treasury agree with the MOD strategy and see as the next essentialstep the introduction of what they describe as &quot; arm&apos;s length fixed price quota-tions &quot; on ROF lines for as much dockyard work as possible. We are sure thatthis is right and we agree, too, with the Treasury&apos;s suggestion that, if the Navy isto fulfil the role of customer adequately, the MOD will require an organisation to monitor dockyard prices and make informed decisions between dockyardand contract refitting decisions at present taken largely within the dockyardorganisation itself. The role of this organisation would be similar to that of theProduction branches which report to MGO. We endorse this view and theTreasury&apos;s acceptance of the vital need for the concentration of financial
responsibility for all dockyard inputs in the hands of CED, with the consequencethat this may require the introduction of a single net dockyard Vote.135. The Treasury see the introduction of a Trading Fund as a furtherlogical step and so do we. But we part company with the Treasury when they suggest that, if on review it is considered that a Trading Fund could add nothing of value to the efficiency of dockyard operations, it might be possible to rest ona single dockyard Vote and the Operating Account. We believe the wholeexercise should be geared to the introduction of a Trading Fund. We are con-vinced this is necessary to achieve maximum efficiency.136. We realise that a substantial amount of work is involved. nevertheless we hope that there might be some improvement on the Treasury&apos;s suggested timescale which they set out for us as follows:(1) Necessary accounting, costing, and pricing machinery working by April1973.(2) Operating Accounts available for financial year 1972-73.(3) The introduction of a full customer/supplier relationship between theNavy and the dockyards in the course of 1973.(4) Depending on the success of the foregoing, a Trading Fund from April1975.MOD, in conjunction with CED, should analyse the steps leading up to theintroduction of a Trading Fund and set target dates for each successive stage.The aim should be to resolve the difficulties and introduce a Trading Fund by april 1974. The planning should be on that basis.COST INCREASES137. There is one other point in the sphere of finance and accounting towhich we attach a great deal of importance. We have noted that it is commonCivil Service practice not to make any provision in Estimates for cost increasesthat may take effect over the period of a project except where there is a commit-ment to a specific increase at the date when the Estimate is prepared. We under-stand that this practice conforms with the requirement that Parliament should notbe asked to Vote funds in excess of the minimum likely to be required in thefinancial year concerned.138. We accept the reason for this practice but we question whether it shouldbe followed in respect of the forward cost estimating which is undertaken forthe purpose of deciding between alternative projects, or in order to set a targetcost for a production organisation. In the former two applications we feel that not to recognise the possibilities of price changes, in particular differentialchanges between the alternatives, is to run the risk of wrong decisions based onfalse premises. In the latter case there is no incentive to management to keepwithin a cost estimate which they know will inevitably be exceeded because ofthe operation of inflationary tendencies common to all manufacturing activities.139. We recommend that for all internal purposes MOD should adopt thenormal commercial practice even at the expense of having to adjust the figuresfor submission to the Treasury and Parliament.COMPETITION140. All our recommendations are directed to giving the dockyard organisa-tion an identity, giving it the situation in which it can be, and be seen to be,

We have already spoken in paragraph 132of a measure of competition between yards in the form of cost comparisons. Weshould like to see this go further and extend to, competition withoutsidepardsfor such work as the latter can undertake. Such competition could well act as aspur both to dockyard management and to the work force and wouldigive an indication of the comparative efficiency of the dockyard operation. It might leadto a reconsideration of their overall capacity. Should it lead to a;decision toreduce capacity appreciably we think it would be preferable to close one dock-yard rather than continue with four underloaded yards with the implicationsthis would have for tempo of work and efficiency generally. The yard which was closed might be sold off for other purposes.141. In the light of existing dockyard capacity, the MOD proposals for additional investment in dockyard, port and Naval base facilities ought to be reviewed. We have been given details of the investment proposals to the value of 53-4 million but we have not seen any detailed justification. Even if a reductionin the level of Government owned facilities was thought unlikely to emerge from our proposals we would still wish to suggest there should be an early review in depth of the expansion plans. It may be that this has already taken place. Incase it has not, we would like to record that we think it should be undertaken at the highest level.CONCLUSION142. Throughout the enquiry we have been conscious of the blurring of responsibilities and the problems in relationships that have resulted from theintroduction of civilian management into the dockyard organisation. These we recognise as the kinds of problems that are associated with the implementation of radical change in any organisation. In the course of our enquiry we havesatisfied ourselves that MOD took a sound decision when they created a civilianpost for a Chief Executive of the dockyards and the weight of our recommenda-tions is intended to support and consolidate that decision.143. We appreciate that it will be a major task to implement all our recom-mendations within a reasonable period. In our view, a programme for imple-mentation should be drawn up by MOD. This is our final recommendation. Itis designed to draw together the different subjects we have covered so that theycan be tackled as a whole. If this is done, we are convinced that the management of the Royal Dockyards will prove itself to be as competent as we believe itcould be.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS144.  Our enquiries have imposed considerable demands on senior officersof the Royal Navy and the MOD both at headquarters and in the dockyards.They have responded readily to all our demands upon them and we are most grateful for the help and co-operation they have given.145. We desire to conclude our report by recording the debt we owe to ourJoint Secretaries Miss Joan Davison and Mr. B. C. G. Pearce. Assisted by
Mr . F. G. Dufty and Mr. D. W. Maitland, they have served us efficiently and tirelessly and for their help we are indeed grateful. The Secretaries in their turn would like to acknowledge the valuable help and support they have enjoyed from the CSD Typing Service, the Committee Section and the Reproduction Unit.

(paragraph 25)THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ROYAL CORPS OF NAVALCONSTRUCTORS, THE ROYAL NAVAL ENGINEERINGSERVICE AND CERTAIN TECHNICAL AND DRAWING OFFICE GRADES1. The Royal Corps of Naval Constructors is a body of about two hundred profes-sional men who design the ships of the Royal Navy and see that they are properly builtand maintained. They are a civilian Corps but uniform is worn during training and incertain later appointments. Members are subject to the general conditions of service which apply to all civil servants. Their general administration is carried out by the civilian Management division in MOD having responsibility for non-industrialprofessional staff. The Head of the Corps (see paragraph 25) is responsible for thecareer planning, and advises the CM division on the recruitment, transfer and pro-motion.2. Naval Constructors may work under DG Ships, and DGWfN); in research and experimental establishments; at regional headquarters which have the responsibility for ensuring that the production of warships in private shipyards proceeds satisfactorily;on the staffs of Commanders in Chief and other Flag Officers, acting as advisers on matters concerning Naval construction as well as in the dockyard organisation wherethey fill 28 per cent of the management posts.3. The Royal Naval Engineering Service consists of over two hundred professionalmechanical and electrical engineers who design the propulsion and electrical equipment of ships. They supervise the manufacture of electrical equipment in ships under con-struction, and supervise its repair and maintenance in the dockyards.4. As in the case of the RCNC the RNES is a civilian service, wearing uniformduring training and on occasion afterwards. They are also subject to the general conditions which apply to all civil servants but have a nominated Head of the Servicewhose role and advisory capacity in relation to the Civilian Management division, aresimilar to those of the Head of the RCNC.5. RNES members are found in the same range of Directorates etc. as the RCNCand in the dockyard organisation they occupy 42 per cent of the management posts.6. The Head of the Joint Personnel Service is the Assistant Director Manpower and productivity in the Dockyard Department. The Deputy Head is the SuperintendingGrade Professional Officer on his staff. He is responsible for providing the JointPersonnel Service with professional direction and for seeking such professional andtechnical advice as he might need from appropriate officers in any of the directoratesconcerned.7. The Joint Personnel Service is staffed by the Dockyard Department and providesfor that department and for DG Ships and DGW(N) personnel management servicesrelating to the Technical and Drawing Office Classes. The JPS carries out the policiesdetermined by the Technical and Drawing Office Classes Standing Policy Committeeand takes direction from and acts for the Dockyard Department and the two Directors-General as required. Its field of activity in broad terms, includes the maintenance of personnel records; co-ordination, analysis and retention of annual reports; statistical information and forecasts; career planning and the allocation of individuals to posts,and all departmental personnel work concerning these Classes other than day-to-daydomestic issues.
