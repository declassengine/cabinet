THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp (71) 96 Copy No. 612 August, 1971CABINETEARLY WARNING SYSTEMNote by the Central Policy Review staff the Ministerial Committee on Central Capability agreed thatthe Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) should establish a system for acquiring &quot; adequate early warning of impending major issueson which Ministers would be required to take collective decisions affecting the achievement of the Governments major objectives &quot;(MRCA (71) 1st Meeting).2. Attached is a first list of such issues. It has been edited bythe CPRS, on the basis of Departmental contributions. The editedversion has been agreed with the contributor in every case. Thevertical time-scale columns show the earliest date at which eachevent is thought liable to occur.3. The CPRS has on this occasion refrained from entering anyitems which Departments have not themselves agreed to include,either on their own initiative or at our suggestion.4. The list is intended to cover developments which, if theyoccurred, could either affect the collective strategy of the government or be a source of major embarrassment to the Government, andwhich would require urgent collective decisions at Cabinet level.The aim is thus to outline a landscape of events in relationship toone another within a time-scale; and hence to provide a basis for planning the Governments strategy.5. The problem has, of course, been to devise a net which willcatch only fish of the right size. The CPRS does not expect, at this first attempt, to have got the size of the mesh exactly right. It will no doubt need altering in the light of experience.conclusion. We invite Ministers to consider whether the list is useful inits present form and to indicate ways in which they would like the cprs to develop it.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2 August, 1971.123161a
