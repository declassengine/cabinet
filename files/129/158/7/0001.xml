DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 82 COPY NO    6112 July 1971CABINETPROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND review memorandum by the Prime Minister1. The Cabinet approved (CM(71) 1st Conclusions, Minute 9) theintroduction of a system of programme analysis and review (PAR) as outlined in the report by officials attached to a memorandum by theLord Privy Seal (CP(70) 124).    &quot;Work is now proceeding on the basis ofthe set of programmes proposed by the Chief Secretary as being suitablefor review in 1971 (CM(71) 19th Conclusions, Minute 8).2. I have now approved some revisions in the arrangements for thefuture direction of PAR which take account both of experience to date andthe establishment of the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS).    The main features are as follows:a. The Ministerial Committee on the Central Capability (MRCA)will be the senior Ministerial forum, under Cabinet, for discussionof important general questions arising from PAR; and its terms ofreference are being adjusted accordingly.    In future the Committeewill also deal with the programme of management projects and thework of the business teams, which have hitherto been theresponsibility of the Management Projects Committee; the latterbody will be dissolved.b. The Treasury under the Chief Secretary will be responsiblefor co-ordinating Departmental action and for accounting to ministers collectively for the progress of the PAR system takingfull account of the CPRS role and of the Civil Service Department(CSD) interest in the machinery of government and manpowerimplications of PAR.    The Chief Secretary will chair a sub-committee of MRCA with CSD and CPRS representation to co-coordinate the interests of the central Departments.    Mr East who has beenDirector of the PAR Project in tifcfce CSD will transfer for a period to the Treasury as a special adviser.1
c. The CPRS have an essential role in ensuring that PARcontributes to the clarification of Government objectives and provides an effective basis for the critique of strategic policy issues;  PAR is indeed central to CPRS operations.    They will,when they think it desirable, put forward independent advice to ministers collectively at the critical stages in the PAR cyclewhen topics are being considered for selection and when thereviews themselves come forward for consideration by Ministers.d. The Steering Committee on Public Expenditure (SCOPE)will remain the forum for co-ordination with Departments on major PAR matters.    A PAR Committee will be established in parallel with, and under the same chairmanship as, public expenditure Survey Committee with a joint Treasury/CPRSSecretariat.3. I invite the Cabinet to take note of these arrangements.E H10 Downing Street SW112 July 19712
