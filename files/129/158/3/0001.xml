DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 78 COPY NO      612 July 1971CABINETREFORM OF HOUSING FINANCE IN ENGLAND AND WALES-DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment and the Secretary of State for wales. At its meeting on 30 Jxm&amp; the Home and Social Affairs committee invited us to circulate to the Cabinet the draft of the White Paper preparedby the Minister for Housing and Construction on the reform of housing finance in England and Wales which the Committee considered.    We attachthis draft, with minor drafting amendments as suggested by the Committee.The White Paper sets out the policies previously agreed by the cabinet and Home Affairs Committee (CM(70) 34th Conclusions, Minute 9,CM(71) 17th Conclusions, Minute 7).2. The Home and Social Affairs Committee considered the proposalsfor the de-control of privately rented dwellings.     The proposals affecting rents are the same throughout Great Britain.    In England andWales rents will move from an average of about  la week to an averageof about  3 a week.    The rent increase will be phased over three annualincrements.   Poorer tenants will be protected either by supplementary benefit if they are not in full time work or by rent allowances if they are.In many cases the rent allowance will cover the whole of the rent increase and in some cases some or even all of the controlled rent as well.3. The Home Secretary is circulating a separate paper on the timing of an announcement of the Governments proposals for the reform of housing finance.P WP t department of the Environment, SW12 July 1971
annex draft WHITE PAPER ON THE REFORM OF HOUSING FINANCEINTRODUCTION1.     Over the last 50 years the housing problem has been transformed.   It has not been solved.In 1914 there were some 8 million dwellings inEngland and Wales.   Nine-tenths of them wererented from private landlords.   Today there are some 17 million dwellings.   Over half of theseare owner-occupied.   A fifth are rented from private landlords;   more than a quarter from localauthorities.   Of these 17 million dwellings 6 million have been built since 1945 and anotherli million improved and modernised during the sameperiod.2. But millions of our fellow citizens stillface acute housing problems. There are nearly2 million slums. There are another 2 millionhomes v/ithout such essentials as bathrooms orindoor sanitation. There are many tenants whofind the cost of their home a hardship. Thereare still people with no home at all.3.    &quot;Successive Governments have sou^it to tackle the housing shortage, aggravated as it was by twoworld wars, in two ways.   They controlled rentsto prevent the exploitation of the shortage.   Theysubsidised new building to overcome the shortageitself.   As a result of their efforts there isno longer an acute overall shortage of houses inEngland and Wales.   But the very policies which have produced this result have become a hindrance to&apos;jhe solution of the problems that remain.   they take too little accounft of the need to keep theexisting stock of houses in good heart.   they provide too little help for people in need.Moreover they are fundamentally unfair.   they take from people who can ill afford it to give to others who often have no need of help.-1-(cqnfjpential)
4.     In these changed circumstances the time hascome for a radical change in housing policy.Nothing less will create the conditions for a finalassault on the slums,  the overcrowding, thedilapidation and the injustice that still scar thehousing scene.THE NEED FOR CHANGE5.     The Government&apos;s housing objectives are:-i)   a decent home for every family at aprice within their means;ii)   a fairer choice between owning a homeand renting one;iii)   fairness between one citizen and &quot;another in giving and receiving help towardshousing costs.6.  .. The achievement of these objectives is thwartedin the following ways by the present system of housing finance.Public Sectori)   Existing subsidies for new building areindiscriminate.     In 1970/71 Exchequerhousing subsidies amounted to about  157million.     In addition, local authoritiespaid a housing subsidy from the rates ofabout  60- 65 million.     90$ of thesesubsidies was used to reduce the general level, of rent regardless of the need of tenants.     Only 10% was used to payrent rebates for poorer tenants.     As aresult many in need received little orMno-help.ii)   The present system provides subsidy for housing authorities which do not need it.     It gives too little to authorities with the worst problems of slum clearance and overcrowding.-2-
iii)   The &quot;burden of the subsidies is unfairlydistributed.     Many ratepayers pay nohousing subsidy.     But those who do makea disproportionately heavy contribution towards the housing costs of some of their fellow ratepayers.     Many taxpayers whopay their snare of Exchequer housing subsidies (and all taxpayers do so), andmany ratepayers who meet the cost of ratefund contributions, are poorer and worsehoused than the council tenants whom theysubsidise.iv)   The present system has produced a pattern of rents which varies unfairly betweenthe tenants of one authority and another.In March 1970 the national average localauthority rent before rebate was  2.23 aweek.     But in London for example thataverage varied from one borough to anotherby as much as from  1.90 to  4.41 a week.Such indefensible variations are onlypartly caused by indiscriminate subsidy.They also arise from the historic accidentswhich have determined the composition ofeach local authority&apos;s housing stock.An authority which built most of itshouses when costs were much lower canbalance its Housing Revenue Account bycharging rents far below the present valueof its houses.     But an authority whichhas had to build most of its housesrecently may be obliged to charge much higher rents for houses of similar quality.The difference in historic costs works tothe disadvantage of the authority withunsolved housing problems, and of itstenants cv)   Housing subsidies from taxpayers andratepayers cost some  220 million in1970/71.     If they continued, their annual cost would increase over the next ten yearsby at least  300 million.     This sum wouldnot produce the new building required norremove the injustices of the presentsystem.     But it would be a staggeringaddition to the nation&apos;s tax burden.-3-
Private Sectorvi)     In the private sector rent control was introduced to protect the tenant.Most controlled rents today barely cover the cost of proper maintenance and insurance.   Tenants are thus being;subsidised by their landlords..&apos;  The; ;rent of private tenants subject to rent .control has not moved since 19:57&apos; andis typically 85p a week outside Londonand  1.50 a week in London.   Many&apos;landlords of controlled tenantsare.poorer than the tenants who enjoy avery low rent at the landlord&apos;s expense.It is not only the landlord who.suffers.   It is the tiousing stock ofthe country.   Rent control hasaccelerated the deterioration of ourolder houses.   A landlord who onlyreceives a controlled rent cannot beexpected to maintain, let aloneimprove his house.   Indeed if thepresent system is continued - the effort devoted to the removal ofslums will be neutralised by thedrift into slumdom of controlleddwellings.Meanwhile, tenants subject to rentregulation may have their rent -increased.   But, outside Birmingham^there is no help for those in need ifthey are in full-time work. &apos;7.     The Government: has accordingly decided thatthere is an&apos;urgent need -for a thorough reform o&apos;fjiousing finance. . lit will introduce the appropriatelegislation in the autumn.   Thi,s White Paper sets out the proposed reform in the Context of theGovernment&apos;s other housing policies, especially,those concerned with the encouragement of HouseImprovement and Home-ownership.vii)viii)-4-f CONFIDENTIAL^
HOUSE IMPROVEMENT8.     Many of our older houses are fundamentallysounds     They can &quot;be given a new lease of life ata fraction of the cost of &quot;building a new home.When a house and its surroundings are improvedpeople can continue living in the community andenvironment to which they are attached.     Improvementcan also play a very important part inrehabilitation of urban areas and enhancing thequality of the urban environment9.     The Housing Act 1969, provided a soundframework for a policy of modernising nouses otherthan those subject to rent control.  &quot; Grants canbe made for improving both the house and itssurroundings.     The Government is giving freshimpetus to this policy.     The number of improvement grants has increased substantially and progress isbeing made in establishing general improvementareas.     This progress must be tested against the continuing decay of older houses.     The Governmenthas just embarked on a sample survey of thecondition of the housing stock in England and Wales.This will make it possible to assess the rate, atwhrch houses are becoming unfit and to take thenecessary measures in the light of this assessment.10.   Housing associations can make a particularlyvaluable contribution to improvement.     The voluntaryhousing movement is well equipped to acquiredwellings and to convert and improve them.     In1970 about 3,800 dwellings were acquired by housing associations for this purpose.     Certain localauthorities, notably the Greater London Council,have given substantial financial support to thisvaluable activity.     The Government urges other local authorities to follow their example in thusalleviating the housing needs of their areas.-5-
11.     But the Housing Act.., 1969, gave insufficientencouragement to the improvement, of the many rentcontrolled dwellings which lack basic amenities.In the two years since it was enacted, less than,000 controlled dwellings have been improved up tothe qualifying standard of repair and amenity.The landlord of a controlled dwelling who wishes to improve it, has to undergo a daunting procedurebefore obtaining the right to charge a fair rent;and must then wait 4 years after the improvements have been made &quot;before that rent can be obtained in full.     The Government proposes to simplify theprocedure and to allow the increase to the fair rent to be phased more quickly.12.   As soon as the landlord has obtained approval for any grant claimed, improvement work will beable to go ahead without further formality.     Ifthe tenant does not agree, the landlord will&apos; still have the right to apply to the county court forleave to carry out the works.     The tenant will still have the right to object to the landlord&apos;sproposals on such grounds as disturbance or lossof accommodation, out not - once rent allowances are introduced (see paragraph 46) - on grounds offinancial hardship.13.    The landlord will still be allowed to charge,as soon as the improvement works have been carriedout, a rent increase whose annual rate is 12i% ofthe amount (net of grant) spent on the improvements.But charging this increase will no longer interferewith the landlord&apos;s right to apply for a fair rent.When the house has been certified as up to the qualifying standard of repair and amenity and the fair rent has been registered, then (unless thefirst increase was small) the remainder of the rent increase needed to bring the rent up to the fair rent will be chargeable in two equal annualpease increments.     The f irst/would generally come oneyear after the 12i% increase and the second one yearlater.     If the tenant cannot afford the increasedrent, he or she will be able to obtain a rent allowance.-6-
(CONFIDENTIAL)HUH il  Ml f Nil&quot; ITlH&apos;.1LITT&apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;T-&quot;*-&apos;&apos;&apos;  riMtinnmBBTiaganilttHBflMyHOME OWNERSHIP14.   Home ownership is the most rewarding form of house tenure.   It satisfies a deep and naturaldesire on the part of the householder to haveindependent control of the home that shelters him and his family.    It gives him the greatest possiblesecurity against the loss of his home;   andparticularly against price changes that may threatenhis ability to keep it.   If the householder buyshis house on mortgage, he builds up by steady savinga capital asset for himself and his dependants.    Inthis country the existence of a strong building society movement helps him to realise these advantages.15.   It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that homeownership should have gained so much ground in the &apos;last half-century.   In 1914 about a tenth of allhouses in England and Wales were owner-occupied;   by april, 1951, the proportion had increased to 31$;now it is more than half.   As the White Paper of1965 (&quot;The Housing Programme 1965 to 1970&quot;;Command 2838, paragraph 15) noted, this trend is a sign of social advance.16.   The Government shares this view.   Home ownershiphelps savings.   And experience shows that the owner-occupied house is visibly better maintained, andat less cost in real resources than the rented one.17.   Tax relief on mortgage interest derivedoriginally from the first Income Tax legislation of1798.   Since then the principle of helping thissocially desirable form of house tenure has beenaffirmed and reinforced, especially in recent years,by successive Governments.    In 1963 the owner-&apos;occupier&apos;s liability to Schedule A Tax was abolished.In 1967 the previous Government brought in the OptionMortgage Scheme enabling mortgagors whose taxliabilities were small to exchange their tax relief for a more favourable subsidy.    In 1969, when itabolished tax relief on loan interest generally, itreaffirmed its support for owner occupation by giving a specific exemption to the interest paid on loans for the acquisition or improvement of property.-7-
18. The present Government has taken further stepsto encourage home ownership.(i) The Land Commission has beendisbanded and the Betterment Levyabolished to encourage private building.(ii) SET which added  120 or more tothe cost of building an ordinaryfamily house has been halved andwill be abolished next year.(iii) The restrictions imposed by theprevious Government on the saleof council houses to tenants havebeen lifted.(iv) The stamp duty on the mortgage deedis   being abolished.(v) Following discussions between theGovernment and the Building SocietiesAssociation, the Association leaders have commended to their memberspractices which will improve theprospect of a mortgage for people whose earnings are good but whose   &apos;capital resources are limited (forexample skilled workers and thosewho have completed long studies fora professional qualification)   Theyhave done the same for people who might otherwise think they were tooold for a mortgage advance.(vi) The Option Mortgage Scheme is beingmade more flexible.   The money limitgoverning the scheme by which theGovernment can help guarantee 100$mortgage advance to an optionmortgagor is being raised from 5,000 to  7,500.   The period after which a mortgagor can relinquishoption mortgage terms and switchback to tax relief is being shortenedfrom 5 years to 4.-8-
(v:il)     The Government has removed themoney, ceiling in force from&apos; 1967 to. :;1970 on local&apos;authority mortgageadvances.   This will help people-. -who, by the nature of their housingneed, might reasonably look to localauthorities rather than to theordinary . mortgage institutions&apos; for. a house purchase advance.(viii)   A local authority has power to paythe removal expenses of a tenantwho is willing to vacate his dwellingby purchasing a private dwelling...The Government proposes to enable,&quot;local authorities to pay such a .tenant&apos;s legal expenses - conveyanceetc. - in the same way as a private,landlord.   As a result authoritiesin areas of housing shortage will be&apos;helped to make additional accommodation- available to the badly hous-ed andhceless.A FAIR PATTERN OF RENTS19.   Despite the continuing growth of home ownership,there are sti11 over 8 million rented dwellings.Renting indeed will always play a vital part in meeting peoples&apos; needs.    It is in the rented sectorthat the greatest problems arise.   Many of theexisting evils - unfairness between one citizen .and^another, neglect of: people in need, dilapidation ofproperty, waste of resources - are caused by the .absence of any consistent principle.underlying the pattern of rents,   feents are not consistently,;..ne value of the accommodation ortenant.related either to tto the means of theIn the .Government&apos;s view,&apos;the right principle is first to determine a rent which is reasonable forthe&apos;dwelling and then to consider whether thetenant needs help towards that rent.   Any rentsubsidy should be directed to the tenant rather than to the house.   To achieve this, the government proposes a new deal for rented houses based upon:.-.9-(confidential)
(i) fair rents for all unfurnished tenantswho can afford them;(ii) a rent rebate or allowance for those who cannot;(iii) the concentration of Exchequer subsidies on authorities with the worst housingproblems.Fair Rents in the private sector21.   So long as there is a shortage of dwellings to let, tenants will need to be protected by rent restriction and given security of tenure.   Yet bothmeasures make landlords less willing to let.    Ifrents are kept unreasonably low by law, tenantedproperty loses value and becomes difficult and finallyimpossible to maintain.    Thus any Government whichcontemplates rent legislation has to maintain adelicate balance.   Abuses - whether by landlords ortenants - must be stamped out.   But if the landlordis needlessly knocked, it is the tenants who feel   thebruise longest.   Rent legislation cannot cure housingshortage.    It can only mitigate the effects of shortage by giving comfort to sitting tenants at theexpense of prospective tenants.   And if it tilts thebalance too much in favour of tenants it frightensoff those landlords who have accommodation to let andthus makes matters worse for all who need it.22.   For many years rent legislation has beenunbalanced.   Landlords, of whom the majority own onlyone or two dwellings, have been discouraged by theburden of rent restriction.   Many have ceased tomaintain their property or disposed of it as soon asthey could get vacant possession.   More and moreprivate dwellings to let have fallen into disrepairto the serious disadvantage of the tenant.   Some have become unfit and been lost to the housing marketaltogether.23.   The Government intends to restore the balance of rent legislation for the benefit of both tenant andlandlord by basing its policy on the fair rentsystem introduced in the Rent Act   1965.   A &quot;fair rent&quot;-10-
is the likely market rent that a dwelling couldcommand if supply and demand for rented accommodationwere broadly in balance in the area concerned.   Somecritics of the fair rent system have argued thatfair rents are too high;    others that they are too low.   The Francis Committee was set up in 1969 to look into these criticisms.    It concluded unanimously thatthe system is working well.   This is a tribute tothe rent officers and rent assessment committees whooperate it.   The Government accepts this conclusionand endorses the tribute.   It will build on thesuccess so far achieved.24.   For a start the Government proposes to bringcontrolled tenancies more speedily into the fair rent system.   At present more private rented dwellingsare outside the fair rent system than with it it.There are still 1.3 million tenancies which are controlled as distinct from regulated.   Apart fromthose formally notified unfit, these will be broughtinto rent regulation under a staged   programmebeginning 1 January 1973.   This is the date when rentallowances for private tenants will generally become available under the Government&apos;s proposals.   Thetransfer from control to regulation will take about three years.    It will be staged by rateable valuebands beginning with the highest rateable values.Landlords will be able to apply to the rent officerfor registration of a fair rent three months beforethe tenancy comes out of control.   The transition from the controlled rent to the registered fair rentwill be phased in three equal annual instalments(ie over a two-year phasing period).   But, until the fair rent is reached, the annual increment will benot less than 50tenant whose renp per week.   At the end of the day nowas previously controlled will pay more than the fair rent for his accommodation.    Thosewho cannot afford the fair rent will be helped by arent allowance from the community instead of a subsidyfrom their landlords-11-
25.    In accordance with a majority recommendation ofthe Francis Committee the Government proposes to /allow landlords and tenants&apos;to agree rent increasesbetween themselves.    This will be on the basis that either party has the right to apply to the rentofficer at any time for a fair rent.   Such agreementswill be possible in three situations:-(i)   for the tenancy which comes out of rent control;(ii)   for the tenancy already regulated butfor which no rent has been registered, ,(under existing law the current rent   .cannot be increased unless a fair;rentis first registered);(iii)   ft) r the tenancy for which a fair renthas been registered and has been inforce for three years, but where landlord and tenant are able to agree the rent.26.   It is not the function of the State to interfere in private contracts freely made.   But the law should ensure that a contract between landlord and tenant is made on equal terms.    The Government,therefore, proposes to make rent agreements subjectto the following safeguards for the tenant:-:(i)   When a tenancy passes from- control toregulation, the tenant will have hadno recent experience of what constitutes a reasonable rent for his dwelling.   TheGovernment, therefore propose that if the landlord and tenant agree the new rentwithout reference to the rent officer,the agreement will have;to be written&apos;on a prescribed form.   This form willexplain&apos;allL the tenant&apos;s rights, and acopy will nave to be left with the tenant.The landlord will be required to lodgethe agreement with the local&quot;authority.He will not be&apos; free to Increase the rentuntil four weeks after the agreement has been lodged.    The agreement will beopen to public inspection.
(ii)   When the tenant of a tenancy which isalready regulated but for which no renthas yet been registered agrees, to a newrent, the agreement will nave to bein writing, so that the tenant knowswhat he is agreeing to. ;(iii)   When a rent has been registered atleast three years, and the parties:agree on a new rent, they can applyjointly to the rent officer .for /cancellation of the registration.He will cancel the registration only,if he is satisfied that the proposedrent does not exceed a fair rent.:&apos;(iv)    In all three situations, there will beno obligation on the tenant to agree a new rent with the landlord.    If thetenant declines to agree a new rent,the onus will be on the landlord toask the rent officer to register afair rent.   Where the tenant doesagree to a new rent, but later feelsit was too high, he will be able at   -any time to apply to the rent officer.If a tenant is reluctant to approach the rent officer, he or anyone on his behalf can bring, the case to the noticeof the local authority.   The localauthority will be empowered to refer it to the nent officer, as the FrancisCommittee jrecommended. , : -27.    The Government ajlso proposes to prescribe newrent book notices toweekly tenancy is givjrights.   Informationmake sure that each tenant pf aen clear information about, hisleaflets will be provided free to all offices and otlher agencies which advise tenants.28.    The Government has taken a decision on&apos;three other major-recommendations of the Francis Committee.As the Minister for Housing and Construction announced on 10 March, 1971,-13-fCONFIDENTIAL&quot;)
(i)   The Government agrees that indefinitesecurity of tenure for furnished tenantswould cause the supply of furnished accomodation to dry up and so &quot;be againstthe longer term interest of tenantsthemselves.,(ii)   The Government will take the earliestlegislative opportunity to proposeincreases in the maximum penalties forharassment and illegal eviction.(iii)   The Government rejects the recommendation to take out of.rent regulations tenanciesof dwellings with a rateable value between .. 300 and  400 in Greater London, and .between  150 and  200 elsewhere.29.    The Government is considering the many, other recommendations of the Francis Committee on bothfurnished and unfurnished tenancies.   When these havebeen subjected to public debate and examination, itwill propose any new legislation necessary.Fair Rents in the public sector30.    The Government proposes to apply the principleof fair rents to local authority dwellings.   Theserents will be subject to the same broad criteria asthe rents of private unfurnished dwellings.    Inconsequence? the two main sectors of the market forrented housing will, for the first time, be governed by one common equitable principle - fair rents forall.31.   The rent of every council dwelling will in futurereflect its value by reference to its character,location, amenities and state of repair, butdisregarding the value due to any local shortage of similar accommodation.   Council tenants will no longer be liable to rent increases resulting from the stateof their authority&apos;s Housing Revenue Account or the size of its housebuilding programme.    The rent of thetenant without a rebate will no longer be affected bythe rebates granted to other tenants.   Nor will it heaffected by the extent to which the Housing Revenue(confidential)^^BiT^M IjSIM iU VTHfl WIP HV&apos;.flr i11&quot;........i-HWU annmm JtilMWWttfittiwraa-&apos; 11 r 1--&apos; &apos;--IJ&apos;ir &apos;WH&apos;Jf&apos;WBi - t inV^&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;^1^
Account is made to bear part of the high cost of slum clearance or community benefits connected with .council housing.     Nor will the rent of thedwelling depend on the amount of Exchequer subsidyavailable to the authority, nor of any rate fundcontribution which it chooses to make, nor on theapplication of such subsidies to the dwelling.&apos;The only criterion of the rent of the- dwelling,will be the fair rent for that dwelling.32.  * The proposed procedure for determining the fair rent of local authority dwellings will, be as :.follows:- (i)   The local authority will assess a fair rent for every dwelling.     It will.be free to consult the Rent Officer on thelevel of fair rents in its area, and theGovernment believes that authorities will-find such consultation helpful.(ii)   The authority will then publish itsprovisional assessments and consider any representations which any tenantmay wish to make about the assessmentfor his home.(iii)   Thereafter the authority will submitits assessments to a special committeedrawn from the Rent Assessment Panel,(from which Rent Assessment committees are also drawn).   .Tne committee will testthe assessments by inspecting typicaldwellings! and making sample checks.    If.   in the light of these tests the committeeagrees with the local authority&apos;sassessments, it will confirm them andthey will thereupon become the fair rentsof the authority&apos;s dwellings concerned.If the committee disagree with any ofthe authority&apos;s assessments, it.will inform the authority and, after considering any comments by the authority., will, as necessary, alter the assessments in thelight of the statutory criteria.&apos;   the altered assessments will then become the fair rents of the dwellings concerned.
YjY).   These proposals are not as novel as they :may atfirst appear.   As the law now stands, a local .authority can charge rents which it considersc iiriparablo with the fair rents registered for private tenants in its area.    A number of authorities alreadyfix rents on this basis for some of their dwellings.Local authorities are at present required to make,reasonable charges for their dwellings.   In futurethey will be required to apply new statutory criteriato give, effect to the fair rent principle.   But therewill be two significant changes:(i)   In future every authority will be undera duty to consider the views of tenantson its assessment of the fair rent, andto subject this assessment to theindependent scrutiny of members of the, RentAssessment Panels.   These Panels have nowbuilt up an impressive expertise on the fair rent levels appropriate in the private sector and their members are well qualified to undertake this new responsibility.:(ii)   At present a local authority is notobliged to rebate the rent of any-dwelling.    In future each authority will be under a duty to grant a rebateto any tenant who cannot afford the  -fair. rent.   The .rebate will.be governed by the national scheme described below.34.^   The Secretary of State for the Environment andthe Secretary of Stateifor Wales propose to&apos;set up aCommittee to advise them on any general problems which may arise in connection with the determination of fair rents in the ljpcal authority sector. , Thisadvisory committee will have an independent chairman and a membership reflecting the points of view of rent Assessment Panels, Local Authorities and&apos;their tenants. -  -35..   With the introduction of fair rents a counciltenant will be entitled to the same protection againstsummary eviction as any other tenant.    The Government,thereforei proposes to terminate the application ofthe Small Tenements Recovery Act 1838 which enables-16--
local authorities.to obtain possession under a summaryprocedure not available to other landlords.    In future a local authority will be able to evict a tenantonly by an order from the county court.36.   The rents of most council dwellings are atpresent less than the fair rent.   To apply the fair,rent without phasing would dislocate the budgets ofmany families&apos;who will not qualify for a rebate.The Government, therefore, proposes to introducefair rents by annual steps.37.   The formula governing the size and date of the steps is explained in detail in Appendix lu    its main features are as follows:(1)   The weekly rent of all dwellings ofa local authority whose rent is belowthe determined fair rent, or whose fair rent has not yet been determined, willbe increased by an average of 50p forthe whole of each financial year beginning with 1972/3, with a maximum of 75p foreach year for any dwellings.(ii)   Within this maximum the authority willbe free to effect the average increase by whatever increases it considerssuitable for the individual dwellingsto which the average increase applies.If the authority considered that the rents of certain dwellings were already at or near the fair rent level, it could make little or no increase in thoserents and make a somewhat larger increasein the rents of other dwellings.(iii)   The authority will be free to secure theaverage weekly increase of 50p for thewhole financial year by making that increase at the beginning of April in 1972/3 and subsequent years.   But, if it so prefers,the authority will be free to alter the timing in ways which will still achievebroadly the same financial result as anannual increase in April.   For this purpose-17-
rent increases made between 1 October 1971and 31 March 1972 can count as having beenmade in 1972/3.38.   If, when the fair rent is determined, it provesto be less than the current rent, the rent will bereduced arid overpayments refunded.39.   Once fair rents have been determined for councildwellings, they will be redetermined at three yearly intervals by the same procedure as for the firstdetermination.   Any rent increase resulting froma redetermination of the fair rent will also besubject to phasing.40.   The effect of the transition on any individualtenant will vary according to circumstances.   Everylocal authority will be required to apply thenational rent rebate scheme not later than October1972.   The Government expects that most authorities will apply the scheme in conjunction with the firstannual rent increase to be made under the transitionto fair rents.   Tenants with low incomes or heavyfamily commitments will benefit from the scheme.For some of them the current rent will be reduced.PEOPLE IN NEED41.   The Government&apos;s central policy of subsidisingpeople, not bricks and mortar, will be carried outthrough the national rent rebate scheme.   At presentmany local authorities grant no rent rebates to their tenants.   Others operate rebate schemes which give too little help to tenants in need.   Private tenantsreceive no rebate at all, however poor they may be,except in Birmingham where a progressive authority haspioneered a rent allowance scheme on its own account.Under the national scheme proposed by the Government,all council tenants will be able to claim a rebatewhich is fair in relation to their means and familycircumstances,,   So, for the first time, will private tenants of unfurnished accommodation.
42.   The national scheme will also be an important new weapon against family poverty.   The Family income supplement was devised to help those whose incomes .are low in relation to their family responsibilities.But people with low incomes and high.rents need morehelp than those with low incomes and low rents.: Thenational scheme and the Family Income Supplement scheme&apos;will in combination give effective help to people with low incomes who have children to support but.whoare not eligible for Supplementary Benefit becausethey are in full-time work.43.   The basic structure of the rent rebate schqmefor council tenants will be as follows.  When thescheme is introduced, every tenant will have&apos; a needsallowance of  13.50 for himself and his wife arid 2.50 for each child.    If his gross income is,exactly^the same as his needs allowance he will pay 40$ only of the rent of his house.    For every  1 by which.his   -income exceeds the needs allowance the 40$ rent wi 11be increased by 17p.   For every  1 by which his incomefalls short of the allowance, the 40$ rent will bereduced by 25p*.44.    For example, a married council tenant with  children, living in a house with a weekly, rent of 5, will have his weekly rent reduced to  3.95? if hisweekly income is  30, to  3.10^ if it is  25, and to 1.37^ if it is  16.    If his weekly income were  25 ?his rebate would be calculated on the following basis:-i)    the &quot;need allowance&quot; is first deducted fromthe tenant1 s. weekly income, to allow for the basic cost oif necessities for himself, andhis family.    In this case the allowance willbe  18.50, i^e  13.50 for himself and his wife*If the 40$ rent is less than  1, the starting point for calculating the rent payable will be  1.,-19-
and  2.50 for each of his 2 children.11)   as his needs allowance is less than hisincome, the rent paid by him will be 40$ ofthe rent of his house ( 5) plus 17$ of thedifference ( 6.50) between his income ( 25) andhis needs allowance&apos; ( 18.50).   The rent paid byhim will therefore be - 3.104 ( 2.00 plus  1.104)and his rebate will be  1..894.The rent paid thus takes account not only of thetenant&apos;s income and family circumstances but also ofthe value of his house.   The rebate, however, does notrob him of the incentive to increase his income.    if his weekly income were to increase by  1 he would haveto pay only 17p a we elk more, in rent.&apos; - i -45.    If the weekly income of a married council tenantwith 3 children were :only  16, and tho rent of his house were  5, his rebate would be calculated asfollows:- * &apos;i)   his needs allowance will be  21 ie  13.50.for himself and his wife and  2.50 for each ofhis 3 children.&apos;&apos;ii) as the needs allowance is greater than hisincome the. rent paid by him will be 40$. of the rent of his house ( 5) minus 25$ of thedifference.( 5) between his needs allowance( 21) and his income ( 16).    The rent paid byhim will therefore be 75p ( 2o00.minus  1.25; andhis rebate will: be&apos;  4.25.If the weekly income^ of the tenant were only  13, .the rent paid by him will be 40$ of the rent of his house( 5) minus 25$ of th e difference ( 8) between hisneeds allowance ( 21) and his income ( 13)&apos;.   The rentpaid by him will therefore be nil ( 2 minus-  2)e46.   The rent allowance .scheme for private tenantswill work in the same way as the rent rebate schemefor council tenants except that the private tenantwill receive a cash allowance whereas the counciltenant1s rent payment will be reduced by the amountof any rebate granted to him.   The amount of the.. rent allowance paid to a private tenant will be the same,as the rent rebate granted to a council tenant if their ;;rent, income and family circumstances are the same.&apos;  -20-(confidential)
47.   Further examples,. pf\ th e operation of the.national scheme in both the public and the private sector are given in Appendix 2.   This sets out indetail the model provisions for rent rebates and allowances which will initially be prescribed bythe Secretaries of State for the Environment andfor Wales.   The examples illustrate the Governmentsapproach to the problem of helping tenants withtheir rent.   A rent subsidy differs from otherincome related benefits.   Housing is a basicnecessity, but its cost varies greatly forhouseholders with similar incomes and familycommitments.   To be fair the rent subsidy must notonly be available to tenants whose income is at orbelow the minimum level judged to be tolerable forsuch purposes as Supplementary Benefit.    It must also be.available to tenants with incomes above thi;level, if the rent of their home would otherwiseimpose an unfair burden on their family budget.This subsidy must be wide in scope and flexible inapplication.48.   The Government propose a national schemelocally administered.   Local authorities have, bylaw, special responsibilities towards their owntenants and a general responsibility for   assessing the housing needs and problems of their area.Since a rent subsidy is a contribution towardshousing costs, the Government considers that it isappropriately administered by local housing authorities.    This view is snared by the localauthority associations in England and Wales.49.   The Government propose that each authority should be required to introduce a rent rebatescheme for its own tenants not later than October1972 and a similar scheme of rent allowances, for private tenants of unfurnished accommodation inits area not later than January 1973.*   Thedifferent dates of introduction are proposed for adminsitrative reasons.Footnote:-     In London the rent allowance scheme would be operated by the Boroughs.   Each london authority will grant rebates to its own tenants.-c 1- .
50.   The provisions of each scheme will have to beno less favourable to the tenants than theprescribed model provisions.   An authority will,however, be free to make the schemes more favourable,provided the alterations apply to both rebates and allowances and do not increase the cost of either bymore than 10$ over the estimated cost of adopting the model provisions.   For example a local authority will be free to disregard the full amount of a wardisablement pension.   The Secretaries of State willrevise the model provisions from time to time in thelight of experience and changing circumstances.    Theywill be advised in this by an expert AdvisoryCommittee.51.    The national scheme will integrate the rentsubsidies given to tenants in work and tenantsreceiving Supplementary Benefit.   A tenant whoseincome is low because he is not in work needs thesame rent subsidy as a tenant who obtains the sameincome from his earnings.    In the Governmentrs view,the local housing authority has no less duty to helpa tenant with his housing costs when he falls sick,becomes unemployed or retires than when his earnings are low.   Each authority&apos;s rebate and allowance scheme will therefore cover also those tenants who receive Supplementary Benefit.   But, under arrangements agreed with the local authority associations such tenants will have to apply for helponly to the Supplementary Benefits Commission.    TheCommission will then inform the local authority whowill grant the appropriate rebate or allowance, andany remaining rent will be taken into account in calculating Supplementary Benefit.52.   Rent allowance will be paid to the tenantexcept in the special circumstances described inparagraph 7 of Appendix 2.    It will not enable the landlord to obtain more than the fair rent.    Thelocal authority will pay the allowance only if the rent of the tenancy is the controlled or registeredfair rent, or if it is satisfied that the rent towardswhich the allowance is payable does not exceed the fair rent.   If it is not so satisfied, it will be ableto help the tenant by granting him an interimallowance, until the fair rent is registered, whichwill be based on its own assessment of a reasonablerent. The allowance will be based on only a proportionof the fair rent if the dwelling is much larger thanthe tenant requires or is situated in an area of highproperty values where the tenant is living from choicerather than fromnecessity.22l
53u    A rebate reduces the rent income obtainableby the local authority and this reduction may leadto a deficit in the Housing Revenue Account.     Sucha deficit could be met only from the Exchequer orthe rates.     The Government considers that a 100$Exchequer subsidy for rebates would be wrong inprinciple, call in question the financial independence of local housing authorities, and fail to reflect their responsibilities.     10$ of the deficit in 1972/73 rising to 25$ in 1975/76 andsubsequently, and the cost of administering the rent rebate scheme, will therefore fall to be met from the rates on the basis described in paragraphs and 9 of Appendix 3.54.     The Government also considers it right inprinciple for the local authorities to meet partof the cost of rent allowances.     But the cost of rent allowances is uncertain.     Its incidence on particular authorities cannot be predicted, and theexpenses of administration are likely to exceed those of administering rent rebates.     TheGovernment is therefore prepared to meet the whole amount of the statutory rent allowances paid in theyears 1972/73 to 1975/76 and to meet at least 80$of this amount thereafter on the basis described in paragraph 13 of Appendix 3.55.     The majority of tenants who now receive arent rebate will receive a larger rebate under thenational scheme than they da today under theirauthorityfs existing scheme.     Special arrangements will be made to avoid hardship for any tenantalready enjoying a rebate who would otherwise haveto pay substantially more rent when the new system is introduced.-23-
AREAS IN NEEDSlum Clearance56.   The main financial obstacle to slum clearanceis that cleared land is often worth less than itcosts to acquire and clear.   Under the present system,local authorities can mitigate this loss byredeveloping the land with their own housing.   Theland and clearance cost is then charged to theHousing Revenue Account and the loss is offloadedlargely on to&apos; the tenants and the Exchequer.   But a growing number of authorities with slums to cleardo not need the cleared land for council housing andwant to use it for other purposes, includingredevelopment for owner.occupation, commercial purposes&quot; or as public open space.57.   The Government proposes a new Slum ClearanceSubsidy.    The details are set out in paragraphs 14 &amp;15 of Appendix 3.   This will provide for slum clearance operations to be financed separately.   Itwill meet, for at least the first fifteen years,75$ of the loss to the general rate fund incurredthrough slum clearance whatever the use chosen by theauthority for the cleared land.    It will enable theauthority, at no cost to its tenants and moderateexpense to its ratepayers, to accelerate slum clearance and put the cleared land to the use best suited to local needs.58.   No local authority&apos;need defer slum clearance inorder to obtain the Slum Clearance Subsidy.   The newsubsidy will be payable towards losses arising fromslum clearance for any year from 1971/2 onwards. . Itwill also&apos;cover expenditure on land acquired forslum clearance after 31 March 1968 if this had notbeen put to another use by the beginning of 1971/2.New Building59.   Not only must the slums be cleared butovercrowding must be relieved, especially in thegreat conurbations.   The Government proposes toredeploy subsidies to achieve this end.-24-
60.    Once the full fair rent is payable for allcouncil dwellings there is likely to be a surplus in the Housing Revenue Account of those authorities who built up their housing stock in earlier years.Such authorities will need no Exchequer or ratesubsidy for that Account.   But authorities withhistorically high costs and continuing building programmes will have a deficit.61.   The existing housing subsidies to localauthorities are geared to a system in which the stateof the authority&apos;s housing account determines thelevel of rents.   They are manifestly not suited to asystem in which the income from rents determines thestate of the account.    If the account is in surplus,,they will be unnecessary.    If it is in deficit, theywill not match that deficit nor provide the authority with the resources for its building needs.    Theexisting subsidies must, therefore, be replaced by anew subsidy structure adapted to the new system.   Thechange to this structure, like the change to fairrents, will be phased and the new subsidies will ease the transition.   The details of the proposals are&apos;set out in Appendix 3.62.   In areas of housing stress the most powerfulinstrument for the promotion of new building will bethe proposed new Rising Costs Subsidy.   This is described in paragraphs 5 to 7 of Appendix 3.   It willmeet the bulk of the deficit incurred when housingcosts rise faster than rent income.   It will thusplay a key part in the relief of overcrowding and therehousing of those now living in slums.63.   Other subsidies will help authorities with thedeficits arising during the   transition to the new system.   They are described in detail in Appendix 3.64.   The Exchequer will relieve ratepayers of most ofany deficits in the Housing Revenue Account andinitially of the whole cost of rent allowances.    TheGovernment, therefore, considers that the exchequer should share in any surplus arising in that account.The arrangements for sharing the surplus are explained in paragraph 22 of Appendix 3.-25-
65.   The Secretaries of State will also review theoperation of the new system in (Consultation with thelocal authority associations towards the end of its first 10 years.   They will then make, by Order,appropriate adjustments for the years following thisperiod within the range of adjustments permitted bythe Act.    This is explained more fully inparagraph 23 of Appendix 3.The Effect of the New Subsidies66.    Under the new system total Exchequer subsidies for housing in England and Wales,.instead of   growingrapidly, will remain at about their present level(at current prices).   The national total of rate-fund contributions to Housing Revenue Accounts willprogressively fall below its present level and theburden of rate fund contributions will be more evenlyspread.    It is true that in the transition period.iiost authorities not now making a rate fundcontribution will make one until their Housing revenue account moves into surplus.   But authorities withsevere housing problems will make smaller contributions in the course of solving these problems in the longer term -than they would have made under the presentsystem.   Those with the worst problems will be able toreduce their contribution as soon as the new system is introduced.67.    The new subsidies will not be confined to new building.   They will meet the major part of deficitscaused by all the housing activities of a localauthority, including repairs, management and therefinancing of maturing debts.68.   This subsidy structure will give a new deal tothose local authorities whose needs are greatest,,THE VOLUNTARY HOUSING &quot;MOVEMENT69.   The voluntary housing movement holds a specialplace in the Government&apos;s housing policies.    it makes a distinctive contribution to meeting people&apos;housing needs.   It can rely on the Government&apos;scontinued encouragement and support.-26-
70.   Go-ownership societies have justified the hopes of the Government which launched them in 1961 and1964.   They are able to meet the   demand forco-ownership with the help of the option mortgagesubsidy available to their members.   The Governmentwill maintain the present arrangements governingthis form of tenure which increases the range of housing choice.71.   Under the Government&apos;s proposals housing associations and societies which provide rented accommodation will be brought within the ambit ofthe fair rent principle and the national rent rebatescheme.   For their future schemes the rent will belimited to the fair rent.-   Like private landlordsthey will be able to have a fair rent registered forall their dwellings.   They will be able to raisethe weekly rents of existing dwellings to the fair rent by annual steps not exceeding 75p and beginning .&apos;not earlier than January 1973 - when their tenantswill become eligible for rent allowances under thelocal authority&apos;s rent allowance scheme.72. These measures will secure for many housing associations a greatly increased rent income withouthardship to those of their tenants who cannot afford the rent increases involved.    Those associations whichhave already built up a stock of accommodation torent will thus be able to accumulate the funds needed to support further new building or conversion and improvement with the help of Exchequer subsidies.The existing Exchequer contributions for acquisition,conversion and improvement will continue, and theiradequacy will be kept under review.73.   The Government proposes that subsidies paid inthe past for new building should be withdrawn fromhousing associations on a basis similar to that whichwill apply to local authorities.   The withdrawal willbe timed to take account of the rate at whichassociations can increase their rents to the registered fair rent and of the extent to which theirrents are already at or above the fair rent level.-27-
74.    To stimulate further new building the government proposes a subsidy related to the initial deficitoved. arising on/schemes built for rent (other.than by an industrial housing association) where the income fromfair rents, which will be guaranteed by virtue of the rent allowances available, does not cover the initialexpenditure on loan charges, repairs and management.75.&apos;   The Government considers that the objections to a100$ deficit subsidy for local authorities apply alsoto housing associations.   Moreover the subsidy should not encourage the further fragmentation of the voluntary housing movement.    It is in the movement&apos;sbest interest that its members should be financiallystrong and engage on the major enterprise of new building only from a sound financial base secured bycharitable monies or surpluses from propertiesalready owned.76.   The new deficit subsidy will run for ten years,beginning with the year in which the scheme is completed, and will be reduced by stages to coincide with the triennial review of fair rents.   For thefirst three years the subsidy will meet 90$ of the deficit arising in the year of completion.   For thesecond three years the subsidy will meet 60$ of thatdeficit, for the third three years 30$ and for thelast year 10$.   Many local authorities may wish, as some already do, to support housing associations withcontributions from the rates.- -77.    There may exceptionally be schemes where, owingto unforeseen difficulties, there is a deficit, not met by subsidy which cannot in the event be covered .by rent income and reserves.   In such cases the localauthority or the Housing Corporation may be ready toallow repayments of principal and interest to be deferred and interest to be capitalised.   Where this measure is inadequate or inappropriate, the Secretaryof State will have power to defer reducing thesubsidy on the basis set out in the preceding paragraph, if the association can satisfy him thatits total financial position justifies special treatment.-28-
78.   At present housing associations wishing to buildwith the help of subsidy cannot borrow from theHousing Corporation.   Instead they normally obtain a loan from the local authority.   In future, they can continue to borrow from the local authority provided the authority has the right to nominate not less than50$ of the tenants of   the dwellings to be built.Otherwise the association will be free to approach the Corporation for loan finance for new buildingschemes from the Housing Corporation.    The Governmentis discussing with the building societies thepossibility of enlarging their powers so as to enablethem to lend direct to the Housing Corporation.    TheGovernment hopes that building societies will be willing to use such powers and thus give the voluntary housing movement more access to privatesavings,,79.   These measures will be adapted as necessary for those housing associations and societies which arecharities, including almshouse charities which cannotcharge a rent but normally obtain a contribution from the occupants of their dwellings.   special arrangements will also be made for the North EasternHousing Association.   Appropriate arrangements will bemade for schemes approved for subsidy, but not completed, before the Introduction of the new system.80.   The Government is also considering other aspectsof the voluntary housing movement in the light of areport based on the evidence presented to asub-committee of the Central Housing AdvisoryCommittee set up in February 1968.   Further changesmay be necessary to .consolidate and streamline themovement if it is to realise its full potential in are formed system of housing finance0-29-
NEW AND EXPANDING TOWNS81.     The reforms described in this White paper which affect local housing authorities and their tenants will generally apply to new town development corporations,  the Commission for theNew Towns and their tenants.     The details and provisions involved are explained in paragraph 33of Appendix 3.82c     The local authorities will have the sameresponsibility to pay rent allowances to tenants of private landlords and housing associationswithin the area covered by the development corporations and the Commission for the New Townsas they have for other private tenants.83.     The new subsidy system will also help tomaintain the momentum of overspill schemes, and soameloriate the housing problems of our conurbations,The arrangements for expanding towns are set out inparagraphs 2 and 12 of Appendix 3.CONCLUSION84.     Present housing policies will not cure theslums, the overcrowding,  the dilapidations or theindividual hardships and injustice suffered by many tenants, landlords and owner occupiers.This is because they fail to   concentrate resources to help people and areas in need.     The cure canonly come through a radical reform of housing finance.85.     The proposals described in this White paper will sweep away a financial structure which hasbeen assembled piecemeal in response to housingpolicies pursued with varying determination andconsistency over the last half century.     Theseproposals will also give the greatest help to areasof greatest need.     Subsidies will be concentrated on these areas where they will stimulate the clearance of slums, the building of new houses and the improvement of existing houses and sorelieve overcrowding, bad conditions and housingstress^-30-(CONRDEJfEAL)
86.     The reformed system is geared to meet thecircumstances of the individual.     It treatshousing as a personal service.   Tenant householderswill &quot;be helped in accordance with a discriminatingassessment of their needs.   Those who wish to own&apos;their own home will &quot;be helped to do so in everypracticable way.    These reforms are based on theprinciple of fairness.   They will establish a fair balance between owner occupiers and tenants and&apos;parity of treatment for council tenants and private tenants.    They will do justice between landlord and tenant.   They will have due regard to the reasonable claims of the citizen as a taxpayer andas a ratepayer, without placing on either.the inflationary burden of unnecessary taxes.87.   Taken together they provide a fair deal in housing with increased help for areas and people in need.-31-
APPENDIX I proposed FORMULA FOR THE TRANSITION TO FAIR RENTSI,     For the purpose of rent increases made in 19^2/3 and subsequentfinancial years,  a &quot;qualifying dwelling&quot; is a dwelling in the HousingRevenue Account   of the local authority whose current rent is below the fair rent for that dwelling as confirmed or altered by the RentAssessment Committee or a dwelling for which a fair rent has not yetbeen so confirmed or altered.2.     If the local authority has made a general rent increase between1 April 1972 and 30 September 1972, it will be required to make on1 October 1972 only such a further general rent increase (if any) as is needed(a) to s*secure an average increase in rent income for 1972/73 of 26 per qualifying dwelling;    and,(b) if the earlier increase averaged less than 50p a week perqualifying dwelling,  to bring the sum of the averages of thetwo increases to 75p a week per qualifying dwelling.3.     If the local authority has made no general rent increase between1 April 1972 and 30 September 1972,  but has made such an increase between 1 October 1971  and 31 March 1 972, it will be required toincrease rents on 1 October 1972 by whichever is the greater of(a) the amount which,  together with the previous increase, securesan average increase in rent income of  26 per qualifyingdwelling for the period between the date of the previousincrease and 31 March 1973s and(b) an average of 50p a week per qualifying dwelling,provided that(c) if the average of the previous increase was less than 25p aweek per qualifying dwelling the average increase on1.
(CON fid e NtIaIT)1 October 197^ is not less than 50p per qualifying dwellingplus that deficiency./M     If the local authority has Fnade no general rent increase between October 1971  and 30 September 1972 it will be required to make a rent increase on 1 October 1972 of  1 a week for every qualifying dwelling.5,     In 1973/4 and subsequent years, the local authority will berequired to make a rent increase averaging 50p a week per qualifyingdwelling on the following dates:(a) if there was a general rent increase on 1 October 1972, inOctober;(b) if there was no general rent increase on 1 October 1972, buta general rent increase between 1 April and 30 September 1972,in the month in which that general increase was made;(c) if there was no general rent increase on 1 October 1972, andno general rent increase between 1 April and 30 September 1972,but if there was a general rent increase between 1 October1971  and 31 March 1972, in April.2.
APPENDIX 2THE PROPOSED NATIONAL RENT REBATE SCHEMESCOPE OF THE scheme,     The local housing authority&apos; s rebate scheme will apply to tenants of unfurnished dwellings in the Housing Revenue Account,  except for service tenants.      (The authority will have discretion to apply itsscheme to tenants of its unfurnished dwellings in other accounts.)The authority1 s rent allowance scheme will apply to tenants of protectedor statutory tenancies under the Rent Act 1968 (except for tenants ofservice tenancies and premises with a business use), and to tenants of housing associations,  in the authority&apos;s area.CALCULATION OF REBATES AND ALLOWANCES2.     The model provisions prescribed by the Secretary of State forcalculating any rebate or allowance are expected to be initially asfollows (all calculations will be made on a weekly basis):-(1)    NEEDS ALLOWANCEThe authority will calculate a needs allowance,  to take account of the basic needs of the tenant and the othermembers of his family living in the dwelling, as follows:-^-For a blind tenant or spouse the needs allowance will be increased by 1.25 if one of them is blind and by  2.00 if both are blind.(2)    TENANT&apos;S income for the purpose of calculati ng the amount of any rebate orallowance the &quot;tenant1s income&quot; will be the average weeklygross income of the tenant and his spouse (plus 0.1% of anyuninvested capital over  300) except that the followingamounts will be disregarded:-Single tenant 9.50Tenant and spouse 13.50Each dependent child of the tenant or spouse..  2.501.
(a)any payment made to the tenant in respect of rent by another member of his household and by any sub-tenant;(b)the first  2.50 of the earnings of the tenant&apos;s wife;(c) the first  2 of any pension or payment made fordisablement to the tenant or his spouse;(d) the first  2 of any excess of war/industrial injurieswidows&apos;  pension over national insurance widow&apos;s pension payable to the tenant or his spouse;(e) the first  1 of any voluntary or charitable payments tothe tenant or his spouse excluding voluntary payments for maintenance or any payment under (a) aboveprovided that the total reduction under (c) -(e) does not exceed  2;(f)    any attendance or constant attendance allowance, anymaternity or death grants, or any sums payable as holderof the Victoria or George Cross paid to the tenant or his spouse.(3)    MINIMUM RENTSubject to the exception below, a part of the rent (the&quot;minimum rent&quot;) will not be met by a rebate or allowance.The minimum rent will be 40% of the rent of the dwelling or 1.00 whichever is higher, except if the tenant is in work(or out of work and subject to the &quot;wage-stop&quot;) and hisincome is less than his needs allowance.      In that case theminimum rent as calculated above will be reduced by 25% ofthe difference between his needs allowance and his income.2.
If the general level of rents in a local authority area is exceptionally high, the Secretary of State will beempowered to authorise the authority to provide in its rebatean allowance scheme for a minimum rent of less than 40$;and any provision so authorised will count as the modelprovision for the purpose of calculating the rent rebateor allowance subsidies referred to in paragraphs 8 and 13of Appendix 3.allowance, the amount of the rebate or allowance is to bethe sum equal to the difference between the rent of the(4)REBATE OR ALLOWANCEIf the tenant s income equals, or is less than, his needs3.
dwelling and any minimum rent, subject to (5),  (6) and (7)below.      If the tenant&apos;s income exceeds his needs allowancethe minimum rent will be increased by 17% of the excess.If the resultant amount is less than the rent of the dwelling,he will receive a rebate or allowance equal to the deficiency,subject to (5),  (6) and (7) below.(5)    MINIMUM REBATE OR ALLOWANCEThere will be no rebate or allowance if the entitlement is less  than 20p.(6)    MAXIMUM REBATE OR ALLOWANCEThere will be a maximum rebate or allowance of  6.50 outside london, and  8 in London.      (The authority may be authorisedto increase this maximum, if a lower minimum rent is. authorisedunder paragraph 2(3)  above,)(7)    REDUCTION FOR NON-DEPENDENTSThe rebate or allowance will  be reduced for the followingnon-dependents living in the dwelling occupied by the tenantby the following amounts:-(a)    For each non-dependent aged 18 years or moreand not undergoing full-time education or training: 1 .50(b)For each non-dependent of pensionable age and not in receipt of Supplementary Benefit: 1 .00(except that where two such non-dependentsare husband and wife the combined total for both will be: 1.50)(c)For each non-dependent receiving supplementary benefit (for this purpose the recipient and hisdependents will count as one non-dependent):65P
5.(8)    SPECIAL circumstances the authority will have discretion to grant a special rebate ori I I owaneo if the pcrsonnl circumstances- of the tenant areexceptional (eg to deal with special cases of hardship not covered by (I) -(7) above).    The authority will also havediscreLion Lo treat as the tenant,  for the purpose ofcalculating any rebate or allowance, another adult in the household if he is the principal earner.Some examples of the effect of this method of calculating rebates and allowances are given in paragraph 12 of this Appendix.PUBLICITY FOR THE REBATE AND ALLOWANCE SCHEMESBefore its rebate scheme comes into force the local authority will inform its tenants in writing of the circumstances in which a tenantwould be likely to be granted a rebate, the procedure for applying andthe details to be provided in an application.      It will give similarwritten information to its tenants once a year and in any case on a first tenancy or when the scheme is changed or rents are increased.The authority will also publish annually similar information about itsrent allowance scheme in the local newspapers and will make availablethis information in written form to any private tenant or landlord whorequests it.      Private landlords will be required to insert this information, within 4 weeks,  in any rent book issued on or afterI January 1973.PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING REBATES OR ALLOWANCESThe procedure for obtaining a rent rebate or allowance will be broadlyas follows.     The tenant will apply to the local authority for a rebateor allowance, unless he is receiving or eligible for supplementary benefit (see paragraph 9 below), and will furnish such information aswill enable the authority to calculate the amount of any rebate orallowance in accordance with paragraph 2 above.      For the calculation of the tenant&apos;s weekly income the authority will normally confine itself
to ascertain! ng,  and as necessary checking,  the income of the tenantland his wife during the last 5 weeks (if they are paid weekly) or thelast 2 months (if they are paid monthly) preceding the application,jut it will ascertain income over a different period if this is appropriate eg in the case of employment subject to seasonal variationsor the self-employed.15.    if tne authority decides to grant a rebate or allowance in response to an application,  it will normally have effect from the date of theapplication until 6 months (12 months in the case of pensioners) fromthe date on which the tenant was notified of the decision.      thereafter the procedure in paragraph /, will be repeated for as long as the tenantqualifies for a rebate or allowance under the authority&apos;s scheme.6.    During any period for which a rebate or allowance has been granted,it will be possible to alter (or, if appropriate,  to terminate) therebate or allowance to take account of changes in the tenant&apos;scircumstances, the rent of his dwelling or the authority&apos;s scheme.7.    The local authority will be empowered to require evidence from any private tenant who has applied for, or is receiving, a rent allowance of the amount of rent which he is paying;    and to terminate the allowance,or to pay it to the landlord,  if the tenant is failing to pay his rentregularly.8.    The local authority will have discretion as to the method andfrequency of paying rent allowances provided that these have regard tothe reasonable needs and convenience of the tenant.9.     Tenants receiving Supplementary Benefit will not have to apply tothe local authority for a rent rebate or allowance.      For the firsteight consecutive weeks benefit will be assessed on the basis of the rentcurrently paid by the tenant (after taking account of any rent allowance)and any rebate or allowance granted will continue.     From the beginning6.
7.of the ninth consecutive week the local authority will grant automaticallya rebate or allowance equal to the difference between the rent of thedwelling and the minimum rent (less any reductions to be made for non-dependents and subject to the maximum rebate or allowance) and the supplementary Benefits Commission will reassess the tenant&apos;s benefit onthe basis of that rebate or allowance.     While the tenant receivesbenefit the local authority will normally need to ask him for informationonly about the age and marital  status of any non-dependents living in thesame dwelling (and whether they are undergoing full-time education) and,for private tenants, whether the tenancy is protected or statutory.When the tenant ceases to receive benefit, he will be invited to make afresh application for a rent rebate or allowance based on his new circumstances.     Special arrangements will be made for &quot;wage-stop&quot; cases.PAYMENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SECURITY10.   Under an agreement reached in 1970 between the Government and the localauthority associations for England and Wales a local authority whichoperates a rent rebate scheme but excludes from the scheme tenantsreceiving Supplementary Benefit was recommended to pay to the Departmentof Health and Social Security a lump sum annually, calculated on an agreed formula, in respect of tenants so excluded.     Since existing legislation does not enable local authorities to make such a payment,they will be empowered to make one for 1970/71  and 1971/72.11.    When a local authority&apos;s rebate or allowance   scheme comes intoforce, or when those schemes are subsequently changed, or when the rentsof council dwellings are increased, it may not be practicable for thelocal authority immediately to calculate the amount of any rebate orallowance for tenants in receipt of Supplementary Benefit for more than8 consecutive weeks, or for the Department of Health and Social security to reassess immediately the benefit payable towards the rent.      In that
cisc the nuthori t.y,  by iigreomont with tho Department, will  not for thetime being grant any rebate or allowance, or alter an existing one, andwill subsequently pay to the Department a sum in respect of the rebatesor allowances thus withheld.12.   The Tables below illustrate the effect of the model provisions for the calculation of rebates and allowances set out in paragraph 2of this Appendix in the case of households in which the tenants wifeis not working, any children are dependent children of the tenant or his wile and there are no adults other than the tenant and his wife.8.

APPENDIX 3The proposed new subsidies for local authorities1,   The following new subsidies will replace all existing housing subsidies to local authorities, other than improvement contributions under the Housing Act 1969 and earlier Acts:Residual SubsidyTran sition Sub sidyRising Costs Subsidy^   Rent Rebate SubsidyOperational Deficit SubsidyTown Development SubsidyRent Allowance SubsidySlum Clearance SubsidyResidual Subsidy2,    The existing housing subsidies will in effect be phased out after1971/2.   This result will be achieved as follows.   The existingsubsidies wiill cease to be payable after 1971/2 but there will be atemporary and reducing subsidy, the Residual Subsidy, which will be related to the total amount of existing subsidies payable for 1971/2.The Residual Subsidy will be paid to the credit of the Housing revenue account (HRA).   The Secretary of State will determine each   localhousing authority&apos;s total entitlement to the existing subsidies for1971/2 (including any contribution received under Section 94 of theHousing Act 1964 and Sections 9 and 18 of the Housing Subsidies Act 1967).IThe amount so determined will then be reduced in 1972/3 by  20 for everydwelling (excluding temporary dwellings provided under the Housing(Temporary Accommodation) Act 1944) in the authority&apos;s HRA as at 31 March1972,   The balance (if any) will be the amount of Residual Subsidy payablejfor 1972/3.   The amount of any Residual Subsidy payable for 1972/3 willbe reduced by  20 for every dwelling in the HRA as at 31 March 1972 and1.
any balance will be the amount of Residual Subsidy payable for 1973/74.In subsequent financial years the amount of Residual Subsidy payable forthe preceding financial year will be reduced by  10 for every dwellingin the HRA as at 31 March 1972 and any balance will be the amount ofResidual Subsidy payable for that year.   This process will continue until no Residual Subsidy is payable for the financial year.Transition Subsidy3.    This subsidy will become payable to any authority, for the credit of its HRA, for any financial year towards the deficiency arising whenthe increase in net rent income for the year over the net rent income forthe preceding year is less than, for 1972/3*  20 multiplied by&apos;the numberof dwellings in the HRA as at 31 March 1972 or the authority&apos;s totalentitlement to existing subsidies for 1971/2, whichever is less, and, for1973/4 and subsequent years, the Residual Subsidy for the preceding year or the amount by which the Residual Subsidy for the preceding year exceeds the Residual Subsidy for the year, whichever is less.   The TransitionSubsidy will meet a percentage of this deficiency, and the balance of the deficiency will be met by a rate fund contribution to the HRA, as followss-Subject to paragraph 4 below, the Transition Subsidy and associated ratefund contribution which become payable for any financial year willcontinue to be payable for subsequent years up to and including 1981/2.Thus for any financial year from 1973/4 to 1981/2 there may be payable in the case of any authority an amount of Transition Subsidy, and a percentage to be met by:Transition Subsidy     Rate Fund Contribution1972/31973/41974/51975/6 - 1981/290858075101520252.
corresponding amount of the associated rate fund contribution,consisting of(a)the amount or amounts of subsidy and contribution which became payable for one or more of the preceding years,and/or(b)    the amount of subsidy and contribution which becomespayable for the year.4,    The amount of Transition Subsidy payable to an authority for any financial year, and of the associated rate fund contribution, will bein accordance with paragraphs 18 and 19 below.Rising Costs Subsidy5.   This subsidy will become payable to any authority, for the credit of its HRA, when the reckonable expenditure falling on the HRA for any financial year exceeds the reckonable expenditure for the preceding year.&quot;Reckonable expenditure&quot; will include all expenditure properly debitedto the HRA, subject, broadly speaking, to limits set for loan charges in respect of new dwellings (including car accommodation at the rate ofone car per dwelling) under the housing cost yardstick procedure, andfor the cost of repairs and management on a basis determined afterconsultation with the local authority associations.6.    Subject to paragraph 7 below, for 1972/3 and 1973/4 a percentageof the excess of any increase in reckonable expenditure over  6 for everydwelling in the HRA, and for 1974/5 - 1981/2 a percentage of the wholeof any increase in reckonable expenditure, will qualify for Rising CostsSubsidy and the balance of that excess or increase will be met by a ratefund contribution to the HRA, as follows:-limited to a total not exceeding the amount needed to balance the HRA3.
Percentage to be met by-Rising Costs Subsidy-Rate FundContribution1972/31973/41974/58090851015201975/6 - 1981/27525Subject to paragraph 7 below, the amounts of Rising Costs Subsidy and.of its associated rate fund contribution which become payable for anyof the years 1972/3 - 1976/7 will continue to be payable for subsequent years up to and including 1981/2;    the amounts of subsidy and contri-bution which become payable for any year after 1976/7 will continue tobe payable for the four subsequent years.   Thus, as in the ca&apos;se of transition Subsidy, there may be payable for any financial year after1972/3 an amount of Rising Costs Subsidy, and a corresponding amount ofi the associated rate fund contribution, consisting of the amount or amounts of subsidy and contribution which became payable for one or more of thepreceding years and/or the amount of subsidy and contribution whichbecomes payable for the year.7.    The amount of Rising Costs Subsidy payable to an authority for any financial year, together with the associated rate fund contribution will,as in the case of Transition Subsidy, be limited to a total notexceeding the amount needed to balance the HRA in accordance withparagraphs 18 and 19 below.Rent Rebate Subsidy8.    Subject to paragraph 9 below, each authority will make a rate fundcontribution to the HRA in respect of rebates equal to the cost of rent rebates granted to the tenants of its dwellings in the HRA for any financial year (including for 1972/3 any rebates granted under any existing rebate scheme) plus any payments in respect of rebates made for
the year to the Department of Health and Social Security (seeparagraph   11 of Appendix 2).     If the provisions of theauthority&apos;s rebate scheme are the same as the model provisions, the rent Rebate Subsidy will be a percentage of the whole of the rate fundcontribution in respect of rebates.     If the provisions of theauthority&apos;s rebate scheme are more favourable to the tenant than the model provisions (see paragraph I4.9 of the White Paper), the aithority will need to keep comparative records of the actual amount of rent rebates granted(and payments made to the Department of Health and Social Security) andits estimate of what the amount would have been if its rebate scheme hadcontained the model provisions;   and to apportion the rate fund contribu-tion in respect of rebates between the total estimated amount and the excess over that amount:   the Rent Rebate Subsidy will then be a per-centage of that part of the rate fund contribution equal to the total estimated amount.In either case the percentage will be determined by the year for whichthe rate fund contribution is made, as follows:-1972/3 90?o1973/4 85^1974/5 80^1975/6 - 1981/2 75/&apos;-The Rent Rebate Subsidy will be paid to the credit of the authority&apos;general Rate Fund.     It will not be payable towards the expenses of administering the authority&apos;s rebate scheme.9.     The rate fund contribution in respect of rebates will be limited toan amount not exceeding that needed to balance the HRA in accordancewith paragraphs 18 and 19 below.     If the rate fund contribution ofwhich the Rent Rebate Subsidy is a percentage is limited in this way,the subsidy will be limited nro rata.5.
Or.erational Deficit Subsidyi 10.    Subject to paragraphs 18 and 19 below, this subsidy will be payable for 1972/3, for the credit of the authority&apos;s HRA, at the rate of 5C$ of(1)   the difference between the excess of HRA expenditure for 1971/2 perIdwelling in the HRA as at 31 March 1972 over HRA expenditure for1970/71 per dwelling in the HRA as at 31 March 1971 and  15, if thelatter figure is less, 1multiplied by the number of dwellings in the HRA as at 31 March1972,plus(2)   the smaller of the rate fund contributions to the HRA for. 1970/71or 1971/72, if a rate fund contribution was made for both these years,plus(3)   in the case of a receiving authority under a town development scheme, any contribution received from a sending authority towards a deficit in the HRA for 1971/72.The authority will make a rate fund contribution to the HRA equal tothe amount of Operational Deficit Subsidy payable.11.   Operational Deficit Subsidy wilLnot be payable for any year after1972/3 unless it was payable for that year.     The amount payable for1972/3 and the associated rate fund contribution will continue to be payable until 1981/2, unless they are limited for any year to a total notexceeding the amount needed to balance the HRA in accordance with para-grahs 18 and 19 below.     If for any year the amount of subsidy andcontribution has to be reduced on account of this limitation, they willbe reduced by equal amounts and the reduced amounts will be the amountsPayable for subsequent years.     Once the amounts have been eliminated6.
(confidential)-&quot;or any year by reason of the limitation, the subsidy and contributionwill cease to be payable for subsequent years.Town Development Subsidy12.   An authority designated as a sending authority for the purpose of town development will make contributions from its general rate fund tothe general rate fund of the receiving authority for 1972/3 and sub-sequent years.     The contributions will meet the percentage of the ratefund contributions in respect of rebates which is not met by Rent RebateSubsidy and the rate fund contributions associated with TransitionI Subsidy and Rising Costs Subsidy which the receiving authority makes inrespect of tenants from the sending authority.     A Town DevelopmentSubsidy equal to 25$ of these contributions will be paid to the sendingauthority for the credit of its general rate fund.Rent Allowance Subsidy13.  If the provisions of the authority&apos;s rent allowance scheme are theI same as the model provisions, the Rent Allowance Subsidy will be a per-centage of the total amount of the allowances paid for the year plus any payment in respect of allowances made for the year to the Department ofHealth and Social Security (see paragraph 11 of Appendix 2).     If theprovisions of the authority1 s rent allowance scheme are more favourable tothe tenant than the mo del provisions (see paragraph 50 of the White paper), theauthority will need to keep comparative records of the actual amount of allowances paid (and payments made to the Department of Health and social security) and its estimate of what the amount would have been if its rent allowance scheme had contained the model provisions;   and to make a totalestimate of the latter amount:   Rent Allowance Subsidy will then be a percentage of that total estimated amount.     In either case the percentagewill be 100$ for the years 1972/3 to 1975/6.     Before the percentage forthe years 1976/7 to 1981/2 is determined the Secretary of State will(confidential) _-
(confidential)consult the local authority associations.     The percentage for these years will be 80$ unless the Secretary of State makes an Order providingfor a higher percentage for all authorities or any class of authority.The Rent Allowance Subsidy will be paid to the credit of theauthority&apos;s general rate fund.     It will not be payable towards theexpenses of administering the authority&apos;s rent allowance scheme.Slum Clearance Subsidy14.   This subsidy will be payable for the credit of the general rate fund to meet 75^ of the net annual loss for 1971/2 and subsequent years arisingfrom the authority&apos;s slum clearance operations.     The calculation of thesubsidy will be similar to the calculation of planning redevelopmentgrants made under Section 7 of the Local Government Act 1966.     Broadly,the net annual loss for any financial year will be determined by reducingto notional 60 year annuities:-(1)   the capital expenditure on acquisition and clearance, and thecapital values arising from the disposal or appropriation at thecurrent market value for the new use, of any land acquired forslum clearance after 31 March 1968 and not disposed of, orappropriated for another purpose, before 1 April 1971;   and(2) any capital expenditure incurred and capital income due in any yearbeginning with 1971/72 in connection with the making of demolition,closing or clearance orders;and adding to these annuities any revenue expenditure and income for theyear relating to such land and orders.Expenditure and income in respect of unfit houses retained to providetemporary accommodation after 31 March 1972 will be included in the calculation of the net annual loss, if possession has been taken of thebuses after 31 March 1972 and they have not been approved under section 13of the Housing (Financial Provisions)Act 1958.(confidential)
(confidential)Ihe Secretary of State will have power to exclude from the calculation of the annual loss for any year from 1986/7 onwards an annuity in respectof capital expenditure, capital values or capital income which arosemore than 15 years before the year.15.   For the purpose of the Slum Clearance Subsidy authorities willrequire the Secretary of State&apos;s prior approval only in special cases egfor counting for subsidy purposes expenditure and income relating to thepurchase by agreement, or appropriation, for slum clearance purposes of^land and buildings adjoining (but not surrounded by) a clearance area.Rate Fund Contributions to the HRA16.   In addition to the rate fund contributions associated with TransitionSubsidy, Rising Costs Subsidy and Operational Deficit Subsidy, and therate fund contribution in respect of rebates authorities will make thefollowing rate fund contributions to the HRA (subject to paragraph 18below):(1)   a contribution in accordance with a formula to be determined bythe Secretary of State after consultation with the local authority associations in respect of the expenses of administering the rent rebate scheme;(2)   a contribution equal to 1/3 of any improvement contributions payable to the authority for the year under the Housing Act 1969 and earlierenactments in respect of the dwellings in its HRA;    and a contributionequal to the excess for the year over the cost proper incurred bythe authority in carrying out improvement works under theHousing Act 1969 in respect of such dwellings;(3)   any contribution which the Secretary of State will have power torequire an authority to make in respect of land disposed of at lessthan market value, or to reflect the community&apos;s share of benefitsor amenities arising from expenditure incurred in the exercise of theauthority&apos;s housing functions;9.
(confidential)(4)a contribution equal to any excess over the reckonable expenditure for subsidy purposes;    such reckonable expenditure will be deter-mined in the same way as reckonable expenditure for the purpose of rising Costs Subsidy (see paragraph 5 above).17.   If in any year after taking into the HRA all the amounts properly-credited and debited to the account there is a deficit in the account,the authority will make a rate fund contribution equal to the deficit.Limitation of subsidies and rate fund contributions to balance the HRA18.   The amounts of Transition Subsidy, Rising Costs Subsidy, OperationalDeficit Subsidy, their associated rate fund contributions, the rate fundcontributions in respect of rebates and all other rate fund contributionspayable to the HRA for any financial year are to be limited to an amount in total which is sufficient to balance the account without increasingthe amount of the balance carried forward at the end of the year abovethe amount brought forward at the beginning of the year.     The balancewill be achieved by adding these subsidies and rate fund contributions(in full or in part) to the other income required to be credited to the account for the year in the sequence set out below until the total income in the account (including any deficit rate fund contribution which may benecessary under paragraph 17 above) equals the expenditure required to bedebited to the account for the year plus any balance which the authoritydecides to carry forward at the end of the year, provided such a balancedoes not exceed any balance brought forward at the beginning of the year,,The sequence will be as follows:(D   for the year 1972/73(a)     the rate fund contributions referred to in paragraph 16(1)- (4) above and any part of the rate fund contribution inrespect of rebates which is in excess of the total estimatedamount of rebates under the model provisions (see paragraph10.
(confidential)8 above), in any sequence desired by the authority;(b) the rate fund contribution in respect of rebates of which, the rent Rebate Subsidy meets a percentage;(c) Rising Costs Subsidy and the associated rate fund contribution;(d) Transition Subsidy and the associated rate fund contribution;(e) Operational Deficit Subsidy and the associated rate fundcontribution.(2) for 1973/74 and subsequent years(a) the rate fund contributions referred to at (l)(a) above;(b) the rate fund contribution referred to at (l)(b) above?(c) Operational Deficit Subsidy and the associated rate fundcontribution;(d) Rising Costs Subsidy and the associated rate fund contribution;(e) Transition Subsidy and the associated rate fund contribution.19.   The rate fund contributions associated with Transition Subsidy,Rising Costs Subsidy and Operational Deficit Subsidy will be reduced,under paragraph 18 above, in the proportion they bear to the amount of subsidy with which they are associated.   Where the total amount of transition Subsidy or Rising Costs Subsidy, together with the associatedrate fund contribution, which would otherwise be payable for any financial year is reduced in consequence of paragraph 18 above and thesubsidy and rate fund contribution consist of amounts which become payable in different years, the reduction will be made in the followingorder:    first the amount, if any, which would otherwise become payable for the year will be reduced;    thereafter the amounts which becamepayable in preceding years will be reduced, beginning with the amounts which became payable in the earliest preceding year and finishing withthe amounts which became payable in the latest preceding year.11.
(confidential)Abolition of Housing Repairs and Equalisation Accounts20,,   local authorities will no longer be required to keep a separateHousing Repairs Account for 1972/3 and subsequent years and expenditureon repairs and maintenance for those years will be debited to the HRA.Any credit balance in the account at 31 March 1972 will be transferredto the HRA and become part of the working balance carried forward to theyear 1972/73.   If there is a deficit in the Housing Repairs Account at31 March 1972 it will be transferred to the debit side of the HRA for1972/73 and will be treated as part of the repairs expenditure for thatyear.   A local authority which has a Housing Equalisation Account willclose it at the end of 1971/72 and transfer the balance to the HousingCapital Account.Working balances in the HRA21.   The working balance which may be carried forward at the end of any financial year will be limited to an amount equal to  30 multiplied by thenumber of dwellings in the HRA at the end of the year.   Any excess over this amount will be treated as a surplus and will be dealt with inaccordance with paragraph 22 below.   An authority will have discretion to treat a working balance within this limit as a surplus.

Claims for subsidies under the 1967 Act in respect of dwellings completed up to and including 31 March 1972 should be submittedby the date on which the legislation comes into effect.

Recipients who opt to receive acapitalised payment will be freed from any restriction as to the rentcharged for the dwelling on which the annual payment is now conditional.Unfit houses acquired for temporary occupation  .28.  Houses acquired for &quot;patching&quot; under section 13 of the Housing(Financial Provisions) Act 1958 will be taken out of the HRA for 1972/3attd subsequent years.

The arrangements for subsidies and rent rebates set out in this appendix will generally apply to New Town development corporations andto the Commission for the New Towns,   But the corporations and theCommission will not receive the Operational Deficit, Town Development,Rent Allowance and Slum Clearance subsidies as these subsidies are not appropriate to the circumstances of new towns.   The new towns will berequired to keep a Housing Account in a form similar to a localauthority&apos;s Housing Revenue Account.   They will make contributions toit from their General Revenue Account equivalent to the rate fundcontributions to be made by local authorities and supplementary grants under new towns powers will be paid to the corporations and theCommission to make good these contributions.   Any contributions by new towns to local authorities now made in order to facilitate comparablelevels of rent will be phased out, as this object will be achieved bythe application of the fair rent principle.17.
