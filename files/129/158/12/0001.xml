5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 87 COPY NO       (J \19 July 1971CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1975-76. REPORT on proposed ADDITIONSMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. In this paper I report the results of discussions with colleagues toestablish to what extent their proposals for additional expenditure could be accomodated within their respective programmes and propose how thenext stage of the review to find further offsetting savings should be handled.2. The totals of the proposed net additions to public expenditure as they stood at the time of the Cabinet&apos;&apos;s previous discussion (excluding steelinvestment on which we await the report of the enquiry later in the year)were:  million at 1971 Survey prices1972-73   1973-74   1974-75   1975-7641 88 124 2673. In Annex 1 I set out the position that has been reached on each of theproposals. In this form the amounts, net of savings, which they would add to public expenditure would be:Including Defence Budget(which only affects 1975-76)and prescription charges(see Annex 2)34 60 69 171Excluding Defence Budget 19 45 54 51and prescription charges &quot; /The components of these totals are summarised in Annex 3.
4. These figures show considerable progress towards the objectiveset by the Cabinet.    But, as was expected, they also show the need of a wider review, in the light of any firm decisions taken by the Cabinet as aresult of this memorandum.5. I suggest that this wider review should be conducted as follows:a. I should arrange for an interdepartmental study by officials,and report to Cabinet in September the means by which, asconsistently as possible with our policies generally, totals ofadditional expenditure shown in paragraph 3 above could be matched by reductions.b. We should indicate now whether in this study any of theadditional proposals set out in Annex 3 should be exempt from further scrutiny.c. The possibility of having to make further reductions forother reasons, such as increased pressure of demand or increasedsteel investment, should be borne in mind in the review.M V treasury Chambers SW119 July 19712

5*     Tho Lord Chancellors proposals involved net additional expenditure of a little over  1 million in&apos;1972-73 rising toabout  2 million in 1975-76*    He is not able to offset thisaddition by savings, but will bring the Bill into operation only from the beginning of 1973-74 and will seek to increase therevenue from court fees.     1 would regard this as all that is opento him in response to the Cabinet5s decisions *Support for Voluntary Social^service*     The Lord Privy Seal5 s separate report (CP&apos;(71)86) showsthat colleagues?in whose programmes the extra expenditure wouldbe incurred, have now said that they can find from within theirpresent provision about  1 million towards the extra fii). millionhe proposes for the whole periods     Outlets for this extra expendi-ture have been identified up to 197.1-74j   these figures havebeen extrapolated to make provision for the subsequent years,,The Cabinet must judge whether the general object of this expend!-ture and the smallness of the sums involved justify this departure from the normal processes for controlling public expenditureeCivil Defence7c     A report by officials has been submitted to the ministerial committee on Home Defence seeking their views on the future levelof expenditure on this programme *      The report sets out alter-native programmes, which could potentially increase the provision in the 1971 Survey by up to about  k million in 1972-73 and up to  .5 million a year in subsequent yearsfrQverseajLAM8e     The original proposal was for an increase for overseas aidin 1975-76 of  22 million at 1971 Survey prices (estimated to be equivalent in 1975-76 to  25 million in cash),,     Since then I have discussed with the Minister for Overseas Development an extendedproposal to increase both the cash totals for the years 1972-73to 19724.-75j, and the Treasury proposal for 1975-76 (embodied in the2
1971 Survey), to a level which would   maintain the same per-eentage of GNP under the latest forecast as these totals are shownin the Survey to represent under the previous forecasts,,.     Thetotal amount involved over the four years would have &quot;been  65million is?, cash, distributed as follows:  million1972-73       1973-74       1974-75       1975-7610 15 15 259*     I do not think it right to adjust the aid figures with every revised forecast of GX?P*.     Last autumn Cabinet decided to look again in 1972-73 at the aid figures for the following twoyears in the light of the development of the private flows as ares\ilt of our measures to stimulate private investments     Asregards 1975-76P if the Cabinet feel that the cash increment forthat year should he larger than in the previous year, and thatthere should &quot;be a programme for that year representing an increasedproportion of GHP, then I would consider the ease to have beenmade for raising the present 1971 Survey figure for 1975-76 of 375 million in cash &quot;by  10 million in cash (equivalent to about 8 million at 1971 Survey prices).Defence Budget10*     I understand that the Secretary of State for Defence isstill in the process of examining what will be involved in keeping to the published defence budget totals up to 1974-75;until this examination has been completed, we shall not be ableto consider the proposal for an extra  105 million in 1975-76,3
AHMBX 2THE FUTURE OF PRESCRIPTION charges the Cabinet have now decided to reconsider the question ofuncertain whether the saving of  -15 million per year from 1972-73included in the 1971 Survey will in fact be available.     I suggestthat, in the further study I am proposing, officials should makeallowance for the possibility of having to find this  15 million of savings elsewhere0prescription charge increases in the autumnIt is therefore
