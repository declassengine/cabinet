THE FUTURE SHAPE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCEBackground1. The Government published their proposals for reorganising local govern-ment in England, Wales and Scotland earlier this year.* They will introduce legislation covering England and Wales this autumn, and Scotland in the autumn of next year.2. Reorganisation creates the opportunity for reviewing local government finance and the Government now wish to stimulate a wide public debate on thefinancial implications of reorganisation and in particular on the financialrelationship between central and local government.3. Legislation will be needed before new financial arrangements could bebrought into effect. This would be introduced at the earliest opportunityfollowing the consultations arising from this Paper.4. The Government^ proposals for the structural reform of local governmentwill create larger units, better equipped to discharge their functions and toexercise their responsibilities. As the White Paper on Local Government inEngland said, &quot;A vigorous local democracy means that authorities must begiven real functions with powers of decision and the ability to take action without being subjected to excessive regulation by central government throughfinancial or other controls&quot;**. Any review of financial arrangements must seek to preserve and strengthen the financial responsibility of local government and to minimise detailed intervention by central departments.5. The right financial framework will be one in which central and local govern-ment can act as partners in promoting the welfare of the citizen, each exercisingits proper responsibilities with the minimum of overlap and potential conflict.Within this context the Government must remain responsibile for managing the economy and for controlling the level and distribution of public expenditure inthe promotion of national policies.6. Already local authorities incur nearly one third of all public expenditure.On present trends this proportion will increase. The scale of local government expenditure and its financing are therefore of critical importance in the manage-ment of the national economy. Moreover, the various possibilities outlinedmust be set against the Government^ electoral pledge to reduce and reformtaxation.Present Arrangements7. Local services are now paid for in two ways. Less than half only 40 percent comes from local rates and of this only half comes from the householder.*Local Government in England: Government Proposals for Reorganisation Cmnd. 4584.The Reform of Local Government in Wales Consultative Document HMSO February 1971.Reform of Local Government in Scotland Cmnd. 4583.**Cmnd. 4584, paragraph 8.
The other 60 per cent comes from central government out of general taxation -a proportion which has been gradually increasing over the years. These areaverage figures. For individual authorities the contribution from rates may beas much as 60 per cent or as little as 10 per cent.8. This contribution from central government is quite understandable. Thereare many areas of local authority activity education, police, fire and so on where the citizen will expect to receive a certain minimum standard of serviceregardless of where he may live. It is the central governments responsibility to see that this happens.9. One purpose of this Paper is to consider the ways in which local authorities may raise their share of their expenditure. The bulk of this now comes from therates.10. Rates have considerable merits as a tax: their yield is large exceeded only by taxes on income they can be varied easily from place to place, are clearlyrelated to the areas of local government, and are comparatively cheap to ad-minister and collect.11. But they have defects too. Their effect on individual ratepayers in somecases bears little relationship to ability to pay. The yield does not have thebuoyancy required to keep pace with the growth of services.Growth of Expenditure and Growth of Rates12. Local government expenditure is absorbing an increasing share of national resources. Even though its rate of growth has been slightly reduced recentlyit is still greater than that of the economy as a whole. Not only is the share of resources taken by local authorities growing faster, but the cost of providinglocal authority services is increasing faster than costs in general. This is because wages and salaries form an exceptionally large part of the total cost oflocal authority services so that the effect of pay increases on local authority expenditure tends to be more marked than on prices in the economy as a whole.13. The yield from rates, on the other hand, tends to grow more slowly.While the level of rates has over the last 25 years grown broadly at the same paceas earnings, the real growth of the values on which rates are levied new con-struction and the improvement or replacement of existing property - hasbeen much smaller than the growth in the standard and scope of services. the combined growth from these two factors the rate in the pound and the growth in property -has been insufficient to finance a constant share of local expenditure and the central government has therefore had to make good the gap.14. On present trends there will continue to be a gap between the amount required to finance a programme of development of local authority servicesand the yield of the local revenue on which the provision of such serviceslargely depends. This is clearly shown by the figures in appendix 1. Theproblem is how to fill the gap.
15. One possibility would be to cut back still further the rate at which localauthority expenditure is growing. But even without any improvement in standards some growth is clearly essential to cope with population growth and similar factors outside the control of local government. Any attempt to reducethe rate of growth must also deal with the inherent tendency to grow disproportionately-disproportionately fast because of the high proportion of pay mentioned in paragraph12.  There remains the question how fast we can afford to improve standards.16. Other possibilities would be to shift some of the burdens from localgovernment to central government and to increase the income from charges forthe provisionof certain services. But the first of these runs contrary to the Go vern-ment&apos;s objective of devolving power from central to local government, andthe scope for the second is limited.   They are discussed further in appendix 1.17. If local authority expenditure continues to grow in line with recent trends,there are three and only three possible ways of filling the gap referred to inparagraph 14: either property occupiers must pay more, or the national taxpayermust bear an increasing proportion of local expenditure; or new and buoyantsources of local revenue must be found.Filling the Gap18. The first course would mean for the householder that rates would beincreasing faster than his income. This would be widely resented by localelectors and would make the financing of local services progressively moredifficult for local authorities.19. The second course would be to continue the gradual increase, year by year,in the proportion of local authority expenditure met by central government grants. On the basis of the figures given in appendix 1, the gap betweenrevenue and expenditure could be met over the decade after reorganisation by increasing the overall grant percentage from its present level of 60 per cent toa level in 1985 of about 66 per cent.20. There are fears that the higher the contribution of central government theless responsibility remains in the hands of the local people. A block grantsystem can be designed to overcome this difficulty. Indeed sensitivity to changes in expenditure can be increased, in that if an authority has a fixed grant from the Government, and it then decides to increase its own expenditure, theincrease in that expenditure will be proportionately higher in relation to itsown income the larger the original government grant. Examples of this are shown in appendix 1.21. The third course would be to find new local taxes. In discussion ofvarious possibilities for different sources of local revenue no net addition to taxation is envisaged. To the extent that new sources of local revenue become available there will be a corresponding reduction in the need for nationaltaxation.22. There have been many proposals for abolishing rates and replacing themwith some new form of local tax, and the subject has been studied exhaustively
both inside government and elsewhere. Hitherto the almost universal con-clusion reached for example, by the Royal Commission on Local Governmentin England* has been that a property tax such as rates must remain the principalsource of local revenue, though it may be possible to reduce the extent to which local expenditure is dependent on the rates by providing other sources of revenue to supplement them.23. There is a distinction between giving local authorities a share in the proceeds of a central tax as opposed to making them free to fix their own tax rates fortheir own areas. The former is in effect a government grant. It is the latterwhich really adds to local discretion.24. Appendix 2 discusses the various possibilities for additional sources oflocal revenue. It considers their suitability as local taxes, the practical problems they raise and their wider impact on the management of the economy.25. In particular appendix 2 explores the advantages and disadvantages of alocal income tax, a local sales tax or value-added tax, a local employment orpay-roll tax, and locally levied duties on motor fuel and motor vehicles. it also mentions two possible methodspf increasing the yield of rates, the super-rating of non-domestic property,-^ surcharge on rates or poll tax for adultsother than householders, and announces that the Government have no in-tention at present of re-rating agricultural land and buildings. Finally thequestion of municipal lotteries is mentioned.26. The Government will wish to complete its consultations before forming a view on the merits of the possibilities discussed in appendix 2. But it may bethat none of them, either alone or in combination, could satisfactorily take theplace of rates. Ways of improving the rating system therefore must also be explored.Improving Rates27. One of the main disadvantages of rates is that they tend to hit hardestthose householders at the lower levels of income; in other words the lower therate payers income the greater the proportion of it that is taken in rates. Thereis already in existence a scheme of rate rebates to help the poorer ratepayer.We could graduate the relief and extend its scope so that, as with rent rebates,even householders with incomes above the national average could be coveredif they have large families and their rates are relatively high. In graduating therelief we could take account of personal circumstances in much the same way aspersonal allowances for taxes on income Rates would thus become much more closely tied to ability to pay, certainly at those levels of income at which they atpresent cause hardship. A possible means of doing this is put forward inappendix 3 as a basis for discussion.28. At present rateable values are assessed on the rent which the propertywould fetch. This presents problems, particularly with domestic properties.There is at present a scarcity of evidence of the rents that properties would*The Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England Cmnd. 4040.
command so that domestic assessements have tended to become increasinglynotional. Appendix 3 therefore discusses the possibility of changing to capitalvalues as the basis for assessing rateable values of dwellings. Such a changecould not be implemented immediately, because the valuers would need timeto prepare for it.29. The Government will wish to discuss with those concerned the possibilities for other improvements to rates, including changes in the present powers underwhich local authorities can levy rates on empty property. Some of these are mentioned briefly in appendix 3.Payment of Grant30. With or without additional sources of local revenue to supplement rates,local authorities must rely to a large extent on government grants to providea substantial part of their income. The future shape of the grant system is discussed in appendix 4.31. Of all grants paid to local authorities about 80 per cent are paid as rate support. The remainder are specific grants towards current expenditure on services such as police and towards capital expenditure on, for example, majorlocal authority roads. The total of grants towards current expenditure is fixed in discussion between central government and local government; allowance is then made for specific grants towards current expenditure about 10 per cent of this total and the greater part of the remainder, consisting of the needselement and the domestic element is distributed among authorities according toobjective formulae; the rest, the resources element, is distributed by referenceto current expenditure of individual local authorities.32. The Government intend to give greater freedom to local authorities.Specific grants tend to involve the central government in detailed supervision of the particular expenditure to which they relate. This is not so with thoseblock grants whose distribution is not directly related to the expenditure. TheGovernment therefore wish to explore with local government how best to absorb into block grant as many as possible of the remaining specific grants towards both revenue and capital expenditure.33. Block grant may be unable to ensure that sufficient contribution is made towards the expenditure on some services which may be substantial and irregularin incidence, particularly in district councils outside metropolitan areas. It is unlikely therefore that specific grants can be abolished altogether. Moreoverspecial considerations will apply to one or two particular cases such as the policegrant. Housing subsidies are dealt with separately in the recent White Papers0__a ^V&quot;)cwACmnd. 4728.34. Rate support grant is fixed in advance for two years at a time. Thisarrangement may be too inflexible and it is suggested therefore in appendix 4that the new block grant might be settled annually, but with a provisionalindication of the total for, say, two years beyond.
35. The distribution of grant between authorities takes account both of theirdiffering needs and of their differing resources. It is necessary to consider howfar in practice the existing system does adjust properly for both these factors.36. While the present arrangements take explicit account of factors such aspopulation, the number of school children, the miles of road and so on, theyfall short of securing a totally fair distribution between areas with differing needs.This may well be impracticable but it should be possible to devise a system underwhich the cost of providing a certain standard of service would for each localauthority represent a more nearly equal burden per head. Discussions with local government will seek to establish such a formula.37. The same problem exists when one considers the resources of local autho-rities. Under the existing arrangements those authorities whose yield from rates in relation to their population is below a standard level receive grant from the exchequer to make up the deficiency. At present the standard level inEngland and Wales is the national average although it is somewhat higher inScotland. This means that a number of authorities receive no resources grant.A more equitable result could be achieved if grant for resourses were given insuch a way as to put virtually all authorities on a par. This could be done by bringing them up to the level of one of the richer authorities.38. There remains another problem. Similar houses and flats have differentrateable values according to their location, so that occupants of similar propertywith comparable incomes in different local authority areas are faced with differentrate bills even when the rate in the pound is the same. This could be correctedby arranging for the distribution of the grant which is making good deficiencies in the resources to take account of these factors; but to do so would produceanomalies for non-domestic ratepayers. This in turn might be corrected bycharging different rates in the pound on domestic and non-domestic properties.The amount of grant towards resources paid to each local authority might be related to the rate in the pound which it levied in its area.39.   These questions are explored at greater length in appendix 4.Central/Local Government Relationships40. The Government wish to give greater freedom to local authorities, butthey cannot evade their own responsibility for management of the national economy, nor can they evade their duty to ensure minimum standards for essential services throughout the country. The problem for central governmentis how to resolve this dilemma within these constraints.41. So far as management of the economy is concerned, the central governmentare able to influence the decisions of local authorities on current expenditurethrough the block grant and in other ways at the same time leaving individual authorities free in the last resort to decide for themselves how much they wishto spend. The Government welcome this. In view of the close working re-lationship between central and local government, experience shows that theaggregate effect of all these individual decisions can be predicted with someaccuracy.
42. Capital expenditure presents different problems. There is a much greaterpossibility that, without central government controls, aggregate expenditure could substantially exceed the tolerable level. The local democratic concernmay be with the immediate impact the relatively small interest charges ratherthan with the massive capital expenditure itself.43. The Government have already introduced new procedures in England andWales. These have reduced detailed government control at the same timegiving local authorities greater freedom in planning their capital expenditure,simplifying administrative procedures and improving the central governmentsability to monitor the total level and main trends of expenditure.44. Under the new system capital projects in the &quot;key sectors&quot; those wherenational considerations and the need for maintenance of minimum standardsweigh heavily are controlled through programmes agreed with the re-sponsible departments. For other projects each authority or group of autho-rities is given a block allocation for each year to spend as it likes in the &quot;locally determined sector&quot;.45. As experience grows, particularly in the new authorities to be created bylocal government organisation, these arrangements could be extended, and inScotland it should be possible to introduce control of capital expenditure through a system of block allocations.46. Under the new arrangements the emphasis of the control is directed to theexpenditure itself and to its timing. The Government will wish to discusswhether the present statutory control on borrowing for individual projects the loan sanction is still appropriate or whether it might be replaced by a more general control over capital expenditure.47. The Control of Borrowing Order of 1958 made under the Borrowing(Control and Guarantees) Act of 1946 gives the Treasury a separate control which in recent years has been used mainly to regulate the terms and timing of borrowing on marketable securities for the purpose of monetary and marketmanagement and also to impose limits on the proportion of temporary debt.The Government in exercising their responsibilities will need to retain somepowers to regulate the borrowing of local authorities but will both review thenature of such controls and also seek to simplify and widen the borrowing powers of authorities. Thus all counties, or regions in Scotland, and district councils might be given a general power to borrow including the consilidation of those special powers, such as to borrow in foreign currency or by the issue of bills, which at present depend on local legislation.48. To ensure a real and effective partnership between central and localgovernment, ways must be found of enabling local government to influence the central governments decisions on the total of local government expenditure.The Government intend to explore with local government how best to arrangeinformed two way discussions within the timetable for the publication of theannual White Paper on Public Expenditure.
49. Already the Government have moved substantially in this direction, by making changes last autumn in the system for negotiating the rate support grant under which local authority associations joined with government de-partments in preparing central forecasts of expenditure, service by service basedon shared information. This partnership could be developed further by changesin the grant system itself. But so far these changes have been in the field of current expenditure; there is room for similar joint discussion of the properlevel of local government capital expenditure. The Government wish to con-sider how this can best be arranged.Consultation50. This Green Paper is published as a basis for consultation. The Govern-ment invite public discussion of the possibilities set out in it and stress theunique occasion that is presented by the reorganisation of local government.
Appendix 1TRENDS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE AND REVENUEGrowth of expenditure .1 Local authority expenditure is one of the faster growing elements in public expenditure. Throughout the first half of the 1960s it grew about 6 percent a year in constant prices about twice as fast as the growth of the economy as a whole. This rate has now been moderated: the average annual growth rateof relevant expenditure for the last two rate support grant settlements is 4.9 percent, and in the second of these-the current grant period it is 4.2 per cent.Even this lower rate of growth is greater than that of the economy as a whole,so local government is steadily absorbing an increasing share of real national resources.1.2 This is not the whole story, however. The cost to local authorities ofcarrying out a given level of services will vary if pay and prices vary. about two-thirds of local authorities&apos; current expenditure now consist of pay, and thisis a larger proportion than in the economy generally. The result is that the effectof pay increases on the expenditure of local authorities will be more markedthanit will be on prices in th^.economy as a whole. Past experience suggeststhat local authority costs tend to rise only about 1 per cent less quickly thanearnings in the economy as a whole.1.3 If these trends persist in the future a not unreasonable assumptiongiven the nature of local authority services the future growth of local authority expenditure in money terms can be derived and compared with the likely growth in rate revenue that will be available to finance this expenditure.Growth of Rate Revenue1.4 Real growth in the total of rateable values the rate base arises only from new construction and the improvement or replacement of existing prop-erty; revaluations are in essence price changes and thus do not represent realgrowth. Between 1964 and 1969 total rateable values increased at an average rate of about 2.7 per cent a year, but over a longer period, 1958-1969, the in-crease was somewhat lower 2.3 per cent a year. Current trends suggestthat it will continue at about 2\ per cent. In other words, the natural growth of the rateable value base is less than the expected growth in the expenditure at constant prices.1.5 The other factor which determines the yield from rates is future increases in rate poundages, which unlike the rate base are under the direct control oflocal authorities. Over the post-war period, taken as a whole, increases inrate poundages, adjusted for revaluations, have been broadly in line with earnings.If this relationship continues which would mean rates taking roughly the sameshare of future as of present incomes then rate poundages would rise 1 percent faster than local authority costs. Adding to this 1 per cent the 2\ per centgrowth in rate yield stemming from the increase in the rate base, the increase in revenue available to local authorities would be sufficient to finance a rate of growth of expenditure in real terms of 3^ per cent, provided that government
grant grew at the same rate and thus continued to bear the same share of ex-penditure. If, however, expenditure were to grow at a higher rate, there wouldbe a gap that would have to be filled in one of three ways by raising ratepoundages faster than earnings; by increasing the proportion of local authorities&apos;expenditure financed from central government grants; or from new sources oflocal revenue.Filling the Gap1.6 How significant this gap would be, and what filling it would entail, can be illustrated by the following examples each based on a starting assumption oflocal authority expenditure growing at 4 per cent a year in constant prices, witha consequent gap of f per cent to be filled each year.1.7 If this gap had to be filled by rates alone the first course poundageswould have to rise f per cent a year faster than earnings. This would lead toresentment on the part of ratepayers and consequent problems for local autho-rities.1.8 The second course would be a progressive increase, year by year, in theproportion of local authorities&apos; expenditure met by grants. On the basis of present trends, at the date of reorganisation in 1974, government grants will bemeeting around 60 per cent of relevant expenditure by local authorities. Thepercentage will be a little lower in England and Wales and much higher inScotland. On this assumption if rate poundages rose no faster than earnings,the gap could be filled with a progressive increase in the grant percentage,reaching about 66 per cent by 1985.1.9 One objection often made to a high percentage of government grant isthat it reduces the financial responsibility of local authorities. This is not,however, inevitable. While a high-percentage specific grant which is paid as a precise share of actual expenditure may have this effect, a block grant need not involve detailed intervention by central government, and so long as it is not increased or reduced to reflect actual expenditure, it can have, in some respects the opposite effect.1.10  The following example illustrates this.  If an authority which expects to spend about  lm receives a fixed block grant of  500,000, the remainingI.&apos;  5,000,000 has to be raised from rates.   If the authority subsequently decides( to spend 1 per cent more  1,010,000 the extra  10,000 has to come entirely from the rates; and to meet this expenditure they have to be raised to  510,000 an increase of 2 per cent. By contrast, if the block grant had been  750,000,with rates having to meet only  250,000, then a similar 1 per cent increase in total expenditure would increase the rates by  10,000 on  250,000  or 4 percent. Thus, although in the latter case the block grant is meeting a signifi-cantly greater proportion of total expenditure, the sensitivity of rates to localdecisions on marginal expenditure has actually been increased.1.11 For this reason, however, the higher the percentage of expenditure beingmet by grants, the more important it becomes that the formulae for distributinggrants should accurately reflect the needs and resources of individual authorities;
since, as the grant percentage in a block grant increases so, by the same token,does the sensitivity of rates to roughnesses in the distribution formula.1.12 The third course would be to find a new source of local revenue. If a source could be found with a yield approximately a quarter that of rates, thegrant percentage could be reduced from 60 per cent to 50 per cent in 1974,local revenues thus meeting 50 percent rather than 40 per cent of local expenditure.If the grant percentage were to be kept constant at that level, while rates were increased no faster than earnings, the new source of tax would need to have separately of growth in constant price terms sufficient not only to match the rate of growth of local expenditure (4 per cent), but also to make up the shortfall(I per cent) in rate revenue. Since the yield of the new tax would be only one quarter that of rates it would need to grow by an additional 3 per cent (4 x f percent) on this account a combined growth rate in constant price terms of about per cent a year, which is virtually unparalleled by existing national taxes.1.13 The yield of any new source of local revenue should therefore be bothsubstantial and buoyant if it is to fill the future gap between expenditure and revenue.   The possibilities are explored in Appendix 2.Charges1.14 An alternative to new sources of taxation, or to increases in rates orgrants, would be to reduce the expenditure to be met from taxes either by cutting back growth o^local authority services or by increasing the income which local authorities derive from charges for the provision of services.1.15 There are some services generally classed as &quot;trading services&quot;, forwhich charges are made. These include water supply, cemeteries, civic re-staurants, and aerodromes. The gross expenditure on them is about  400million a year, of which about  380 million is recovered in charges. Thereis room for increasing the amount recovered, but the effect on total local autho-rity expenditure would be small.1.16 Other local authority services also produce income by way of fees, rentsor recoupment. This amounts in total to some  300 million a year, excludinghousing rents and repayment of loans for house-purchase, and derives from a wide range of activities including charges to industry for trade effluent, charges for disposal of refuse other than normal dustbin emptying, and payments for health and welfare services such as home helps and accommodation in hostelsfor the aged.1.17 A careful review by local authorities of all these fees and charges mightwell produce some increase in income, but there seems little room for radical changes. To charge for an essential service such as dustbin emptying which isprovided on a standard basis to all ratepayers would bring little advantagesince rates already provide the most convenient and the fairest method of spread-ing the cost.1.18 There may however be some services which are not so essential and wherethe amount of use depends more upon individual choice.   In these cases there
may be some scope for further charging, and the Government will look tolocal government for suggestions in this field.Transferring Services from Local Government1.19 Another way of reducing the financial burden on local authorities wouldbe to transfer responsibility for certain services from local to central government.This could be done either by making a government department or other centralagency responsible for providing the service concerned, or by leaving localgovernment with managerial responsibility while transferring the financial burden in whole or in part to the centre.1.20 Any substantial move in this direction would conflict with the Govern-menfs objective of devolving power from central to local government, and should only be considered where there are overwhelming arguments which make thechange necessary. Any arrangement which separated administrative from financial responsibiility to any marked degree would be open to strong ob-objections both of principle and of practice.1.21 There are however a very few cases where local authorities provide a service in terms precisely defined by central government with virtually no room for local discretion, and in these cases there may be grounds not only for paying a high rate of specific grant but also for excluding both the cost of the serviceand the amount of the grant from the overall block grant settlement. as envisaged in Appendix 3 the revised system of rate rebates might be treated inthis way.1.22 It is sometimes suggested that the central government should meet thefull cost of teacher&apos;s pay on the, grounds that rates of pay are nationally deter-mined and local authorities have no discretion to depart from them. On theother hand it is a cardinal feature of our educational system that local authoritiesare responsible for the satisfactory staffing of their schools, and thus for theemployment and conditions of service of their teachers. Leaving local autho-rities with these responsibilities while passing the bill to central government wouldsharply divorce financial from managerial responsibility. It would also hinderthe development at local level of better forward planning of educational ex-penditure, which requires that all the resources involved teachers, buildings,and equipment should be taken into account on a common basis whenexpenditure decisions are taken.
Appendix 2ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF LOCAL REVENUEGeneral Considerations2.1 Many suggestions have been made for new sources of revenue for localauthorities, including new taxes or the transfer to local government of part or all of the yield from existing national taxes. This appendix explores the potentialities-tialities of those proposals which have been most frequently put forwardtogether with the problems they might raise.2.2 It should be stated from the outset however that the objective of new localtaxes is not to increase the overall level of taxation; it is to find means by whicha greater part of local authority expenditure can be met out of income raisedlocally by the authorities themselves, and a correspondingly smaller part there-fore met from government grants paid for out of national taxation.2.3 Some of the suggestions explored are simply the transfer of existing taxes.In these cases all that needs to be examined are the consequences of operatingthem as local rather than central taxes Others entail the creation of wholly new sources of revenue; in these cases the tax requirement of the central governmentwould be diminished by the reduction in its grants towards local authority expenditure. It may than be relevant to consider how far any adverse economiceffect of the new local tax could be offset by adjusting the pattern of nationaltaxes.2.4 Some of the local taxes discussed operate in other countries, and in whatfollows reference is made to foreign experience where relevant. But in con-sidering foreign experience it is necessary to take account of differences in thenational institutions, in the relationships between central and local government,and in the fiscal systems.2.5 Local taxation in any form raises one general problem. In a country likethe United Kingdom any local tax is bound to have some effects which spread be-yond the boundaries of the local authority determining the rate at which it isto be levied. The local authority&apos;s primary concern must inevitably be for finance to meet its own local needs; it must be governed by the views of the localelectors, and decisions taken in this light may not coincide with the widernational interest.2.6 With a single local tax it is possible for central government to judge withsome accuracy what the impact of local taxation on the economy will be. Butif there were a choice of local taxes, and local authorities were free to exercisethat choice in a number of ways by reference to local conditions, the task ofprediciting the impact of local taxation for the purpose of managing the economy would become much more difficult. Moreover a local authority is not in aposition to take account of the effect of its decisions in the national economy,whereas the central government is able to relate the levels of individual taxes to theneed to preserve a balance of taxation appropriate to overall economic manage-ment. It will always be in a better position than any individual local authorityto take account of the relative effects of various types of taxation on the economy
as a whole. In some countries in order to meet this problem a limit is imposed onthe rate at which a particular tax can be levied by local authorities, but thisgenerally leads to authorities all levying up to the limit. The tax then ceases to be locally variable and becomes a variant of government grant.2.7 In what follows the various sources of revenue are analysed under three main headings administration, suitability and economic effects.2.8 Under &quot;administration&quot;, in addition to discussion of the problems and cost of running the tax are comments on the practicability of genuinely localvariation in the rates of the tax. This is a key factor: some so-called local taxesin other countries consist of no more than the assignment to local authorities ofa predetermined share of a national tax which is levied and imposed on a country-wide basis. With an arrangement of this kind there is no possibility of the localshare being varied by local decision. Hypothecated revenue of this nature hasno advantages over the payment of government grant out of general taxation.On the contrary, it is less desirable: for it means that the central governmentmay be inhibited from raising or lowering the particular tax because of theeffects on local authority revenues, and the distribution formula, if simply basedon place of collection, is likely to be less sensitive to local needs than the formulaused for grant.2.9 Under &quot;suitability&quot; is discussed the potential yield and buoyancy of the tax and whether its effects would fall on the local electors in such a way as toimpose some discipline on local expenditure decisions. The dangers of conflict between the operation of a local tax and national economic policies are alsoexplored.2.10 It is clearly not worth considering a supplementary source of revenueunless it could make a significant contribution to meeting local expenditure andthus to reducing government grants. In the discussion which follows an indi-cation is generally given of the rate at which a new tax would have to be leviedto meet about 10 per cent of local authority expenditure, which would make it possible to reduce government grants from around 60 per cent to about 50 percent.2.11 It is also desirable that any alternative source of revenue should have a potential for growth at least as good as that of rates. Here it is necessary todraw some distinctions. The potential for growth of a tax depends on two separate factors: first its built-in buoyancy which is its power to provide in-creases in yield without increases in the rate at which it is levied and secondlythe scope for increases in that rate. Buoyancy itself may reflect price move-ments or increases in money incomes in accordance with the rising cost of living,or it may be the true buoyancy that arises from real growth in the tax base suchas increased consumption of petrol, more cars, a greater volume of sales, andreal growth of incomes. Rates themselves have some capacity for growth in both these ways: some increases in the yield flow from periodic revaluationsor increases in rate poundages, while others stem from real increases in totalrateable values resulting from new buiding and improvements of existingproperty.
2.12 Under economic effects&quot; is discussed the impact of a tax in national as opposed to local terms, and the possibility of correcting for this where appropriate.2.13 It may be convenient, when comparing possible sources of local revenue,to judge them by their ability to satisfy three main conditions. First is the praticability of genuinely local operation how feasible would be localvariations in the rate of tax. Second is the extent to which its effects fall on localelectors would they be sufficiently conscious of the tax for its impact to imposediscipline on local expenditure decisions. Third is the effect on the national economy as a whole what implications would the tax have on the cost ofliving or through industrial costs on the balance of payments and how readilycould its economic effects be offset by adjustments of national taxes.A Local Income Tax2.14 One of the criticisms most frequently levelled [against rates as the princi-pal local tax is that they are insufficiently related to the local taxpayers ability to pay; this would not be so, it is argued, with a local income tax.Administration2.15  A local tax on incomes and profits could take one of two forms:a tax assessed and collected locally, on information supplied by the InlandRevenue, or a system under which only the tax rate is fixed by the local authority with assessment and collection left in the hands of the Inland Revenue.2.16 Both systems would require personal information to be transmitted by the inland Revenue to local authorities, involving a substantial change in the presentstrict rules of confidentiality, to which most people attach great importance.2.17 Practical problems would arise from the fact that Inland Revenuerecords are kept mainly by reference to the address of the taxpayers employeror to his principal place of business rather than to his place of residence. Boththe Inland Revenue and the local authorities would therefore face additional work in putting the information held by tax offices into a form in which itcould be used by local authorities.2.18 To get the right amount of tax from individuals local authorities would need to know the total income of each resident. Tax offices hitherto haverarely been concerned with total income as such: most income of individuals istaxed at souce, whether under PAYE or deducted at the standard rate fromdividends and other annual payments, and a taxpayers total income needs to be ascertained only for the purposes of surtax or in a comparatively few cases forcertain personal allowances. While tax offices will become more concernedwith total income under the Governments proposals for reforming personaltaxation, in the great majority of cases such as taxpayers not liable at ratesabove the basic rate it will still not be necessary to compute total incomeexactly. This general difficulty might be reduced by excluding some forms of income, such as investment income up to a certain amount, but this would make for a more rough and ready scheme, giving rise to anomalies and inequities.Information about total income would not be available until well after the end
of the tax year. Local tax would consequently have to be assessed and paid on all incomes on the basis of the income of the preceding year, which mightbe greater than that in the year when tax was payable.2.19 If local authorities were responsible for assessment and collection theywould have to set up their own machinery, thus duplicating to a considerable extent the existing central machinery. Since they would be collecting the taxdirectly from the taxpayer and not at the source of income they would be likelyto need a relatively larger collection staff than the central government. Thedifficulties of collecting tax from people who are not householders, and who mayhave no distrainable effects, would also make their task more difficult than that of collecting rates. These problems would be avoided if assessment and collectionwere the responsibility of the Inland Revenue, but extra work would still be created.2.20 To deal with income from employment it would be necessary to adapt thePAYE system. The PA YE codes used for national tax would not be suitablefor local tax deducations because they take account of some factors which are,and would be, relevant only for national tax. Moreover, employers would haveto make separate tax deductions for each local authority area, with adjustmentswhen employees moved their homes from one area to another. Employersoperating on a nation-wide scale would have to face particularly heavy extraburdens. An alternative would be to apply direct assessment the system which would have to be adopted for dividends and similar payments to PAYEincome as well. This too would mean extra work for the assessing authority,on a larger scale than anything likely to arise from the Governments proposalsfor reforming the national tax system. A massive administrative effort would therefore be needed by the Inland Revenue, or the local authorities, or employers,or by some combination of all three, if the tax was to work satisfactorily.2.21 A number of questions would also arise in relation to companies. Manyoperate on a nationwide basis and very many are likely to operate in more thanone local authority area.2.22 The first question would be whether a company should pay tax to theauthority in whose area its central management and control is carried on, or tothat where it earns its profits. The former alternative would produce seriousdistortions in favour of London and the South East, where much of the manage-ment of the larger companies is concentrated.2.23 On the other hand the problem of allocating profits to the places wherethey were earned would be very difficult. At present the division of profitsamong the various activities and sources of income of a company does not normally concern the Inland Revenue, nor indeed need it concern the companyitself. Profits would need to be allocated between the different stages of a company&apos;s activity, and the scope for argument would be endless. Incomesfrom overseas, dividends from subsidiaries, royalties and other forms of incomewould present similar problems. The taxation of financial concerns, invest-ment and unit trusts, insurance companies, land sea and air transport companies,and pipeline operators would give rise to particularly acute problems in this context.
Suitability2.24 Demands on individuals would be more closely related to ability to paythan are rates, and local authorities would also draw a contribution to theirrevenues from the many individuals who are not, for r ating purposes, the occupiers of property, and therefore do not pay rates directly. The yield couldbe substantial an additional levy of about 3 percentage points on the stan-dard rate of income tax would finance a reduction in grant from 60 per cent tobelow 50 per cent and it would have a built-in buoyancy in a period of risingincomes at least as great as the national rate of increase of incomes. It is,however, less easy to envisage regular increases in the rate of a local tax on incomes, so that the real scope for local variation and matching the tax yield tolocal revenue requirements is rather less than might appear.Economic Effects2.25 With a local income tax alongside the national tax, central and localgovernment would be sharing between them the yield, and the built-in buoyancy,of taxes on incomes. Sharing any tax in this way brings its own difficulties to each party. On the one hand, the scope for independent local variation wouldbe severely limited; on the other, the central governments scope for manoeuvrein raising or lowering national rates would inevitably be reduced. Moreover,the economic impact of a change in national tax rates could be blunted byconflicting changes in the local tax.2.26 A local tax on income and profits would probably have little or no directeffect on industrial or export costs. But it would, on balance, be likely to add to the relative attractions of those areas which are already more prosperousthan the average, since they would be able to fix their tax rates at a lower level than less affluent areas.2.27 In a number of countries including the United States, Canada, Germany,Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland, the income of regional or local government authorities is derived partly from taxes on income and profits.The systems vary widely.2.28 In the United States and Canada, for example, the individual states andprovinces have their own legislative powers and as a result there are variations in the systems as well as in rates of tax. Thus in some states of America there isa local definition of taxable state income from which federal income tax isdeductible, while in others the state tax is based on the federal assessment.In these cases, however, the variations are generally as between states ratherthan local.2.29 In Germany and the Netherlands income tax accruing to local authorities is an assigned share of a national tax it thus amounts in essence to a form ofgovernment grant and elaborate rules and procedures for allocation become necessary.2.30 In Sweden, although the local income tax rests on national legislation, thelocal authorities, exceptionally, have freedom to determine locally the ratechargeable.  The system there requires every individual to be registered for tax
purposes as a resident of the appropriate local authority area; and this regi-stration is also used as the basis for the income tax levied by the central govern-ment. Each area is empowered to levy its own rate of tax on its total incometax base. This is, however, calculated by the central government, and the assessment and the collection of the tax remains with the centre. These arrange-ments, under which the system of national tax rests on registration in the area of residence, are quite unlike the UK income tax system which is related to the sources of income.2.31 Virtually all these regional or local income taxes have either grown up with the national income tax or preceded it. None of the countries mentionedhas such a highly developed system of deducting tax at source as the UnitedKingdom.Local Sales Tax or Value-Added Tax2.32 Local sales taxes have obvious attraction. Although major shoppingcentres and mail orders provide exceptions most shopping is done within thelocal authority area where people live.2.33 A few developed countries operate local sales taxes. The principalexample is the United States of America, where federal revenue is raised largely from direct taxation of persons and companies and there are no federal sales orother general turnover taxes. The existence of state and local sales taxes doesnot therefore lead to conflict between central and local taxation of the same goods and services. In most other countries, however, a significant proportion of central government revenue is raised from general taxation of goods and ser-vices; and the UK with its purchase tax and selective employment tax, which areto be replaced by value-added-tax VAT in April 1973, conforms to this pat-tern.Administration2.34 To avoid unfair competition retail sales tax would need to be charged onretail sales from all shops and other retail businesses, except perhaps the smallest.It would involve the annual assessment for local tax of between half a million and one million businesses, depending on the extent of the exemptions. Thiswould be a major administrative task. Different levels of local sales tax indifferent areas would add to the complications. These complications wouldbe most severe for businesses such as chain stores which operate in a number ofdifferent local taxation areas, since their pricing policies and accounting prac-tices would be affected. There would be problems in extending a local tax toretail services as well as sales of goods.2.35 Two particular points of difficulty call for special mention. First mailorder firms and direct sales by manufacturers and discount traders, which are important forms of retail trading, would not fit easily into the concept of a localsales tax. It would be a considerable complication to require such firms to account for tax, at different rates to different local autorities, according to the address of their customers yet exempting them would give rise to unfair competition. Second, there would be a problem in definiing a &quot;retail sale&quot; forthe purpose of taxation so that sales by shops to the ordinary purchaser were
covered but sales of industrial and commercial machinery and equipment for business use were exempt. Experience in other countries has shown that this problem can lead to serious administrative complications, that there is no entirely satisfactory solution, and that in practice a local sales tax falls to a substantialextent on business purchases.Suitability2.36 From the point of view of yield and buoyancy the attractions of a localsales tax may appear greater. Total consumer expenditure on goods and services in 1969 was about  29,000 million, giving a theoretical yield of  290 million fora 1 per cent tax. But this total includes expenditure on such things as rent, watercharges, fuel, and light, transport and communication charges, health, education,and insurance; if all these items were exempted, the yield from a 1 per cent rate of tax would be reduced to some  220 million. If, in addition, household ex-penditure on food were excluded, this would cause a further reduction of re-venue to some  160 million. All these figures ignore the[effects on consumptionof imposing the tax. With these exclusions a level of a little over 2 per cent would provide sufficient yield to finance a reduction in central government grants from 60 per cent to 50 per cent. The yield would have a built-inbuoyancy roughly equal to the annual rate of increase in consumer expenditure at current prices. This is less than the likely increase in local authority costs sothat regular increases in the rate of tax would be necessary even to match therate of growth of local expenditure let alone contribute towards meeting therevenue gap. This itself presents some difficulty since a tax set at about the2 per cent level does not leave much room in practice for fine local variation:small fractions of a percentage point would be cumbersome.Economic Effects2.37 The central government would have to continue to tax consumer ex-penditure in one way or another, so that a local authority sales tax, like a localincome tax, would be in competition with central government taxation over a wide area. This would impose some constraints on the yield and flexibility ofthe local tax, and would also have some effect on the use of the central govern-ment tax as a regulator of the economy. But these conflicts would probablybe less important than those arising from a local income tax. Differences in taxrates between local authority areas could, if they were large enough, lead tosome diversion of shoppers to lower-taxed areas with consequent criticism from traders in the higher-taxed areas.2.38 A further question is, whether it would be feasible to operate both a value-added tax VAT levied by central government and separate localauthority sales taxes. There is no direct precedent in overseas countries forsuch a combination. In France until a few years ago both a central governmentVAT and local sales taxes existed side by side. But at that time the VATextended only to the wholesale stage; and, when in due course the VAT was extended to the retail stage, the local sales taxes were abolished. There can belittle doubt that the simultaneous operation of both a VAT levied by centralgovernment and separate local sales taxes would impose very heavy admini-strative burdens on retailers; so much so that any attempt to introduce localsales taxes at or near the same time as VAT is introduced could hardly be
contemplated. Whether local sales taxes could subsequently be introduced inaddition to the VAT could be regarded as a more open question, which mightbe reviewed after some years&apos; experience of the practicial operation of a VAT,particularly in its application to retailers.2.39 It has also been suggested that local VATs might be introduced at thesame time as the national VAT. There are two possibilities here. If localauthorities were merely assigned a share of the national VAT, the argumentsabout hypothecation discussed in paragraph 2.8 would apply. There would bethe further question of deciding the basis for determining the size of the slicepaid to each local authority: if it were based on the amount of VAT collected in each area, then the level would be related to the value added rather than to the consumers&apos; expenditure in each area, and this might not be equitable as betweenareas. The second method would involve full local variation of the VAT,operated by local authorities on top of the national VAT operated by the centralgovernment. Under a VAT, however, firms can claim tax paid on their pur-chases as a deduction against tax due on their sales, and if there were separatelocal VATs this would often mean that tax paid to one local authority wouldbe claimed as a deduction and thus reduce the tax payable to another authority,which would not derive any benefit from the tax deducted. To avoid the dis-tortions this would cause it would be necessary to make each local authorityareas self-contained for local VAT purposes, but that would mean a system ofborder controls on the movement of goods between local authority areas.Such an arrangement hardly seems a practical proposition. It is perhapssignificant that no country which operates a VAT has any form of local VAT.A Local Employment or Payroll Tax2.40 A local employment tax would be an alternative to a local income tax asa means of sharing with local government some part of the buoyancy of taxesrelated to earnings. And it could be justified on the grounds of the connection between employment in a particular locality and the expenditure which thatlocality has to incur.Administration2.41 The simplest form of a local employment tax would be a flat rate per-centage tax charged on employers by reference to their gross payrolls. a flat-rate payroll tax falling on the employee would be no more than a crude andinequitable form of income tax and is not therefore discussed here. local administration would be comparatively easy for the taxing authority since themain burden would be placed on employers themselves thus adding, however,to the work that they already carry out for national purposes, such as collectionof income tax through PAYE and of National Insurance contributions.Liability to tax would be determined by where employees worked, rather thanwhere their pay records were kept. For the medium and large sized firmsoperating in more than one local authority area this would mean that separateemployment records by taxing locality would have to be compiled and main-tained for all their establishments. Special arrangements would be necessaryto deal with the complications of employees such as commercial travellers and construction workers who have no settled place of employment and whose workextends over a number of different tax areas.
Suitability2.42 In 1970 total payrolls, excluding central and local government, amountedto  22,000 million. Thus at a level of 2 per cent a payroll tax would financea reduction in central government grants from 60 per cent to 50 per cent andits built-in buoyancy of yield growing automatically with earnings would be substantial, although periodic increases in the rate of tax would still be necessaryfor the reasons given in paragraph 1.12. Increases in a payroll tax might bemore attractive to local authorities than increases in rate poundages, since onlya small minority of local electors are employers. The main burden of a payrolltax would not fall locally, since it would tend to be passed on in prices, and itsimpact would thus be felt by consumers generally, not just those living in thearea of the local authority imposing it. As with the local income tax, it isthe local authorities with the least flourishing industry and commerce whichwould feel the greatest need for other sources of revenue besides rates and thus be inclined to levy the employment tax at a high rate. This could have implications-tions for the central government^ regional development policies.Economic Effects2.43 A payroll tax would, for a given yield, have less effect on the cost ofliving than a sales tax, and a correspondingly smaller effect on consumptiondemand. It would, however, have a greater effect on industrial costs, andconsequently on the balance of payments. A 2 per cent rate of payroll tax would add an estimated  100 million to export costs. It would be difficult for the central government to offset this effect by other means, since payrolltaxes whether local or national cannot be rebated on exports.Motor Fuel Duty2.44 A significant proportion of local expenditure is devoted to catering formotor transport, and the control of traffic particularly in urban areas is becoming increasingly important. For this reason a tax related directly to theuse of motor transport is a natural candidate for consideration; and the RoyalInstitute for Public Administration put forward in their evidence to the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England a detailed scheme for providinglocal government with additional revenue out of the yield of the motor fuel duty.Administration2.45 A simple transfer of the motor fuel duty would mean that local authorities would take over its collection completely, with power to impose different rates.As an laternative the central government might continue to collect the bulk ofthe duty and distribute the receipts among local authorities according to the quantities sold in their areas; authorities could then be empowered to levy an extra local duty and perhaps to grant a rebate if they choose.2.46 If local authorities were made responsible for collecting any part of theduty on motor fuels, then operators of garages and petrol stations, oil distributors,and large industrial users who buy direct from the oil companies, would need to make regular returns of their sales or deliveries and to pay the appropriatelocal duty. Controls would have to be instituted to check the returns againstrecords of purchases and sales, and against meter pump readings, stocks, and
so on. Since there are nearly 40,000 retail outlets without counting the largeindustrial users which are not at present subject to revenue control, collectionof the duty would be more expensive to administer and more susceptible ofevasion than the existing arrangements under which HM Customs &amp; Excisecollect the duty from a relatively few refineries and bonded warehouses operatedmainly by large companies.2.47 The scope for evasion and abuse could be reduced if the central govern-ment continued to collect most of the duty and only a limited extra duty were collected by local authorities. But the administrative costs of supervising everygarage and commercial depot would remain.Suitability2.48 The rate of duty on motor fuel is currently 22Jp per gallon, and the dutyyielded just over  1,250 million in 1970-71. A transfer of about a third ofthe duty could compensate local authorities for a reduction in grant from 60 percent to 50 per cent. Local collection would produce revenue related to theamount of fuel sold in the area, but its effects would not necessarily fall on local electors, since private motorists would not necessarily be residents and business users might well pass on the cost in prices.Economic Effects2.49 The motor fuel duty provided over 8 per cent of central governmentrevenue inl970/71;itisalsoa maj or element in the effectiveness of the&quot; &quot;regulator&apos;&apos;,under which the Chancellor of the Exchequer can at any time impose a sur-charge or allow a rebate of up to 10 per cent on Customs and Excise duties and purchase tax. Transfer of the whole, or a substantial part, of this revenue to local authorities would curtail the central government^ scope for regulating the national economy particularly in the short term. The smaller the parttransferred, the less serious would be these effects; but, if local authorities weregiven discretion to vary the tax rates on their part of the revenue, partialtransfers would involve the general difficulties that arise when a tax is sharedbetween central and local government.2.50 A scheme which involved different rates in adjoining areas would alsotend to introduce distortions, since it would encourage both private drivers,and large users who purchase in bulk, to concentrate their purchases so far asthey could in areas where the duty was lower. Moreover, since much of theburden of duty on motor fuel falls on commercial vehicles and on motor carsused in business, significant variations in duty rates between different localauthorities would have important effects on local business and industrial costs,and thus lead to further economic distortion.2.51 The administrative difficulties of collecting the motor fuel tax locallycould be reduced by simply hypothecating to local authorities the yield or part of the yield of centrally-collected duties on some agreed basis; but thiswould raise all the questions concerning hypothecation which are discussed in paragraph 2.8.
Motor Vehicles Duties2.52   The ownership of motor vehicles is another possible candidate for local taxation.Administration2.53 The motor vehicle duties are at present collected by local authorities as agents of central government, but collection is being transferred to a centralcomputer system. This involves a complex process of transfer from localauthority collecting points to the centre, maintaining the existing arrangements as long as they are required, and should eventually bring staff savings, and make for easier enforcement. These are arguments against putting the process intoreverse; and no significant further changes in the machinery could be introduceduntil centralisation, which will take several years, is complete. So if thereceipts of the tax were to be transferred to local authorities, it would seem thatthe tax would need to be collected centrally and thereafter remitted by thecollecting authority. It would not be practicable to give local authoritiespower to vary the rates of duty before 1980, but it would be possible before this though probably not before 1977 to start distributing the proceeds to localauthorities while keeping responsibility for fixing the rates in the hands of central government.Suitability2.54 The transfer of private motor vehicle duties at the present rate of duty would finance a reduction in central grants from 60 per cent to about 53 percent. The duties on goods vehicles however do not seem to be suitable for transfer because of the ease with which the operational base of goods vehiclescan be moved, the complicated structure of rates, and their importance for national transport policy. The private motor vehicle duties would have theadvantage as a local tax that they would fall largely on local electors, although a significant proportion of private motor cars are used partly for businesspurposes or are provided by employers, and motorists are in any event lessnumerous than ratepayers. Against this, local variations would create admini-strative problems for centralised collection, and since owners would seek to register their vehicles in low-taxed areas, total yield might diminish, higher ratedareas might lose revenue, and inaccurate records might create difficulties of enforcement.  To overcome these problems extra staff would be needed.2.55 As the rate of growth of car ownership now appears to be slowing down,the buoyancy of motor vehicle duties is likely to be comparatively low, andfrequent increases could well be necessary if their yield was to keep pace withgrowth in local authority expenditure. But this would encourage vehicleowners to arrange the renewal of their licence immediately before the time whenincreases were expected leading to severe &quot;peaking&quot; of the work of issuinglicences, and thus, particularly after centralisation increasing the cost and difficulty of administration.Economic Effects2.56 Because of the number of private cars used for business purposes therewould be some addition to industrial costs if local authorities increased therates of duty more than central government. Otherwise the transfer of the motor vehicle duties would be unlikely to have undesirable economic effects.
Increasing the yield of rates2.57 An alternative to new local taxes as sources of additional revenue for local authorities would be changes to the existing rating system. These couldbe of two kinds: changes primarily designed to improve rates as a system oftaxation but which also thereby made increases in rate demands more tolerable;and changes whose object would simply be to increase the yield of rates.Improvements of the rating system are discussed in Appendix 3: the following paragraphs are concerned solely with means of increasing the rate yield.(i)  Super-rating2.58 In practice, the greatest constraint on increasing the yield of rates is theburden on domestic ratepayers, who have no scope for passing on any part oftheir extra rate burdens in prices or charges. If this could be eased, it might bepossible to increase the overall yield of rates.2.59 In the past, selective assistance has been given to various sectors of theratepaying community notably industry and agriculture in the depression ofthe 1920s by partial or total derating. Agriculture is still wholly derated, butindustry, at least in England and Wales, has been brought back by stages to full rating. The retention of partial industrial derating in Scotland is not designed to give industry an advantage relative to other ratepayers, but rather to ensure that the share of rates met by industrial ratepayers in Scotland is broadly in line with that of their English and Welsh counterparts. By contrast,the introduction in 1967 of the domestic element of rate support grant hasextended to dmoestic ratepayers a measure of gradual but progressive derating,with the result that in 1970-71 domestic rate poundages were on average just under 90 per cent of rate poundages for other classes of property. these arrangements, under which the domestic element of the rate support grantmakes up to local authorities, directly and in full, the shortfall in domesticrate yield, could be extended by providing that non-domestic properties shouldbe super-rated: that is to say that local authorities should be empowered to levy on the rateable value of non-domestic properties a higher rate poundage than on domestic properties.2.60 Super-rating would be an extension of rates in their present form, and itscollection would involve no additional administrative costs or problems.Either non-domestic ratepayers as a whole could be required to pay a certainpercentage above the rate poundage paid by the domestic ratepayer, or increases in rate poundages for domestic property could be fixed at a proportion of the increases applied to non-domestic property. This latter form would entail a progressive, and cumulative, degree of domestic derating.2.61 The yield of super-rating would depend entirely upon the degree of super-rating adopted; but to finance a reduction of government grants from 60 percent to 50 per cent would require an initial degree of super-rating on presentpoundages of about 50 per cent. A straight surcharge on rateable values would,of course, have no more built-in buoyancy than rates in their present form, sothat the yield of rates, with domescic rate poundages rising no faster than earnings,could not, even enhanced in this way, be made to match the rate of growth of local expenditure unless the degree of super-rating were progressively
increased. To fill the gap discussed in appendix 1, rate poundages for non-domestic properties, which account for roughly half the present yield of rates,would have to rise initially about H per cent a year faster than domestic ratepoundages. It would be possible with such a rise to hold government grant at a constant figure of about 60 per cent.2.62 Since super-rating would form a part of business costs, much of its burden would not fall locally; and, as with a payroll tax, those on whom it would be directly levied would constitute a relatively small proportion of the localelectorate. For these reasons, it would appear necessary for the centralgovernment to prescribe nationally the maximum degree of super-rating. Thiswould also help to avoid uneven effects on industrial and commercial costs as aresult of local variations, which would reflect, not simply the variation in local revenue requirements, but also variations in the local proportions of domestic and non-domestic rateable values.2.63 Super-rating would be a form of tax on investment, and would tend toincrease both industrial and commercial costs, including those affecting exports.The impact would be likely to be greater on commerce and services than on industry, though, within the latter, it would tend to bear more heavily on certain basic industries and public utilities. To the extent that these extracosts were passed on, this might well tend to magnify its effect on the pricespaid by final buyers. Even if the degree of super-rating were prescribednationally, the impact of super-rating would tend to vary between areas inrelation to their respective proportion of domestic and non-domestic rateablevalues. Modern industry moving into areas where rateable values for otherproperty are generally low and poundages consequently high, tends to bear ahigher share of the total rates than it would in more prosperous areas. Super-rating would tend to accentuate this, and thus to reduce the effectiveness of regional policies for encouraging industry into development areas althoughthe means of distributing government grants discussed in Appendix 4 couldcompensate for this.(ii) Surcharges on the rates for earning non-householders2.64 It is sometimes argued that there are a large number of persons with earnings or other income who make no direct contribution to the local revenue of the areas where they live because they are not, for rating purposes, the occupiers of property, and they thus pay no rates. It is pointed out for examplethat a family which includes several wage earners can nevertheless pay the samerates as the single old-age pensioner who lives next door.2.65 It is not as simple as it seems. Wage earners contribute to the cost oflocal authority services through the national taxes that they pay, since thereceipts from such taxes are used to finance the government grants on which local government largely depends. It would be wrong therefore to think thatthe earning non-householder escapes altogether from paying for the local services that he receives, even though he may make no contribution through thelocal tax and to this extent may be unresponsive to pressures on local expenditure.2.66  The proposal most frequently canvassed for making the earning non-
householder pay more is that the householder should be surcharged by way ofan addition to his rate bill of a proportionate or fixed amount for each earner.It would then be for him to recover an appropriate amount from each earnerif he wished.2.67 On the basis of the partial census of 1966, it is estimated that there were then 9 million such earners who were not rateable householders. This figure includes, however, not only those residing in private dwellings for whom the householder could arguably bejsurcharged but also those living in commercialpremises, such as residents of hotels, boarding-houses, hostels, and roominghouses. Since such premises are rated as businesses, residents are alreadyeffectively paying rates in the charge for their accommodation, and surchargesin respect of this category of earners would be difficult to justify. Nor would it seem reasonable to surcharge all persons residing in private dwellings whoare earning or have some income. There would be a case for some exclusions-for example, a householders wife, his children under 18, pensioners, and the disabled.2.68 Allowing for these exclusions, the total number of earners in respect ofwhom a surcharge might be levied would probably be reduced to 4 million.Identifying these 4 million would be a big administrative task. The onlyreadily available evidence of their presence is the electoral register; but this isnot comprehensive (it excludes aliens etc), nor would it be sufficiently up-to-date.There would therefore need to be provision for each local authority to requireall householders in its area who need not be rateable occupiers to makeannual declarations about the persons usually resident in their households atthe relevant date. There would presumably have to be penalties for non-compliance and false returns, which would encourage disputes about theinterpretation of terms such as &quot;earning&quot; and &quot;resident&quot; thus making thescheme more difficult to operate.2.69 The size of the surcharge would have to be arbitrary, but a proportionatelevy of more than 20 per cent of the rate bill for each additional earner wouldbe difficult to defend. On this basis, the yield would add no more than about per cent to the total rate call. About the same yield would be obtained froma fixed levy or poll tax of  10 for each earner.2.70 The administrative costs of any scheme would be substantial anddisproportionate to the relatively small yield. Moreover it could not be operated without giving local authorities extensive powers to enquire into the personal household circumstances of all domestic ratepayers a task thatwould be distasteful to many local authorities and would be widely resented bythe public.(iii)   Site Value Rating2.71 The rating of site values is another means sometimes proposed for increasing the yield of rates. Rates are a tax on the occupation of land and buildings and are charged on the rental value of property as it exists. Withsite value rating, on the other hand, rates would be levied on the market rentalof the site, on the assumption that it was available for the most profitable
permissible development. Since the beginning of this century the question ofsite value rating has been considered by a number of official committees andcommissions, and on every occasion the majority have come down against it.The most recent of these was the Erskine Simes Committee, which was appointed in 1947 and reported in 1952.2.72 The main arguments put forward in favour of site value rating are thatthe economic rent of the site is created not by the owner but by the community,so that it is right for the community to recover a share of this value by taxing it;that the rating of site values would encourage owners of land to bring it forward for development more speedily; and that, unlike the present system, site valuerating would not tax and hence discourage improvements.2.73 Against the first of these arguments it may be pointed out that capital gains tax may be paid on the development value of the land when it is sold,and the Government have recently, when abolishing the Land Commission,made it known that in their view this is the appropriate way for the community to share development value. The second argument perhaps has more force inrelation to underdeveloped countries than in relation to Britain, where the need is to channel and organise development in the best possible way, rather thansimply to encourage it. The third argument has some validity in the sense thatminor improvements, such as the addition of central heating to a house, wouldnot, under site value rating involve an increased assessment. But because sitevalue rating assumes the land to be subject to maximum permitted developmentregardless of the extent to which it has actually been developed it thus taxesbefore they have occurred categories of development which under the existing system would only result in increased assessments after they had occurred.2.74 The arguments against the rating of site values are partly objections ofprinciple. First it would tax not the current income or resources of the taxpayer,but instead his prospective and potential resources. In this it would exaggerateyet further what many already regard as the main failing of rates that they areinadequately related to the taxpayers capacity to pay.2.75 Second, it would tax land values not only before they were realised butoften when it would be quite impracticable to realise them for example, wherethere were several interests in the land and none of the individual owners couldredevelop because he could not acquire the other interests. Or, again, a sitecould be taxed for several years on a high development value that might thenbe lost through a change in planning proposals, or for some other reason,before the ratepayer had realised any part of it.2.76 Third, site value rates would have to fall on the owners of the land,because they rather than the occupiers benefit from development value. Itwould, for instance, be unfair indeed impracticable to tax the occupier ofa slum dwelling on the possibly high development value of the land on whichhis dwelling was situated. Thus the link between local taxation and localrepresentation, which is an important aspect of any local tax, would be muchweakened.
2.77 There would also be practical difficulties. First, a pilot survey carriedout in Whitstable in 1963 by the Rating and Valuation Association indicated that site value rating could price amenities out of existence. Under the rulesadopted for that study, rates on the local golf course, for example, would haveincreased seventy-fold. Second, there seems little doubt that the problems of valuation, and therefore the scope for grievance and litigation, would be greaterand more extensive than with the present basis of a free market rental, becauseof the scarcity of evidence of site values and because it would be more difficultto reconcile differences of opinion about values in the absence of a corpus of decisions from the Courts. Third, owners of land are less easily identifiedthan occupiers, and collection and recovery would be more difficult. Finally,there would have to be frequent changes in valuations to keep up with changesin the planning situation.2.78 It is sometimes argued that site value rating works satisfactorily in othercountries, but the circumstances are dissimilar. In particular, as the ErskineSimes Committee recognised, site value rating is inconsistent with the systemof planning control existing in this country since 1947, under which planning permission for development can be refused without payment of compensation and, in consequence, the market value of land depends very largely on the precise details of the planning permissions which may have been granted.(iv)   Rating of Agriculture2.79 One further possibility which deserves discussion as a means of increasingrate revenues is the reimposition of rates on agricultural land and buildings.The Royal Commission on Local Government in England described the deratingof agriculture as an anomaly which ought to be removed. Certainly this is theone substantial class of property that is$ill exempt from rates. The exemptionwas originally granted when agriculture was a depressed industry, and circum-stances now are very different. Arguments can be adduced both for and againstrerating. But, although there would be no technical problem in valuingagricultural land and buildings for rating, it would impose a substantial task of valuation on scarce professional staff-who could not cope simultaneously with the introduction of capital values for dwellings and could probably notbe completed before the 1980s. The Government do not therefore propose tomake any change at present in the treatment of agriculture for rating purposes.Lotteries2.80 It has been suggested that local lotteries could provide a source of addi-tional revenue for local authorities, and individual authorities have from timeto time sought power to promote lotteries on their own behalf. Many other bodies have also seen lotteries as a potential source of funds for their own pur-poses. The Government have already announced that they will review the wide issues raised by these suggestions, and that meanwhile proposals forfurther amendment of the law on this subject must rest in abeyance. The questionof municipal lotteries will be among those considered. The Governmentassume that if any power to promote lotteries were to be given to local govern^-ment, it ought to be conferred generally rather than confined to individual authorities.
2.81 Calculation of the likely yield from a system of municipal lotteries mustbe made on this basis. It must also take account of the competition both from established forms of gambling such as the football pools and from anyother bodies such as charities which might be allowed to operate lotteries ontheir own behalf. These matters should be clarified by the current review, and meanwhile it is not feasible to put a figure to the potential yield.2.82 Some foreign countries have lotteries, but these tend to be either statemonopolies or devoted to a single purpose. Moreover, in these countries there is less competition from other forms of gambling. Foreign experiencedoes not therefore provide a guide to the potential yield of a system of municipallotteries.
Appendix 3IMPROVEMENT OF THE RATING system the Rating Authority3.1 In England and Wales the rating authorities at present are the countyborough councils and the borough and district councils, the latter two levyingrates to cover the net cost of the services performed both by themselves and bythe county councils. The county councils obtain their share of the levy byprecepting upon the borough and district councils, the amount of the preceptbeing expressed in terms of a specified rate poundage in the area of the districtauthority. This arrangement, which is clearly set out in the combined ratedemand, enables the ratepayer readily to identify how much of his rate bill is attributable to each authority.3.2 In the new two-level system proposed by the Government the new counties and districts will be independent of one another, but it seems necessary to retainan arrangement whereby one authority collects the rates for both. Whether thecounty council or the district council is better fitted to do this is arguable, butthe Government have already announced their decision that the present system under which the district councils are the rating authorities should be retained.3.3 Similarly in Scotland the new regional and district councils will be independent of each other and each should determine the rate to be levied tomeet its net expenditure, but both rates should be collected by one of them.This will involve more substantial changes from the present financial patternthan in England and Wales and the Government propose to discuss the question with the Scottish local authority associations before the precise arrangements are determined.The advantages and disadvantages of rates3.4 Despite the criticisms frequently levelled at them rates have many positivemerits as a local tax. Their yield is substantial, certain, and predictable; andstraightforward increases in poundages secure proportionate increases in yield.They are a tax on fixed property which is unambiguously related to one parti-cular area and cannot be transferred to another area to take advantage of a lower level of taxation. Their burden falk; to a large extent, on local electors though not all local electors pay rates and the need to raise poundages to finance increases in expenditure provides a direct link between what the localelectorate demands in terms of local services and what it must pay to financethem. There is virtually no scope for evasion, and local variations present nodifficulty. The cost of collection and administration including the cost of valuation, at less than 2 per cent of yield, is low by comparison with the costs that would be entailed in local operation of other possible taxes. in short, rates satisfy very well the main tests of a local tax set out in paragraph2.13.3.5 But rates also have disadvantages. For the domestic ratepayer at thelower income levels rates tend to be regressive&apos; that is to say, the lower thehouseholders income the greater the proportion that will be taken by hisrates although at average income levels and above rates are no more regressive
than the other main taxes on expenditure. Moreover rates are the largest taxwhich is demanded in substantial amounts from those of average means or less.In the commercial and industrial sectors, rates fall relatively heavily on those whose operations depend upon substantial investment in fixed property and plant and anomalies in the rating of plant and machinery aggravate this effect.Periodic revaluations are needed to ensure that rateable values maintain theirrelationship with current rental values, and, between revaluations, poundageincreases are necessary simply to offset the effects of inflation. In addition,valuation of dwellings has become increasingly difficult because there is atpresent a growing scarcity of evidence of open market rentals, on which rateablevalues are based, in large parts of the domestic sector.The scope for improvement3.6 Many of these disadvantages could, however, be moderated, if not cured,by improvements to the present rating system.3.7 The regressiveness of rates at low income levels has already been mitigatedby a rate rebate scheme. This was intended to be an interim scheme, pendingthis review of local government finance, and paragraphs 3.13 to 3.22 outline amore refined scheme, extending to ratepayers further up the income scale, as apossible replacement. If an effective scheme reached up to about the averageincome, rates would cease to be regressive compared with most other taxes.3.8 The proposal sometimes put forward that rates should be allowed as a deduction against income tax would if anything make the rating system moreregressive, and would not allow fairly for variation in family income. three factors bear on this: first, those who paid no tax would get no relief; second,the larger reliefs would tend to go to taxpayers with the larger rate bills; and,third, the higher the marginal tax rates on the income of a ratepayer the greaterwould be the relief.3.9 The impact of rate demands for large amounts at a time has already beenlessened by the right accorded to domestic ratepayers in legislation introduced by the previous Government to pay rates in not less than ten monthly instal-ments. Payment by instalments in this manner could be further encouraged,and might indeed become recognised as the normal pattern of payment. Itmight be facilitated by having a tear-off strip on the demand note which would need only a bank address and a signature to become a standing order on a bank.3.10 It may well be possible to remedy any anomalies in the rating of plant and machinery. The Government are setting up a small expert committee toexamine this question.3.11 Periodic revaluations of the present kind could be avoided only if the concept of open-market value were abandoned, but it is difficult to find analternative basis which would be regarded as generally fair and which would nothave more serious drawbacks. The disadvantages of this aspect of the rating system could perhaps best be minimised by ensuring that revaluations are notpostponed beyond the statutory quinquennium.
3.12 The scarcity of evidence of open-market rental values in the domesticsector might be overcome by changing from rental to capital values, evidence ofwhich is much more widely available. An appropriate conversion factor could then be used to convert these values to rateable values which would comparesatisfactorily with those of sectors still based on rental values. The possibilityof this change is also discussed in detail below.A new scheme for rate rebates3.13 The present rate rebate scheme was introduced in 1966, and provides forthe remission of two-thirds of the rate bill above a minimum payment of  7-50a year for householders whose income falls within specified limits. The presentqualifying income limits are  12-25 a week for a married couple, and  10 aweek for a single person, increased by  2 for each dependent child. House-holders with incomes above these limits also qualify for some rebate, but theamount is tapered off sharply as income rises so as effectively to exclude altogetherthose with incomes above  20 a week or thereabouts.3.14 About 900,000 householders received rebates in 1969-70, and there were,in addition, over 2 million households on supplementary benefit whose rates were fully taken into account in the allowances they received. This means thatsome 3 million households about 18 per cent of the total in Britain at presentenjoy full or partial relief of rates on grounds of low income.3.15 Experience of the present scheme has highlighted its main weakness.In the first place, it is limited in scope. The qualifying income limits are not far above the supplementary benefit level, and they are well short of the levels of income at which rates cease to be markedly regressive; moreover the sharprate of taper means that, for those qualifying for other welfare benefits which also taper off as income rises, the combined rate of reduction can be unaccept-ably high. Secondly, all those whose income falls within the qualifying limits whether only just or by a substantial margin are entitled to the same degreeof relief. Finally, the treatment of income from disablement pensions, and ofadditional members of a household such as housekeepers and relatives otherthan spouses, is anomalous and can cause hardship.3.16 These weaknesses could not be eradicated merely by raising the incomelimits, since it would still be impossible to differentiate between differentincome levels within those limits, and thus to adjust the amount of rebate tothe degree of need. In order to overcome them it appears that a new schemeis necessary, in which not only would entitlement to relief extend further up theincome scale, but the amount of relief given would also be graduated in relationto income.3.17  The main features of such a scheme might take the following form.3.18 Entitlement to relief would be based not on gross but on net income. Thiswould be arrived at by deducting up to, say,  2 a week for income from dis-ablement pensions and other payments of a similar kind to the sick or handi-capped, and deducting variable allowances in much the same way as for income tax purposes for the single person, the married couple, and dependent
children. The problem of additional adults in the household could be dealtwith by giving the householder an option between a proportionate reductionin the amount of rates reckonable for the calculation of rebate as in the present scheme, or aggregation of incomes within the household combined with a furtherpersonal allowance for each additional adult whose income was aggregatedin this way.3.19 The amount of relief might be two thirds of the amount by which ratesexceeded a specified percentage of net income. So long as rates took less thanthat specified percentage of net income which might be 6 per cent the rate-payer would be required to meet them in full. The provisions for tapering offrelief as incomes rose could be made as gradual or as sharp as seemed desirable,taking into account the arrangements for entitlement to other welfare benefits.To avoid excessive administrative cost it would doubtless be necessary to provide that no relief would be paid where the amount involved was less than a minimalsum.3.20 The applicant would have to declare his gross income from all sources, andif entitlement to relief was based on income for the preceding tax year, then for those assessed by PAYE the majority the certificate of pay and tax deducted Form P 60 would provide most of the necessary evidence. However, tomake the scheme more responsive to significant falls in income levels, provisionmight be included to enable rating authorities, where circumstances justified it,to base the calculation of rebate on current income in, say, a quarterly period.As in the present scheme, those in receipt of supplementary benefit including an allowance for payment of rates in full could be excluded.3.21 With a scheme of this kind, extending the possibility of relief for those with a number of children and relatively high rate bills to householders withroughly the average national income, over 3 million ratepayers might qualify for rebate, and the loss of rate income might be of the order of  65 million ayear as compared with  16 million for the present scheme. The greater partof this loss of income might be met by the Government through a high-percentagespecific grant outside the rate support grant arrangements.3.22 A scheme on these lines would do much to mitigate the present regressivecharacter of rates at lower income levels, and thereby reduce public dissatisfaction-tion with them as a tax. The details given are for illustrative purposes only,and the outline is put forward as a basis for further discussion. There would clearly be advantages in aligning the details as far as practicable with the newrent rebate proposals.Assessments of dwellings on capital values3.23 Although adequate rental evidence is available for valuing properties inthe non-domestic sector, there has been a growing scarcity of rental evidencefor valuing dwellings. Taking the domestic sector as a whole, there is now more evidence of capital than of rental values, and this preponderance is likelyto increase. This is not true everywhere, however. Thus although there isplenty of evidence relating to property of types attractive to owner-occupiers,there is very much less relating to older houses, flats in converted premises, and
houses in multi-occupation, which have a capital value as an investment butare not generally sold with vacant possession. In some areas there wouldbe little or no evidence of capital values, and evidence from further afield wouldhave to be used. On balance, however, it seems likely that a change to capitalvalues as the basis of assessment for dwellings would increase the evidence available for this sector. For properties such as shops with dwelling accom-modation and houses constructed or adapted in part for some other purpose mixed hereditaments there is not the same scarcity of rental evidence as forproperties used exclusively for dwellings. For these properties, as for thenon-domestic sector, there would seem to be no justification for a change fromrental values.3.24 Such a change would not be quite as straightforward as it sounds. Saleprices sometimes reflect the personal preferences and needs of a particularpurchaser not to mention anticipated development value rather than thevalue to any occupier, and are quite sensitive to state of decoration and repair.Capital values would need careful definition to take account of such factors.It would also be necessary to find an appropriate divisor for converting capitalvalues to rateable values comparable to those of other sectors which would stillbe based on rental values.3.25 Some of these problems could be lessened by the adoption of a system of&quot;broad-banding&quot; of capital values for assessment purposes. Up to a capital value of  5,000 properties might be grouped together in successive bands of 250 value; between  5,000 and  10,000 in bands of  500; and thereafter inbands of  1,000. Rateable value might then be calculated on the lower limit of the band in which the property fell. It might also be provided that duringthe currency of each Valuation List no increase or decrease in assessmentshould be made unless the alteration in capital value amounted at least to thewidth of band in which the existing capital value of the property lay. Thiswould avoid much of the criticism that arises now from increases in rateable value following minor improvements to houses, and incidentally would alsosave a lot of litigation.3.26 One disadvantage of change would be that the wealth of case law support-ing valuation methods based on rental values would be superseded, and unlessthe new definition was more precise extra work and litigation would be entailedin dealing with the new problems to which capital values would give rise.3.27 A change to capital values might result in some changes in relativitiesbetween the assessments of different types of domestic property. The 1973revaluation in England and Wales, which will still be based on rental valuesbut which will allow evidence about the value of any type of dwelling to be usedin assessing that of any other, is in any case likely to produce some changes ofthis kind. The effect of a change to capital values might be to increase theassessments of houses particularly modern ones, but also older houses tosome extent by comparison with assessments on purpose-built flats andmaisonettes; while assessments would move in the opposite direction for near-slum houses and &quot;white elephants&quot;.
3.28 A decision to change to capital values as the basis of assessment of dwellings could not be implemented before the 1978 revaluation since the valuerswould require some time to prepare for such a change.Empty property rating3.29 In England and Wales, under provisions introduced by the Local Govern-ment Act 1966, a rating authority may resolve to make all empty property inits area liable to half rates, subject to &quot;free periods&quot; of six months for newdwelling-houses and three months for other properties. Once the provisionshave been adopted they must remain in force for at least seven years unless theSecretary of State agrees to waive them. Rating authorities have no discretion to levy the &quot;void rate&quot; selectively on certain classes of property: they must rateall empty properties, or none.3.30 Local government has criticised the minimum period of seven years, andthe inability to levy the void rate selectively, as lacking the necessary degree of flexibility to suit local circumstances. Others have argued for mandatoryrating of empty property and even penal rates not simply to increase rateyield but as an instrument of social and economic policy.3.31 Rates on empty property cannot be expected to provide much revenue,though to the extent that they act as an encouragement to owners to expedite the sale of vacant property, and hence its rating in full, they provide more extrarevenue than can be identified. In some areas, however, the additional costof collection may outweigh the extra revenue; and in areas with a surplus ofsome kinds of property empty property rating might encourage prematuredemolition rather than re-occupation.3.32 Because of the wide variety of reasons why property is left unoccupied, itwould be difficult to justify making the rating of empty property mandatory; but since empty property makes some call on rate-borne services, there are grounds for continuing the existing discretion to levy half rates on empty property.But there is a strong case for giving rating authorities power to specify classesof property on which the void rate either should, or should not, fall, and for reducing the seven-year minimum period for operation of the rate to, say, threeyears in which event the provision for Ministerial waiver could probably be dropped.3.33 In Scotland there are different provisions which are mainly at the discre-tion of rating authorities. There has been very little criticism of these provisions,or of the way in which they have been operated, but they will be reviewed withthe local authority associations.Assessments by formula3.34 The rate liability of some public utilities notably gas, water, electricity,and the National Coal Board-is assessed by formula. Statutory docks and harbours in England and Wales are a recent addition to the list: in Scotlandit is intended that they should be rated by formula from 1972-73 onwards.
The Government have promised to review the Order establishing the formula for the statutory docks and harbours before the revaluation in 1973, although they do not intend to make any radical change in the general basis of theformula. They will be examining the other formulae, in consultation with thelocal authority associations and appropriate bodies representing the operationalinterests, to see whether changes are justified in the light of other changes inthe rating system.
Appendix 4THE FUTURE SYSTEM OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENT GRANTSIntroduction4.1 Whether or not additional sources of local revenue can be found, govern-ment grants must continue to provide a substantial part of local authorities&apos;income. The system under which grant is paid will thus play a cardinal role in the relationship between central and local government. The opportunityoffered by local government reorganisation for a radical re-examination of thegrant system must not be lost. And this aspect of local government finance isone which, above all, demands close consultation with representatives of localgovernment. The ideas set out below are put forward as a basis for such discussion.Character of grants4.2 One of the first questions to be settled is the relative weight to be givento block grants and specific grants respectively. How much of the total grant should be distributed as a block grant to which entitlement is determined byobjective formulae ? And how much should be related to actual expenditure on particular services? Block grants in some form have existed for a very longtime. The Local Government Manpower Committee, however, drew particular attention to the detailed controls and intervention in local affairs which specific grants entailed and this led to the introduction of general grant under the LocalGovernment Acts of 1958. Since then block grants have become dominantamong government grants.4.3 General grant replaced 10 specific grants and, together with rate deficiencygrant, accounted for about 75 per cent of the grants paid towards the current expenditure of local authorities. The shift towards block grants was takenfurther by the Local Government Acts of 1966, under which rate supportgrants account for 90 per cent of grants towards current expenditure. A returnto specific grants would be inconsistent with the intention that local government reorganisation should bring to local government greater freedom from detailedcontrols by central government. It seems therefore that as much as possible of the central government assistance to local expenditure should be given inthe form of block grants, and the Government therefore wish to explore with local government how many of the remaining specific grants may be absorbed into the block grant.f-74.4 Despite the changes made in 1958 and in 1966,-44* specific grants towardscurrent or capital expenditure of local authorities still exist. In the current year it is estimated that if the police grant,  111m, the highways capital grant, 123m, and housing subsidies,  245m, are excluded, these specific grants will amount in total to no more than  100m or about \\per cent of local govern-ment expenditure. Under many of them the amounts paid are very smallindeed, but they each involve, to some extent, a specific control by centralgovernment over local authority activities; and the need to account for each indetail involves both local and central government in more work than if the servicescame within the block grant arrangements.
4.5 There may be good reasons why some of these grants should continue.Some are not so much grants as payments made for a service provided by localauthorities as agents for central government; and it is therefore appropriate that some or all of the cost should be borne by central government in the formof a directly related payment and indeed that there should continue to becontrol. Certain civil defence expenditure falls into this category. others are grants which are paid also to persons or bodies other than local authorities,and for which local authorities are eligible when acting in a similar capacity.It seems inconsistent to deprive local authorities of such payments. An example of such a grant is that paid to fishery harbours, only a minority of which are theresponsibility of local authorities.4.6 A specific grant may be justified also where the expenditure on a service is large in relation to the resources of individual authorities, and its incidenceis so irregular that it could not be adequately reflected in the distributionformula of a block grant. Such circumstances should, after reorganisation, befound rarely except, perhaps, in the case of some district councils outsidemetropolitan areas.4.7 Special considerations apply to the police grant. The maintenance oflaw and order is a primary responsibility of central government, and there is aspecial constitutional significance in the joint responsibilities of local authoritiesand central government for the police service. The existence of the specificgrant for police recognises these.special factors, which would appear to justifyits retention. Special considerations also apply to the grants for magistrates&apos;courts and for the probation service in England and Wales, since, on these services, discretion effectively lies with the responsible committees of magistrates,rather than with the local authorities who provide the facilities.4.8 Grants for the urban programme and for commonwealth immigrants,which are tailored to provide selective assistance to areas of specific need, might also be retained.Determination of the Block Grant4.9 For rate support grant as for general grant before it the legislationprovides that grant shall be fixed for not less than 2 years ahead. This was intended to provide some stability letting local authorities know in advancewhat grant they would receive, and thus giving them the maximum freedom to plan their own expenditure ahead. In practice grant has never been fixed for more than 2 years ahead, and both central and local government have, fromtime to time, felt that even biennial settlements were too inflexible. As analternative to the present pattern of biennial settlements, the total expenditure to which grant relates and the figure of grant might be provisionally settled fora 3 year period, but confirmed in relation only to the first year. Settlementsof grant would be annual, but combined with the best indication possible ofthe trends for, say, 2 years beyond.4.10 An annual system would inevitably impose an additional burden of negotiation on both sides, but this might be considered a reasonable price topay for the advantages the changed system would bring.   In particular, annual
settlements could be more closely meshed in with the Governments annualsurveys of public expenditure, in this way fitting in with the suggestions outlined in paragraphs 48 and 49 of this paper for associating local government more closely with these surveys.4.11 Annual grant settlements and forecasts could, as at present, be made interms of prices and rates of pay known and settled at the time of the settlement subsequent increases when appropriate being taken into account in increaseorders at the time of the negotiation of the next grant settlement.4.12 As mentioned earlier in this paper although the Government are seeking to give local authorities as much discretion as possible, they must be concernedwith the total demand on national resources arising from the decisions of individual authorities taken as a whole; and must seek to influence these decisions by the amount of grant provided to augment local revenues. In eachgrant settlement therefore the Governments primary interest will be the pro-spective total of local authorities&apos; current expenditure; but they will also be concerned in the share to be borne by local taxes and what contribution shouldbe made from national taxation by way of grants.4.13 The present definition of &quot;relevant&quot; expenditure, or &quot;reckonable&quot;expenditure in Scotland, which is taken into account in determining the totalof government grant comprises all expenditure out of the rate fund which hasto be met from rates or grants, with certain specific exclusions. These include,in particular, contributions to housing revenue accounts and trading accounts.Payments from one local authority to another other than payments of rates onproperty occupied by the authority are also excluded, these exclusions are not,however, made in the distribution of the resources element of rate support grant.4.14 Since the Government are interested in the total of local authority expenditure, and also since the distinction between &quot;trading&quot; and &quot;non-trading&quot; services is largely a matter of accounting convention which variesbetween authorities, it is suggested that no items of expenditure met from therate fund should be excluded, other than payments between authorities that could lead to double counting. But consideration might also be given toexcluding payments of rates on local authority property, both between authori-ties and by an authority to itself, since at present these enter into both expenditure and income.4.15 Once the forecasts for the total expenditure have been settled, it will befor the Government to take a view on the contribution that government grants should make. On this basis the present arrangement by which specific grants are treated as essentially a special element in the distribution of government grant as a whole would continue to be appropriate. But the present arrange-ments under which certain grant-earning expenditure is excluded from the totalof relevant expenditure are inconsistent with the principles set out in para 4.14above and lead to anomalies, and it is therefore suggested that all such expendi-ture, including the gross expenditure of the metropolitan police, should betaken into account.
Distribution of grants4.16 Under the present grant system, having determined the total amount ofthe government contribution the amount expected to be paid by way of specific grants towards current expenditure is deducted and the remainder is the amountdistributed as rate support grants. Some of this is set aside as the &quot;domesticelement&quot; to make good the loss of income from the reduction imposed by theGovernment in the rates in the pound which are levied on domestic ratepayers.The remainder the great majority of the grant is distributed as &quot;needselement&quot; and &quot;resources element&quot; which have regard to the needs of an authorityto incur expenditure and to the resources available for that purpose. block grant systems for many years have dealt separately with needs and resources and it is convenient to consider them individually now.Equalisation of needs4.17 The formula for the distribution of the present &quot;needs element&quot; incor-porates over a dozen factors which are related to the need for local authority expenditure. These are: total population, numbers of children under 5 yearsof age, persons over 65, primary and nursery schoolchildren, secondary school-children, further education students, university awards, school meals served,low density in persons per mile of road, high density in persons per acre, longterm decline of population, the mileage of non-trunk roads and principal roads,and a special factor for authorities in the metropolitan police districts. Theweightings attributed to all these factors, however, do not provide for equalisation-tion of the burden of meeting needs; and, since the distribution formulae were originally established by reference to specific grants paid towards actual expenditure on individual services, one would expect to find only partialequalisation. With the evolution in the weightings over time there are nowconsiderable variations in the extent to which various needs are equalised.4.18 The right objective would seem to be the distribution of grant in such away that the cost for each local authority of providing a standard level ofservice should be a standard amount per head.4.19 To achieve this completely, it would be necessary for grant to correct infull for the effect on the cost of providing services of every local variation fromthe average distribution of population. For the education services, for example,where the number of pupils can be readily determined, it is possible to calculatenational average unit costs per pupil for primary and for secondary education,and to relate these to the number of primary and secondary pupils per 1,000total population in a local authority area. But unit costs for some other services such as the welfare services for the old and for the very young are more difficult to determine, since the level of expenditure reflects deliberatelocal choice to a far greater degree. The objective factors in the presentformula for distributing the needs element which are related to populationdistribution attempt to take some account of variations of this sort.4.20 But the cost of providing a standard level of service varies widely through-out the country, and indeed the provision of a standard level everywhere is impracticable. In a large urban area a well-stocked library is probably availablewithin walking distance; but in a rural area the inhabitants may have to be
satisfied with a weekly visit by a van, and even so the cost of the latter servicemay be greater than that of the former. All block grant systems in the pasthave taken some account of variations of this sort by incorporating someweighting for sparsity of population. But the problem is not limited tosparsity. For some services, such as transport, costs may be higher in congestedconurbations.  Other examples could be quoted.4.21 For reasons such as these, complete and precise equalisation of needswould be impracticable. However, if the principle of equalisation to a standardcost per head is accepted, it ought to be possible to derive a formula whichwould get a great deal nearer to this ideal than the present needs element formula.4.22 The formula need not necessarily include all the factors which are atpresent incorporated. After reorganisation some of these may no longercontribute significantly to the variations in the need for expenditure, nor maythey be an accurate guide to what determines such needs. There may be other factors which, although not previously recognised, are more relevant. Statisticalanalysis should make it possible to isolate factors which have a significantcorrelation with the incidence of expenditure at present, and in this way toderive new factors and co-efficients which can be combined in a new &quot;needselement&quot; formula. It would be possible with such a formula to take accountof changing needs as they develop, and also to introduce weightings designedto encourage a change in the pattern of expenditure. For example, weightingsmight be introduced to advance the Governments policies for development areas and Intermediate Areas; or to reflect more closely the various demands on the social services.4.23 Work will need to be done, in consultation with local government, toestablish an appropriate formula, but this would not necessarily be appropriateindefinitely and any legislation should allow as much latitude as possible forvariation of the formula from time to time as needs change.Equalisation of resources4.24 The present resources element of rate support grant has the effect of bringing up to a standard level the resources of all authorities with rate productsper head below that level. In England and Wales at present the standard level is the national average, but in Scotland it is somewhat higher. Since the objectof the grant system is to distribute a fixed total of grant among all local authoritiesin relation to their true needs and resources, a more equitable result could beachieved if a resources grant were given in such a way as to put virtually allauthorities on a par. This could be done by bringing them up to the level ofone of the richer authorities.4.25 Because the formula for distributing the present resources element isbased on the rate product per head of population, it results in equal ratepoundages as between authorities incurring a standard expenditure per head.Thus if, after deduction of the needs element and of all grants other than theresources element, the expenditure per head of the authorities which receiveresources element were uniform, so would be their rate poundages.
4.26 But equalisation of rate poundages does not necessarily equalise theburden on ratepayers. The wide variations in the rental values of domesticproperties through the country lead to similar variations in rateable values,with the result for example that the rateable value of a 3 bedroom ParkerMorris house in a northern industrial town may be only half that of a similarhouse on the south coast. The range for comparable dwellings can be as muchas 1 to 3, excluding Central London whose high values would further extend the range. Thus, if rate poundages were equal, the occupant of the house inthe north would be paying only half the rates paid by the occupant of the house in the south. It is true that there are also regional variations in the level ofwages, but these are not by any means as great; the range of variation in averageindustrial earnings between regions is only about 14 per cent. Thus the occupier of a house in the south is likely to be paying a substantially higher proportionof his income in rates than the occupier of a similar house in the north ofEngland. To take full account of these variations a revised system might attempt to equalise not rate poundages but rate payments by comparabledomestic ratepayers, by bringing into the distribution formula not only rateproducts per head of population but also variations in the rateable value of standard council houses and variations of average industrial earnings in each county or region.4.27 Regional variations in the rateable values of comparable non-domesticproperties are far less significant. Thus, while a system which sought toequalise the rate burdens for comparable householders might be appropriate for domestic ratepayers, a system designed to equalise rate poundages through-out the country might be more equitable for non-domestic ratepayers. Thereis thus a problem; that the system of equalisation which suits the domesticratepayer may not suit the non-domestic ratepayer, and vice versa.4.28 This problem might be solved by differential rating that is to say,levying a rate of one poundage on domestic ratepayers and of another on non-domestic ratepayers. Differential rating in itself would not be new, in that the domestic rate poundage is already less than that levied on non-domestic rate-payers, and at various times in the past there has been partial de-rating ofparticular categories of ratepayer. The novelty would be that the differentialbetween domestic and non-domestic rate poundages would vary from authorityto authority.4.29 This variation need not, however, be at the discretion of the individualauthority. A relatively simple formula, similar to that used at present to calculate for each area the percentage entitlement to resources element, couldbe used to calculate the percentage by which non-domestic rate poundagesshould be reduced below, or increased above, the poundage to be levied on domestic ratepayers in the various areas. The calculations could be made and the percentages prescribed by central government.4.30 Differential rating on these lines would mean that some local authorities would get an increase in their rate income from non-domestic properties, othersa reduction. These effects could be compensated for in the distribution of grant in much the same way as the domestic element of rate support grant at
present makes good the reduction in income resulting from the lower poundagelevied on domestic ratepayers. Those authorities who lost income by &quot;under&quot;rating would receive extra grant, while those who gained income by &quot;over&quot;rating would receive correspondingly less.Effect of grant system on marginal expenditure4.31 With a grant system which catered for both needs and resources along thelines discussed above, not only would the burden of expenditure be spread moreequitably among ratepayers throughout the country, but the impact of a marginaldeparture from a standard expenditure per head would be much more uniformthan at present.Calculation and payment of grant4.32 Under the rate support grant system, the distribution of grant is calculatedby reference to factors which relate to the grant year. In the case of theresources element, these factors include actual expenditure. Much of the databecomes available only during the course of a grant year, and some may notbe available until as much as a year later. Grant is therefore distributedinitially on the basis of provisional calculations, and the distribution correctedlater as more up-to-date information becomes available. In practice there are normally 2 or 3 successive calculations for the distribution of the needs element,and up to 5 calculations for that of the resources element. These re-calculationsresult in successive redistributions of grant among authorities, and in somecases have led to substantial changes in the amount of grant which an authority has received. This makes for uncertainty for local authorities in the management of their affairs. It may therefore be more satisfactory, particularly with anannual grant settlement, if the distribution of grant is calculated once only,before the beginning of the grant year. For this purpose factors that are alreadyknown at that time might be used, although it would be possible to makeadjustments in advance on the basis of trends in the immediately preceding2 or 3 years: this is a refinement which might be considered.4.33 The present resources element of rate support grant is calculated as a proportion of actual expenditure by qualifying authorities, and paid in this way as grant. But another way of explaining the effect of the resources elementformula is that the Government stand in, as though they were a ratepayer, tomake up the deficiency in rateable value in the area. It would be possible torecognise this more openly in the new arrangements for equalising resources,by determining the deficiency in rateable value for each area, and paying to each authority an amount of grant calculated by applying its own rate poundageto that deficiency. Payment could be made, as for other grants, by instalmentsthrough the year.4.34 The advantages of paying the resources grant in this way would lie inthe simplicity of calculating the grant entitlement, and in the added certainty that individual local authorities would gain about the amount of grant theycould expect to receive during the year. The proportion of total expendituremet from income, by way of rates and resources grant which are determinedby local decision, would be broadly the same for all authorities, who wouldbe put in much the same position as the most fortunate at present.  The
entitlement to this element of the grant would be calculated once only, at thetime when each local authority decided upon its rate poundage, and the amount paid would be directly related to that decision. The total amount of grant would, of course, be estimated at the time when the annual grant was settled,and this estimate would be taken into account in determining the amounts tobe distributed for needs equalisation and as specific grants and thus the totalshare of relevant expenditure to be met by government grants.The recipients of grant4.35 In England and Wales grant for equalising needs and in support ofgeneral expenditure could continue to be paid to county councils, except in metropolitan areas where it would probably be more appropriately paid todistrict councils, as it is with London Boroughs at present. These authorities will be the major spenders. If the proposals in paragraph 4.33 were adopted as the means of equalising resources, both district councils and county councilswould attract grant on their deficiency in rateable value. The grant adjustments to compensate for &quot;over&quot; or &quot;under&quot; rating of non-domestic property described in paragraph 4.30 would probably be made most conveniently through district councils, who will be levying the combined rate both for themselves and for thecounty councils. A portion of the needs grant, perhaps an amount per headof population, might then be paid to district councils to ensure that authoritiesover-rating non-domestic ratepayers receive enough grant to allow the necessarydeductions to be made.4.36 In Scotland some variations in these arrangements may be appropriate,depending on the division of functions between regions and districts. Thiswill require to be considered with the Scottish local authority associations inthe discussions referred to in paragraph 3.3 of Appendix 3 about the responsibilityfor the rating function.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery office by McCorquodale Printers, Ltd.HM 4566 Dd 159898 KOO 7/71 McC.
