0 iCP(71) 100 COPY NO2 August 1971CABINETTHE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITIESMemorandum by the Prime Minister1. The main issues in our negotiations for accession to theEuropean Economic Communities have now been resolved.    parliament will be asked in October to approve our decision in principle to join the communities on the terms which have been negotiated.    We must now proceed on the assumption that this approval will be given and that weshall be going forward with the process of joining the Communities.2. With the main issues in the negotiations resolved, we are nowentering a new phase in our relationship with Europe.    We must activelyturn our minds to the changes in our attitudes and practices which thisphase will require.3. Between now and the date of accession we shall face a two-foldtask.    First, we have to complete the processes leading up to our accession.    This means completing the outstanding negotiations in orderto be in a position to sign a Treaty of Accession by the end of 1971 andsteering through Parliament by the end of the 1971-72 Session thelegislation which will be required in order to enable us to ratify theTreaty by 31 December 1972.    Work on these matters is already in hand;and the issues for decision will come to us at the appropriate times.4. The second part of the task will be no less difficult and even more fundamental.    We have now to adapt ourselves to the prospect of entry into the Communities in terms of both our basic policies and ouradministrative practices.    Hitherto, &quot;the approach to Europe&quot; has meant,in effect, the negotiations with the Communities on the terms of entry.The processes of discussion and decision have been designed accordingly.From now on, however, we cannot afford to compartmentalise Europe inthis way.    In all major problems of policy, whether political, economic or strategic in character, we have to learn to &quot;think European&quot;;  to thinkand decide in terms of our interests as a member of the Communities andin terms of the inter-action of our policies with Community policies anddevelopments.    This is not just a matter of ensuring that between now and the date of accession the Communities do not take policy decisions which are unacceptable or unpalatable to us.    Over the whole range ofour business we shall have to develop a clear and hard-headed concept[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
of the real scope and nature of our interests as a member of the communities and a realistic understanding of the aims and policies of the communities and, indeed, of the individual members.    And we shall haveto be ready to take decisions in the light of what we can do to promote our interests as a member of the Communities and to encourage the develop-ment of the Communities in directions which serve our own interests and requirements, those of the other members and those of Europe as a whole.5.        All this implies an effort of a kind which the British Governmentalmachine has never had to make before, at any rate on this scale, wxcept perhaps in the field of defence.    We cannot expect to achieve this radical change of attitude by creating a new &quot;Department of Europe&quot; or even byrelying upon the normal processes of inter-departmental discussion.    Whatis required is that individual departments should themselves develop the habit of thinking and acting, over the whole range of their business, in themanner appropriate to a member of the Communities.6. We must use the period between now and the date of our accession to make a reality of this change of attitude in order that we may be ready,when the time comes, to join the Communities with  a clear purpose anda realistic strategy which permeate the whole of Whitehall.7.        All this will mean a great deal of work, which will have to becarried out simultaneously with the specific preparations for entry to whichI have already referred.    Ministers should now put in hand the arrange-ments for ensuring that their Departments are staffed and organised todeal with this task.8.        During this period I believe that it will be helpful to have a smalland compact inter-departmental unit to compare experience and toco-ordinate thinking and action.    The existing inter-departmental machineryon Europe has served us well so far; and I believe that, strengthened where appropriate, it will match up with equal efficiency to the greater tasks which lie ahead.9.        I have asked the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to take chargeof the whole programme in addition to the completion of the negotiations withthe Communities.    The inter-departmental team will be responsible to him.As the remaining negotiating isaues are dealt with, the focus of activity willshift increasingly from the diplomatic to the domestic arena.    At thebeginning of September, the Chancellor of the Duchy will therefore moveout of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office into a more central and non-departmental position in Whitehall, although he will remain the Ministerialhead of the negotiating team until the negotiations are complete.    I amasking the Solicitor-General to assist the Chancellor of the Duchy in thepreparation and passage of legislation through Parliament;  and ministers from other Departments will, of course, be invited to co-operate in pre-paring those sections of the legislation which are concerned with matters for which they are responsible.
10.       In this new task the Chancellor of the Duchy will need thegreatest possible support from all Departments in Whitehall; and I ask my colleagues to give him all the help they can in meeting the greatchallenge of transforming the British administrative system into some-thing which will think and behave in a truly European manner.E.H.10 Downing Street, SW12  August 1971SESTET
