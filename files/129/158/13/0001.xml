POPULATION OP THE UNITED KINGDOMREPORT PROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE OHSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ,DRAFT WHITE paper the Government is very grateful to the Select Committee on science and Technology for a most interesting and stimulating report on thePopulation of the United Kingdom,   The Report, and the evidence whichthe Select Committee have published, are a timely and significantaddition to our knowledge of an important and difficult subject about which many people feel seriously   concerned.   Their concern has itsorigins in the possible social, economic, environmental and othereffects of a population which is continuously producing and usinggreater wealth; quite apart from the scientific implications of population growth as such and the question of whether or not it isdesirable to find or sue means of limiting population growth,2.   Before reaching anjr firm conclusions about the likely, or possible,consequences of population growth in the United Kingdom, the Governmentneeds to assess the available evidence with some oare, and, where possible, to fill some of the gaps in our understanding of thepossible trends and their consequences.   The Select Committee clearlybad this need in mind in proposing a new Special Office, directly responsible to the Prime Minister,3.    However, the Government does not at this junoture consider that theaddition of a new piece of permanent official machinery of Governmentwould necessarily be the most appropriate way of tackling the problem.In the first place, a distinction must be drawn between the implications of actual and foreseen population trends for the Governmenfs economic,social and other policies on the one hand, and the desirability of actionconsciously designed to influence the overall rate of population growthon the other.     The study of the first of these questions is a continuingprocess involving many Departments, which is now being co-ordinatedcentrally in the Cabinet Office as part of the improvements in themachinery of Government introduced by this Administration,i
4,     The question of whether or not the Government should have a population policy or policies is complex and controversial.     There isalso room for disagreement about the consequences for everyday conditionsof life of the current and foreseen rates of population increase.     Thesequestions require careful and dispassionate analysis in depth.    What isrequired as a first stage in this analysis is an assessment of theavailable evidence about the significance of population trends in thiscountry at present and in prospect;   what gaps there are in our knowledge;and how we should go about filling them.     The Government will then be in abetter position to consider what further action is necessary,5*     The Government has decided that the best way of achieving this isto appoint a small mixed Panel of experts from outside the government machine as well as from inside.     The members of the Panel will not beexperts in the narrow sense, but will have broad and relevant experience in the subject and the necessary qualities to tackle its anlysis effectivelyand dispassionately.     The official members will be appointed to the Panelon account of their ability to contribute personally to the analysis ofthe subject, and not as representatives of Departments,     This Panel willbe supported by a small staff in the Cabinet Office.6,     The Lord President of the Council will be responsible for answeringin Parliament on matters relating to the co-ordinating work within theGovernment on population questions and on the work of the new Panel,2
