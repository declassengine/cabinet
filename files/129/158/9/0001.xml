$DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S GOVERNMENTaCP(71) 84 COPY NO      ^ I12 July 1971CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE SCOTTISH HEALTH SERVICES:DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. Following discussion at Home and Social Affairs Committee on9 July, I attach for consideration the text of a draft Scottish White paper which I should like to publish before the Summer Recess.2. This will be the first general document on the reform of the health service published in Scotland since the previous Administrations ScottishGreen Paper on December 1968.    It contains my proposals for a single-tierstructure of 14 health boards, with boundaries closely related to those of thenew local government regions and districts.    It also outlines arrangementsfor a Health Service Planning Council and a Common Services Agency,designed to ensure that the new management bodies can participate inadvising on policy and can obtain specialised services without beingsubordinated to either of these two new central bodies.    One aspect of thearrangements unpopular with Civil Service staff interests is the proposal that some of the work of the Scottish Home and Health Department, with thestaff concerned, should be incorporated in the National Health Servicerather than in the Civil Service, but I am sure that this transfer is justified on merits in the new Scottish organisation.3.        The proposals reflect the need for control by the Government and parliament over a largely centrally-financed service.    There is therefore no ambiguity about the status of the health boards, and it is made clear that members of the boards will be appointed as individuals, not as representatives of special interests.    Provision is however made (seeparagraph 3.6) for professional consultative machinery to take account ofthe special position of the health care professions.    As agreed at Home and social Affairs Committee I have adjusted these references to reduce the commitment to seek the views of the professions on matters of concern tothem and to give them access to management to express their views.    Ibelieve that the draft now avoids any embarrassment to my colleagues,though I think that it will probably be desirable to give rather more specific pledges (particularly to the doctors) at a later stage.
4.        Since I hope that the Scottish Bill may be introduced next Session,publication of the White Paper will be an essential preliminary to detailedpreparatory work, in conjunction with the interests, on a number of Issuesrequiring further study (including the working relationship with localgovernment, details of the local management structure and some othermatters of that kind).    In view of the tightness of the timetable, I shouldbe grateful for authority to proceed with publication before the summer recess if possible.G scottish Office SW112 July 19712

CONFIDENTIALSCOTTISH WLITE PAPER ON THE EE ORGANISATION OF THE NH31    introductory,1     This White Paper contains the Government&apos;s proposals for reform of theadministrative structure of the National Health Service in Scotland.     It takes account of the proposals in the previous Government&apos;s Green Paper*, the views expressed either in writing or in subsequent discussions by those concerned in the running of the services, and the proposals for local government reform publishedrecently.1,2    The White Paper represents the Government&apos;s considered views on a new structure and includes their conclusions on certain major matters of principle;but there will of course be opportunities to review the detail of the proposalsafter comments and suggestions have been received and before they are presented to Parliament in the form of legislation.     The Government aim to introduce a Billin the 1971-72 session.     Therefore it may be possible to have the new structure in operation late in 1973 or early in 1974.     There is advantage in introducing the new administration of health services in advance of the reform of localgovernment, which, in terms of the Government&apos;s proposals, will be completed inScotland in 1975.1.3    The Government accept the argument in the 1968 Green Paper in favour of a united administration of the health service, and the structure now proposed followsthe broad lines set out in the Green Paper.     The principle has been accepted bythe representatives of those working in the present service, although varying viewshave been expressed about certain features of the structure proposed.     TheGovernment have developed certain aspects of the proposals in ways which they hopevail meet some of the difficulties, and they believe that the proposals now set outin this White Paper represent a structure for a unified health service in Scotlandthat will be acceptable and will work, taking account of special Scottish needs and circumstances.1*4    As the original Green Paper said, the reform of the health serviceadministrative structure is not an end in itself:   it is a means of enabling the* Administrative Reorganisation of the Scottish Health Services.

doctors, nurses and other health care professions to work together with greaterease and effect ft-r the benefit of their patients and the whole community.   Forthis purpose there must be an effective partnership between those responsible forthe management of the services and the professional people who provide them.   TheGovernment consider that the best means of ensuring such a partnership is toestablish a strong professional consultative structure through which doctors,nurses and other professional groups can directly influence the way in whichservices are provided, and to make it possible for them to contribute to theday-to-day management of the services.   The new structure will encourage newthought on methods of work for bath professionals and laymen.   The report-5 of theJoint Working Party tan the Integration of Medical Work considers modern trends in medical work; and there is a need for a similar review of the work of otherprofessional people working in the National Health Service, as well as of layadministrators.   The Government hope that the time which must inevitably elapsebetween proposals for legislation on National Health Service structure and the start of the new structure will be used not only for the immediate tasks ofworking out the detailed mechanisms of the administrative structure but for thethorough examination of professional aims and attitudes which it will make bathpossible and necessary.* The Joint Working Party on the Integration of Medical Work, a group of doctorsrepresentative of a wide range of clinical and other professional interests, heldits first meeting under the chairmanship of the Chief Medical Officer in January1.970.   The working party&apos;s report &quot;Doctors in an Integrated Health Service&quot;&apos;was published by HM Stationery Office on 28 Julv
2.   THE PRBTCHLZS OP BSPORMCONFIDENTIAL2.1   is a result of the long process of discussion with health service interestssince the publication of the original Green Paper the principles of national health Service reform are widely accepted.2.2   In each area of Scotland the organisation and management of health services will be united under a single health board, instead of being divided between thehospital service, the family practitioner services and the local authorityhealth services.   A wide ranee of matters will become the responsibility ofhealth &quot;boards, so that day-to-day decisions are so far as possible taken in the locality.2.3   The responsibility for the finance of the National Health Service willremain almost entirely with central government, and the Secretary of State&apos;present responsibility to Parliament for the services available in Scotland willremain unchanged, with the health boards acting as his agents in the provision ofthese services and working closely with the local authorities responsible for social work, environmental and other services.2.4   It is proposed that there will be 14 health boards in a single-tieradministrative structure.   The boards will have wide discretion, withinnational policy, to decide the pattern of services best suited to their area.In this task they will rely heavily on the advice of professional committeeswhom they will consult in the running of the services.   The boards will berepresented on a Scottish Health Service Planning Council, advis6iy to theSecretary of State, which will contribute to the development of policy in theprovision of services, and will be able to draw upon the facilities andspecialised experience of a Common Services Agency working for all 14 Scottishboards.2.5   The Chairman and members of each health board will he appointed by theSecretary of State after consultation with professional, local authority,university and other interests.   Members of the health professions and othersreflecting the close links that are necessary with the medical teachingresponsibilities of the universities will always be included in the boards;the majority of the members, however, will beCONFIDENTIAL
Golocted to secure the general public interest in the efficient management ofthe services.   In all cases they will be appointed as individuals for the personal contribution they can make to this end.2.6   Some representatives of the medical profession have urged that the health care professions should have the right to appoint members directly to health boards.   The Government recognise the importance of giving full weight to the views of doctors, nurses and other professional people on both thecurrent problems and the long-term development of the health service, but they believe that this can best be achieved by a strong professional consultativemachinery, on the lines discussed in paragraph 3.6 below, which will ensurethat at all levels of administration the considered opinions of the professions are brought to bear on all matters of concern to them,    (it is perhaps hardly necessary to stress that the reform of administrative structurewill not in any way alter the clinical freedom of the professions in the irrelations with patients nor require any change in the long-standing &quot;independentcontractor&quot; status of general practitioners.)2.7   The Government are anxious to encourage the interest of local people inthe running of the health services.   One possible form of machinery for thispurpose, referred to in general terms in the original. Green Paper, is a local health council bringing together representatives of the local community,without executive responsibilities (and therefore uncommitted to localmanagement policies) but with a continuous and constructive interest in their local services.   The lines on which councils of this kind might work are considered in paragraphs 3.11 - 3.12 below.   Alternatively the functions ofthese councils might be performed by the community councils discussed in theWhite Paper on local government reform.   The Government are studying thesematters carefully, and would welcome any further views from interests concerned.2.8   Discussion with health service interests has revealed a. wide measure ofagreement on the new administrative structure.   Some concern has, however, been expressed by representatives of the hospital service about the proposal for a confidential
CONFIDENTIALsingle-tier structure.     A two-tier structure of Regional Boards and Boards of management has been a feature of the hospital service since 1948.     However inother areas of the National Health Service the local administration and thecentral department have dealt with each other directly;   and these interests have shown no desire for a two-tier structure.2.9     The decision to adopt a single tier structure in Scotland has been taken after careful consideration of all these views.     The original Green Papersuggested that a two-tier structure may lead to uncertainty about the divisionof responsibility.    It is just as important for the public to know whereresponsibility rests as for those who are entrusted with the control of essential and expensive health resources.     There will of course be some services which are best provided on a scale larger than that of a health board area, but for these services consideration on a national ratherthan a regional basis will usually be required.     The absence of a regionaladministrative tier need not, of course, preclude special arrangements betweengroups of health boards for particular purposes.
3   THE PROPOSED NEW STRUCTUREAreas wf Health boards.1   Paragraphs 41 to 45 of the 1968 Green Paper suggested that any health boardought to be able to provide most services in its area for acute medical andsurgical care.   It should therefore be large enough to command adequate resources and employ highly qualified staff.   Local government and health board boundariesshould coincide wherever possible, although the determining factor must always be the operational needs of the health services.3.2   Since the Green Paper was published the Royal Commission on Local Govern-ment has reported^, and the Government&apos;s White Paper on the Reform cf LocalGovernment has proposed a new regional and district structure which can readilyaccommodate a system of 14 health boards for Scotland.   The table below and the map &quot;&quot;.1 page Jotf show the areas proposed for the health boards in relation to thelocal government boundaries proposed in the White Paper.   (The names given tothe beards are provisional designations used purely to facilitate reference.)The health board boundaries, however, will be decided only after full consider-ation of the local circumstances and the views cf those concerned, and need notbe settled in detail at this stage.   The areas of Regional Hospital Boards weredefined at the start of the National Health Service, not by the National health service Act itself but by statutory orders which are made and can be variedunder enabling powers contained in the Act.   It is proposed to include correspond-ing powers in the new legislation, so that the boundaries of health boards would be laid down in an order subject to Parliamentary procedure, made by theSecretary of State after consultations and after final decisions on localgovernment.* Report -jf the Royal Commission **n Local Government in Scotland I966-I969under the Chairmanship of the Rt Hon Lord Wheatley Cmnd 4150, Sept I969.

Shetland	-	17,0003.3 Six of these areas are identical with proposed local government regions, while a further six are formed by the subdivision of the two largest local governmentregions along district boundaries.   Orkney and Shetland, which in many respects fall short of satisfying the ordinary criteria for health board status, are neverthelessrecognised to be special cases for geographical reasons.   Since they will be dependant on other areas for many specialised services, the definition of their functions may differ from that of other health boards.Membership of Health boards.4 As indicated in paragraph 2.5, it is proposed that the members of health boardswill be appointed by the Secretary of State after consultation with interests concerned.   It is not intended to fix a uniform number of members for all boards,
CONFIDENTIALsince the areas for which they will he responsible differ widely in size and nature.   In almost all cases it should be possible to keep the boards small, witha membership of the order of 15.   Although members will be appointed for thrdrpersonal qualities and not in a representative capacity, it is clearly desirablethat they should be drawn from a wide range of experience, including the health professions and local government.It is expected that one member of each board - more than one in areas with medical schools - will be appointed after consultation with theuniversity concerned.   There would be a duty on the Secretary of State in appointingmembers to the Boards to consult the statutory professional committees in the area,and it might be&apos;.expected that members of the committees wuuld themselves be strong candidates for appointment to the Boards.5.5  Fawer will be taken to pay a part-time salary to the chairman of healthboards, whose responsibilities will be heavy.   The possibility of improving thesystem of allowances for members of boards will receive further study.   Thedecision reached on the payment of members of local authorities will be of con-siderable relevance.Professional Consultative Machinery3.6 A consequence of this pattern of membership is that health boards wouldnot be entitled to regard any of their members as giving the collective view of,for example, the nursing or medical profession.   They would look for the profes-sional view on both current and long-term problems to the s trong prsf essionalcommittees which it is hoped that the professions themselves will establish at every level of administration.Lines on which this professional structure might developwithin the medical profession are discussed in the report of the Joint working party on the Integration of Medical Work referred to in paragraph 1.4 above, andthere is a clear need for corresponding arrangements in the other professionsconcerned in the health service.   These professional committees would not bemerely advisory committees looking at the management sf the service from outside:
they  would be given statutory recognition, and arrangements will be worked out toenable their expertise to be available to the boards in their deliberations on mattersshioh affect patient care.     A parallel may be seen in the existing local medical,dental and pharmaceutical committees which are elected by the professions themselves,recognised by the Secretary of State for the purposes of the Part IV services underthe 1947 Act and given a right to be consulted by the Executive Council in circumstances specified in regulations made under that Act.famgement by Health Boards3J Boards would no doubt carry on much of their business through committees.They would have power to co-opt additional members to these committees, includingahererer appropriate members of the statutory professional committees.     For certainpurposes - eg some of the provisions of the contracts with family doctors andother practitioners which are at present administered by Executive Councils - the professional committees would have the right to appoint members directly.3*8 The boards will need administrative and professional staff of high quality,nho can be given responsibility within their various fields for the day-to-dayrunning of the services on lines laid down by the Board.     The individualresponsibilities of these officers and the relationships between them will need careful definition.     Further consideration is being given to these matters,which will require to be fully discussed with the health service interests concerned.3.9 The arrangements for the management of particular units or districts withinthe board&apos;s area - comparable to the present hospital management structure atgroup or hospital level - will vary according to the circumstances of the area.They will be centred on a group of administrative and professionalofficers of the board working under the general direction of the
CONFIDENTIALappropriate senior officers at board headquarters and responsible for co-ordinating the services in the district.     The extent to which, and the way in which, individual members of the health board might be associated with this group will require careful consideration.     It will in any event be essential for the districtmanagement group to have arrangements for close association with local (district)professional committees within the professional consultative structure discussed in paragraph 3.6 and, where the district includes a teaching hospital, withrepresentatives of teaching interests.     It is proposed to give further consideration in consultation with health service interests, to the management pattern so thatguidance may be given to health boards in working out a structure appropriate tothe circumstances of their area.3.10  The precise management arrangements to be adopted by health boards are not amatter for statutory provision.     It is proposed, however, that each board shouldbe required to submit for the Secretary of State&apos;s approval a management schemecovering such matters as the board&apos;s committee structure, relations with the professional consultative committees, the management units or districts into whichthe area is to be divided, the general management pattern in the districts, and thearrangements in the districts for association with the professional consultativestructure, medical and other teaching interests and the local health councilsdescribed in the following paragraphs.Local Health Councils3.11   As noted in paragraph 2.7 above, the Government- are anxious to encourage localinterest in the health services, and are considering the possibility of setting uplocal health councils for this purpose.     The following paragraphs discuss how suchoouncils might operate.3.12 Each health board would have a duty to establish a local health council either for separate districts within its area or for the whole of the area.     Membershipcould vary according to local circumstances but would include representativesappointed by the local authority or local authorities concerned.     Members orofficers of the board might attend meetings of the committee as assessors.
3.13 The pounnils rni eht bft serviced oitbcar by tho hoard or under private arrange-ments, but in either event their expenses ?;ould be met by the board.   The functionsof the councils might include the following: -(a) The right to be consulted on any proposals by the health board foralteration or development of services in, or directly affecting, thedistrict;(b) the right to consider and report to the health board on the adequacy of the health services provised in the district, with recommendations for any changes designed to improve them;(c) the right to obtain from the board general information about manpower,costs, waiting lists etc in the district and in the area of the board;and(d) the right to visit establishments of the health board within the district to study the standard of facilities and the welfare of patients.3.12). But although local health councils would be concerned with the adequacy oflocal services from the point of view of the &quot;consumer&quot;, their success would be measured by their ability to develop a constructive approach to the problems facing the health boards rather than confine themselves to purely negative criticism.   Theymight for example promote voluntary activities in the same was as &quot;Friends of theHospital&quot; have traditionally done in many areas.Health Commissioner3.15 The Green Paper referred to the possibility of establishing a HealthCommissioner to handle complaints about the health service.   The Government have notyet reached a final conclusion on this but hope to make an early announcement.   Theywill of course have regard to the special position of the Mental Welfare Commission.
4   CENTRAL ORGANISATION4.1   The 14 Scottish health  SSPJSH^Ti^1,statutorily responsible to the Secretary of State - as are the present regional hospital boards and executive councils - for the provision of health services intheir areas.   It is intended that health boards should have wide scope to develop their services in accordance with local circumstances and needs.   It is also important that the boards, as the operational units of the National health service, should be able to play a full part in deciding policy, and that for thispurpose there should be a close and cantinuous relationship between them and thecentral Department.4.2   It is proposed therefore to establish a Scottish Health Service planning council, which would bring together representatives of the boards and theDepartment in the discussion of policy, and a Common Services Agency, which wouldprovide a wide range of services for the Planning Council, the health boards andthe Department.Scottish Health Service Planning Council4.3   This Council would be given statutory status as an advisory body to theSecretary of State.   It would consist of a representative of each health board anda number of departmental officers and representatives of University teachinginterests. &apos; There might in addition be one or two members able to contributerelevant specialised knowledge.   The chairman would be the Secretary of State or aperson appointed by him.   The Council&apos;s functions would include cpnsideration o..developments in the general pattern of services and policy issues related to the health service building programme, including for example the siting of highly specialised units serving wide areas of Scotland.   It would be empowered to set upcommittees to consider particular aspects of health service provision anddevelopment,   In addition it would be a focal point to which the views of the health care professions on such matters could be directed.   It is hoped that atnational level, as at health board level, there would be professional committees of the kind referred to in paragraph 3.6.   The chairmen of such committees wouldbe entitled to attend meetings of the Council.CONFIDENTIAL
. .Tho object of tlic CouTwil^^OilWS^EwTy^toS the health boards directlyinto the consideration of national health service policy.     Although the finalresponsibility for decision would remain, as at present, with the Secretary ofState it is to be expected that the recommendations of the Council would carrygreat weight.     As an advisory body to the Secretary of State it wouldsupersede the present Scottish Health Services Council.Common Services Agency4,5    The essential function of the Common Services Agency would be to providehealth boards and the Department with a variety of executive and advisoryservices which are necessary throughout Scotland and can be provided mostefficiently by a single agency.     It would also provide secretarial and other services for the Planning Council.     The Agency - which like other health service bodies would be ultimately responsible to the Secretary of State -would perform certain functions (eg execution of major building projects)at present performed for the hospital service by Regional Hospital Boards, andwould develop the pattern of the numerous ad hoc agencies which have grown upover the years in the existing service to perform functions on behalf of individual health service authorities;   but it would bring functions of thiskind into association with one another as parts of a single Agency and would add to them certain functions which are at present performed within the central department.     The result would be to produce a new type of National health service body of central importance to the efficient day-to-day running and long-term planning of the service, which would offer interesting work andcareer prospects to National Health Service staff in Scotland.4.6    The Agency would thus bring together a range of activities dischargedunder the existing administrative structure by a variety of central bodies:for example the Dental Estimates Board, the Drug Accounts Committee, theCentral Legal Office for the Hospital Service and at least some functions ofthe ambulance and blood transfusion services.     In addition it would have a building division concerned with the physical planning and execution of majorbuilding projects, having responsibility at all stages after the specificationof requirements by the health board concerned up to the handing over of thenn , A CONFIDENTIALcompleted building for commissioning.
Specialised work study activities and. a number of other complex management services might usefully be centralised to some extent within the Agenpy.The Hospital Centre, no doubt renamed to take account of its wider functions,would also find its place in the new structure.4,7    An important new feature of this proposal is the transfer to the Agencyor a substantial amount of work which has hitherto been undertaken by theScottish Home and Health Department.     For example, most of the work of theDepartment*s Research and Intelligence Unit, the Scottish Health Education Unit,and a large part of the Departments supplies function could be carried out bythe Agency.     Some of the Departments functions relating to broad policy onplanning and development of health services could also become the responsibilityof the Agency.     It might be expected that most of the professional staff ofthe Department would become officers of the Agency.     It is intended that the agency, the Department and the individual health boards should be regarded aspartners in the provision of health services so that necessary information canbe widely exchanged.4.8    Another important function of the Agency might fall to a division dealingwith certain aspects of health service staffing and training.     Eor example,central arrangements already exist for the training of administrators and forthe non-professional training of nurses, and these functions might all be taken over by the Agency.     It would assume central responsibility for the trainingof administrative staff and the management training of all staff,&quot;   a divisionof the Agency might itself deal with advanced training and give help to boardswith in-service training.     In addition its functions might include careeradvice and recruitment of various grades of administrative staff and advice on appointments to senior posts.4*9    In order to achieve flexibility it is proposed that the precise range of functions undertaken by the Agency should not be laid down in the Act but should be settled by the Secretary of State from time to time in consultationwith the
eOWFlDEWTBALinterests most closely oonoerned.   Flexibility ic also necessary in the internalorganisation of the Agency, which would bring services together in a confederationrather than continue the present tendency for specialised agencies to develop in isolation.ij.,10  The Agency would have a small management committee representing health boards and the Department.   The function of the management committee would be to keep underreview the whole range of services provided by the Agency, so that the health service as a virhole will be involved in the necessary scrutiny of the scale on whichcentralised services are provided and the extent to which the needs of health boards and the Department are met.   In addition a number of the functional divisions ofthe Agency will no doubt require specialised supervisory bodies to ensure the closest possible links with experience at health board level; for example the DentalEstimates Board.   The most suitable arrangements for associating the professionalcommittees with the administration of the Agency require further consideration.Functions of the Central Department k-,11  The Department would remain responsible for the direction of policy and determination of priorities, having regard to advice from the Planning Council, andfor general financial control (including standards of cost), the allocation offinancial resources, and the evaluation and surveillance of the efficiency of management.   The Scottish Hospital Advisory Service, no doubt renamed to underlinethat its functions would be extended outside the hospital field, would be retainedto provide the Secretary of State, the Planning Council and individual boards withregular reports on the most vulnerable sectors of the National Health Service.k*l2  The proposals outlined in the preceding paragraphs, however, would mean that important work at present carried out by the Department would be transferred to theCommon Services Agency.   The terms of transfer of the administrative and professionalstaff concerned will require detailed discussion with the staff associations.   Therewould be considerable advantage in close physical proximity between the headquarters of the Agency and the Department and in regular secondment of staff between theDepartment and the Agency (and other health service bodies).
^,13   iThere would be a close and direct relationship between the Secretary of Stateand the health boards, since neither the Planning Council nor the Common ServicesAgency would stand between the Department and the boards.    There would of course be regular contacts between the boards and the Agency in connection with theservices provided to boards by the latter, but guidance and directions on policy, financial allecations and formal approvals would still come from theDepartment on the Secretary of State&apos;s behalf.4.14   The reform of the administrative structure would not introduce any barrier tonegotiatiens between the Department and the professions on matters of concern tothem.4.1p   It must be emphasised that tbe significance of the changes proposed at thecentre of the Nation-al Health Service is not to be found in any catalogue of functions which will be delegated ta health service agencies or retained in theDepartment.   It lies rather in the conscious attempt to involve representativesff health service administrative bodies and of the health professions inconsideration of policy at the formative stages.
confidential  RELATION SHIPS TTETH LOCAL GOVERNMENT5,1   Close relationships at working level v;ith local authorities are -of obviousimportance in relation to such local authority responsibilities as social work and environmental health services which are complementary to the services provided bythe health board.   The effectiveness of each authority&apos;s services will frequentlydepend on facilities provided by the other, so that close and regular contacts between those working in the field will be essential.   The local authority will need medical and ether advice which the health board can provide, while the board will rely on advice from the local authority on the social implications of the health services.   The machinery for fostering close working relationships neednot be specified in legislation in precise terms, but the health board and thelocal authorities would be expected to consult each other regularly about the running and future development of their services.5.2   The school health service will, as regards medical and dental examination and treatment, become the responsibility of the health board, but education authorities will have a strong and continuing interest in the services provided.   The childguidance service and the provision of speech therapy in schools will remain theresponsibility of the education authority, which will be able to call on theclinical services of the National Health Service in the same way as at present.5.3  As paragraphs 36-38 of the 1968 Green Paper pointed out, there are many other services of local authorities which have drawn upon the skills of the medical officer of Health as an adviser.   Although the local authority personal health services - and the doctors and dentists, nurses, midwives and health visitors whoprovide them - will be transferred to health boards, local authorities will stillbe responsible for environmental services, including the control of food hygiene,which have important health implications.   They will thus still have a concernwith the public health of their areas, and health boards will have a duty toprovide medical advice for this purpose.   The necessary arrangements will be worked out in discussion with representatives of local authorities.   They might inv^lve^for example, designating one particular medical officer on the board&apos;s staff who
-foulcl become the local authority&apos;s normal source of medical advice and would ineffect discharge some of the functions of the present Medical Officer of health in relation to the authority&apos;s environmental health responsibilities.   This&apos; &quot;designated&quot; medical officer would establish a close working relationship withthe local authority&apos;s sanitary inspectors and other officers responsible forthese services.5,4 As a corollary it will be a general, principle that where primary responsibilityfor a service r9sts on the local authority the health board will not seek to buildup a separate specialised service on its own.   For example social &quot;work in hospitals and other parts of the health service should be integrated with the community services, with the prospect of considerable potential benefit in ensuringcontinuity of support for patients.   The normal home help services will remain with local authorities, though care at home of a kind going beyond what can be expected of the local authority services will be the responsibility of the board.5.5 Arrangements are being made to discuss with the local authority associationsthe pattern of relationships between health boards and local authorities in thenew structure and the statutory provisions which will be required,
(TOM Fib ENTIAII    OTHER ADMINISTEATIVE MATTERS   v-wr&quot;Staff6,1  For doctors, nurses and other professional people engaged in the care of patients the reformed administrative structure will mean no change in theirclinical responsibilities or their relationships with patients:   the only immediatedifference will be that they will be employed by, or in contract with, the health board instead of a hospital board, executive council or local authority.     Thiswill also be true of most other staff working in the health service:   the onlyimmediate change when the new structure comes into operation will be the name of theiremploying body, and they will continue to be employed as before on specific duties ata particular hospital, health centre and so on.     For some people, however,particularly in administrative posts, both professional and lay, there will bealterations in their duties, grading or place of employment;   and for all of themthere will be new career opportunities both in the health boards and in the common services Agency.6.2 To safeguard staff interests in the transitional period the Secretary of state will establish an independent Staff Commission, which would begin its work well before the new structure came into operation.     The arrangements for the StaffCommission will be fully discussed with the staff interests concerned.Remuneration and Conditions of service.3 The present arrangements for deciding remuneration and conditions of service for those engaged in the National Health Service in Great Britain will continue.The present whitley Councils which negotiate agreements on pay and conditions ofservice will have to be adapted to reflect the changed structure of the management of the health service, but the principles for the determination of these matters are not in question,finance6.4 The services provided by health boards will be centrally financed, as is thecase at present with the hospital and family practitioner services.    Adcustaenv in thoaaount of Bxohequcr support to Iscal authorities will be necessary to take account ofthe fact that they will no longer incur expenditure on the services transferred to health boards.
confidential,5  In settling the allocation of funds among hoards the Department will take account of the amounts necessary to maintain or develop current services, tointroduce new services and to meet the revenue consequences of capital projects.In these matters the views of the Scottish Health Service Planning Council will heof considerable value.   &quot;There as a matter of accounting convenience payments aremade direct to the Common Services Agency in respect of services provided by the agency to particular boards this will be taken account of in the allocations to theioards.   Funds will necessarily be earmarked for some specific purposes, including in particular the costs of the family practitioner services provided under contractvdth the health boards, but the aim will be to leave boards with as much freedom aspossible to decide the distribution of their revenue allocations among their services 6Endowments6,6  The Government welcomes and attaches importance-&apos;to the continued support of the health service by the public through gifts and bequests,   Such gifts and bequestsin the past have been mainly for hospital purposes, but the integrated service i?illprovide other opportunities for benefactions, for instance, by gifts to health centres.   The endowments which were given to hospitals before November 1946 areshortly to be transferred to the Scottish Hospitals Trust under the HospitalEndowments (Scotland) Act 197&quot;! 5   this Act provides that the basis for distributingincome to hospital authorities and the purposes for which it may be used shall belaid down in a scheme on which hospital authorities must he consulted.   Such ascheme is at present in preparation.   When the new structure comes into operation the income payable under present arrangements to Board of Management will be paidto health boards, and they will be required to allocate the bulk of it to hospitality-hospitals in their areas in such a way that the basic effect of the scheme is preserved.The post-1946 endowments at present vested in hospital Boards of Management willbe vested in health boards who will be required to use them so far as possiblefor the objects specified by the donors and subject to any conditions which theymay have specified.   Health boards will be empowered to receive gifts and to use them for any of their National Health Service functions, as may be specified bythe donor, and subject always to any conditions so specified.CONFIDENTIAL
7,  conclusion,1     No single document on the future of the National Health Sex-vice can hope to do more than given an outline of the broad pattern to be adopted.   the promotion of health and the treatment of illness and injury are among the major concerns of all societies, and in advanced countries a complex technologyis joined with a wealth of human and material resources for these purposes.The proper aims of the administrative structure of the National Health service are to make the most efficient use of resources, allow advances in knowledgeto be applied without unnecessary constraints, and give effect so far aspossible to the rational priorities of the community as a whole.   The Govem-ment believe that the proposals in this white Paper can make a positive contri-bution to a modem National Health Service in Scotland.
