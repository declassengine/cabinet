CIO N Fl DENTIAL$DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 92 COPY NO g27 July 1971CABINETo iEMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS IN GREAT BRITAINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment, At its meeting on 13 May (CM(7l) 25th Conclusions, Minute 4), theCabinet discussed proposals set out in CP(7l) 58 to restrict further theemployment of foreign workers in Britain.    In summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that the Cabinet were generally in favour of these further restrictions but would wish to consider the question of any announcement of a change of policy when the state of the european economic Communities (e.c.) negotiations was clearer.    It was also agreed that there should be a study of how to reverse the tendency ofthe hotel and caterin3 industry to rely increasingly on foreign labour.2. The position on e.c. is now clear.    Officials of the Departmentsconcerned have carried out a careful study of the employment of foreign workers in the hotel and catering industry, and a summary of their conclusions is attached.3. I now make the following proposals for changes in the arrangementsfor the employment of foreign workers.WORKERS FROM e.c. COUNTRIES4. It would seem most inappropriate for us to introduce for 1972 newrestrictions on the employment here of nationals of e.c. member-countries.Any tightening up of our arrangements for ensuring that the employers have sought to obtain a British worker before the permit is issued would, ofcourse, apply generally.    But any specific changes in the rules about theissue of permits would now have to discriminate between nationals of eec countries and other foreign workers,    I doubt if this would lead to any major increase in the number of workers coming in from e.c. countries;the total number has in fact been falling in recent years.INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE GENERALLY5. I would propose that we cease completely to issue permits forunskilled and semi-skilled men from foreign countries other than e.c.,to work in industry and commerce (apart from hotels and catering).    Thenumber of workers in this category in 1970 is estimated at about 2,000,
HOTELS AND CATERING6. The main conclusions of the study by officials of the employment offoreign workers in the hotel and catering industry are at Annex A.Agreement was reached that there should be some further restrictionson the issue of permits for semi-skilled workers and seasonally employedunskilled workers.    The general view is that this would best be achieved bya quota system applying to both groups of workers, particularly since thedividing line between them is anything but precise.    I am sure that we mustsignificantly reduce the number of unskilled and semi-skilled foreign workers employed here in this industry because while it is relativelyeasy to get them (at lower rates of pay) it is unlikely that employerswill make strenuous efforts to recruit and train British workers.    Andthe fact that the quota restrictions will not apply to the e.c. countries should be a safeguard to the industry.    My own view is that we mightbe prepared to issue say 3,500 permits for the employment of foreign workers from non-e.c. countries,.    This would compare with about 7, 500who came in from these countries in 1970.    Allowing for the same numberof workers from e.c. countries (2, 500) there would be a reduction from10, 000 to about 6,000.    The details of the operation of the quota schemeought to be discussed with the industry?  the size of the quota should not.7. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry while not contestingthe principle that a quota should be applied considers that the size of the quota which I have proposed would prevent the hotel industry obtaining asatisfactory supply of labour.    As a result of the exceptionally largeresponse to the Government incentives, some 660 new hotels are being built and some 1,500 existing hotels are being extended^ at a cost to public funds of over  60 million.    The Secretary of State for Trade and Industrydoubts whether the measures proposed will provide sufficient additional labour to staff the new accommodation and to meet the present shortageof staff in existing hotels.    As the intake of e.c. nationals is not expectedto increase significantly, the quota for other nationals would need to be notless than, and possibly higher than, the recent intake if a serious labour shortage is not to result.    The Secretary of State for Trade and Industryconsiders that for balance of payments reasons alone it is important toavoid action which would damage the development of the tourist industry.TIMING OF ANNOUNCEMENT8.        An announcement about restrictions which openly discriminate between workers from e.c. countries and from other foreign countries might be rather awkward before the vote on e.c. has been taken inParliament.    I think we could leave an announcement of the new restrictionsuntil the end of October.    It could not be left any later since it would benecessary to work out urgently with the industry the details of a permitquota scheme for employment in hotels and catering in 1972.
RE C recommend TIONS9.        I recommend that we should in October announce:i. That no further permits for unskilled and semi-skilled menfrom non-e.c. countries would be issued for work in industry and commerce,ii. A quota for unskilled male seasonal workers and semi-skilled male workers in hotels and catering should be introduced for 1972 of 34 500 from non-e.c. countries.iii. We should from now on apply more stringently our arrangements for ensuring that no British workers are locallyavailable to fill the vacancies.R department of Employment SW126 July 1971
(CONFIDENTIAL)THE EMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS IN THE HOTEL AND CATERING industry the Cabinet agreed at its meeting on 13 May 1971  (CM(7l)25th Meeting,  item k)  that a  study of the hotel and cateringindustry should be made to indicate means of reversing thetendency of the industry to rely on alien labour.    A full and detailed report of the study was written and this paper summarises the main points which emerged.lo The industry is a very fragmented one with 600,000 employeesrather more than half of whom were employed in some 3^1000 hotels(1968)  and the remainder in restaurants.2.      The total employed has remained more or less  constant overthe last ten years during which time the number of aliens allowedto take up work in the industry has more than trebled,  from about,000 in i960 to over 21,000 in.1970.    Not all permits are utilisedbut the number of foreigners actually taking work in 1970 was probably about  18,000,  representing about 3% of the total number employed in the industry.3.       There are various restrictions on the admission of aliens,:notably the  &quot;local labour rule&quot;    which seeks to ensure that permitsare only issued if no indigenuous labour is  available.4.      The high demand for labour in this industry is reflected inthe large number of vacancies notified to employment exchanges;l8,0O0 unfilled vacancies in June 1970 when unemployment in theindustry was at its lowest,  but when there were 191000 unemployedpeople whose last  employment was in that industry.    The fact thatthe industry relies to some  extent on foreign labour even in times of relatively high unemployment reflects an element of &quot;mismatch&quot;between unemployment and vacancies,  not only between male and female workers but also between occupations, regions and seasons.Of the 18,000 notified vacancies only 4,500 were for males whereasof the 19,000 unemployed over  13,000 were males.    The bulk of vacancies for hotel and catering workers are in London and theSouth East where although the numbers of unemployed are high,the rate of unemployment is substantially below the national average.    A high proportion of vacancies are for skilled and semi-skilled workers but those registered as unemployed in theindustry tend to be unskilled.5o      Many people are reluctant to work in this industry.    Much ofthe work is intrinsically unattractive,  many of the jobs are of a seasonal nature,   offer little  security and are regarded as being of relatively low status.    Hours of work are long,  are oftenconcentrated at the times when other people are free to enjoytheir leisure,   and pay is relatively low.6.      This still leaves the  question of why the number of aliensemployed in the industry has increased where the total numbers employed have remained constant.    To  some extent the statisticsconceal changes taking place within the industry.    Since 19671
(confidential^)there has been a marked increase in the numbers employed in luxuryhotels,  particularly skilled and semi-skilled aliens,   and this isprobably the result of the expansion of this sector since  1967.However table 1 attached shows that the greatest increase wasamong unskilled workers and this is difficult to explain exceptin terms of the willingness of young foreigners to put up withpoor pay and conditions in order to improve their English andthe fact that not all aliens admitted as unskilled seasonal workers are in fact unskilled,,    By contrast a relatively nighproportion of the unemployed who are registered as unskilledhotel and catering workers are virtually unemployable.7o      Some aliens are brought here for their special skills andtalents,  but the general  explanation for the industry1s increasingreliance on foreign workers is its inability to attract sufficientBritish workers of the right calibre with the appropriate  skills.At the semi-skilled level the  shortage of British workersprobably reflects the reluctance,  particularly among young people,to seek work in the industry.80      The  full report was  considered at a meeting where the interested departments were represented.    The meeting consideredthe various ways open to the industry and the Government not onlyto remedy the present situation,  but to cope also with the forecast increased demand for labour as new botels are opened.It is recognised that accommodation difficulties in London andthe relatively poor pay and conditions in the industry would give no  scope  for encouraging the unemployed to move to London forseasonal work.    The study group also concluded that there wasrelatively little scope  for- applying greater pressure on theunemployed to take work in the industry even where this did notentail a move.    At present the Benefit Authorities normallydisqualify a person from receiving unemployment benefit if herefuses a job which the  Employment Services consider suitable.In areas of high employment the Supplementary Benefits Commissionrefuses  supplementary allowances to fit  single men under k5 afterk weeks  and to others after 3 months on the basis that there areavailable jobs in hotel  and catering among others.2
(confidential)9.    In the longer tere if more British workers are to be attractedinto the industry both pay and conditions will have to be isnprovedand it was recognised that increased costs resulting from suchimprovement if passed on in the form of higher prices  couldseriously damage the  competitiveness of the industry,,    This mighthave repercussions on the Tourist Industry generally which is oneof britain&apos;s largest  foreign currency earners.    A rise in hotelprices could therefore lead to a loss in foreign exchange earnings.10.  There was general agreement that a more immediate need was toproject a new image for the industry in order to attract Britishworkers;     that this should not be concentrated towards managementbut should show that  the industry offered a worthwhile career atlower levels.     In view of its highly fragmented nature and the factthat there is no association truly representative of the industry it was felt that the necessary action was unlikely to be taken bythe industry itself.    There was support for the view that as partof the Government1s training programme there should be a shortcourse  (one week)  introducing the industry to potential recruitsand that this should attract a Government Grant.11.    While the industry can continue to import labour from spain and other countries where wages are lower than in the UK the industry will  be reluctant to improve its terms and conditions.     It was recognised, nevertheless,  that if all permits for male semi-skilledaliens were to be excluded,  as originally proposed,  this would    inthe short term at least  cause serious difficulties in some sectors ofthe industry,  notably the luxury hotels and some restaurants inLondon.     In addition the liklihood of our joining the e.c. suggeststhat there may be serious objections to imposing further restrictionson e.c. nationals.12.     It  is therefore  suggested that a quota be introduced for bothsemi-skilled and unskilled foreign men coming to work in the industry,but that if Britain joins the e.c. this  quota should not be appliedto e.c. nationals.      Discussions should be held with the industry todetermine the application of the quota system.    Any announcement about these restrictions should not be made until  after parliament has  taken a decision on the Common Market.3
