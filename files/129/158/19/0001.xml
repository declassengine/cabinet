DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 94 COPY NO 6127 July 1971CABINETTHE DISPERSAL review memorandum by the Lord Privy seal. Cabinet noted on 17 November 1970 (CiVl(70) 38th Conclusions,Minute 4) that the dispersal review would begin with two groups of departments (l - Home Office, Department of Health and Social security and Department of Education and Science; 2 - Ministry of Defence and the then Ministry of Aviation Supply) and invited me to make an interim progresreport about now.2.        I attach at Annex B a report which I have received fromSir Henry Hardman, the Co-coordinator of the review.    I endorse the proposals in paragraph 18 of the report:a. Review of Ministry of defence the slippage on the Ministry of Defence is not serious.Given the complexity of the task and the vigour with whichthe Ministry has applied itself to the review, it would be a mistake to short-circuit the process and I arn sure we should agree to the extension to May 1972 for which Sir Henry Hardmanasks.b. Results of the Group 1 review the review is comprehensive, in that it is to look at the communication pattern in and between all Headquarterswork in London.    It would be a mistake to take decisions on the Gx*oup 1 Departments (which would rightly resent sucha reward for their co-operation in the initial stages) on the basisof only partial information, since this would rob the review of itsobjectivity and thoroughness.    Any decision made on Group 1 alone would, to make the best planning and administrative sense, have tobe provisional on the results of the whole review and this would reduce the impact of any public announcement.1
c.      The Remaining Phases of the ReviewThere is great advantage in completing the review during 1972, as sir Henry Hardrnan suggests: it v/ill provide, at a reasonably earlydate, a basis on which to make decisions affecting the location of the90,000 Headquarters posts in London, a much larger total than hasbeen examined in such detail before.    if we are to do the preparatory work in time for the phased start proposed - and this includes the designation of Departmental teams and their training - I now needmy colleagues&apos; agreement that phase 3 should cover all remainingDepartments,    (Departments would need to find the necessary staff from within their existing resources; I attach at Annex A a noteshowing the composition of the existing Departmental teams as a guide to what is involved).CONCLUSION3, I invite Cabinet to note that I propose to a^ree toSir Henry Hardman&apos;c; recommendations:a. That the Ministry of Defence timetable should be extendedto May 1972.b. That decisions on Group 1 should be deferred until the resultsof reviews of Departments associated with it are available.c. That the review should extend to all relevant remainingDepartments, beginning no later than 1 February 1972, and thatit should be conducted by Departments themselves with assistancefrom the central team under Sir Henry Hardman,4. I hope my colleagues would agree that a discussion of this is notneeded? and unless I hear to the contrary by Friday 30 July I will assumeI have the Cabinet&apos;s authority to make an early statement of our plans forthe remainder of the review.J civil  Service Department SW126 July 19712

THE LOCATION OF GOVERNMENT:  INTERIM REPORT BY SIR HENRY HARDMANIntroduction1.      Cabinet agreed last November that there should be a review inorder to assess what headquarters work needs to be in London,  andto consider whether other work might be relocated.    The review wasto take account of two main criteria,  efficiency and economy on theone hand and regional policy on the other.    It was to begin in three departments  (Group 1:  Home Office, DHSS and DES) and move on to MODand MAS.Purpose of report.      This report describes progress in Group 1 and the merged MODand MAS and makes proposals with regard toa.    the revision of the timetable for the review of MODbo    dealing with the results of the Group 1 reviewc.    the scope and conduct of reviews of other Departments.3.      Progress with related studies is described in Appendix I.Progress in Group 1 and MOD4.      The central part of the review consists of three related strandsof study:a. the study of patterns of communication within and between departments and with the outside worldb. the study of possible receiving locationsc. the study of savings,  costs and benefits.5.      The study of communication patterns in Group 1 should be complete in late August 1971,  except for the Health side of DHSS.    It is unlikely that the MOD part can be completed before January 1972 owing1.
to the much greater number of posts involved,  the greater complexity of MOD 1s communication needs and the organizational changes following the establishment of the Defence Procurement Executive.6.      The study of communications on the Health side of DHSS has been deferred until the current work there by McKinsey&apos;s has defined broadoutlines for a possible reorganization.    I have assumed that some   &apos;measure of reorganization will follow.    The lack of operatingexperience in the reorganized Department will prevent my team from using their standard method there.    A somewhat less detailed,  andconsequently less comprehensive,  method will be used instead.    Iexpect the review to start in September 1971 and to conclude inDecember 1971.7.      The collection of data about locations will be suffiently advanced by September 1971 to permit the first operational analysis of communications,  locations,  savings,   costs and benefits for theGroup 1 Departments.     (The list of places recently agreed upon by ministers for study does not exclude the possibility that furtherplaces may be studied if and when the need arises) .The review of MOD8.      It is clear that the study of MOD cannot be completed on theoriginal timetable,   for the reasons set out in Appendix II and referred to above (paragraph 5).    I seek agreement to an extensionso that a report would be made in May 1972.The results of the Group 1 review9.      Although I expect the Group 1  review to be finished on time,  Ido not think it wise to make recommendations on the results,  if theseindicate any measure of dispersal,  because a.    We have all along taken the line that the fact that theGroup 1 Departments are the first to be reviewed does not imply any assumption that decisions will be taken on them in isolationand that it would be a mistake to do so without also consideringthe location of other Departments.2.
b. Early decisions might be at odds with the findings of subsequent reviews of Departments with which the Group 1Departments have working relationships and,  by transferringwork to certain places, might restrict the Governments freedom to make better use of those places later in the review.c. In discussion with the Departments themselves, with theNational Staff Side and with the Departmental Staff Sides,  the implication has been that decisions would not be sought prematured. An early decision to disperse parts of Group 1,  which couldbe regarded as expressive of a desire to achieve dispersalwilly-nilly,  would impair the willingness of Departments and staff to cooperate with the review.10o    I should,  however, wish to report to you on the results of theGroup 1 review,   since I expect it to provide us with a number oflessons - perhaps of a general application - on the treatment of the data.     (it will be recalled that the Group 1 exercise represents thefirst operational use of the method of review.    It was never expectedthat Group 1, which consists of comparatively small Departments,would have much capacity for further dispersal).    These lessonsconcern the suitability of the data collected and of the conclusionsderived from them and from the process of analysis and recommendation(in which the Group 1 Departments are themselves concerned).11.    I conclude from this that the study of Group 1 should be carried through,  in collaboration with these Departments,  to a report,  butthat Ministerial decisions should not be sought until recommendations are presented on MOD also or on a wider range of Departmentsassociated with the Group 1 Departments.Scope and conduct of further reviews12.    The other major Departments account for 60,000 HQ posts inLondon, very nearly all the remaining work subject to the review.Apart from those of satellite bodies (see paragraph 16), there are afew   other posts to consider in smaller offices.
13. I suggest that the next phase of the review should extend to allthe remaining Departments subject to the review. Types of office whichmight be excluded are listed in Appendix III.14.    I further suggest that the review should begin in February 1972,with a view to recommendations to Ministers by the end of 1972.    Thiswill of course need to be agreed with the Ministers concerned in thenear future,  if the necessary preparatory work is to be done and theprogramme is to begin on time.    The merit of reviewing such a largenumber of posts during 1972 is that it will complete the dispersalstudy and enable Ministers to come to decisions on the basis of aconnected view of the possibilities, within two years of starting.I do not believe that a longer period of study would be justified.    Moreimportant,  it is imperative for the Government to have as complete a picture as possible in making decisions which may have importantconsequences for the conduct of public business.&quot;... &apos; \\15.    It will be necessary,  so as to spread out the load on my teamin the CSD,  for the 1972 review to make a phased start,  perhaps in twoor three groups of Departments,  and for Departments largely to do thework themselves.    Experience so far has been invaluable in providing a basis on which a  &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; review can be undertaken and Ibelieve that,  with suitable support from my team and goodwill in deparments,  a review team in each Department could cope with the study of communication patterns.-   (16.    Much&apos;accommodation is held at public expense in London by bodies which are not part of the HQ structure of Departments,  notably the research Councils.    So far these bodies have not been included in the review,  although they are of course showing up in the studies ofcommunication patterns.    Prima facie these bodies should be included,and I shall prJesent recommendations to you in due course with regardto their treatment,  after consultation with those concerned.Acknowle dgement s17.    I am grateful to the Departments now under review and to their staff for their cooperation,  and to other Departments which have provided
facilities for some of the related research. I am also grateful tothe Civil Service National Whitley Council (Staff Side) for helpfulcomments on the review.(iConclusions18.    I invite you to agree that jja. the timetable for MOD should be extended until May 1972;b. while a report might be made to you on Group 1 this year,I should seek no decision on it until the results of the reviewof MOD or of Departments associated with it are available;c. the review should next extend to all Departments, other thanthose types noted in Appendix III,  should begin on 1  February 1972and should be conducted by the Departments themselves, with assistance from my team in CSD.Henry HardmanCivil Service DepartmentWhitehallLONDON SW1July 1971
THE LOCATION OF GOVERNMENT:  INTERIM REPORTRELATED STUDIESTelecommunications research .      A team at University College,  London,  under contract to CSDand the Post Office,  is studying the potential contribution ofdifferent forms of telecommunications and the questions whether such forms are likely to be regarded by staff as an effectivesubstitute for face-to-face meeting.    CSD itself is about to starttwo experiments,  one with closed circuit television (in London) andthe other with an audio-link enabling separate groups to confer -this will be between St Andrew&apos;s House in Edinburgh and Dover house in Whitehall.The human aspects2.      The CSD has commissioned the Tavisxock Institute to do a shortpiece of research on the attitudes of staff who have been dispersedor who may be dispersed.    The aim is to enable management to identifytypes of problems,  to build on past experience and to avoid pastmistakes.     Samples of dispersed staff have been found in theDepartment for National Savings (London, Durham and Glasgow),  HMSO(Norwich) and the Civil Service Commission (Basingstoke).    This work is nearly complete and we are proceeding shortly to mount the workon staff who may be subject to dispersal in the Group 1 Departments.The management aspects3.      The CSD is identifying management issues with a view to proposingways of dealing with them.    They include the effect of dispersal oncareer patterns,  the mobility rule and the cost of dispersal in termsof transfer and other allowances.1.
Foreign experience4.      The FCO are carrying out a small study of the experience ofother countries in overcoming problems associated with the separation of units of Government or the Government and economiccapital.
THE LOCATION OF GOVERNMENT:THE REVIEW OF MOD1.      The original timetable for the Departmental communicationstudies envisaged a start on the Group 1 Departments in November 1970and on the Group 2 Departments (MOD and the former MAS) in April 1971*Completion of Groups 1 and 2 studies was programmed for June and october 1971 respectively.    The MOD staff responsible for the reviewof their Department questioned from the start the feasibility ofthis timetable,  taking into account the Department1s greater size and complexity.    A joint reappraisal resulted in a feasible completiondate of January 1972 based on an April 1971 start.    In recognitionof this,  the MOD review began in April 1971 despite the fact that the start of the Group 1 studies had been delayed until January 1971*Current progress is in line with the revised timetable.2.      The review involves distributing and analysing over 12,000questionnaires to MOD staff at and above HEO level.    This compares with about 3*000 for the Group 1 Departments.    This greater size is reflected also in the greater number of &quot;blocks of work&quot; into whichthe Department has been divided with the agreement of senior staff.Agreement with senior staff on the communications patterns and needsof each of these blocks will be sought following a report on each.There are about 300 such blocks,  excluding (MOD(AS) which is complicated by the forthcoming Defence Procurement Executive.    InMOD(AS) the staff are divided into about 500 very small blocks inorder to allow for their re-grouping when the shape of the DPE begins to crystallize.    It will be necessary, therefore, to seek more detailed communications patterns in MOD(AS) and to consult again withsenior staff in the DPE.3c MOD has characteristics different from other Whitehall departments and these profoundly affect communication needs.    They arise from its.CONFIDENTIAL
operational readiness for crises.    I have accepted that these special features require special treatment.    The questionnaire to staff is being modified, therefore,  and some additional studiesmounted.    This results in additional workloads throughout the study.
THE LOCATION OF GOVERNMENTTYPES OF OFFICE WHICH MIGHT BE EXCLUDEDa1.    Bodies whose primary link is with the work of Parliament  (egParliamentary Counsel) or with Ministers collectively (eg theCabinet Office - other than the Central Statistical Office - andthe Privy Council Office).2.    Bodies of limited duration (eg the Commission on theConstitution).3. Bodies whose dispersal is already agreed in principle (eg the countryside Commission).4. National institutions, other than Government offices, visitedby the public (eg museums and galleries).5.    Bodies with only a small liaison office in London (eg theScottish and Welsh Offices).
