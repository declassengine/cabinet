THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp (71) 99 Copy No.  6130 September, 1971i j wCABINETREVIEW OF GOVERNMENT STRATEGYNote by the Prime minister attach a paper by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) whichoffers a synoptic view of the Government^ performance in relation toits strategic objectives. As a first contribution in this field it is not designed to provide a blueprint for Government action but rather a basis for stocktaking by Ministers of what the Government hasachieved so far and discussion about our strategic priorities both inthe remainder of this Parliament and in the longer term.2. The paper can only deal cursorily with the various sectors of our strategy. It is supported by amplified notes about the sectorswhich I am having circulated separately so that my colleagues canread them if they feel so inclined. But these notes can do little morethan offer a bird&apos;s-eye view and suggest some ideas. They are not,and are not meant to be, substitutes for the expertise of Departments.3. I propose therefore that we should not formally discuss thesupporting notes; but that we should confine ourselves to a general discussion, which I will ask the responsible Ministers to lead in eachsector, drawing or not as they wish on the CPRS notes.E.

REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT STRATEGYMemorandum by the Central Policy Review StaffINTRODUCTIONThe Government has been in office for some 15 months. Thepurpose of this paper is to provide a basis for discussion of what theGovernment has done and how its strategy might be developed.Supporting notes of greater detail are available on all the particulartopics discussed.GENERAL OBJECTIVES2 The Governments policies are intended to lead to:(a) a better quality of life for all;(b) better quality of government;(c) liberation of the individual; and Id) greater economic growth on which almost all else depends.PARTICULAR POLICIES3 The particular policies which are intended to contribute to these general objectives have been grouped under the following areas of activity:(i) The economyControl of inflation; a high level of employment; reduction oftaxation and of Government expenditure.(ii) Overseas affairs and Northern IrelandJoining the e.c.; keeping Britain strong abroad; realisticpursuit of British interests; establishing peaceful and effectivegovernment in Northern Ireland.(iii) industry a. strong competition policy; encouragement of investment;no further nationalisation; hiving off parts of the nationalised industries; disengagement from direct intervention; continuedsupport for agriculture.
(iv) LabourImprovement of industrial relations; the efficient deployment of manpower, -(v) The regionsCorrection of structural weakness; improvement of infra-structure.(vi) The environmentReform of housing finance; provision of transport on aneconomic basis; balance between the needs of expanding, wealthierpopulation and amenity.(vii) Social affairsDeveloping health and personal social services; filling gaps in social security; improvement of education; law reform and enforcement; easing race relations.(viii) The role of GovernmentGreater devolution; more open administration; encouragement of voluntarism.4 The Table at Annex J summarises action taken so far to implement a number of these policies. The succeeding paragraphsexamine the objectives and policies in more detail, raise certain questions and conclude by offering recommendations.THE GENERAL OBJECTIVES5  Quality of LifeThis is only measurable (and then subjectively) over a periodof years. There is no discernible improvement yet. Some, notably the unemployed, would say there has been regression. How much is achieved by 1975 will depend primarily on sustaining the expansionof the economy: other policies will take longer to have effect.6  Quality of GovernmentThe Government has won marks by doing what it said it would do, with the crucial exceptions of inflation and unemployment.But: Its style has sometimes appeared hard and unfeeling;decisions are taking as long to make as ever; and the strategicobjective has frequently been sacrificed to the tactical necessity(e.g. Upper Clyde). The big Departments have not yet fullyproved themselves; nor has PAR; nor, perhaps, has the CPRS;but who are we to say?
7 Liberation of the IndividualThe individual person or company has been set free in a numberof respects (e.g. the burden of taxation and interference with industry).But: They have not always appreciated it. It has sometimesmeant unemployment, bankruptcy, or exposure of the consumerto forces against which he feels powerless. And the compensa-tions (e.g. through the benefits of faster growth) have not yeteventuated.8  Economic GrowthThere has been conflict between the need to achieve growth andthe policy chosen to control inflation. The various policies intendedto promote faster economic growth tax incentives, tax reform,e.c. entry, more competition, less Government interference will necessarily take time to produce any significant or discernible effects.In the short term, production has been stagnant and unemploymentrising.THE PARTICULAR POLICIES9 The Economy(i) Unemployment and economic expansionUnemployment has reached an unacceptable level. The tax.reductions in the Budget and the July measures should reduce unemployment during 1912.But: (a) If the momentum of expansion is to be maintainedafter 1972, the balance of payments will deteriorate. The presentflexibility of exchange rates should help if we can ensure that by1973 the e.c. currencies and the Japanese yen have appreciatedin relation to the pound by the amount which we need.(b) The expansion, particularly in the context of entry intothe e.c., will need to be very carefully managed. There is a risk that a new round of stop-go cycles may emerge in 1973-74.(ii) Control of inflationInflation has not been controlled: wages and prices haverespectively risen by a record 12 per cent and 9 per cent in the lastyear. Neither competition policy nor trades union reform will by themselves have much effect either in the short or long term. the chancellors reflationary measures of July may actually improve124257.
labour bargaining power. The CBI initiative is a way of breakinginto the vicious circle; but unless there is a response from the unions is a limitation of prices alone will lead to inadequate profitability andthus jeopardise industrial investment.While the Government has so far avoided a statutory freeze orother formal prices and incomes policy, it will need to develop a positive strategy before the expiry of the GBI initiative. otherwise the effects of joining the e.c., of the VAT, of the reform of housing finance and of economic pricing by the nationalised industries couldcause intolerable inflationary strains in 1973-74.However successful the Government^ policies, inflation will be higher in this Parliament than ever before. If inflation averages 7 percent, a fixed income of  2,000 at the beginning of the Parliament willbe worth just over  1,400 by the end. The Government should consider how it can protect the losers from this process.(iii) Reduction of taxationThe Government has reduced taxation by  1,100 million in1971-72 and has abolished hire purchase restrictions.But: Inflation has whittled away some of the benefit of the reductions to individuals. Moreover, can the downward trend oftaxation be maintained until 1974-75 unless public expenditure is also held down more firmly, especially if resources have to befound for an increase in investment on accession to the e.c. and for the balance of payments in, say, 1973?(iv) Restraint of Government expenditure the prospective rate of growth of public expenditure over thenext five years has so far been kept only just below the estimatedpotential growth rate of the economy.But: There has been a conflict between this objective and thecontainment of inflation. Many of the cuts in public expenditurehave involved the transfer of charges from the public to theprivate sector e.g. agricultural finance, housing finance,prescription charges, school meals and milk.Civil Service manpower has been reduced by abolishing the land commission, the PIB and Investment Grant offices. But thedemands of VAT, law and order and more selective social services impede further reductions. So Civil Service manpoweris still actually rising rather than falling. Progress with hivingoff has been meagre; and it is in any event no economy in man-power (though it may lead to improved efficiency) to transferpeople from one pay-roll to another. The need is to identifyactivities which may be dispensed with altogether; or which may
be carried out as efficiently with fewer staff. Since departments have so far been unable to do this themselves, should theGovernment now engage professional consultants for thepurpose?10  Overseas Affairs and Northern Ireland(i) Joining the EECNegotiations have been successful. Subject to Parliament, theUnited Kingdom should be a member of the Community on1 January, 1973.But: Have we yet started thinking European? Have we decidedwhat sort of Europe we want and what we must do to get it, e.g.defence policy, monetary integration, future of London asEurope&apos;s financial centre?(ii) Northern IrelandPast policy on Northern Ireland is in ruins. Given the cost of thepresent troubles in lives and money, British opinion is liable tobecome increasingly disenchanted.(iii) Keeping Britain strong abroadThe Government has done well to achieve an East of Suezpresence and a stronger contribution to NATO within financiallimits lower than the cost of the Labour Governments programme.But: The percentage of our GNP devoted to defence will on present plans remain alarmingly high by e.c. standards. Evenkeeping to the limits at present contemplated will be difficult,however, if we are to maintain our existing commitments,especially in a period when the American contribution to europe&apos;s defence is likely to be contracting. The constraints of manpower on defence policy are also likely to increase.(iv) Realistic pursuit of British interest abroadThe Government has maintained a skilful balancing act wherediffering British interests conflict (e.g. arms for South Africa and the singapore Conference).But: Other troublesome cases are looming (e.g. economic relations with the United States, oil supplies from the middle east and reactions to a possible settlement with Rhodesia).SECRET124257 b*
11 Industry(i) CompetitionThe Government has reaffirmed belief in the competitive forcesof the market place and is to introduce new legislation oncompetition.But: Competition in future must be considered in terms ofEurope: the e.c. is our domestic market and any legislation onmonopolies and restrictive practices should reflect this. It shouldalso show concern for the consumer.(ii) InvestmentAllowances have been substituted for grants and will be generallypreferred by industry when profitability increases.But: Reluctance to invest has persisted, with serious implications-tions for our industrial competitiveness. This is particularly important in the context of entry into the e.c. in 1973.Significant increases in the level of investment will only occurif the Government commits itself to a credible long-term policyof stable and uninterrupted growth and permits higherprofitability.(iii) The nationalised industriesApart from Rolls-Royce, and now some pressure in respect ofUCS, the Government has resisted further nationalisation.But: It has found difficulties ideological and practical inhiving off parts of the existing nationalised industries. Thereis a fundamental conflict in the Government^ attitude to these industries: is the Government still aiming at leaving them to actcommercially or does it want to retain control (e.g. pricing policy)?(iv) DisengagementThe 1958-59 has been wound up and the Government has emphasised its refusal to support lame ducks.But: The Government had to rescue Rolls-Royce, is trying toprovide a new structure for shipbuilding on the Clyde and isbuttressing ICL. Does this point to the advantage of a morepragmatic, less doctrinaire approach to intervention in theprivate sector? Is there scope for some co-operative agencywhich would enable Government and industry to plan together,as for example the Japanese, Italians and French seem to do with some effect?
(v) Support for agriculture the Government has taken the necessary steps to move to an import levy system of support, thus facilitating harmonisation withthe common agricultural policy of the e.c..But: As members of the e.c. we shall need to be clear aboutthe optimum level of protection for European agriculture.12 Labour(i) legislation the Industrial Relations Act is on the Statute Book a notableachievement.But: Legislation alone is not enough. Indeed, in the short termit may even exacerbate unrest. Bargaining power has swung infavour of organised labour. Ultimately, there has to be a new relationship between Government, management and labour which recognises this development.(ii) ManpowerThe process of industrial change creates redundancies in someskills and areas and labour shortages in others. New policy initiativeson training and re-training in order to increase mobility and reduce unemployment are essential, e.g. measures to ensure that existingtraining facilities, especially those in Government Training Centres,are fully used together with a further substantial expansion of such facilities. These initiatives must be geared to the structural problemsof the development areas.13  The RegionsDifferential incentives (through tax allowances rather thangrants) have been continued for development areas; the regional employment Premium is to disappear. There has been someconcentration on infrastructure improvement.But: Unemployment is at a very high level, calling forth a publicworks programme costing over  150 million in the regions whichwill, however, provide few jobs. Development areas still relyexcessively on declining industries (e.g. coal mining and ship-building). The regional problem is thus as acute as ever. Shouldan entirely new approach be considered, such as planned emigra-tion from the regions, not only to other parts of the UnitedKingdom but to Europe and outside it; the establishment of effective regional development institutions; or stimulating aco-ordinated European approach involving Community finance?The political constraints here may be paramount, but by 1974-75the regional problem, on present indications, will be no nearerfundamental solution. Any solution will involve spending a lot of money.124257b* 2
14 The Environment(i) Reform of housing finance the charging of economic rents is a step forward.But: The brunt will be felt in 1973 when the United Kingdom isalso incurring the first costs of the e.c. and of VAT. The effect will be inflationary.(ii) Surface transport the roads programme is going ahead steadily. Steps are beingtaken to make public passenger transport more responsive to marketforces.But: Railway closures are becoming increasingly hard to implement. There are still no comprehensive solutions to urbantransport problems. Minorities without easy access to eitherpublic or private transport will continue to present difficulties.Should the Government have a more co-ordinated policy towards the private motor car?(iii) AmenityThe problem is to preserve a balance between the needs of expanding population and industry, and the preservation of amenity.This affects the quality of life.But: Does the Government know what people really want andare prepared to pay for? The environmental lobby is strong andthe Government has itself made people more aware of environ-mental considerations. Is the pendulum swinging too far?Would people be prepared to pay  100 more per car to preventpollution of the atmosphere?15  Social Affairs(i) Improvement in the health and personal social servicesMany improvements are being made and considerable priorityhas been attached to the programme as a whole. The reorganisation of the NHS is in hand.But: Finance and manpower are major constraints. Thequestion of whether the Department of Health and social security should have a more positive directing role in relationto the executive authorities is important. The long-term financing of the NHS gives cause for concern. More, and more relevant,research is needed across the whole field.
(ii) Social security the radical reconstruction of National Insurance in accordancewith declared Government policies is well under way.But: Decisions on family poverty will not be easy politically,but will be crucial. Decisions remain to be taken on theselectivity or otherwise of future real improvements in pensions,and on the disincentive effects of benefits at certain income levels.(iii) Improvements in educationResources have been purposively shifted into primary education.Local authorities have been told that they are free to choose theirown pattern of secondary education.But: Finance and manpower are once again major constraints.The rate of growth of the University programme has been cutback to pay for primary school improvements, and the futurestrategy for higher and further education remains to be decided.Major issues in the teaching profession are looming up. Nothinghas yet been done to expand nursery education. Is the present structure of the education system being adjusted quickly enoughto meet the needs of a rapidly changing society?(iv) Law reform and enforcement; and race relationsAction has been taken to meet the Government^ immediatepledges. The treatment of offenders is the subject of the Home OfficePAR for 1971.But: The availability of qualified manpower will constrain the prison programme, the police and the probation service. Long-term programmes will be needed to tackle the fundamentalproblems of child care and race relations.16 The Role of Government(i) Reform of local government and greater devolutionThe Government has promised to increase the independence oflocal authorities and to bring about a genuine devolution of power from the centre.But: The current reform of local government due to come intoeffect by April 1974 does not redeem either of these promises.Like its predecessor, the Government seems to have turned itsback on devolution lest it lead to loss of efficiency and greaterexpense. Would these really be the costs of more independentlocal government? Are Ministers prepared to argue that therewould be no offsetting advantages?
(ii) More open governmentLittle progress has been achieved with this objective. preoccupied with issues of security, the Government has not notably opened built-up areas of debate, even within Whitehall. However, change here isdesirable if the apathy or cynicism about politics among much of the electorate, notably the young, is to be overcome. It is also necessary as a spur to Civil Service efficiency.(iii) VoluntarismProgress in encouraging private resources into socially beneficialareas has been scant. None the less, this offers one way of restricting the area of government and of helping to achieve savings ingovernment expenditure and manpower. It should therefore be encouraged, notably by tax incentives. Obvious areas are the social services, education and the arts.CONCLUSIONS17 The notable achievements of the Government&apos;s first 15 monthsof office have been:(i) successful negotiations to join the e.c.;(ii) the passing of the Industrial Relations Act;(iii) the substantial reductions in taxation; and(iv) the introduction of a more serious style of government.18  The notable failures have been in respect of:(a) inflation;(b) unemployment; and(c) Northern Ireland.The first two of these could be fatal in the General Election of1974-75 if they persist. Their rectification must be the Governmentsfirst priority, and the basis for the second year&apos;s momentum.19 Northern Ireland is the joker in the pack: is it an exaggerationto say that it could be the United Kingdom&apos;s Vietnam? A new initiative is imperative, well before 1974-75.20 Specific, but less fundamental, areas where the Government isnot at present fulfilling its pledges are those of reduction in the size of the Civil Service; devolution to local authorities; less stateinvolvement in the nationalised industries; and more opengovernment.
21 However, the Government is likely to be judged less on itsfulfilment of specific pledges than on its success in dealing with the major problems mentioned in paragraph 17 above. At this point thequestion of timescale becomes very important. A number of theGovernments policies, designed to increase the country&apos;s prosperityin the longer run, will not have much effect before 1975: examples are those concerned with competition, investment and labour relations. Others indeed may be positively unpopular in the shortterm: examples are disengagement from private industry and entry into the e.c.. The Government therefore also needs policies to dealwith the short term. These however should so far as possible be consistent with their longer-term policies more personal responsi-bility, disengagement, lower taxation, thinking European.RECOMMENDATIONS22 In the light of these conclusions, the CPRS selects from the ideas in this paper the following recommendations. We have groupedthem according to the timescale on which they could be expected tohave effect.A.  Immediate measures for early results(i) Give top priority to the essentials controlling inflation and reducing unemploymentAn accommodation with the trades unions on wages must befound before the expiry of the CBI initiative on prices. Otherwise theGovernment may be forced into a statutory incomes policy.Meanwhile, the Government should reduce unemployment by ageneral expansion of demand rather than by propping up uneconomicindustries. This expansion should leave room for an increase in investment preceding United Kingdom entry into the e.c. and for transferring more resources to the balance of payments in 1973.(ii) Maintain currency flexibility in expanding demand the Government should exploit its majorpiece of good fortune that the balance of payments constraint maybe removed by other currencies revaluing in relation to our own. Itshould therefore aimL at retaining currency flexibility as long as necessary to ensure an appropriate relative value for sterling.(iii) In seeking further cuts in public expenditure, avoid areas wherethe result is to put up prices to consumers; cuts should rathercome through greater efficiency or cessation of a service.
(iv) Protect the losers from inflationThe Government needs to identify the main losers from inflation and protect them.(v) Pay more attention to communicationThe Government has so far not got proper credit for its morecompassionate policies. It needs to show that it cares.B. Immediate measures for longer-term results(i) Think in European termsThis affects such diverse things as regional policy, environ-mental measures, and policies for competition, social security andindustrial development. The Government will need to formulatepositive initiatives on e.g. the Common Agricultural Policy, monetaryintegration, European defence and making London the financialcentre of Europe. Results may not be seen until the next Parliament,but a start has to be made at once.(ii) Re-examine the Governments role in relation to industryInvestment must be encouraged by a credible Governmentcommitment to uninterrupted growth and higher profitability. Wheretotal disengagement is impossible the Government should considernew ways of marrying public and private funds e.g. through an agencyrun jointly by the state and the private sector.(iii) Re-think regional policyExpansion may ease the regional problem in the short term. Butthe adoption of a new approach with new policy instruments is urgently needed if the long-term problem is to be eased and money is not to be squandered.(iv) Fill gaps in the short-term strategy for social affairsTackle the problem of family poverty. Work out a strategy fortreating the offender. And initiate better customer-orientated researchacross the whole field.. &apos; &apos;-rPJ,uihsfi &apos;t W:y      i  &apos;&apos;:&quot;&apos;:: ?s: iuj(v) Make the public service more efficientThe CPRS believes it may be possible both to reduce the size ofthe public service and to improve its efficiency. Since departments have themselves been unable to achieve this, an alternative would beto engage independent management consultants for the purpose.(vi) Northern IrelandWe make no recommendation here but underline the importanceto the Government of finding the basis for a fresh policy.
C.  Longer-term measures(i) Make up your minds about the nationalised industriesPolicy towards the nationalised industries is ambivalent. Theyshould either be left to act commercially, in such matters as pricing,or be more closely controlled. The former would be more consistent with the Governments general philosophy.(ii) Develop a long-term strategy for social affairsWork out a new strategy for education, especially higher educa-tion, to fit society&apos;s new needs and develop the structure of the teaching profession accordingly. Plan for the financing of the NHS inthe 1980s. Work out comprehensive policies for child care. develop a long-term strategy for race relations.(iii) Decide what sort of military power we wish to beFinancial, manpower and international problems are likely tocall for radical reappraisal within a few years at most. They shouldbe anticipated.(iv) Be bold about more open government this would pay dividends with the disenchanted. The green paper technique should be further developed, e.g. to cover many ofthe topics discussed in this paper (family poverty, transport, the environment).23 Strategy is dynamic, not static. The present paper, together withthe more detailed sectoral notes, is intended as no more than a first step in what should be a continuing process of self-examination. the cprs proposes:(i) Periodically to monitor progress towards the Governmentsobjectives and fulfilment of the policies discussed inparagraphs 3 to 16 above.(ii) To scrutinise particular programmes and policy proposals asthey come forward for compatibility with the objectives.(iii) In collaboration with Departments,  and through themachinery of PAR, to examine how the policies discussed in this paper can be developed.24 Finally, we consider that since many of the problems examinedhere are of great complexity, it is neither desirable nor possible to rely exclusively on meetings of the Cabinet, Ministerial Committeesand on officials for discussion and thought about them. We believethat selected groups of Ministers must find time to discuss selectedproblems related to strategy under informal conditions. Such discus-sions should be preceded by a brief colloquial paper by a Minister, a civil Servant, the CPRS or someone else. Whether or not ministers are already over-worked, we consider that informal Ministerialmeetings along these lines at regular intervals are highly desirable.
