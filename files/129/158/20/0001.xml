3DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENTh 1CP(71) 95 COPY NO     u x27 July 1971CABINETSHIPBUILDING ON THE UPPER CLYDEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. When I reported the provisional opinions of the Advisory Group tothe Economic Policy Committee on 23 July, I said that there seemedlittle prospect of viability for any new enterprise based on the facilities of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS).    The views of 3 European shipbuildingexperts commissioned by the Group to study production facilities at UCS,were not then known.    In the light of their advice the Group are nowconvinced that a limited enterprise, well managed, would be viable,provided that unions co-operate with management to the full.    The Groupdo not believe that UCS as a whole was or could ever have been viable.2.        They propose the creation of a new enterprise concentrated on theGovan (formerly Fairfield) Yard and the adjoining Linthouse premises.They recommend the disposal as quickly as possible of the other UCS Yards.The Group envisage that the annual output of the new enterprise would be some 6 bulk or product carriers of around 30, 000 dwt. providing employment for about za 500 men.    They point out there should be scope both for increasing production to 8 vessels from the existing berths and for expansion of the facilities on the site.3.        Capital requirements would be some  2 million for fixed assets; 2 milllonfor improvements to the facilities; and  5 million for working capital.    The Group remain doubtful whether the new enterprise couldattract private equity.    However they think It might be possible to transferit to private ownership after a period of proven viability.4. I am circulating separately (as Annex 1) the summary of the Group*conclusions and recommendations.5.        Although the Group are now convinced of the viability of a limitedshipbuilding facility on the Upper Clyde, we should set no great store bythe possibility that it could later be hived off to the private sector.    Thereis every likelihood of an indefinite commitment of public support for ship building on the Upper Clyde.    This cannot readily be squared with our industrial policy and would be widely resented in sectors of industry (not1
only shipbuilding) which are being forced to stand on their own feet.    Onthe other hand, to refuse all public support would have painful social consequences, and in view of the hopes we have publicly expressed weshould have great difficulty in defending a refusal to back therecommendations of the Group, which we should certainly not be able tokeep secret.6.        In the circumstances, I conclude, reluctantly, that we should accept in principle the GroupTs recommendations.    It will however take time toset up the new enterprise and a suitable management team! we should proceed by stages and our final agreement should be conditional on the negotiation of satisfactory undertakings with the trades unions.7.        Initially the Goven/Linthouse unit will have to be kept going by theprovisional liquidator (who is virtually certain to be confirmed by the Courtas liquidator on Friday when UCS are gr anted the winding-up order andwho will thereafter dispose of the other two yards in the normal way).The present programme at Goven is not sufficient to employ the whole ofits work force and the liquidator in the ordinary course would close the yard early in November.    If, however, work were to proceed on 3contracts the liquidator has suspended (including a dredger for the brazilian Government) the yard would be fully employed until the end ofthe year.    The liquidator is ready to co-operate in this, provided meansare found of protecting the creditors against possible loss on these contracts.    The size of loss is difficult to estimate but could be about 1 million.    The liquidator would also need working capital which mayhave to be provided by the Government.    There is also a possibility thatthe 3 shipowners might require a Government guarantee of completion.8. This will give some months during which a. undertakings can besought from the unions and b. the first steps to setting up the newenterprise can be taken, including if possible early appointment of the keymanagers.    The Advisory Group have agreed to continue to assist meduring the difficult transition to the new set-up.    It remains to be worked out whether the liquidator^ regime can see us through the whole of the transitional period, or whether we need to think in terms of some other form of caretaker management under contract.FINANCE AND LEGISLATION9.        In the first instance, any moneys required by the Government willbe obtained from the Contingencies Fund and estimates will be submittedto the House in due course.    In the event that a continuing operation is involved, legislation will have to be introduced as soon as practicable.REDUNDANCIES10,       On the basis of this plan immediate redundancies would not riseabove 400;  500 would follow in September; a further 2, 000 by the end ofthe year and the remaining 3,000 during early 1972.    With Lower Clyde2
Shipbuilders requiring 1,000 men immediately, roughly 40 per cent of theUCS work force could continue in employment in shipbuilding.RECOMMENDATIONS11.        I invite my colleagues to agree that:i. We should accept the Advisory Group^s proposals and support the establishment of a modest shipbuilding enterpriseat Goven/Linthouse (including an investment of up to  10 million of public funds) provided that satisfactory undertakings can beobtained from the unions.ii. Meanwhile Govan/Linthouse should be kept in full operationthrough the liquidator until other arrangements are made but if satisfactory agreements with the unions are not reached by30th November, operations should not continue beyond the endof 1971.iii. If necessary for the purposes of ii., we should give theliquidator an indemnity against loss on the 3 ehips referred to inparagraph 7 above ; provide him with working capital and give guarantees of completion to the 3 shipowners concerned.12.       I attach at Annex II a draft of the statement I would makeannouncing these decisions.J d department of Trade and Industry SW127 July 19713
confidential annex ii draft statement^x&apos; BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRYIn my statement on 14th June on the position of UCS I said that,without prejudice to the creditors&apos; interests, the Governmentwould seek to ensure the minimum dislocation of current production,the preservation of as much employment as possible and as many of the assets as could be expected to have a viable and prosperous future. i therefore asked a small group of experts to advise me as to what arrangements could be made to this end.The Group&apos;s conclusions and recommendations are available in theHouse of Commons   library.Their findings are broadly:Firstly that the U.C.S. Ltd. as organised in 1967 was doomed fromthe start as a result of the faulty concept of structure within whichit was organised; the burden of eventual loss with which it was saddled;the inadequate management with which it was provided.    They thereforeconclude that its liquidation is inescapable.Secondly, that by concentrating the order book on the Govan andLinthouse sites; by radically reforming management; by negotiating amuch more productive and realistic working agreement with the 2,500men who might be employed in these facilities; and by standardisingproduction in terms of ship construction; it should be possible toretain a viable shipbuilding capability on the Upper Clyde withprospects of some eventual expansion.,Thirdly that, in view of the history of U.C.S.    and the currentprospects of the yards, there is little likelihood of attractingprivate capital to sustain such a venture and that, accordingly,it should be for the government to undertake the immediate salvageoperation with the ultimate expectation, having proved the viability ofthe venture, of disposing of it to private interests.The Government accept these conclusions and, as I have already indicated . are prepared to make some reasonable degree of financial support available in order to achieve the objectives recommended by theGroup.In addition to the 2,500 who, as I have mentioned, willhave the assurance of continued employment within these plans, atleast 1,000 and perhaps some hundreds more should be able to find work with other shipbuilders on the Clyde; some too may be retained in work asa result of the acquisition by others of the remaining facilities of u.C.S. - Overall I hope that around half of the present U.C.S. work-force will find continued employment in shipbuilding on the Clyde.This will still mean heavy redundancies; they will not however occurtogether, but be spread over a period as ships now under constructionare completed./The ..
The liquidation of U.C.S. will proceed. During the period of transition I hope &apos;.o have the continued advice of the expert Group,to whom   I am&apos;most grateful for their work.Close contact has been maintained throughout with theprovisional liquidator and will be continued when a definitiveliquidator is appointed.    I am confident that he will give everyassistance in mitigating as far as it lies within his power the severity of this disastrous affair.    On the Government1s side everything possible will be done to assist those who lose their jobs, compatible with the firm resolve not to prop up an enterprise without prospects of a viable future.In the first instance any moneys required by the Governmentwill be obtained from the Contingencies Fund and estimates will besubmitted to the House in due course-    In the event that a continuingoperation is involved legislation will be introduced as soon aspracticable.-2-CONFIDENTIAL
STRICTLY CONFIDENT! ALUPPER CLYDE SHIPBUILDERS1.        The causes of this failure, which contrasts sadly with;   the performance of other shipbuilding enterprises onthe Clyde can be summarized as follows:-(a) a totally mistaken initial structure which forcedtogether into one rigid and prestigious Group fivecompanies whose shipbuilding competitiveness wasexceedingly doubtful unless major improvements infacilities and methods were brought about urgentlyand whose financial strength was fragile.     Thisimposed annual Group expenses of something over 2m. net of loan interest:(b) a massive drain from an already weak working capital by the absorption in UCS of losses from pre-existing contracts which in August 1968 had been estimated at  3. 55m. but which, in fact, have totalledover  12m. : _^(c) a mistaken marketing policy which led to losses on new contracts which already in August 1968 were known to amount to  4. 8m. but which, in fact, havetotalled  9. 8m. :(d) in the result, the total injection of public funds hasdisappeared.    No improvement in facilities, no worth-while investment has been made.     Facilities remain as they were before the merger,  ill-equipped andcramped at Clydebank, less out-of-date but still morecramped at Scotstoun, and even at Govan by no meansmodern although much better in available space sovital for modern shipbuilding:(e) a mistake in original structure and the subsequenthappenings were compounded by poor management,for/.. .
RECOMMENDATIONS:3.1     In these Recommendations we have tried to make judgmentprimarily on grounds c  likely commercial viabilityboth in a short and longer term sense, but, in viewof Governments share of responsibility, we have also givenweight to social considerations v/hich we believe Governmentin this case must observe.    Our Recommendations, subjectto the approval as appropriate of the Liquidator, are asfollows:-(1)      that an end be made to UCS whilst retaining legal andfinancial flexibility to help achieve other objectives:(2)     that a successor company is established at Govan/Linthouse, and that Clyclebank and Scotstoun be disposed/. . .confidential for the continuation of which until June 1971Government and the Shipbuilding Industry Boardmust bear their share of responsibility:(f) in particular, management has not exercisedefficient control of costs, particularly of wages,in which their impact seriously threatened otherindustry on the Clyde:(g) it is true that recently there is evidence of improve.-ment in productivity which we recognize has madeevents -even more of a shock to men when from a production viewpoint they thought they wererounding a corner.     But this improvement doesnot offset the inherent weaknesses in the present structure and facilities of UCS.CONCLUSION-: .2.1     The conclusion must be that any continuation ofUpper Clyde Shipbuilders in its present form wouldbe wholly unjustified and, indeed, could cause serious and more widespread damage.- - It is important that the lessons of this failure are clear and unambiguous.
disposed of as soon as possible by the Liquidator:(3)      that the present shipbuilding programme is con-centrated so far as is practicable, and as urgentlyas possible, upon the Govan yard.    In achieving this, we would note that individual contracts may bere-negotiated wherever there is potential benefit.We should also mention that there is considerable-misunderstanding about this present programme.Looked at in total it may seem large but spread asit was over the three UCS yards it was alreadydangerously thin in the light of the present depressedconditions in world shipping.    If this programme canbe concentrated partly or largely into Govan/Linthouse,however, a more valuable based order book would beachieved. &apos;(4)     that every assistance is given by Government and theLocal Authorities in assisting redeployment ofredundant staff and workers, particularly in the ship--  yards on the Lower Clyde, at Yarrows and elsewhere..   It is our understanding that Scott-Lithgow could absorban additional balanced force of 1, 500/1,750 and thatYarrows, subject to the co-operation of M. o. D. (N) inregard to the naval programme, might be able to absorbup to 1, 30O additional steel workers.    Furthermore,the completion of existing new buildings in the three UCS-yards and the transfer to Govan of other newbuildingswhere keels have not yet been laid will all take a little time which could be valuable in phasing out redundanciesso that natural retirements due to age etc. have thegreatest possible influence.3. 2    It is our belief that shipbuilding can be undertaken with good prospects of profitability at Govan.     The yard issuitable for building bulkcarriers up to around 70, OOOtons deadweight and should be well placed to competeefficiently in this range of size, which includes ships suchas product-carriers.    We would not recommend any extensionabove the upper limit until at least five years of viable per-formance had been recorded.CONFIDENTIAL
3, 3     On the basis of present facilities, we believe thai-six ships of some 30, OOO tons deadweight could becompleted each year involving a steel output of some30, OOO or 40, OOO tons.     Efficient production on this scale would probably give stable employment in the first stage for some 2, OOO men and 5O0 staff.     In securinglonger term viability, improvement in productivity shouldbe capable of being achieved up to some 50% above present levels.3.4    An essential contribution towards this would be a commitment by the Unions to accept certain changesin working practices including in due course a change to a.2-shift daily working,  say from 6 a. m. to 2 p. m* andfrom 2 p. m. to lO p. m. , with night working limited to main-tenance. -   By such means, an increase in output to eightships of the type mentioned might be possible, which in turncould justify an investment programme of perhaps  1.5m. in improving cranes and lifting facilities within Govan and perhaps,  on a larger scale later,  of extension of facilities in Linthouse.3. 5 We must emphasize that these recommendations inrespect of the continuation of shipbuilding at Govanare conditional oh:&apos;(1)      the full co-operation of the Unions in making this venture succeed and, in particular,  inthe acceptance of shift working of the typesuggested above, together with competitivewage rates:(2)     adequate capital being forthcoming:(3)      satisfactory management.3. 6    Union participation both on a national and local basishas to be secured and this might be done in a V/orkingParty set up to establish this new company.    In theterms of reference for such a Working Party there must beno doubt at all that the proposal represents the one and only effective/. . .CONFIDENTIAL
- CONFIDENTIAL (v)effective alternative to a total cessation of shipbuildingon the Upper Clyde.     It should be stated however, thatthis is an alternative which,  in our commercial judgment,we believe should be viable and capable also of expansion in the years to come.3. 7    We recognise that the financial support needed toestablish the new company will not be easy to   obtain.A degree of Government involvement will be necessaryin any event if the support of suppliers of marine equipment and other goods and services on the one hand and of ship-owners on the other is to be obtained.     Initially the Govern-ment may have to bear the total financial burden, either by making resources available or by the provision of guaranteesor by a combination of both.3. 8    The success or failure of this venture will dependfundamentally on management.     It is rarely possibleto produce a satisfactory management structure atthe drop of a hat.     Efficient operation of the unit on a day-to-day basis must be secured;   executive responsibility mustbe precise and unblurred.     It has been suggested that this could be achieved under the overall policy direction of aTemporary Management-Committee, to be set up immediately and to include representatives of others engaged in the ship-building industry in Britain.    Such representatives wouldhave to be chosen very carefully to ensure that this is notjust a paper solution but is a body capable of taking action and monitoring action.     On these conditions such an arrange-ment could bridge the initial period and lead the way to theadoption of a final management structure a little later.We are  not able to commit ourselves finally at this stage tothis suggestion,  but we believe it worthy of consideration as part ofthe essential steps to establish a new shipbuilding company at Govan.
