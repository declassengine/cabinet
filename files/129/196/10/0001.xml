DoCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 60 COPY NO      g13 June 1977CABINETTRANSPORT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for transport&quot; Two years ago the late Secretary of State for the Environmentinitiated a review of transport policy.    A consultation Document was published in April 1976.    The Go\ ernment promised that, after a period ofthorough consultation, a statement of its own views would be published later that year.2.        I now attach a draft White Paper.    It covers the transport interestsof the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales as well as my own.3- The draft has been considered by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy (EY) and by an ad hoc Group (GEN 83) of ministers principally concerned under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of theExchequer.    The draft reflects the Group&apos;s conclusions as well as a numberof changes, notably on fares and energy, suggested by my colleagues.The White Paper assumes the same total of public expenditure on transport for the end of the decade as was proposed in this year&apos;s public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6721) - a total of  2, 200 million (at 1976Survey prices).    This is 7 per cent below the peak year of 1976-77 andsubstantially below the total for 1973-74 - the last year of the conservative administration.    It is also below the total for the present year.^&apos;        The White Paper&apos;s main conclusions are summarised in Chapter 12.The principal features are:a. A reallocation of resources to give higher priority to public transport.    It proposes increases over planned levels for 1980-81of  75 million in subsidies to buses and  20 million in concessionaryfare schemes for elderly, blind and disabled people, with corresponding reductions in trunk road construction and in localauthority road expenditure, and a  20 million reduction in subsidies(now amounting to  300 million) to British Railways passengeroperations.SECRET
b. New powers and obligations for local authorities including a requirement on non-metropolitan counties to prepare and publishannual county public transport plans.c. A wider range of permissive powers to manage urban traffic.d. Emphasis on the transport problems of rural areas - byexpress obligations on county councils, by extra subsidy, and by changes in bus licensing to help local initiatives.e. The assurance of a continuing central role for the railways,especially in long distance passenger transport, bulk freight and theLondon commuter network.f. New arrangements for the counties to consider certain cost-ineffective local railway passenger services, and to decide whether to maintain them as they are, or with modifications or not at all.These would replace my powers on railway closures.g. The abandonment of the idea of continuing to develop a nationalstrategic network of continuous high grade new roads so as to concentrate on more modest and local improvements, bearing inmind environmental factors.h. Recognition of the need to promote energy conservation andto keep planning flexible in view of the uncertain prospects for oil.i. Realism however about the increasing use of the car - theview of &quot;motorists&quot; as a minority of well-off individuals is a myth.j. Realism also about the priority which industry places onefficient road transport balanced by fair terms of competition withrailways, and measures to civilise the heavy lorry.k. A tentative proposal for a transport Economic development committee to serve the essential purposes that the Trades UnionCongress&apos;s proposed National Transport Planning Authority wouldhave performed.^* The attached Annex spells out in more detail the background to therail proposals in 5f. above.    It also sets out for the convenience of cabinet colleagues my own judgment of the likely reaction of transport interests,the trade unions and the Party to the White Paper as a whole.7* The White Paper should not hinder the negotiation of Stage 3.    Thelncrease in bus subsidies over currently planned levels will moderateNecessary increases in bus fares from 1978-79 onwards.    Rail fares will haveto ^crease but the Board have already said that they expect no furtherSECRET
increase before this autumn, and if a satisfactory deal on pay is reachedI am hopeful that there need be no further increase this year.    My proposals will have no immediate effects on employment.8. My proposals do not affect the United kingdom s interests orobligations as a member of the European Community.9. The legislative consequences are few.    Those requiring thepreparation of local public transport plane and dealing with local railways are set out in paragraphs 91 to 100.    These could be added to a Bill on the finances of British Railways and the National Freight Corporation for whichthere is already place in the 1977-78 programme.    I propose to consultlocal authority associations and other interests on the details of these new provisions very soon after the White Paper is published, and I invite Cabinetto agree to the preparation of legislation accordingly.    There will later bea- need to legislate also for the extra controls on parking proposed inparagraph 123.10.       I invite Cabinet to approve the draft White Paper, with a view to its publication on or about 22 June.    This would follow the recommendation ofGEN 83.    If the White Paper is not published soon it will, because of theTransport and General Workers Union and National Union of Railweymenconferences in July, become awkward to publish before the autumn.    delay would not be well received in Parliament and would inevitably lead todamaging speculation, and prolonged uncertainty for the industries and theunions.W T r department of Transport13 June 1977SECRET
 Mm.Part I     The railways.   The most difficult and controversial proposal in the white paper relates to the new procedures for deciding the future ofcertain cost-ineffective railway lines. Its origins lie in the impossibility of maintaining the present network indefinitelywithout a substantial and continuing increase in provision for investment and subsidy; and the difficulty, under presentProcedures, of making any significant progress on closures, even0f services which at high cost make a trivial contribution tofeting transport needs.   To maintain the existing network^changed would require expenditure over and above present levelsamounting to some  200-250 million by 1&apos;985.   Local decision may show that perhaps only half of that is necessary to maintainadequate public transport.2.The procedures I propose would focus both on making the bestpleating how cost-ineffective lines are to be tackled. Amongs&quot;C0r^i-atiVeS 1 haVe COnsidered the Possibility of an independentUse of expenditure on public transport and on local people judgingieir own priorities.   They are fully consistent with the generalPolicy of securing better local co-ordination.    I do not under-es&quot;legitimate the delicacy of any steps in this direction.    On the other^ti, if no more money is to be found for the railways, theproPosals in the White Paper will simply not be credible withoutMission, with local enquiries if necessary, in effect to settlee size of the railway network and to propose closures.   But thisWould sound too much like the Beeching Report all over again and^0bld leave the present unsatisfactory procedures unchanged.   Weshould get the worst of both worlds.Another possibility would be to prescribe a massive rundownmanpower (over and above the 40,000 reduction by 1981 attesent assumed).   But apart from obvious difficulties while^Ployment remains high, I cannot believe that this solutionuuid be more acceptable, politically and to the trade unions, thany Current proposals for dealing with cost-ineffective lines.-   Shu if i
not4.      My    proposals were accepted on balance by the ministerial group under the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   The White Papermakes it clear that the prior judgement whether a service shouldbe retained as part of the national system or put for localdecision would be for me to make, after appropriate consultationwith my colleagues principally concerned.   Some of my colleagues may wish me to go further even than the White Paper does indefining the national railway network.   To do so would, however,not only prejudge the Board&apos;s detailed examination of local services, which will take some time to complete, but would immediately provoke questions about the future of all services which the definition, many of which may not in the event be pu^forward for local decision.5.   As for reactions to the railway proposals as a whole, theunions will regret the absence of an immediate commitment to ahigher level of investment, will be apprehensive about theconsequences of the local option on rail closures and will deptothe absence of an immediate decision to return FreightlinersRailways Board.   The JNUR and TSSA will probably feel that a fair balance has been struck (whether they say so is another matter)*bearing in mind the action I propose on the road programme and* t iS^heavy lorries; ASLEF will take a less generous view.   The Bri^  ^cRailways Board may also be relieved although cautious in i^s Pustatements.Part II     Other reactions to the White paper.   The October 1974 manifesto committed us, amongst other poi1^5&apos;to &quot;further measures to co-ordinate and integrate transport policy&quot;.   This commitment was reiterated in last year&apos;s jointTUC/Labour party statement &quot;The next 3 years and the problempriorities&quot;.   This document spoke of an &quot;integrated approach ^actively developed&quot;, and in particular, the&quot;careful examinathe role which could be played by a National Transport Planfll11^Authority&quot;.   Certainly we can point in the White Paper to tliemajor steps we have taken towards improved co-ordinationintegration by local authorities.   We are also making some progress towards achieving comparability of investment cri^between the modes on major national projects in order to Preoi    j
waste.   But &quot;integration&quot; is generally assumed to mean more than^this - rather some centrally directed policy which assigns traffic between modes, reduces or eliminates competition and puts therailways ahead of road transport of any kind.   This approach Ihave been unable to accept on grounds of economic efficiency,consumer choice and democratic accountability.7.   On the other hand, we can point to a greater number ofManifesto and other party commitments we have met - to the priority for public transport above the roads programme to meet the needs ofthe under-privileged; to the package of measures to assist rural^reas; to the freedom for local authorities to improve and extendconcessionary fare schemes; and to the emphasis in the white paper on environmental measures, for example in relation to urbantraffic plannig and the heavy lorry.   Much will depend uponPositive efforts (through a campaign of party and public meetings,for example) to put across the mesaage of the White Paper, toe*plain and develop the unfamiliar ideas in it and to show how itcan be used to political advantage.8-   There may be hesitations about giving new statutory powers(particularly those in relation to local railways) to shirecounties, which are predominantly Tory even at the best of times.But the White Paper proposals will compel Tory Councils to face upto their responsibilities for public transport, which under Section2o3 of the 1972 Local Government Act some have found all too easy to dodge.   They will also be required to establish local jointPianning machinery, which will involve the operators and thetr^transport trade unions in policy-making.   Labour will be able both to claim the credit for creating these opportunities and to make abiS issue locally of the extent to which Tory Councils fall short15:1 taking advantage of them.Other reactions may be as follows:-the TUC will approve the emphasised sis given to public transport and the relaxation of our previous line on urban bus fareswhich was referred to in the last Economic Review.   Theywill be mildly disappointed that a National TransportPlanning Author^^s^be^ ^i^ed;&apos; i &apos;zsa
of the  CM will complain, about the holding down of roadsinvestment and the maintenance of subsidies.   They should terelieved at a &quot;managed market&quot; solution, however, and freedom of choice in a mixed economy;the TGV/U will be pleased by the priority given to buses(and the prospect of smaller fare increases), and in parti0^the additional subsidy for rural areas.   They should go alo^with my proposals for lorries, particularly my efforts tocontrol &quot;cowboys&quot;.   They will be concerned that relaxationbus licensing in rural areas should not go too far;freight transport operators should be glad at retaining a competitive position but will continue to grumble at heavieftotaxation of lorries and some of the restraints we proposeput upon them and at cuts in road building;the bus operators will on the other hand welcome improvedlevels of support and prospects of greater certainty;motoring .prganisations will be critical of continuing cutsin road building and restraints, especially parking in to^5They should however welcome the recognition that motoris&apos;1&apos;5are not to be regarded as a privileged minority;the construction industry will regret volubly the continueC*prospect of a low level of road building;environmentalists should welcome the emphasis in the Whi^Paper on proper planning to reduce unnecessary demand fortotransport; the changes in roads policy; and the measures   ^enable local authorities to improve the quality of the ur   *gjenvironment, including facilities for pedestrians and cyc^local authorities should welcome the new scope given to      *although some may be apprehensive of the additional burdeI)responsibility and cost.

INTRODUCTIONA year ago the Government published a consultation document on transport policy. This was the first stage of a comprehensive review, and since then therehas been a process of consultation unparalleled in the making of transport policy. In preparing this White Paper the Government has been anxious to learn the views of everyone involved in the transport industry, of the public and of those who represent the public&apos;s interests.It has been the Governments wish to carry opinion with it as far as possiblein the process of policy-making. It would have been naive to hope for a consensusand this White Paper is properly the responsibility of the Government alone.But no one who has put forward his views should feel that they have not beenfully considered. The Government is very grateful to all those who have contributed to the process of policy-making.The review has clarified the way in which the social and economic changes of the last ten years have altered the pattern of demand for, and generalattitudes to, the provision of transport. This has confirmed the Government inits belief that a major statement of its policy for transport is now opportune.Accordingly, the White Paper sets out the Governments approach to transport policy and some of the specific decisions it has made. It does not seek to repeat the discussion that characterised the consultation document. While it stands and can be read on its own, the consultation document, and particularlyvolume 2, should be referred to for much factual information.While the consultations were proceeding, the Select Committee on nationalised industries undertook their own enquiry into the role of British Rail in public transport. Their report(1) was published at a late stage in the Governmentsconsideration of the policies set out in the White Paper, but references aremade to it at a number of points. The Government is glad to note that theCommittee, after their own extensive enquiry, formed views that were in many respects in line with the Governments own conclusions, for example oninter-city services, on support for and investment in the railways, on the continuing need to improve efficiency, and on the need to enlarge the scope for local decision. In accordance with normal practice, the Government willstudy the report with care and give a detailed reply in due course.Transport in Scotland and Wales forms an integral part of the system forGreat Britain. But in addition these countries have their particular transportproblems and needs. The comments of Scottish and Welsh interests and indi-viduals, both on general policies and on specific matters have all been carefully considered in the preparation of this White Paper and where there are significantdifferences in policies for Scotland and Wales, they are dealt with in theappropriate chapters.The Scotland and Wales Bill proposes a substantial transfer of authority in transport matters to the Assemblies. Their freedom of action within this authority would not be inhibited by the proposals in this White Paper.The White Paper does not cover transport in Northern Ireland.(l) &quot;First Report from the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, Session 1976-77.&quot;
Chapter 1OBJECTIVES1 We measure our lives in many different ways: by the satisfaction of our job&apos;the comfort of our home, the opportunities open to us and our children, ourphysical wellbeing. We are conscious when these advantages are lacking either on our own account or amongst other people. They provide a framework within which to achieve our aspirations.2 In this equation transport is increasingly a factor. We have come to takepersonal mobility and ease of access for granted, in a way quite unknown toprevious generations. Not so long ago, people often lived and worked withina stone&apos;s throw of where they were born, travelling once a year (if they werelucky) for a short family holiday. Most of their demands for food and household goods were conveniently met at the modest corner shop.3 But now, though many people still walk or cycle to work, many travellong distances to their job by road and rail. People with cars often want andexpect to travel further so as to have more choice in where they shop and howand where they spend their leisure. An annual holiday is a high priority andin recent years more and more people have gone abroad. Higher standards ofliving and the rapid growth of consumer spending have transformed the move-ment of all kinds of goods.4 But complaints are familiar and are widely shared. The bus that is full orlate or does not come at all; the train that is crowded or slow or does not runon Sundays; the delays and frustrations of motoring; most recently, the risingcost of all kinds of travel. The heavy lorry brings goods to the High Streetand serves the factory and the farm, but is disliked almost wherever it goes.5 It is not surprising that public attitudes should be inconsistent when facedwith the dilemmas that the growth of transport creates. We are conscious ofthe need for improving safety on the roads but not so happy when it meansrestraint upon ourselves. We are angry about the rise in bus and rail fares butreluctant to pay more in taxes or rates to meet the subsidy bill. We welcomeroad improvements that increase our speed of travel but resent them when theyincrease the flow of traffic through our communities or past our front door.The contribution that good communications can make to industrial growth and rising living standards is important to all of us, but so are the social patternsand the physical environment which they often appear to threaten and some-times do disrupt. We are deeply attached to our railway system but quick toresent suggestions that we should use our own car less. The picture is complex,but the temptation is compelling to look at it in simple terms.6 In practice, this is the position traditionally adopted by the many lobbiesthat bring pressure to bear in the making of transport policy. They campaign and persuade, as they are entitled to, as groups with particular interests of their
own. They are apt to see the future in a single-minded commitment to thesolution that they themselves propose. But most of us have a stake in all trans-port issues. We are pedestrians and we may be cyclists, but we travel from timeto time by bus, coach and rail. Twenty-two million people hold a driving licence,and over half of the households in the country own a private car. People usecars increasingly for all sorts of journeys, and the car brings wider opportunitiesand choice to more people every year: last year over half a million peoplebecame drivers for the first time. But those with a car also have an interestin efficient public transport.7 It is the task of Government to understand these conflicting caonsiderations and, so far as it can, to reconcile them. But there are limits to what any Govern-ment can do. This White Paper sets out broad objectives for transport policyand shows how they can be achieved. It seeks to create the means by which our transport system can best meet the nation&apos;s needs within its resources.But it would be quite disastrous, even if it were possible, for our transport system to be managed in every detail from Westminster and Whitehall. Thereare many links in the chain between the decisions of Government and howpeople experience the consequences of them in their day-to-day lives.8 About a million people are employed in the transport industry, half ofthem in public passenger transport. They all have a responsibility, lesser orgreater, for the public&apos;s experience of it, and for helping to translate theproposals in this White Paper into everyday reality. The co-ordination oftransport policy and the fitting together (or integration) of different modes is often a matter of plain common-sense, managerial judgment and local know-ledge. This most obviously applies to timetables for buses, trains and ferries,and for interchange facilities. Traditional barriers must be broken down,between the public and the private sector, between road and rail, between oneprovider of services and another.9 The principal objectives of transport policy are three. First, to contribute to economic growth and higher national prosperity, particularly throughproviding an efficient service to industry, commerce and agriculture. Second,to meet social needs by securing a reasonable level of personal mobility, inparticular by maintaining public transport for the many people who do nothave the effective choice of travelling by car. Third, to minimise the harmfuleffects, in loss of life and damage to the environment, that are the direct physicalresult of the transport we use. These objectives sometimes run together. more often they do not. Frequently environmental considerations provide a check on outright priority for economic growth and social needs. As for the lasttwo, they compete for attention and priority, nationally and locally.10 The drive for improving industrial performance is at the centre of theGovernments economic strategy. This means that the raw materials that industryrequires and the goods that industry produces must be moved quickly, cheaplyand efficiently to their destinations. In turn, this depends upon industry having a reasonable degree of choice in selecting the form of transport that best meetsits particular needs and upon Government ensuring the necessary investment particularly in roads to the ports and in rail for the movement of bulk freight.
It means also improving the efficiency of transport services, not least those fortravelling to work; and avoiding waste particularly, but not only, becauseresources are limited.11 But the Governments industrial policies have wider purposes involvingconsiderations that are as much social as economic. Continuing emphasis is needed on renewing the industrial and social infrastructure in the regions of high and persistent unemployment. Even where much has been done, aspecial obligation to them remains. The Government is also committed to along-term programme for renewing inner city areas and this plainly has a transport dimension. The regeneration of these areas will mean attentionto the needs of commerce and industry, and public transport in them mustbe responsive to changing patterns of employment.12 The social needs for transport also rank high the needs of people to have access to their work, shops, recreation and the range of activities on whichcivilised society depends. It is the Governments aim to set a framework withinwhich such needs can best be met. Increasingly, people have chosen to use their own transport as ownership of a car has come within their reach, and theincrease will go on. But for many people the need for public transport willremain. In many cities and towns the car could never provide an alternativewithout new roads on a scale that could not be tolerated even if there werethe money to provide them.13 The special needs of elderly people and disabled people cannot be metexclusively either by public or private transport. Many are sufficiently mobileto benefit greatly from a reliable public transport system, if it is accessibleand within their financial means. Others, particularly those whose mobilityis more severely restricted, may have to depend largely or entirely on privatetransport.14 To maintain public transport will require a substantial and continuingcommitment to financial support where the income from fares is not enoughto ensure a reasonable level of services. Inevitably, this commitment cannotbe open-ended: judgments must continue to be made about relative needs and the most effective way of meeting them, whether by bus or rail.15 These objectives of investment in transport to support industrial recoveryand the provision of adequate public transport have both to be met from theresources we can afford. More for one means less for another. In recent years there has been a rapid rise in public expenditure in transport. That growthhas now come to an end. Expenditure planned for the end of this decade willbe much the same as ten years earlier and well below the peak of two yearsago.16 The argument about the right level for transport spending will go on.The Government cannot expect its own view to command uncritical support.But those who wish to see a significant increase in transport expenditure havea duty to say where the additional money should come from. Those who want
to spend more in one area or another of transport must show where, withinthe budget for transport, compensating savings should be found.17 Greater mobility has been bought at a high price in human suffering andmaterial loss, particularly in accidents on the roads. This price is not fixed.People themselves can bring it down. But the Governments responsibility alsois clear. It intends to bring forward legislation to improve road safety, and thedetails of the proposals will be the subject of a separate statement.18 The environmental effects of transport are less tragic, but no less real.Road traffic severs communities and causes noise and pollution, in many places to a degree that is offensive. Over recent years increasingly stringentlimits have been set by regulations on air pollution and noise from vehicles and the Government will continue to work, within the European Communities,on measures to keep these problems within acceptable limits. Much can alsobe done by sensible traffic management to reduce the impact of pollution andnoise on communities. But seeking remedies may itself produce new dilemmas.An environment completely free from traffic could be one without industry orcommerce. The improvement of a road may have adverse as well as beneficialconsequences. Less polluting vehicles are likely to cost more to produce and can be less efficient in their use of energy. The problem, as so often, is how to strike the best balance between desirable objectives.19 The European dimension to transport has brought in new considerations.The development of the common transport policy in the European Communitieshas not made significant progress over recent years. Despite pressure from theEuropean Parliament, the Council of Ministers has not taken decisions on many of the Commission^ proposals. But we must take account of the work done in the Communities on various aspects of transport and of the inter-national obligations involved. The time has come for a reconsideration ofcertain of the objectives of a common transport policy and the UnitedKingdom intends to play a full part in the discussions. It will be our continuedobjective to seek to ensure that decisions made by the Council of ministers are acceptable in terms of our national policy.20 Over all, there is the question of timescale. It would be comforting tobelieve that the principles in this White Paper could set the scene for the nextfifteen or twenty years, perhaps until the end of the century. There is much tobe said for stability to ease planning in the public and private sectors,especially in investment, to give security for those who work in the transport industries and to provide a reliable basis for the choices that people makeabout where to live in relation to their work.21 But for thirty years Governments have looked for permanence in putting forward their successive proposals on transport problems. Often solutions,appropriate in their time, have been overtaken and outdated through changesin the circumstances of transport and in the public view of what transport policy is about.
22 The prospects for the next thirty years are neither certain nor predetermined.We can expect the growth of transport to go on, though how fast will in partdepend on our success in overcoming our economic problems. Changes in thenature and organisation of industry will alter the pattern of demand for freightmovement. In the longer term, the development of electronic technology andcomputers seems bound to affect patterns of travel although how, and with what effects, we cannot be sure. The cost of the resources which transport useswill certainly rise. In particular, energy resources, especially oil, are becomingscarcer and dearer, and the effects have already been felt in the cost of allkinds of transport. The cost of running transport services will increase too astransport workers, on whom they heavily depend, share in rising standards ofliving in future years.23 All these factors will influence and may well force the pace of change.They have implications for government, and also for those planning and operating our transport systems, private and public. They will need to lookwider than their own particular interests, to consider what elements in ourtransport systems are most likely to stand up to change and to avoidunwarranted commitment to plans based just on existing trends. The transport industries have a leading part in this. They can do much to mitigate the effectof rising costs by increasing efficiency and productivity. But that will not initself be enough, and the consumer will only be well served if the industriescan adapt to meet the changing pattern of demand and need.24 Transport will thus serve us best if it can respond to change. As many ofthe lead-times in transport are long, our policies must look well to the future.Research and development must support them. This is a matter not only ofsearching for new and more efficient means of transport; it involves alsofinding ways of using transport resources more efficiently, of making transportsafer and of reducing the pollution, noise and other harmful effects whichtransport has on the environment. Research should explore too the socialneeds which underlie the requirement for transport, and these are now receivinggreater attention. Public and private industry, local government and manyacademic and professional bodies are engaged in research and development in these and related fields; the Department of Transport, with the transport and Road Research Laboratory, has itself an extensive programme of work,much of it in collaboration with these other bodies.25 In many important areas which affect transport, the course and shape of future developments is uncertain. There is particular concern about energy.It is becomong clear that fossil energy, which now provides most of the motivepower for transport, will become increasingly scarce. Already the rate at whichnon-renewable energy resources are being consumed is a cause for concerninternationally as well as in Great Britain. There is particular concern that thedemand for oil products will outstrip supply. In the foreseeable future, theworld will have to find alternatives on a large scale to natural oil as sources of energy. All this raises particularly difficult problems for transport, which is so heavily dependent on oil and consumes over one-fifth of the oil we use.26 The prospect is that a growing scarcity will cause oil prices to rise relative to other prices, and that they could even double by the end of the century.
Uncertain as forecasts of this kind must be, we cannot be sure that the increasein price will not be even higher, or that shortages and disruptions in supply will not arise, further increasing prices, perhaps sharply. We are fortunate inthe reserves of oil in the North Sea; but they are finite, and production fromthe North Sea is expected to decline towards the end of the century. Thisresource must be used to best advantage. Oil saved now will increase thesecurity of supply in later years, for we cannot expect to be insulated fromchanging conditions in the world at large.27 The conservation of energy must be a major national objective and in trans-port we must pursue it by all means that are practical and cost-effective. some people have argued that the future prospect is such that conservation must bean overriding objective, justifying sharp and profound changes throughoutour way of life. In the Governments view, we must plan for a period in whichoil will become scarcer and dearer, with all that implies for the cost and avail-ability of transport. But it would be wrong to assume that we can cope withthe problem only by abandoning the advances in mobility that haveaccompanied the growth of transport in all its forms.28 The effective management of our resources for the greatest benefit of our people will require a continuing exercise of judgment. All forecasts are boundto be provisional and our plans must be constantly revised as prospects change.In transport, the developing prospects for energy must increasingly affectpolicies, planning and research, as well as the whole range of decisions whichpeople take that influence their needs for transport.29 The largest scope for economy is in the use and design of cars, which use60 per cent of the oil consumed in inland transport. Research is being donehere and in many other countries into technical methods of saving fuel. Butthere are ways forward which do not require new technological discoveries.We should expect and promote a general move to more efficient engines asfuel prices rise. Taxation can be a valuable ally in promoting economy in theuse of energy.30 The policies in this White Paper will support the national aims of energyconservation. Public transport is usually, but not always, more efficient inthe use of energy than cars. Both buses and trains with full or average loadshave the advantage particularly for journeys to work in towns and cities.In urban areas the maintenance of efficient public transport and the effectivemanagement of traffic will serve energy as well as social and environmentalaims. But where public transport is lightly used, it often has little or no advantage over the car in saving energy, and the interests of conservation willbe served by making better use of the car for example by car-sharing ratherthan the use of separate cars.31 The prospects for energy, both now and as they may emerge in the future,will be fully reflected in the planning of roads. On all reasonable expectations,the growth of traffic will continue for ten to fifteen years at least, but at as lower rate than was at one time expected. The Governments road planningalready assumes substantial increases in the price of oil, and these assumptionswill be kept continually under review.
32 As oil resources become scarcer, market forces are likely to channelsupplies to transport and other premium uses. But in the longer-term, a shiftto new sources of energy for transport is likely to be required, though we mustbe prepared for increases in the cost of other forms of energy on whichtechnological developments in transport could be based. Possibilities includesynthetic liquid fuel manufactured from coal, of which this country has verylarge resources, and electric vehicles. The prospects underline the importanceof programmes of research and development, involving public and private industry the motor industry perhaps most of all. They are not matters onlyor primarily for research by Government, but Government will undertake orsponsor projects wherever it is necessary to supplement the work done by industry.33 Our policies for transport and energy must be linked also with our planningpolicies so that, together, they reflect our view of how we should protect ourenvironment and how we want our communities to develop. Transport mustfit in with plans for housing, employment and other uses of land, and thepatterns of where people live and work, in conurbations or new towns, innercity areas or estates on the outskirts of towns, or in the country.34 In particular, the plans of authorities, firms and individuals must now have regard to the new realities of transport. In the past, plans have oftenassumed an increasing supply of relatively cheap transport. Housing andemployment have become increasingly separated. Larger hospitals, schools,offices and shops to serve wider areas have meant longer and often moredifficult journeys. The expectations for the longer-term are different now.The building of a general hospital or a new school to serve a large area mayrepresent value for money in terms of direct costs and the standard of provision.But these benefits must be weighed against the transport costs they impose onthe people for whom the facilities are provided.35 For the future therefore, we should aim to decrease our absolute dependence on transport and the length and number of some of our journeys; and to planmore consciously for those who walk as well as those who use mechanisedtransport. There are obvious possibilities here, particularly locally. although there is no general or quick solution by these means and transport of all kindswill remain an essential feature of the activities of people and industry, this isan objective that must be pursued.36 This is the background to the White Paper. It reviews in some detail theproblems of public transport. Its policies are meant to influence the future and not to rest on present trends. The fact remains that, however farsightedand skilful we may be, we cannot foreclose the options that time and circum-stances create. In the years ahead, transport policy must remain flexible and open to revision so that it can match changing realities.
Chapter 2THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT37 The provision of mechanised transport consumes a large amount of our national resources an amount equivalent to no less than one-sixth of ourgross national product. What unifies this massive activity is that it exists simply to enable people to travel and goods to be moved. But needs for transport are very diverse, and so are the means by which they are met. Transport is nota single industry like coal mining, nor a public service like hospitals and schoolswhich are largely provided by Government. The transport resources budget in the annex to this White Paper shows how the money which goes on transport is spent and what it buys. Of the  20 billion of resources which went intotransport last year, less than one-seventh was paid for by central or localgovernment. Most personal travel is by car and most freight movement is bylorry. Day-in and day-out most transport needs are met with very little govern-ment intervention. Nevertheless it is the Government that determines the rules and the framework within which the principal decisions about transport aremade.38 It has been suggested that the Governments main task is to plan and provide to meet demand. New roads would then be built to provide enoughcapacity to eliminate congestion, and public transport would contract to amuch lower level wherever demand has fallen away. But such an approach would take little account of the cost to the community of providing for all the separate private decisions which make up demand. New road-building can bring benefits but it can also cause great social and environmental damage.Unrestricted freedom for the car would undermine public transport even further, leaving those who depend on it even worse off.39 A wholly free market in transport could be brutal. Government has a responsibility not only to balance benefits to individuals against costs to thecommunity, but also to maximise the benefits which the transport system as awhole can provide. Each mode of transport must be judged on the same criteriaand encouraged to do what it can do best in terms of both economic and socialcosts.40 There is an alternative view that Government should make long-termforecasts of the future requirements for transport of different industries andcommunities, and prepare a national plan which would assign to each transportoperator a share of the expected demand. It is part of this approach that a central agency would assess which mode of transport could best carry outparticular tasks and, where it judged it necessary, direct traffic from one modeto another.41 The Government does not believe that centralised national planning of thiskind could work. The nature and size of the demand for transport is constantlychanging as a result of many diverse factors such as the requirements of
industry; people&apos;s needs for travel and their preferences about how to spendtheir time and money; patterns of land use and the cost of transport services.These are the factors which should and will determine the development oftransport, and it is they rather than the requirements of the different modesof transport which should be foremost in national transport planning. Thetransport industries should have the ability to adapt their operations, oftenquite quickly, to changing patterns of demand so as to produce the serviceneeded at the lowest cost. It would be a mistake to try to isolate developments in transport from the influences which bring them about, or to believe thatbureaucratic allocations of traffic would produce satisfactory results in meetingeconomic, social and environmental needs.CENTRAL AND LOCAL RESPONSIBILITIES42 A balanced transport policy must draw on the best elements in planningwhile rejecting impracticable and unacceptable features. The Government will use its powers to provide a rational and consistent framework of policy for planning and consumer choice. Within this framework there is a case for better and more coherent planning for transport at the local level as part ofthe wider planning for the areas concerned and under local democratic control.The Transport Act of 1968 laid the foundations for the better co-ordination oftransport in the large cities outside London, but a further advance is nowneeded.43 Local authorities should have more responsibility for dealing with localtransport problems. Many of the real problems of co-ordination are local.Do the bus and rail timetables match? Are the bus stops well placed? And thecar parks? What is the right balance between the free movement of traffic and provision for public transport?44 The solutions to such problems and the view that people take of themvary greatly between one place and another, even between towns of the samesize. Local authorities are best placed to assess local need and to tap localexperience. They are also democratically accountable, and to give more respon-sibility to them would fit well with the desire for sensible devolution of power from the centre.45 Local authorities already have considerable responsibilities in transport.They also have planning responsibilities. With the more complete set of trans-port powers, covering road, rail, bus, and traffic management, proposedlater in this White Paper, and by working with their neighbouring authorities,they will be able to do a more thorough job. The powers and the responsibilitywill be squarely with them and the electorate will be able to judge how wellthey do.46 But it is for central government to formulate the national policies and touse its powers over the organisation of the transport industries, and the instruments of regulation, finance and taxation to guide transport so that itdoes as efficiently as possible the job that is required of it, having regard always to the balance between economic, social and environmental aims.
47 First, organisation. The transport industries were substantially reorganisedin the Transport Act of 1968 which set up three new nationalised industries the National Bus Company, the Scottish Transport Group and the NationalFreight Corporation and provided for the creation of the Passenger transport authorities and Executives. The Transport (London) Act of 1969 transferredresponsibility for London Transport from central government to the greater london Council. The Government has considered whether further changes in organisation are now needed. It remains the Governments intention thatthere should be an extension of public ownership in road freight transport.But there will be no radical change in the organisation of the existing public sector transport industries. Massive upheavals are costly and they causeuncertainty for management and workers. It is more important in presentcircumstances to give the industries a clearer definition of their task and toestablish closer working relations between them and the elected authoritiesso that their skill and expertise can be applied most effectively to meetingtransport needs. The proposals in this White Paper are intended to do that.48 Second, there is the question of the fairness of competition between rail and road and how these modes meet their costs. Controversy has raged about this ever since the internal combustion engine began to make travel by roadconvenient and fast. Each mode pays for its infrastructure in a different way.The cost of providing and maintaining the railway system is part of the costs of British Railways which receive support from public funds, that is, from taxes and rates. The cost of providing and maintaining the roads falls on central and local government and is part of the total cost of government, which hasto be financed from taxes and rates. Part of this cost is met by specific transporttaxes on road users in the form of fuel and vehicle excise duties. Though thesecontribute to the general revenue and are not hypothecated to transportexpenditure, they also serve as a price system to charge users for the resources which government puts into providing and maintaining the road system,and they cover also the other costs to public funds which arise from the useof the roads, including the cost of police and accidents.49 It is arguable that the taxes on road users should cover not only thesecosts but also the general social costs that the use of roads imposes in various ways on the community, such as the costs of environmental damage, andpollution. The problem is how to measure these costs in anything but an arbitrary way. In general, the calculation of costs is confined to those whichcan be measured objectively. But the existence of social and environmentalcosts, as well as other factors such as the need to encourage efficiency in theuse of fuel, may justify taxes which in total exceed the public costs that canbe measured.50 The transport resources budget shows that road users as a whole paythrough the transport taxes sufficient to cover the whole cost of building and maintaining roads as well as the other public costs attributable to road traffic.Indeed these taxes in 1976-77 provided about  800 million more than theestimated costs associated with use of the roads.51 Though taxes on road users as a whole cover the public costs they cause,not all the main classes of road user meet their share. It is the Governments
aim that they should do so unless there are clear social reasons why the costsshould fall elsewhere. This requires an allocation of costs between differentusers since roads are built for all classes of traffic. If account is taken of as many objective factors as can be measured, goods vehicles as a group willthis year more than meet their public costs, but the heaviest lorries still willnot. The progress being made towards eliminating the deficit is described later in the White Paper.52 Taxation on lorries is thus one of the ways in which the Government can secure its objective that there should be no subsidy from public funds to freighttransport. Whatever method of transport is used, its cost is properly part ofthe cost of the goods moved, and it should be met by the consumer. Subsidiesmake freight operations less efficient, and if there are particular safety orenvironmental objectives to be met, they are usually best achieved directly by regulation of vehicles or traffic.53 For passenger movement, the fairness of comparisons between the waysthat different forms of transport pay for their track is less important. Thoughcar users paid in 1976-77 about  930 million more in transport taxes than their share of road costs, local bus services are not expected to cover their share. The support which British Railways receives from public funds for passenger operations, which amounted in 1976-77 to  359 million, is more thansufficient to cover the cost of providing and maintaining the rail track and itssignalling for passenger traffic. The issue in passenger transport is not so mucha question of fairness between one mode of transport and another, but ratherhow much we can and should spend as a nation on supporting public transport,given all the other strong claims on the public purse, and how that supportcan be used most effectively.SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT54 The need for economy in public expenditure is especially pressing at thepresent time and the Government has already decided that the proportionavailable for transport as a whole should decline to the end of the decade.In public transport, as in the other main public utilities, the Government hasbeen forced to take action to reduce the subsidy bill. The consequential sharpfare rises which have been all the more severe where fares were held downagainst rising costs in the early 1970s have been unpopular with travellers,even though fare increases have generally fallen well short of the amountsneeded to cover the full impact of inflation on costs since 1971.55 The Government is committed to maintaining adequate systems of public transport and this will require substantial and continuing subsidy. But public expenditure will be limited for many years to come and investment to supporteconomic recovery must not be hampered by allowing too high a proportion to be pre-empted. This means that subsidies must be controlled and not open-ended and that the authorities who pay them must have the means of securing that they go where they are most needed.56 Subsidy should be paid only where there is a clear requirement for it tomeet social needs in transport that would not otherwise be met. It is sensible
to pay subsidies to support services where communities need public transportthat would not otherwise exist; or to help people who could not otherwiseafford to use the local services that are running anyway.57 The principle of selectivity is not simple to apply, and much will dependon local circumstances. In some areas, local authorities will judge that it isimportant to preserve bus services for rural communities; in cities, specificsubsidies may be needed for services to link inner areas to job opportunitiesfurther away. But subsidies transfer the cost of a service from the traveller tothe taxpayer or the ratepayer, and the traveller is often a taxpayer or ratepayerhimself. To use subsidies to disguise from people the cost of the services theyare paying for is pointless, and to subsidise richer people at the expense ofpoorer is perverse. Though transport services are used by people of all agesand incomes, and subsidies benefit all who use them, the test of whether a subsidy will help towards a fairer distribution of income is one way in which its value can be judged.58 Another test is that of value for money. It is sometimes argued that subsidies should be paid to public transport to attract travellers out of cars and so reducecongestion on the roads. But this can be a valid reason only where road con-gestion is a severe problem and where it would cost more to tackle it directly by traffic management or parking controls. The evidence is that there are fewplaces where these conditions are met and that subsidies paid for this reasonare, on the whole, misplaced.59 The proposals in this White Paper for the allocation of public expenditure to the end of this decade should provide for sufficient subsidy to sustain public transport. To get the best value, there will need to be strict limits, plannedahead on clear and consistent criteria and expressed as far as possible in firmagreements between the authorities who pay the money and the operatorswho provide the service. With firm arrangements between authorities andoperators, and improving efficiency to match rising costs as the rise in realwages is resumed, it should be possible to keep more stable patterns of service to meet the public&apos;s needs.60 It will take time and effort to give full effect to these principles. In this white Paper, the Government is giving its broad view of the priorities whichwill underlie the allocations made each year in the public expenditure white paper.INVESTMENT61 The upsurge in subsidy since the early years of this decade has been accompanied by sharp cuts in investment. By 1978-79, the amount of public expenditure going into transport will be about the same as in 1971-72. But the composition will be very different. As against a  300 million growth in revenuesubsidies to public transport, there will have been a cut in investment of 230 million^1)O These figures, and those in the remainder of the White Paper are, unless specifically noted,for Great Britain, and at 1976 Survey prices. Those in the transport resources budget arealso for Great Britain, but are at outturn prices.
62 The composition of investment has also changed sharply. Investment in public transport has not been reduced by 1978-79 it will have grown by 170 million to a level 60 per cent above that in 1971-72. But expenditure on road construction will have been cut by  400 million to a level 40 per centlower.63 This shift from investment has not just reflected stringency of funds. Todaythere is nothing like the same urgency as there was ten to fifteen years ago for investment in the long-deferred improvement of the transport infrastructure.The core of a national trunk road and motorway network has largely been builtand important cross-country routes have been improved, though in some parts of the country there are still substantial projects to be undertaken tocomplete basic industrial routes. Large parts of the rail network have beenmodernised. In cities and towns, large investment schemes have been com-pleted on both roads and public transport, but it is now evident that additions to the capacity of the transport systems will not do much to get the urbanbalance right much less than was once believed. Nevertheless, there is still a continuing need for selective investment where the system is plainly inadequate for present needs, and to meet new demand. One instance of new demand isfor roads and for public transport into and inside the inner areas of our cities,where isolation and neglect will otherwise doom their dwindling communitiesto deepening impoverishment or even extinction.64 Only trunk road construction is the direct executive responsibility of centralgovernment. Much transport investment is by the private sector and, even inthe public sector, the primary responsibility is with local government or public transport operators. Although central government will need to consider certainlarge projects, its main task is to lay down the broad national policies, to allocate resources and to settle with the public sector operators the plans andstrategies for their undertakings. It will in this way create conditions in which those directly responsible for detailed decisions can use their judgment to reachsensible solutions which take account of local circumstances and needs andfit in best with strategic plans for the development of each undertaking as awhole. But those who have to take decisions must know by what criteria theywill be judged, and operators must know when their decisions should take into account wider considerations than their own operations and finance. Thisis one reason why comprehensive local transport planning is so important.65 Although it would be neither possible nor desirable to protect programmescompletely from the effects of variations in national economic circumstances,the Government will try to ensure that future investment allocations are morestable than they have been in the recent past. For subsidised industries, the planning of investment and subsidy levels must go together. Their planningmust, however, still be flexible enough to allow for adjustment in the light of changing conditions and performance.66 Investment should go where it brings good returns in economic, social orenvironmental terms. It follows that the proper formulation, appraisal and execution of investment plans is very important. In considering the broadallocations of funds, both central and local government need to have some method of comparing such returns, in economic and social terms, from different
programmes. This means that as far as possible, similar criteria should be usedto appraise all investment programmes and to monitor their results. Thegeneral approach to these issues for nationalised industries was set out in the1967 White Paper(J): its central principle was that investment must be related to prices so that it brought a return similar to the return on investment earned in private industry.67 Much work has been done over the last ten years to develop methods forthe economic appraisal of returns from transport investment^). At present,cost benefit appraisals are applied to roads and urban public transport invest-ment but financial tests are used where they can be applied. It has not beenpossible to develop general rules to make these different techniques directlycomparable. The Government has asked the independent Advisory Committeeon Trunk Road Assessment (the Leitch Committee) to consider the questionof comparability of these assessments in its report which is expected later thisyear.68 The relationship between pricing and investment is particularly important in transport because much transport demand especially for daily travel intowns is sharply peaked. Extra travel at peak times is often very expensivein resources because capacity has to be retained or provided which has little or no use at other times. Extra travel at off-peak times on the other hand oftenuses comparatively few resources and there is often a good case for those whotravel at off-peak times to pay rather less than those who travel in the peak.Many transport operators have introduced schemes of reduced fares toencourage off-peak, rather than peak, travel. The Government welcomes this.The scope for promoting a better balance between peak and off-peak demandmust be taken into account both in designing fares policies and in relatingthem to investment planning.69 Where social grounds for supporting services are weak, management mustdesign fares policies so as to cover costs, and produce an adequate return onplanned investment. It will often be economical to plan for flexible pricing,including reduced fares off-peak, so as to get a more balanced use of the facilities.It is sometimes argued that the Government should go further and discourageinvestment in one mode of transport where there is spare peak capacity on another. But it would be right to do so only if the long-term costs of keepingthat capacity were low, and that is seldom the case.70 Where there are strong social grounds for supporting services by subsidy,investment in peak capacity cannot be expected to show a full commercialreturn, and it will have to be judged in a wider assessment that takes accountof social benefits. But it will still be right that fares policy should reflect the much lower resource costs of off-peak travel, and that investment and farespolicy must be planned together.(x) &quot;Nationalised Industries: A Review of Economic and Financial Objectives&quot; (Cmnd 343 7).The Government intends to publish a new White Paper on the nationalised industrieslater this year in the light of experience since 1967 and of the criticisms expressed in therecent report by the National Economic Development Office.(2) The results of this work are described in volume 2 of the consultation document.
71 The establishment of fully comparable investment criteria is complicated by other practical issues. Much capacity is used for a mixture of traffics and theattribution of costs to particular traffics is in part a matter of judgment.Judgments have also to take account of many other factors, such as environ-mental effects. But none of these problems detract from the need for all thosewho take decisions to seek the best objective criteria for assessing the economic value of their investment plans.72 The preceding paragraphs of this chapter have discussed some of the main considerations which underlie the decisions which the Government has to makeabout the allocation of resources between the different parts of the public sector of transport. In making its decisions the Government has to strike a balance between economic, social and environmental aims and put the resources whichcan be provided for transport to the best use in serving them. In present circum-stances, the Government has decided to continue to give expenditure on public transport priority over new road construction, and to provide, as far as possible,a greater measure of stability in investment for the industries. This is in theGovernments view a necessary priority if essential public transport networksare to be preserved.
Chapter local PLANNING AND CHOICE73 In many important ways the decisive influences on transport are local.Most journeys are local-to work, to shop, to school, to see friends. It is their local systems of travel that people most depend on and complain about whenthings go wrong. The form that transport problems take can differ, oftenradically, from one area to another. There are the problems of congestion andpublic transport in towns and the special problems of inner city areas. Thereis concern about rural areas and in particular the isolation of those withoutcars where public transport has declined or disappeared. Over all, there is thequestion how the money from taxes and rates can best be used to meet localtransport needs.74 The first question for the Government is how to organise matters so that decisions on matters of local rather than national importance are taken at theright level. In the Governments view, the right level for most of these decisionsis the local level and they should be taken by people who are accountablelocally. Local authorities are in the best position to know how people feelabout local transport services, their grievances and their ideas. They shouldhave sufficient resources, within what can be approved nationally for transport,to settle the priorities for their areas; and the powers and procedures involved should be sufficient for decisions to be taken and implemented.75 County councils in England and Wales, and the regional and islands councils in Scotland, should continue to have the prime responsibility for local transportdecisions. County councils should involve district councils, who also have important and related planning and transport powers: regional councils inScotland should involve district councils with such powers. County, regional and islands councils are responsible for the structure plans, which will influence and take account of the future patterns of transport needs and provision, andfor drawing up and implementing their annual Transport Policies and programmes.76 Local authorities are also responsible for a range of services to the com-munity, including education and welfare services, which depend in one way or another on transport and can have an important influence on it. They are able to see that plans for such services take account of the availability and con-venience of transport and that transport services such as school buses are con-sidered along with public transport generally to get the most effective use of resources. They are also able to resolve, with operators, the range of problems for example the siting of bus terminals and the scales of children&apos;s fares which are important to those who use public transport.77 Besides the question of organisation, the Government should give its generalviews on how it believes local policies should develop in the context of national transport policy and indicate how it will assist that development. It must also
decide what total of public expenditure the country can afford for local trans-port. The Governments views on a range of important issues in local transport are contained in this and the following chapters.78 Within this national framework, the Government believes that it shouldbe for locally elected authorities, who are closer to the problems that affecttheir area, to decide what are the needs of their area; what provision theyshould make, within their share of the resources for local transport, towards meeting these needs; and what balance to strike in the conflicts that arise on local transport issues. The Government has decided to build on the foundationsfor local transport laid down in the Transport Act 1968, the transport provisionsof the Local Government Acts 1972 and 1974, and the Local Government(Scotland) Acts 1973 and 1975. These created the framework for the systemof Transport Policies and Programmes which local authorities prepare eachyear and on which central government grants for local transport are based.FINANCE79 Central government assists local authorities in their support of local public transport through the Rate Support Grant and, in England and Wales, throughTransport Supplementary Grant also. A number of criticisms have been madeof the operation of the grant arrangements, and changes have been proposed.But these cannot usefully be considered separately from the general context of financial relations between central and local government which were dealtwith in the Layfield Report on Local Government Finance. The Governmentpublished in May two consultative papers on these matters as they relate toEngland and Wales, and to Scotland. But a number of decisions need to betaken now, particularly on the level of resources to be made available for localtransport. The Governments decisions are set out in the following paragraphs.80 The Government will not reduce the national provision for bus revenuesupport, as had previously been planned. Proposals in the consultation docu-ment on transport policy and in the Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd6721) would have reduced the provision for financial support to local bus services in England and Wales by roughly half by the end of the decade. Thiswould have placed great pressure on local authorities to cut services or toincrease fares sharply. The Government believes that the target previously proposed would have imposed an unacceptable burden on the travelling public.Instead, the provision for bus support will remain for the next few years at thecurrent level of about  150 million. In Scotland no reduction was proposed and the planned provision will continue to cover local authorities&apos; anticipatedexpenditure on this service.81 The Governments powers to pay grant towards the capital cost of newbuses expire in 1980. The Government has consulted widely about the future ofthis grant which has helped to modernise the bus fleet substantially over the last few years. Although there is not sufficient justification for maintaining it at thecurrent level of 50 per cent beyond 1980-81, the grant will still be needed for afurther period to support investment by the bus industry to improve thereliability of services and to equip itself with the new vehicles it will require.
The operating and manufacturing industries need sufficient notice of thefuture of the grant so that ordering patterns and manufacturing schedules arenot disrupted. The Government has therefore decided to maintain the present level of grant to 1980-81; it would then be phased out by 1985.82 The Government provides general help to local transport by refundingthe duty which bus operators pay on fuel used for stage services. Since 1971only services on which the lowest fare is no higher than lip have been able to qualify for the rebate. That limitation does not take account of the rise in fares since 1971. The Government has decided that services with a minimumfare of up to 21p should now qualify for the rebate on fuel duty.83 The increase in the planned level of support for buses should enable localauthorities, working with operators, to secure essential local public transportnetworks without increases in fares so substantial that they would cause hardshipand seriously undermine public transport services and the use people makeof them. But no level of subsidy that could be afforded could be enough toinsulate the levels of fares and services from the effect of increased costs.Choices will continue to have to be made as local needs and the cost and ways of meeting them change. Local authorities will have to be selective about whatservices they should support and, with operators, will need to look continuallyfor the most cost-effective ways of providing a service to the public.84 The public expenditure proposals in this White Paper will also enablenecessary investment in local public transport to continue. The main priority should be to maintain and, where possible, improve the existing facilities.Within plans for public expenditure, there is little prospect for the immediatefuture of major new projects apart from the few, such as the Tyne and Wearmetro, which are already being built. In Scotland the modernisation of the glasgow Underground and the re-opening and electrification of the CentralLow Level railway line in Glasgow currently absorb the bulk of availablefunds for public transport investment.PLANNING AND CO-ORDINATION85 The six metropolitan counties in England, and Strathclyde RegionalCouncil in Scotland, are Passenger Transport Authorities and, together withtheir Executives, already have comprehensive powers in the areas concerned to plan, integrate and develop public transport systems covering both busand local rail services. The Greater London Council has similar powers.These arrangements have proved their value and the Government proposesnot to make change in them. It is for the Executives and the Authorities todecide with the other operators how they can make the most cost-effective use of resources. Provided they give the operators sufficient notice of any changes the Authorities are free to allocate support to bus and rail services soas to meet the transport needs of their areas.86 In the metropolitan areas where subsidiaries of the National Bus company or the Scottish Transport Group provide services as well as the Executives,the Government wants to see closer working arrangements between them and
the Executives, together with greater co-ordination and better planning oftransport services. This may in some cases involve the transfer of servicesand assets by agreement. But the Government is not persuaded that there isa case for any radical reorganisation involving compulsory transfers. Thiswould cause substantial upheaval and it is doubtful whether it would produce a better service to the public than could be secured by effective co-operation,such as already exists through the joint operating agreements which a numberof Executives have concluded with the National Bus Company&apos;s subsidiaries.87 There have been many suggestions that a Passenger Transport authority and Executive should be established in south-east Wales to assume responsi-bility for the future planning and development of the public transport system in that part of the Principality. Some have suggested that such an authority might be created for Wales as a whole. The Secretary of State for Wales has considered these possibilities carefully. In the light of the proposals containedin this White Paper he is not convinced that the creation of a passenger transport Authority in either form would of itself bring any significant advan-tage at the present time. He will however keep these alternatives under review and will ensure that they are among the options open for consideration by the welsh Assembly.88 Outside the metropolitan areas, the responsibilities given to local authoritiesto co-ordinate public transport in their areas, in consultation with bus operatorsand the Railways Board, are more limited and are not well defined. They havebeen interpreted in widely varying ways. Bus services in these areas are, typically,provided by a number of different operators subsidiaries of the NationalBus Company or of the Scottish Transport Group, district or regional councilundertakings and independent operators. Rail services, including those servinglocal needs, are governed by the national Public Service Obligation imposed bythe Secretary of State for Transport and financed from central governmentfunds. There is not, as in the metropolitan areas, any requirement for the contribution these services make to meeting local transport needs to be con-sidered along with that of other forms of transport.89 Public transport faces particularly acute problems in these areas. Highercar ownership and lower housing densities make it more difficult to maintainviable bus services. As people use these services less, the finances of bus operatorshave worsened and services have been withdrawn or reduced. In some areas the reductions have now reached the point where there is little room for further economies short of the withdrawal of whole bus routes. This would have severeconsequences for many people, particularly those who are without regular useof a car, and old and young people. Normal patterns of life in urban areas aswell as outside them depend on adequate public transport and will continue to doso. For many it is the means of travel to work, to school, and of keeping contact with families and friends.90 The more generous financial support for buses outlined above will not initself be enough to maintain the public transport that is needed. In the Govern-menfs view, there needs also to be a clear focus of responsibility outside as wellas in the metropolitan counties for planning transport services and for financing
those unecomonic services which are necessary to meet the social needs of thearea. The responsibility should rest with local authorities, working withoperators.91 The Government therefore intends to introduce legislation to place oncounty councils in England and Wales outside metropolitan areas a require-ment to prepare and publish within a specified period a county public transportplan. This will then form the plan for public transport within the context ofthose counties&apos; annual Transport Policies and Programmes: the plan will berolled forward annually. Similar arrangements for public transport plans willbe considered for Scotland.92 County councils, in taking as elected authorities the final decisions about the plans, will need to work in close co-operation with public transportoperators in drawing them up. The operators will be able to contribute to localauthorities&apos; assessment of needs and propose the best and most cost-effectiveways of meeting them. Authorities and operators should develop joint planningmachinery which can work towards the preparation of a comprehensive public transport plan. The form of this machinery may need to vary from one county toanother: in some cases it will be essential for adjoining counties to have jointarrangements for consultation and planning. The Government would expect the planning machinery to involve representatives of county and district councils(and, as necessary, New Town Development Corporations and National ParkAuthorities); and public transport operators, including the British railways board. The machinery should provide for consultation with the transporttrades unions and for seeking the views of consumer interests, and of localindustry and commerce.93 The plan should set out the policy for public transport in the county for five years ahead; the systems (including less conventional modes) to be supported;and the operators who would run the various elements of it and will be able tocontribute their expertise about transport needs and the best ways of meetingthem. The legislation will also require county councils to enter into bindingarrangements with operators for those services included in the plan which require support. The agreements will need to include the services to be provided,the financial contributions to be made by the county council and the arrange-ments for making them; and break clauses providing the minimum periods of notice for any changes in support. In this way, both operators and authorities will gain much more stability in planning than they have at present, within a realistic view of the finance that can be provided and of the levels of servicesthat it will be possible to support.94 A number of formal agreements have already been made between theNational Bus Company&apos;s subsidiaries and local authorities which containequitable and sound arrangements for financing municipal services within the urban area and the Company&apos;s services running into that area from the sur-rounding countryside. Such agreements enable operators to work alongside eachother to the benefit of the public. The experience gained by authorities who havetaken the initiative in this way under existing powers will be valuable to allcounty councils in applying the new legislation in detail.
LOCAL RAILWAYS95 The railways provide in the main an extensive national transport network.Our geography and our geology determine the sweep of the system the location of our main centres of population and industry, our mineral resources,including oil, our deep water harbours, and our routes of commerce with our partners in the European Communities. The Government rejects any notion of imposing major cuts on this system. A system will be required in any eventwhich provides long distance passenger services, transport for heavy flows ofbulk freight, important commuter services and some other passenger services ofa more local character. Especially among the local services, however, there areothers which carry few passengers at high cost. Judged against the nationalneeds for transport, their new investment must have low priority compared withother parts of the railway system.96 It is only within the framework of local planning for public transport that the issues which arise on some of these local services can be resolved, in the best interests of local communities. Central Government is not well placed to judgewhat local arrangements would meet local needs in the most satisfactory way and the present procedures do not provide adequately for local decision.Whether such rail services provide the best way of meeting local needs should besettled within the local democratic process in close concert with public transportoperators and representatives of user interests, rather than under the presentcomplicated procedures, laid down in 1962, by which eventually each case goesto the Secretary of State for Transport for decision.97 The Government accordingly proposes to provide for the British railways board to identify services which would not be worth retaining unless there were a strong local need for them. The Board would first apply a prima facie test,which would be publicly prescribed, in terms of value for money. It would bebased on a comparison of the financial performance of the service (in terms ofthe costs that would be avoided if the service were withdrawn, in relation to therevenue) with the average financial performance on the railway passengersystem as a whole. Unless the Board judged that the contribution of the service to the wider network justified maintaining it for that reason, they would notifyit to the Secretary of State for Transport.98 The Secretary of State would, after appropriate consultation, then decide whether or not there were in the Governments view overriding reasons for retaining the service as part of the national network. For his decision, he wouldbe answerable to Parliament in the normal way. If he decided to regard theservice as part of the national system, the Government would continue tosupport it and the Board would be required to operate it under the nationalPublic Service Obligation. Otherwise he would under the proposed legislationrequire the county or regional council (or councils where more than one were concerned) to consider whether within the resources, represented by the avoid-able costs of the service less the revenue, the service met local needs for public transport in the best way.99 If the council decided that the railway service, with or without modification,formed an apt and cost-effective part of the pattern of local public transport,
it would be the councils responsibility to enter into a binding agreement with theBoard to provide it. These arrangements would be on similar lines to thosewhich will exist with bus operators under the counties&apos; public transport plans.But if the council decided that the railway service as it stood, or in any modifiedform, was too costly or would for other reasons be an inappropriate means ofproviding public transport needed by the people in the area, it would be for themto make a firm agreement with the bus operators for services which made abetter use of resources, whether along the route followed by the railway or ona different route or pattern of routes more closely related to the needs of thepeople. The local authority would thus be under a positive obligation to findcost-effective ways to meet local transport needs, by whatever mode served thepurpose best, taking full account of the views of operators, unions, representa-tives of consumer interests and the public.100 In order to give full time for consideration, the Secretary of State would berequired to continue the national obligation on the railway to maintain theservice for a defined period of two or three years within which the local authority would reach its decision. Whether the authority decided to support the railservice or to strengthen the pattern of the bus services there would be guaranteedsupport from the Exchequer. In settling the arrangements for this support it willbe necessary on the one hand to avoid any sudden imposition on the localratepayers and on the other to secure that different forms of transport were treated fairly. As part of the new arrangements, Parliament will be asked to repeal the provisions under the Transport Acts of 1962 and 1968 relating tothe closure of rail passenger services, without prejudice to the Secretary ofState&apos;s powers under the Railways Act 1974 to impose on the Board the PublicService Obligation to operate passenger services. The arrangements for safe-guarding, where necessary, the route of disused railway lines will be maintained and, if need be, strengthened, lest for any reason circumstances should change to such an extent in future years that it would be desirable to reintroduce a service.101 The variety of situations to be met in the local planning of public transportthroughout Great Britain will be wide. In some areas local planning will need tocater not only for the needs of local people; there may be, for example, a locallyimportant tourist industry to be assisted by special seasonal services or the exploitation of the transport system itself as an attraction, as in a number of places steam traction or light railways have proved to be. Planning should not involve stereotype decisions, but imagination and ingenuity.102 It is primarily for local authorities and operators to improve the co-ordination of public transport services but the Government for its part will beready to help them. The Highlands and Islands Development Board alreadyproduces a comprehensive timetable covering all means of public transport intheir area. One idea that has been proposed by the Select Committee on nationalised Industries would involve comprehensive local public transporttimetables within the framework of a national timetabling system. A study of asimilar scheme has recently been carried out by the Transport and road research Laboratoiy. The Government will consult local authorities andoperators about the practicability of a more comprehensive system.
103 The new requirement on county councils to draw up public transportplans, enter into binding arrangements with local transport operators andassume responsibility for certain local rail services, together represent a major,practical step towards an integrated policy for public transport. The Govern-ment will initiate early discussions with the local authority associations, operatorsand unions to consult them on the proposed legislation and to set up the planning machinery. It will consult the local authority associations aboutsatisfactory financial arrangements to cover in a fair and equitable way theadditional responsibilities to be placed on local authorities.104 Subject to what is said in the Introduction about Devolution, the proposals in this chapter for strengthening the role of local government in local passenger transport will apply to Scotland though with such differences as may be necessaryto take account of particular Scottish circumstances and conditions. the responsibilities of the county councils in England and Wales are in Scotlandexercised by the nine regional and three islands councils, and district councilshave no transport responsibilities. The regional and islands councils are also the strategic planning authorities and all local transport functions therefore focuson them. There will be early discussion with the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities about the exercise of the transport responsibilities of local author-ities in Scotland in the light of the proposed new legislation.CONCESSIONARY FARES105 Local authority schemes of concessionary fares for elderly, blind and disabled people able to make use of them give direct benefits to people whooften do not have access to a car. And if the schemes are well framed thecommunity gets better use of its public transport.106 The schemes in operation vary widely between areas. Of almost  80 million which local authorities in England and Wales currently spend on concessionaryfares, 70 per cent is spent in Greater London and the metropolitan areas where38 per cent of pensioners live. A national scheme, or at least some nationalstandard, has been advocated as the only certain way to reduce the disparitieswhich many people feel to be unfair.107 One possibility would be a national scheme which would ensure that themoney currently spent on concessions would be spread more evenly over thecountry, but that would mean reducing considerably the benefits people get from the more generous schemes. Another would be a national minimum standard: but unless the minimum were comparatively low, even that couldbe costly perhaps more than twice as expensive as the present arrangements.The extra cost would have to be found from the money available leaving that much less for local authorities&apos; other transport policies. Concessionary fares onbus services are, in many areas the main way of giving elderly, blind and disabled people greater mobility, but they are not the only way. In some places,particularly remote areas where there are few bus services, special services may be a better form of help. The best solution will depend on careful localassessment.
108 Though the Government does not consider that a mandatory nationalconcessionary fares scheme would be appropriate, it believes that local author-ities should now work towards more equitable and consistent arrangements,and that the essence of these should be to help the elderly, blind and disabledpeople who could not otherwise afford to travel by public transport. one reason for the wide differences between areas is the advice which the Govern-ment itself felt obliged to give to local authorities in England and Wales twoyears ago that, in current economic circumstances, they should not introducenew schemes or improve existing ones. That advice will be withdrawn from theearliest practicable date. The reallocation of public expenditure projected in this white Paper provides for local authorities to be spending by the end of the decade an additional  25 million above current levels on improved schemes in areas where the present scale of provision is too low.109 The Government will now consult local authority associations in Englandand Wales, drawing on the recently completed joint study of current practicecommissioned by the Consultative Council on Local Government Finance,with a view to giving general advice on concessionary fare schemes. It will alsoconsult the organisations who represent the interests of elderly, blind and disabled people.110 In Scotland, since the reorganisation of local government in 1975, the regional councils have been engaged upon a reorganisation and rationalisation of the various concessionary fare schemes which they took over from the formerburgh and county authorities. The Government wants this work to continue.111 Transport operators offer reduced fares as a commercial matter withoutreimbursement from public funds. The senior citizens&apos; railcards which are nowwidely used on British Railways are a successful venture of this kind. the opportunities for the bus industry to introduce similar schemes have not been so great, but the National Bus Company is currently undertaking a programmeof experiments to assess the viability of a variety of concessionary offers.112 The Government has considered whether it should lay down a national policy on children&apos;s fares. There is at present a wide variety of arrangements:on some services children travel at half fare below the school leaving age,whereas on others the age may be 14 or the fare may be two-thirds or three-quarters of the full fare. On some services there are at certain times of day noreduced fares for children at all. Such differences, sometimes within a singlearea, cause confusion and complaint. But setting a national standard- fcrexample to require all operators to charge half fare for children of school leaving age or below would generally reduce the revenue from services and,particularly where children form a large proportion of those travelling in peakhours, it could mean that some services would no longer be viable. these considerations tell against a national approach. But locally the arguments for more uniformity are stronger and the Government looks to local authoritiesand operators to examine anomalies and remove them wherever they can.113 There is also the question of the arrangements under which children&apos;sfares to and from school are met by local education authorities. At present,the law provides for children who have not yet reached the school leaving
age and who live three miles and more (two miles for children under eight)from the nearest available school to have their fares paid; assistance for children who travel shorter distances is at the discretion of the local education authority.Proposals under which, instead of some parents paying the full cost and othersnothing, all parents would pay a standard charge for each child&apos;s travel to andfrom school, aroused strong opposition. The Government is continuing con-consultations to see if an acceptable scheme can be devised.LOCAL ROADS114 With greater priority for maintaining public transport, the money availablefor spending on local roads will remain restricted. It is quite clear that therecan be no return to the very high level of road building of the late sixties and early seventies, and certainly not to the large schemes which often disruptedcommunities and town centres. Some road building will continue to be required,however, to support the priority to be given to helping industry and commerce,to serve new developments, to provide links to the national networks, and to complement comprehensive traffic management schemes in towns where thedensity or type of traffic presents particular difficulties. Local authorities will need to review their programmes to make a realistic assessment of the new schemes they can now undertake. One important aim should be to remove asmuch as possible of the planning blight created at a time when larger roadprogrammes were expected.115 Local authorities will also need to find some further reduction in theirspending on road maintenance. Many have already responded to the Govern-menfs request for economies in 1975. But there are still wide variations in standards and expenditure and there is still scope for selective reductions eventhough these would mean a poorer surface on minor roads and accepting a lower standard of maintenance of footpaths. It is, in the Government^ view,reasonable to seek from local authorities an overall reduction of some 5 percent in their road maintenance in the light of their local knowledge of where this can safely be obtained. The national survey of road conditions which began in 1976 will continue so as to preclude the risk of reducing standards too far.In Scotland where winters are in general more severe and prolonged theGovernment recognises that the scope for further reductions in road mainten-ance is more limited.
Chapter transport in towns116 Transport and traffic in towns present difficult problems and choices.They also call for positive and imaginative measures. The many activitiesconcentrated in urban areas must be accessible to people and the economicand social life of cities depends on enormously diverse and complex patterns oftravel and distribution. Yet there is not enough road space in large towns andcities for people to travel as much as they like and how and when they like.This in itself can be one source of grievance. Another is that the intrusion ofdense traffic brings objectionable and sometimes intolerable noise, fumes andvibration.117 There is a need for careful and comprehensive planning and management of urban transport and traffic to get the best balance in each area between the conflicting demands of different sorts of movement cars, lorries, buses, taxis,cycles and pedestrians within a limited physical capacity to accommodatethem, particularly at peak hours. Walking and cycling have to be made saferand the adverse impact which transport can have on the environment reduced.118 The choices that are made will be influenced by and will also help todetermine the kind of town people live in. They are the sort of choices whichare essentially for elected local authorities to make. The Government intends to introduce legislation to remove some of the ministerial controls on localauthorities&apos; use of their powers to manage traffic. It has reviewed the range offurther options which authorities should have to control traffic and parking.119 Whatever the combination of policies adopted in each town, public trans-port will be essential. In London and the South-East, railways have a majorrole and they make a smaller but nevertheless important contribution in other large conurbations. But in most places the dominant form of public transport is and will remain the bus. Buses and trains cannot provide for the whole range of journeys which people make, especially around the edges of towns or betweensuburbs, but they can provide more efficiently than cars and with greatereconomy in energy where the pattern of movement is concentrated for journeysto work and travel in congested central areas. The maintenance of public transport services and the management of traffic to help buses run more quickly and reliably should be a priority in all urban transport planning.120 Comprehensive traffic management to improve the efficiency of urbantransport and make cities more attractive places to live in necessarily involves the control of parking. In most cases, local authorities&apos; existing powers to manage traffic and to regulate the amount and the price of public parkingspace they provide should enable them to achieve the balance they consider necessary between traffic and environmental considerations. In some towns,however, local authorities may not be able to carry out their policies effectivelybecause much public off-street parking is privately owned and not under local
authority control, and many employers private and public have a substantial number of their own parking spaces for the use of their staff.121 Local authorities have powers under planning statutes to enable them, ifthey consider it desirable on planning grounds, to discontinue planning permis-sion for private car parks. They also have powers for compulsory acquisition ofcar parks where the land is needed for redevelopment. In these ways they can take steps to reduce the amount of car parking in particular areas, but only where they are justified on planning grounds.122 The Government has accordingly considered the case for further general legislation to control parking. The Greater London Council already has powers,under the Transport (London) Act 1969, to licence privately operated car parkswhich are open to the public. To confer similar enabling powers on other authorities would widen their range of options to regulate traffic. The Gov l-ment has also considered various methods by which local authorities c( !dcontrol parking space in non-residential premises, following wide consultationslast year. Any scheme would undoubtedly present some administrative difficul-ties and, in particular would require enforcement entailing a new right of entry to non-residential private property. But the Government believes that an effective scheme is practicable.123 Local authorities should have an adequate range of powers to manageand control traffic in the interests of their areas, including the requirements ofindustry and commerce for access and the needs of people, such as shift workers who need to travel by car. The Government now intends to consult localauthorities associations and organisations directly concerned on the form oflegisilation to enable county and regional councils to license privately operatedpublic carparks and, subject to appropriate safeguards, to control privatenon-residential parking in areas where an authority judges that use of theexisting powers would not prove adequate.124 There are also arguments for enabling local authorities, by imposingsupplementary licensing or cordon pricing schemes, to restrict both trafficpassing through areas and traffic intending to stop in them. Two authorities inEngland have formally considered these methods; each rejected them at thetime. Present evidence does not show any general need now for controls of thiskind. But the Government would welcome soundly based studies of the useof these methods and is ready to work on such studies with appropriate localauthorities.125 Traffic management is not only necessary to get the best use from the capacity of the road system and to give priority to public transport; it is also required to make residential and shopping streets safer and more pleasant forpedestrians. People get to a wide range of facilities, whose closeness and varietyis one of the attractions of urban living, simply by walking. About two-fifths of all journeys are made entirely on foot.126 In some places the needs of pedestrians will justify quite radical measuresto exclude traffic altogether from an area or reduce it to the minimum necessaryfor essential access. But smaller well thought out schemes can also make a
great improvement in a neighbourhood. Widening pavements, stopping throughtraffic, providing more crossing facilities at junctions and on busy streets,and giving pedestrians time to cross safely, will all help. There are usually gainsand losses to be weighed. Often it is a matter of significant details. A pedestrianscheme is not much help to elderly or disabled people, for example, if it makesthem walk too far; and banning traffic could mean higher delivery costs to consumers. The scale of these problems, as well as the cost of more ambitiousschemes, can often be very much reduced if requirements for essential accessand the needs of pedestrians are considered from the start of the planning and design of schemes.127 The increasing cost of travel has led more people to think of cycling as acheap and convenient way of getting about, and more would no doubt cycleif conditions were made safer and more pleasant. Completely segregated cycleroutes would be impracticable or far too expensive in most cities, but localauthorities should consider ways of helping cyclists when preparing traffic management schemes. Some local authorities have marked out lightly-usedstreets as cycle routes and more of this could be done when the roads are suitable. More cycle stands in town centres and at or near public transportterminals would also help.128 Altogether, there is scope for many more practical initiatives, and for local authorities generally to take account of both pedestrian and cycle schemes which have been shown to be successful. Local authorities will be asked to iden-tify their proposals for such schemes in their annual transport policies and programmes. The Department of Transport will strengthen its Traffic AdvisoryUnit, whose work covers provision for pedestrians, cyclists as well as traffic management. The Department, with its Regional Offices, will improve itsadvice to local authorities on useful measures and make generally availableexamples of successful schemes. The Department will shortly publish adviceabout planning to help pedestrians. It will also contribute to the cost of selectedexperimental schemes for cyclists, and help to devise and monitor them.LONDON AND SOUTH EAST RAIL SERVICES129 The London commuter services carry about 40 per cent of those travellingdaily to work in central London. Fares on them have risen steeply in the last few years. Since the beginning of 1975 they have increased, on average, by morethan 100 per cent much faster than the general rate of inflation. Higher faresare never welcome and the Government recognises that the suddenness andthe severity of the increases in recent years have caused special problems,particularly for the lower-paid, longer-distance commuter. Many of the mostimportant personal and family decisions about where to live and where towork are made on the basis of expectations about fares, housing costs and personal incomes, and too rapid or unforeseen a movement in any one of these items can have painful consequences.130 One reason for the increases is that fares in the early 1970s were artificiallyheld down, at considerable expense to the taxpayer and against the trend of costs, and since then there has been an inevitable period of catching-up. It
should be possible to avoid this reason for increases in the future. The othermain reason is that cost of operating these labour-intensive services has risenfaster than other costs in the economy. In part, these increased costs have been met by commuters themselves from higher fares. But the rest of the increasein costs has fallen on the taxpayer, through the Government grant for railpassenger services; indeed, the proportion of the costs borne by taxation is nowsubstantially higher than it was five years ago. The only way in which com-muters could be given still further relief from the increased costs of theii services would be to put up taxes or divert funds from other programmes. The Govern-ment has concluded that neither of these courses would be justified.131 The cost of running the commuter services is bound to continue to rise,for example because of the need to renew the track and rolling stock they use.These services are a substantial part of the British Railways Board&apos;s passengeroperations, and they must make their contribution to reducing the call whichthe railways make on public funds. The Government therefore expects theBoard, with the unions, to intensify their efforts to reduce costs in every wayopen to them. Even so fares are bound to rise, but the Government believes that the increases that prove necessary should be phased so that commutershave a period of years in which to adjust to them. The British Railways board are also aware of the need to proceed with care. Moreover, the Governmenthas decided not to impose on the Board a specific financial objective for reducingthe subsidy to the London and South East commuter services, as had been proposed in the consultation document on transport policy. This decision willgive the Board the maximum room for a measured approach to fare increases.And the more successful the Board is in the other parts of its business, the less the burden on the commuters will be.132 The recent report of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries onthe role of British Rail in public transport made a number of recommendationsrelating to fares in the London area. The Government will be considering these and will present its conclusions in due course.133 Besides the effect on individuals, there are the possible wider effects toconsider on traffic congestion and on employment and housing in Londonand the South East region if fare increases have the effect of encouraging somecommuters to work locally or to travel more by car. A great number of changes are taking place continually as people change jobs or move house, and these and many other factors alter travel patterns, house prices and the employment situation in different parts of the South-East region. So far as can be judged atpresent, the effects of fares increases on patterns of settlement and travel will beso gradual and spread over so wide an area that they are unlikely to producetrends which would be damaging to the region&apos;s development. But the Govern-ment believes that changes in the pattern of transport, employment and housingwill need to be closely monitored, in collaboration with transport operators andlocal authorities, to see whether this conclusion remains valid.134 Many commuter services have been improved in recent years by investment in important electrifiction schemes, resignalling and modern coaches. Furtherschemes to improve reliability and comfort are planned. The Government has
considered whether responsibility for planning and financing the commuternetwork and its improvement should be transferred to the Greater london council, perhaps jointly with the county councils in South-East England.As the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries have recognised in their recent report, there is scope for better co-ordination of rail services and facilities in London. The Department of Transport and the Greater London council have recently set up the London Rail Advisory Committee, which they expect to secure practical progress in this field.135 The Government will be considering the Select Committee&apos;s recommenda-tion that the Greater London Council should be designated as passenger transport Authority and the London Transport Executive as Passenger Trans-port Executive for the Greater London area. But its present view is that british railways&apos; commuter network covers far too wide an area and is too closelyintegrated with the rest of the railway system for arrangements modelled on those in the metropolitan counties to be practical, and that the direction of future development lies in closer co-operation between the operating authoritiesand the local authorities whose area they serve rather than in further reorganisa-tion.INNER CITY AREAS136 The Government [has published] its proposals for the inner city areasC1).Transport can contribute to the economic and commercial life of inner citiesby increasing the opportunities of those who live and work there, and traffic management can help to recreate a more attractive environment. Local authori-ties will need increasingly, in preparing their Transport Policies and Programmes,to give priority to suitable transport projects to help the inner city.137 Good public transport is especially important to people who live in innercity areas because fewer of them own cars than elsewhere. But many public transport routes and schedules no longer match the existing patterns of journeysto work by those living or working in the inner areas and the regeneration ofthese areas will require a fresh look at patterns of travel. In some places newcross-town routes will be needed. Other problems arise when the cost of traveldiscourages people in inner areas from taking advantage of new job oppor-tunities. Local authorities will want to consider whether these problems canbe overcome by specific subsidies to particular services.138 Traffic management has also a contribution to make towards improving the environment of inner city areas. It can be used to prevent residential streetsbeing used as &quot;rat runs&quot; or as car and lorry parks and to create safe play streetsfor children who often have few open spaces that are suitable. There is valuealso in a limited amount of new road building provided it is designed on a scale to fit in with the urban environment. Outdated or congested road networkshave contributed to the failure of inner areas to attract new or even to holdexisting employment. The main requirement is likely to be for better local roadlinks, for example to improve access to the factory gate, and to take heavytraffic out of mainly residential areas.0) &quot;Policy for the Inner Cities&quot; (Cmnd      ).
Chapter 5THE RURAL AREAS139 People living in the country face greater problems than many others in getting about, for the population is sparser and distances they may need to travel are longer and have grown more so as public and other services have become more centralised. As a result, a higher proportion over two-thirds of households who live in rural areas own cars and for some a car is a necessitythey can ill afford.140 The wide ownership and use of cars in turn encourages even greatercentralisation of facilities and also makes such bus services as there are even less used and more infrequent. Moreover the greater length of many ruraljourneys multiplies the effect of increases in transport costs to people who live and work there. These are high costs they cannot avoid, whether they travelby car or bus or train.141 One solution is to decrease people&apos;s dependance on transport by bringingmore facilities and services to where they live. More could be done to help insome country areas in this way, but there is a limit to what can be achieved.There will remain a pressing need for public transport, generally by bus, for people without access to a car. These are not only people in households withouta car, but also working mothers or housewives, elderly relatives, teenagers and school children when their family car is in use.142 The maintenance of an effective network of bus services in the country isan important aim of the Governments transport policy. The policies for thebus industry in general apply in particular to rural areas. Bus services needfinance, basic stability, and imaginative development. The government&apos;s policy aims to provide the first two, and to secure the right conditions for thethird.143 Within the expenditure now planned for revenue support for buses, theGovernment intends to increase the annual provision for rural services inEngland and Wales by about  15 million by the end of the decade. Discretionfor local authorities to introduce new concessionary fares schemes will be ofparticular value also to people living in rural areas, where such schemes havebeen less common. These decisions will provide a more favourable financial basis for bus operators, contribute to the maintenance of basic services, and help them to be better used. In Scotland it will be for the regional councils, as now, to direct an appropriate proportion of their bus support payments torural areas.144 The National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group are well placed through their subsidiaries to operate extensive networks of countryservices, and the decision that they should remain as national organisations will secure their role for the future. The public transport plans and the agreements between local authorities and operators should give greater stability to the
network of services as well as keeping it responsive to the needs of the travellingpublic. This framework should also provide a secure base for the imaginativedevelopment of new kinds of service to meet the variety of needs of different areas. Such developments have started in a number of places, but their potentialhas so far hardly been tapped.145 There are many places where so few people want to use an existing public transport service that it does not make sense to attempt to continue to meet their needs by a normal bus service, with professional drivers driving full-sizedbuses on fixed routes with fixed stops. It is unnecessarily expensive to run suchbuses day after day carrying two or three passengers at a time. As a resultsome places have lost, or are in danger of losing, their bus services becausepeople do not use them; others are reduced to, at best, a once-a-week service.Some areas have never had a bus service at all.146 In the resolution of these problems, much must depend on local initiativesand decisions, involving the local community as well as local authorities. Butthey also need central support. This the Government will be providing, apartfrom the increase in financial assistance, in two main ways: by &quot;do-it-yourself&quot;advice and by legislation to adapt the existing bus licensing laws. The licensing system will be modified so as to make it easier for cost-effective local transport arrangements to be introduced, responsive to local needs but without under-mining the established bus industry, which must still provide the main network of services for people living in the country as well as in towns.147 The Governments rural transport experiments starting in two areas inEngland, one in Scotland and one in Wales, are directed to the needs of people in typical rural areas. They concentrate on simple low-cost arrangements that could be repeated elsewhere when the conditions are right. The schemes includeminibuses; post-buses; the use of private cars, authorised to charge fares, toprovide an organised transport service; and shared hire-cars charging eachpassenger separately and giving a feeder service to local centres, longer distancebus services and local rail services. The essence of this approach is to hold downcosts (and so fares) by making fuller and more efficient use of vehicles and services which already exist.148 The experiments will form the basis for &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; advice for thoseorganising transport arrangements in their own areas. They will also provideexperience of how such arrangements can be fitted in with existing public transport services and how established services will be affected. Many of theschemes which are being tried are possible within the framework of existing legislation, which allows scope for flexibility and innovation that has hardlybeen used. But the most appropriate service in a number of the areas studiedis not possible under the present law. A short Bill is now in Parliament whichwill allow for certain relaxations in the present law for licensing public servicevehicles in the areas chosen for experiment.149 It is also clear from the early stages of the experiments that there is already a case for some more general modifications to the licensing law. The Govern-ment will therefore seek an early opportunity to introduce them. The legislation
will apply to the country as a whole, but will be of particular relevance to theproblems of rural areas. These areas have most to gain from helpful changes to the licensing law, and most to lose if such changes are delayed.150 The first change is already on its way. The Government is now consultingon methods of implementing the provisions of the Minibus Bill which has passed all its stages in the House of Commons. This legislation would allow theminibuses used by voluntary bodies and schools to be authorised by a simplifiedsystem of permits in place of the complexities of public service vehicle licensing.151 There is also a need for more community buses such as the NorfolkVillage Bus and the Clwyd Community Bus. These are run by local volunteerdrivers and carry small numbers of people where there are no conventionalbus services. They are similar to the services provided by voluntary bodies,except that they are open to the general public. As they form part of the public transport provision they must remain within the jurisdiction of the traffic commissioners. But within this framework the Government will bring forwardlegislation to provide that, like the minibuses run by voluntary bodies, com-munity buses may in future be exempt from the requirements for vehicle anddriver licences which apply to public service vehicles.152 Safety standards will need to be maintained. Community minibuses willbe subject to the same requirements as minibuses used with permits issued underthe Minibus Bill. There will be no relaxation of the statutory insurance require-ments either for minibuses or for cars. Vehicles must be properly insured forthe purposes for which they are being used, and insurers will be fully consulted on the legislative proposals.153 The Government also proposes to review the simplified licensing procedurebrought in by section 30 of the Transport Act 1968. This procedure has speededthe provision of post-buses in Scotland and similar schemes but its use has beenpatchy. The Government proposes to extend its coverage and seek other ways of enhancing its usefulness.154 In addition, the legislation that the Government will bring forward willremove restrictions which make it illegal for car owners to make a charge whenthey give lifts. These restrictions have probably had little effect, in practice, on private arrangements between neighbours: nor do they assist energy conserva-tion. But they prevent the taking of payment for such organised arrangements as the Women&apos;s Royal Voluntary Service social car schemes. Payments bypassengers could not only help to finance such schemes but also make them more acceptable to people using them.155 It has been suggested that road service licensing should be transferred to county councils, and in Scotland to regional and islands councils, in view oftheir statutory responsibilities for the co-ordination of local transport. Themeasures outlined in chapter 3 recognise these responsibilities, and providefor their further development. The Government proposes also to amend the licensing criteria in section 135 of the Road Traffic Act 1960 so as to provide that the Traffic Commissioners should have regard, in making their decisions,to those authorities&apos; policies and plans for local transport. But particularly as
much of the work of the Traffic Commissioners is concerned with traffic crossingcounty and regional boundaries, overall responsibility for licensing is best left with them as separate and independent bodies.156 The proposals in this chapter will give plenty of scope for local initiativeto help people who live in the country to get about, even if they do not have theuse of a car. The Government has considered the case for further relaxing thepresent bus licensing laws. But when the problem is that the main bus operatorsin most areas are carrying fewer and fewer passengers, it is just not sensible toallow competition to move in and cream off a few more. What is needed is thedevelopment of the system to ensure that, while a network of ordinary bus services is protected, local initiative can meet those local needs which the conventional service cannot provide for at an acceptable cost. A more com-prehensive transport system in rural areas can be achieved only through effective co-ordination and full use of the different forms of transport available, notthrough unrestricted competition.157 The considerations and proposals outlined in this chapter will apply to scotland and Wales where the distances to be covered tend to be greater andthe population more sparse than in the English rural areas. There is a furtherdimension to rural transport in Scotland the needs of the islands. The map atthe back of the White Paper shows the main sea and air services to the Scottishislands. For many years the Government has played a part in developing and maintaining transport services to the Scottish islands, and has contributedfinancial support on both revenue and capital account for shipping and air services. That financial support has increased in recent years to support major improvements in both modes and will continue where necessary, though the justification for it and the level of support must be kept under close scrutiny.158 The programme for converting the conventional shipping services carryingpassengers and cargo to modern vehicle ferry operation is nearly complete onthe major routes. Revenue grants for shipping services were very substantially increased in 1975 to prevent large increases in charges and now total  3-8 million.Discussions are taking place with local authorities about a transfer to localsupport and control of some purely local services but the Government will retain responsibility for grants totalling some  3 million. Government support for shipping services will continue but some increase in charges must be expectedas costs rise.159 The Government has considered the case for a &quot;road equivalent tariff&quot;for Scottish shipping services by which charges would be calculated by referenceto the cost of a similar journey by road, but it cannot accept this suggestion.The indications are that the present revenue grant for MacBrayne servicesalone would need to be doubled to about  7 million with a further substantialaddition for the Northern Isles. Apart from objections to dissociating charges from costs, the Government could not agree in present circumstances to directscarce resources to this purpose.160 In Scotland air services are an important basic means of communicationparticularly to and from the islands. Air services in the Highlands and Islands
were reviewed in 1974-75 on the basis of a report by the Civil AviationAuthorityC/) which made a valuable contribution towards the development ofa policy which recognised the part played by air services in the social andeconomic life of this area.161 As a result of this review air services in Scotland are expected to pay their way, except for socially necessary but non-viable &quot;third level&quot; services. Atpresent, Loganair receive considerable financial support from public funds for a number of their scheduled third level services from either the Secretaryof State for Scotland or the appropriate local authority. The deficit on theoperation by the Civil Aviation Authority of its eight highlands and islandsaerodromes is met by the Secretary of State for Trade through the grant-in-aid to the Authority. In the White Paper &quot;Future Civil Aviation Policy&quot;(2), theGovernment recognised that before the end of 1977-78 steps would be needed to put the financing of these aerodromes on a new basis. At the request of theGovernment, the Civil Aviation Authority and the British Airports authority are at present considering making the ownership and management of theseaerodromes the responsibility of the British Airports Authority.O &quot;Air Transport in the Scottish Highlands and Islands&quot;: Civil Aviation Authority, March1974.(2) Cmnd 6400: HMSO, February 1976.
Chapter 6inter-urban passenger transport162 The last twenty years have seen big improvements in the facilities for inter-urban travel. There has been substantial investment in roads, much of it linkingindustrial centres in the traditionally less prosperous regions. Better roads have cut the time taken by long distance bus and coach services, for some of them byhalf. The main inter-city railway lines have been extensively modernised, withbetter and faster services using modern rolling stock. For example, electrificationof the west coast main line and other improvements have reduced the journeytime from London to Glasgow by a third. More recently, introduction of thehigh speed train the world&apos;s fastest diesel train has significantly reducedjourney times from London to Bristol and to Cardiff. The high speed trainwill begin to operate between London and Edinburgh later this year and theprototpye Advanced Passenger Train is planned to enter service on the routebetween London and Glasgow next year.163 As the maps at the back of this White Paper show, rail and coach togetherprovide an extensive and complementary network of services. The rail networkmainly links the larger centres of population and the network of coach routesprovides a finer mesh of services throughout the country.164 There has also been a great improvement in domestic air services and in thefacilities to serve them including the links to airports by road and public trans-port. Apart from services to meet the special needs of the Scottish highlands and islands, air services are concentrated mainly on a few trunk routes linkingLondon with the principal cities in Scotland and the north of England though there are a number of useful cross-country links, for instance between SouthWales, northern England and Scotland. A major advance on the trunk routeshas been the introduction of the shuttle service to Glasgow and Edinburgh, aswell as to Belfast.165 The volume of inter-urban travel has also been growing as opportunitieshave increased for travel between different parts of the country. The largestincrease has been in travel by car, which has almost doubled over the last tenyears. Longer distance journeys by public transport have also increased byperhaps a third over the same period. Travel by tourists from overseas, parti-cularly on the railways, has grown and provides a substantial income tooperators and to the country as a whole.166 Services have developed to meet a wide range of needs. Rail and air providefast, high-quality services which often suit business travellers better than road.But the railways also offer a wide range of reduced fares for people able to takeadvantage of them and now have a special scheme of lower fares for pensionersas well as some special facilities for disabled travellers. Coach services, whichusually offer cheaper fares, appeal particularly to elderly and young people.
167 It is sometimes suggested that there is too much competition between different public transport operators on longer distance services, and that it iswasteful and inefficient for rail, air and coach services to be serving the samedestinations. There is also some concern that the competition between operatorson quality, frequency and price, with each trying to attract and hold a larger share of the business, means that there is too much investment and more capacity is provided than is needed.168 There is no case for subsidising inter-urban services. Demand for them isbuoyant, and they do not present anything like the same financial problems tooperators as local public transport networks. Neither is there a social case forsubsidy. Although the cost of travel by rail, coach and air has risen in recentyears, that does little more than reflect the higher cost of providing the services.To transfer the cost to the taxpayer would mean less to spend on local servicesthat might not exist without support. It would also inflate the demand for inter-urban travel, and hence the capacity and investment required, beyond aneconomic level.169 The Government welcomes selective fares reductions to encourage travel atoff-peak times. As with most transport systems, the capacity and therefore muchof the cost of inter-urban services is determined by the demand to be met at thepeaks. Lower off-peak fares such as the half-fare recently introduced byBritish Rail on selected trains daily between London and Glasgow-shouldbenefit not only the travelling public but also the operators by smoothing outdemand.170 The terms of competition between operators must be fair. They should eachoperate commercially with revenue meeting the full cost of operation. TheGovernment has agreed this aim with the National Bus Company and theScottish Transport Group. The guidance laid down for the Civil aviation authority requires it, in licensing air services, to ensure that revenue is sufficientin the long term to cover all the costs of the operations, including an adequatereturn on capital.171 The Government considers that within their general business, british railways&apos; inter-city services should pay their way. They must aim to make their full contribution to the costs of providing the service, including a proper shareof the cost of the infrastructure, if they are to justify continuing investment intheir development. The Government expects the Board to secure the full contri-bution from the inter-city services as soon as possible. This will need goodmanagement and imaginative marketing. With improving productivity and lower costs, and services planned to meet demand, the inter-city network willhave an assured future connecting the major centres of population with efficient and competitive services.172 Rail, coach and air should provide a complementary network. The Govern-ment sees no justification for seeking to restrict the choices open to people oftheir method of travel. Provided the terms of competition are fair, if peoplechoose to travel by coach rather than rail or air because lower fares are moreimportant to them than speed, they should not be prevented from doing so.
173 There axe, however, grounds for concern about the co-ordination ofoperators&apos; investment plans in the longer term. Improvements by one operatorto services can oblige others to invest in improvements to theirs, or to cut fares.Though this may benefit the public in the short-term, it can result in there beingtoo much investment in capacity which is more than the public need but whichthey will in one way or another have to pay for.174 The Government has a responsibility to ensure that resources are notwasted in this way and that the plans for developing and operating the differentmodes are looked at together in the light of reasonable expectations for themarket as a whole, within the framework of the policies set out in this white paper for transport by rail and road and of current policy towards domesticair transport. It will shortly set in hand, with the cooperation of the operators,a study of inter-urban public passenger transport. The study will assembleinformation about demand for different qualities and types of transport betweenselected areas over the next two decades, compare the plans of major operatorsfor participating in meeting it, and consider in the light of this the generalneed and scope for better co-ordination of operators&apos; policies on pricing and investment in the interests of better service to the public and the avoidance ofwaste.175 The Government is now completing a wide-ranging review of airportsstrategy, begun after the decision to abandon the Maplin project in 1974.Special attention is being paid to the effects on surrounding areas of possibleincreases in traffic at airports, to the general need for adequate surface access to airports by road and public transport, and to the implications for land use and communications planning in the regions. Consultations with operators,local authorities, amenity groups and others have recently been completed,and proposals will be put before Parliament later this year.
Chapter 7freight176 The demand for freight transport is increasing, as it has been for the lasthundred and fifty years. Though this increase will not go on indefinitely, it willcontinue for as far ahead as we can see to match and support economic growth and to cater for the ever more complex needs of modern life. One factor in this demand is the growth of the country&apos;s national product. Other factors,affecting the pattern as well as the size of demand, are the location of industries and their markets (at home and abroad), and the economics of productionand distribution. The Governments overall policies for encouraging a moreeven spread of economic activity between regions depend on efficient systemsfor moving freight.177 A view widely held is that rail has such decided advantages over the lorrythat more freight should go on the railways and less by road. There are nationalnetworks of railway lines, while much of the road network is unsuitable forthe heavy lorries which may nonetheless use it. Pollution from trains is minimal,and the noise and vibration they cause generally arouse much less complaintthan does the disturbance caused by lorries. A single train can carry as muchfreight as many heavy lorries and, for bulk goods, rail is also on average muchcheaper.178 Rail can undoubtedly offer a highly competitive service on longer haulsand for movement direct from siding to siding. But it offers no real alternativefor most of the goods that now go by road. Without railheads at farms, factories,warehouses and supermarkets, most goods traffic has to start and finish itsjourney by road, and the handling needed to Iranship goods from one mode toanother is bound to make deliveries slower and more expensive for consumers.The fact that most deliveries in towns have to be by road reduces the environ-mental benefits that might otherwise be gained there by shifting much of thepresent road traffic to rail.179 A substantial diversion of freight traffic from road to rail is not thereforeimmediately possible. Nor is it a sensible long-term aim. It could only be achieved by detailed direction of traffic to the railways. But requiring industry to getapproval before moving its goods would hinder its efficiency and mean extra cost to consumers. It would be an unwelcome extension of officialdom.180 The main aims of Government should be to secure that there is fair corn-petition between road and rail and that the railways can not only retain a significant share of freight business but also expand it in line with their capacity to improve the reliability and reduce the unit costs of their services.181 The Government is determined to remove subsidies, direct or indirect,to the movement of freight whether it goes by rail or by lorry. Despite therecent recession, the British Railways Board have successfully driven down the deficit on their freight business which became apparent in 1974. The Govern-ment does not intend to provide further support to rail freight after this year.
182 The Government will maintain the progress it is making to secure that the taxation on lorries covers their share of the public costs of roads, including thecost of policing them and of accidents. In 1976-77, transport taxes on goods vehicles as a whole just fell short of their costs, but taxes on certain of the heaviest lorries fell short by as much as 40 per cent!1). Heavy lorries with fewaxles cause much more wear and tear on roads than those whose weight isspread over a greater number of axles. The tax increases proposed in the 1977Budget, which were higher for heavier lorries, mean that lorries over 13, tonsunladen weight should overall cover their road costs in full this year, and the deficiency for the vehicles which cause the most damage to roads will be sub-stantially reduced. The vehicle excise duty system cannot at present discriminate between vehicles according to the number of axles. But the Government willmodify the system so that it can so discriminate and also relate tax on lorriesto their fully-laden weight instead of, as at present, their unladen weight. Thenecessary changes in vehicle taxation are under way but the process cannot becompleted before 1979.183 There are arguments for charging lorries more than their public costs in recognition of the noise, vibration and pollution they cause. These are amongthe social costs of road traffic discussed in chapter 2. Such costs cannot however be measured in any objective way, and a tax based on them would be nosubstitute for constructive policies to help people who suffer from the impact of lorries on them and their communities. The Government does not proposetherefore to try to devise a special tax. In preference, it will take social and environmental considerations into account, along with other related con-siderations such as the need for fuel economy, in deciding by how much roadtaxation should exceed the directly ascertainable public costs of roads. The taxincreases on heavy lorries in the 1977 Budget are clear evidence of the Govern-menfs intention that all classes of lorry shall eventually meet in full the costsattributed to them.184 The Government wants as much freight to go by rail as can economicallydo so. Where there arc clear environmental benefits it will encourage the maxi-mum transfer to rail by grants under section 8 of the Railways Act 1974. Thesegrants towards the cost of providing private sidings have already switched a significant volume of traffic to rail. The Government will continue to secure themaximum use of these grants. It will extend the initial five years period duringwhich money is available for section 8 grants. No worthwhile scheme will be rejected on the grounds that funds are not available, hocal authorities will be reminded of the need for them to bear in mind, when exercising the range oftheir planning responsibilities, the advantages of promoting direct rail accessfor industrial development.185 The Government is prepared to back rolling five-year programmes of investment in locomotives and modern, air-braked wagons. This decision willenable the British Railways Board to plan the workload in the railway workshopsmore efficiently.0) The Transport Resources Budget (Annex 1) gives details.
186 The competitive position of the railways stands to be improved by otherdevelopments for example, the eventual implementation of the european communities&apos; regulations on drivers&apos; hours. Whatever form these regulationstake, they are bound to have implications for the cost of road haulage although their effect on the distribution of traffic between rail and road is unlikely to beof a major kind.187 But the future of rail freight depends far more on the Board and the railunions than on any set of measures that the Government takes. The prospects forrail freight are excellent provided the railways concentrate on the jobs they dowell. Their ability to carry concentrated bulk flows is unique and, in the rightcircumstances, they can offer a viable service on certain routes even for con-signments which do not by themselves take up a full train load. By developingthis part of their freight business successfully, the railways will be able to carrymore freight and to earn substantial profits for investment to replace assets andto develop other parts of the industry.188 These prospects cannot, however, be secured painlessly. The last vestigesof the common carrier obligation, with its idea that the railways should providea nationwide freight service to every centre of population, would have to be abandoned. Manning practices would have to change. A further reduction in thenumber of jobs on the railway would be inevitable. The choice ultimately rests with the railways whether they continue to provide a traditional freight service which can barely pay its way and is gradually eroded because it cannot earnenough to renew and develop the business; or whether they support a strategywhich involves some radical change but would equip the industry to seek andwin more profitable freight traffic and so generate its own funds on a substantial scale.189 The Government has considered the scope for an overall solution to thefinancial difficulties experienced by the four main public sector organisationsoperating in the parcels and small freight market National Carriers Limited,Roadline, British Rail Express Parcels Service and the Post Office ParcelsServices. It has been suggested that there is wasteful competition between themand that this and other problems could best be tackled by creating one organ-isation covering all parcel services for the public sector. There is no evidence thatsuch a major organisational change, which would be disruptive and damaging to morale, would necessarily improve the financial position of these parts of thepublic sector or give the public a better service. Nevertheless, the Government is determined that public parcels services shall be efficient, financially sound andshould operate without subsidy. The way forward is for each of the operatorsto tackle their own business problems and to eliminate their deficits by whatevermixture of pricing, marketing or cost reduction is most appropriate for them.190 Freight movement is not confined to road and rail. Other modes make asubstantial contribution for particular flows and special needs. Coastal shippingcarries a significant share of traffic in bulk commodities, particularly oil. Itaccounts for over 2 per cent by weight (roughly 15 per cent of tonne kilo-metres) of all goods transported in Great Britain every year, including traffic to and from Northern Ireland. Little of the traffic at present carried on the roadsis suitable for transfer to water, but coastal shipping can be expected to continue
to carry a substantial traffic in bulk freight. New developments, some of whichare only in the early stages of investigation, may enable British coastal shipping to tap the markets served by the great inland waterways of Europe, which play a major part in the distribution of goods within the European Communities.191 Traffic on inland waterways is for the most part an extension of short distance movements by sea to terminals inland. Purely internal traffic hasdiminished over the years, and the Government was unable to approve theproposal to improve the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation because themost exhaustive studies failed to identify traffic likely to use an improved water-way on the scale necessary to produce an adequate return on the investment.Though the scope for transfer of traffic to the waterways is limited, the fact remains that water transport is a relatively efficient user of energy for freightmovement and remains useful on a local scale. The Government will examineproposals for investment on their merits.192 Whatever the success in encouraging the maximum sensible use of other forms of transport, lorries will remain the most important means of movingfreight for the foreseeable future. The Government is therefore anxious that everything possible is done to relieve problems which lorries cause. Mostmeasures to make lorries more acceptable impose extra costs which inevitablyfall on consumers. They need to be carefully researched and considered. But aless noisy, less polluted environment is as much a part of the standard of living in its broadest sense as lower prices in the shops.193 Measures to civilise the heavy lorry are of three kinds: those to controlwhere the lorries go, those to regulate the design and construction of vehicles,and those governing their use and operation.194 The impact of the lorry on peopled lives is least when heavy lorries are on good roads away from residential areas. The priorities for the road programme will give special weight to by-passes and orbital routes to divert lorries and heavytraffic from built-up areas. But the problems caused by heavy lorries in large towns and cities are not usually to be solved by new roads. Most of this trafficstarts or makes a stop within built-up areas, so that there is a limit to what canbe gained by by-passes. Convenient access by lorries is necessary if industry isto be revived in inner city areas. In most places traffic management with minor improvements to roads and junctions can provide sufficient road capacity and keep residential streets reasonably free from lorries. In some urban areas newroads may be required to provide more suitable routes. But these are likely tobe the exception and they will have to be carefully designed to fit into the urbanscene.195 The Government has consulted widely about various proposals for anational system of lorry routes. The consultations have shown that heavy lorriesgenerally use the better routes and that there are serious environmental objec-tions to encouraging lorries to use roads which are not adequate for them. TheGovernment has concluded that a national system of roads specifically designated-nated as lorry routes will not be a practical proposition for some time. but where there is a suitable alternative route, local authorities should make use oftheir traffic regulation powers to make orders to control heavy lorry traffic.
196 Traffic regulations are often most effective when they are associated with modifications to the local roads to make them self-enforcing for exampleby cul-de-sacs formed by short lengths of streets for pedestrians only. Butindustry and commerce must have reasonably convenient access. Local author-ities therefore, will need to seek a sensible and practical balance betweenefficiency, environmental improvement and the interests of those who will beaffected by re-routed traffic. Recent examples of traffic regulation orders whichhave led to considerable environmental gain include an order restricting themovement of vehicles over 3 tons to &quot;access only&quot; within a small town andanother restricting heavy goods vehicles to &quot;access only&quot; in a town centre, withother heavy goods vehicles and coaches diverted to the peripheral roads.197 The Government will continue to support research into more efficientdistribution systems. Several large retailers have already set up consolidationdepots where their goods are collected, sorted into consignments for individualstores, and stacked on standard wheeled pallets. One firm reports that, as aresult of such changes, the number of lorries delivering food to a medium sizestore has been reduced from 120 to 20 per week, and vehicle unloading timereduced from over two hours to about twenty minutes. Although larger lorriesare used, on balance this system must be better for the environment, as well asbeing more efficient. The Governments research programme will seek toencourage developments and practical experiments of this kind as well as evalu-ating the effects of possible restrictive measures on lorries.198 Improving the standards of the vehicle itself, to make it safer and to reducenoise and pollution is a continuous task. In the European Communities, theGovernment has played a leading role in securing the adoption of a directiveentailing the application of reduced limits for noise. The Government is alsosponsoring a programme of research and development designed to produce amuch quieter heavy lorry. It is already feasible to develop lorries about as quietas present day cars. But costs are higher and urgent studies are now being under-taken to show whether such quiet lorries can be mass produced and serviced atan acceptable price. If these prove successful the Government will encourage the manufacturers to include much quieter performance as a feature of &quot;their futurerange of models. Lorry design will also be improved by regulations to be madein the next year to require higher standards of braking and reduce the risk ofjack-knifing. More effective arrangements are being sought for controllingemissions of diesel smoke.199 The Council of Ministers has asked the Commission of the european communities to draw up the details of a scheme in an attempt to resolve the differences between individual Member States on the weights and dimensions of heavy lorries. These proposals would broadly involve the harmonisation of maximum permitted vehicle weight at 40 tonnes distributed over 5 axles. TheGovernment will consider very carefully all the economic and environmentalimplications of such a change but will not agree to any increase in the limits nowin force in this country until it is fully satisfied that this would be consistent with the needs of safety and the environment.200 Most operators and drivers of lorries are skilful and competent, to theircredit and that of the Road Transport Industry Training Board which has a
fine record of successful pioneering in training methods. But there are exceptionsand the Government will continue to support the effort to raise and maintainstandards throughout the industry. New regulations to meet the requirementsof the Directive of the European Communities on Admission to theOccupation of Road Haulage Operator will demand higher standards of thosewishing to set up as hauliers. There have now been several years&apos; experience ofthe new operators&apos; licensing system introduced by the Transport Act of 1968.The time has come to review it, to decide how the system might best be tightenedup to improve the quality and efficiency of the industry and to eliminate the&quot;cowboy&quot; operator. This investigation will also consider the present entryrequirements and other questions, for example, whether it is right to apply the same licensing regime to all vehicles for 3-  tonnes upwards. Examinationof practical aspects of the system will also include the adequacy of the enforce-ment effort by various agencies the Department of Transport, the police andlocal authorities.201 Meanwhile the Government will seek an early opportunity to introduce legislation to strengthen the law dealing with dangerous offences such as over-loading and inadequate maintenance of lorries. This will provide for more effective procedures for spot-checking of vehicles and for ensuring that defectsare put right. Powers will be taken to increase the limit of one mile beyond whichlorries cannot at present be diverted to testing stations or weighbridges withoutpayment of compensation.202 The carriage of dangerous goods presents special problems and causesspecial concern. Everything possible must be done to reduce the risk of accidentsand to ensure that any incidents that do occur involving hazardous goods are dealt with quickly and effectively with minimum risk to the public. Mosttraffic in this category is already covered by statutory regulations in one form or another. But there is need for a comprehensive and up-to-date approach and the Health and Safety Commission are preparing new regulations con-trolling all aspects of the packaging and transport of dangerous goods. Con-consultations have already begun on regulations which will cover the marking of road tankers carrying dangerous goods with specially coded information toenable the emergency services to deal quickly with any leakage or spilling.203 The Government is also considering the introduclii n of special supple-mentary licences for operators of goods vehicles carrying hazardous materials.To obtain such licences operators would be required to demonstrate that theyare fully qualified in this specialist field of transport and that their drivers aretrained to handle emergencies.
Chapter 8THE PUBLIC SECTOR204 Earlier chapters of this White Paper describe the Governmenfs conclusions on the general objectives of transport policy, improved means to achieve themand the organisational and other changes which it wishes to see. The starting point must be an assessment of people&apos;s needs and wants. But there must alsobe the right relationship between central and local government on the onehand, and the transport industries on the other, to ensure that these needsare met with efficiency and economy, and that the interests and well being ofthe million people who work in the transport industries are properly safeguarded.205 Particular care must be taken with the relationship between central govern-ment and the major nationalised transport industries. The industries need a clear statement of objectives and as much stability for planning as can be given.But stability must be based on realism. The Government will not promise astability which it may not be able to secure; and where the future depends onthe efforts of the industries themselves, that must be made plain.206 A full statement of the Governmenfs view on the right relationship between government and nationalised industries will follow later in the year after it has reached final conclusions on the recommendations in the report by the national economic Development Office.(2) The Government is discussing with the unions and the industries the best way to implement industrial democracy in the publicenterprises.207 In the meantime, the Government recognises that the transport industriesrequire a better definition of their part in meeting transport needs within the framework of policies set out in this White Paper. It will work closely with theindustries management and unions to evolve, in a form which can fit aptlyinto the work of management, objectives for the industries and improvedmethods of achieving them. This is the best way to give them the right oppor-tunities to do their job efficiently.208 The presentation to the public of the accounts of the industries is animportant matter. When financial discipline is exerted by limiting the amountof cash which the industries can use in addition to their earnings in fares and charges, and by setting objectives for the business in terms of rates of return on capital, the success of their efforts within these disciplines should be plainlydisplayed. So too should the extent to which they have provided for their capitalexpenditure from funds which they have generated from within their business.But other features of the figures may need to be emphasised so that there canbe broader public understanding. For example, it has not been widely recognisedthat the support to the British Railways Board for discharging the Public(*) &quot;A Study of UK Nationalised Industries: Their role in the economy and control in thefuture&quot; (Cmnd.        ): HMSO, November 1976.
Service Obligation by their passenger services has been on a scale equivalent to meeting from public funds the cost of maintaining, operating and renewing thetrack and signalling for those services.209 This chapter summarises the Governments proposals and plans for themain surface transport industries as a basis for their planning. In developingthese plans, the Government is determined to build on the greater trust and confidence with management and unions which has been created during the consultations leading to this White Paper. It will involve them fully in thefurther development of policy and consideration of their role in it.THE BRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD210 There is no question of the national transport system being without a railway. There are tasks which no other form of transport can do as well as therailways can do them, or do them on the scale required. One of the centralissues of transport policy in every major country is to define the tasks whichthe railways must undertake and the service required of them.211 Earlier chapters have set out these main tasks for the railways:(a) to continue as the major public transport carrier of inter-city passengertravel on a network of services connecting all the major centres of population;to continue and develop its function, which is essential to the industrialstrategy, in carrying large flows of freight from siding to siding,especially heavy flows of bulk traffic such as coal and ores;to continue as a major carrier of people to and from work withinLondon&apos;s vast area of work places and dormitories;to continue to provide under the Public Service Obligation and where they are judged locally to be the right way to meet local needs,local stopping services in many parts of the country; and to providealso those services which are required under agreements with the passenger Transport Executives within systems of public transport in the conurbations they serve.212 The Board has further important tasks. There is a large world market for railway equipment. The Board is determined to compete, in partnership with the private sector, to win increasing export orders for Britain. Hardwareis marketed through the joint company BRE-Metro, and the Board&apos;s subsidiaryTransmark is developing the sale of railways expertise. The major companies in both the public and private sectors, including British Rail Engineering, havecombined to set up the British Railway Industries Export Group. The recentachievement by the Board, in conjunction with the private sector, in securingfrom Kenya a large order for wagons and shunting locomotives is a successfu 1start to this effort.213 There are also the Board&apos;s other subsidiaries, principally in shipping andhotels. The Board has been considering how to improve the returns from these(c)id)
operations. If there are obstacles to a genuinely profitable future for them,the Government will consider with the Board what practicable means thereare for overcoming or removing them.214 There has been a national decision to maintain a national railway. TheGovernment reaffirms that decision. The Board is obliged to provide a passenger service which costs more than the revenue which it can earn, and this experience is common to all countries which operate large passenger railway systems.The obligation can only be met if public funds supplement earnings from fares.But support from public funds should be directed not only towards meetingneeds but also towards adapting the system to changing needs so that it willmeet them more efficiently. Support should be provided in such a way thatthere is a discipline upon the management to make the best use of it, lookingnot only to their present situation but to the future as well.215 The recent report of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industriesmade a number of recommendations for action by the Government and theBoard (and some for action by other bodies). They will be carefully considered in the implementation of the decisions which will follow this White Paper.216 Manpower is a large element in the costs of railways. Those who work onthe railways, as in public transport generally, should be able to expect to share in general improvements in living standards as others can in other jobs, providedthat they play their part in securing the increases in efficiency which alone can make those improvements possible. Over the years, notable improvements in productivity have been achieved, and the unions have been constructive in negotiating solutions to manning problems There must be continuing improve-ments in productivity and efficiency. There is no other way to secure the futureof the railways.217 A railway system and its rolling stock have to be continuously renewed andmodernised to safeguard the future of the business in the conditions oftomorrow. The Government recognise that the Boanfs problem is made moredifficult by constraints which operate in the short term. A business with a turn-over of  1-4 billion and a workforce of 180,000 people is exposed to fluctuations in the national economy, in the amount of public expenditure which can be afforded and in the national labour market from which it cannot be insulated.Government, management and unions have to work together within the con-straints of the short term in order to preserve and concentrate on the mostpromising opportunities for the railways in the longer term.218 A great deal of investment will continue to be needed in order to renew and develop the railway to discharge its future tasks. High speed trains are being built for the east coast services to Newcastle and Edinburgh, and the Govern-ment has recently authorised the trains to be built to this design for the west ofEngland service to Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance. The London commuterservices also need investment. Last year the Great Northern inner suburbanelectrification was completed, and the Government authorised the electrificationof the Bedford-St. Pancras line. Several major resignalling schemes, such as theone covering the London Bridge services, have made services much more
reliable, and a similar new signalling system will bring comparable benefitsat Victoria. The Government has recently authorised 250 new coaches to be built for the Southern Region, the first new stock for the inner suburban routesfor many years.219 The Board and the unions have expressed to the Government their strongly held view that if the total of investment in the railways is not before long allowedto rise above its present level the consequences for the system will be serious.Much of the investment has to go into renewing the railway, but the choice of projects should also be made with the future needs of the railway firmly in mind.These should be choices for the management, with the unions playing their part. No one can now say what provision for expenditure on transport theeconomic conditions of the country will make possible in the 1980s, but theGovernment hopes that the developing prospects will justify the case for some increase in railway investment as the plans for public expenditure are rolledforward.220 Meanwhile to increase the Boanfs freedom of action in planning and running their business, and give a greater incentive to them, with the unions,to make the best use of the assets, the Government proposes to introduce a newspecial replacement allowance for the renewal of the assets of the passengerbusiness. It will replace loans and be a step towards a form of current costaccounting for the railways. This will in due course enable the Government toset the Board&apos;s target for Exchequer finance for the passenger business in termsof a single figure covering both revenue support and renewal. The Board willbe free to manage the business within the target, and the more efficient theirperformance, the more resources will be available for investment.221 In addition, the Government will agree with the Board new rolling pro-grammes for building freight locomotives and freight wagons, and it willextend them to other suitable types of investment. These programmes will lookseveral years ahead and will be rolled forward each year. The approval for new stock for the Southern Region secures a flow of such work for the next fouryears. In these ways, the Board will have a more stable basis for planning itsinvestment, and the railway workshops will be able to plan their productionmore efficiently.222 At the end of last year the Secretary of State for Transport, in consultationwith the Chairman, enlarged the British Railways Board and changed its form.The Board is now strongly executive and, at the same time, it commandsexperience and expertise which is wider than ever. It should be well equipped to lead the industry through the necessary changes in the next few years. Its mem-bers have a notable record of success, in co-operation with the unions, incontaining the requirement for Exchequer support for the passenger business andin reducing very rapidly the deficit which emerged on the freight business in thelast two or three years. Costs have been reduced and, in the face of strongcompetition, earnings have been increased. This is the right path for the future.223 The Government must now set the Board two broad financial objectives.The first is to contain, and then to reduce, subsidy to the revenue account for
the operation of passenger services. Legislation will be introduced to providefor the necessary continuing Exchequer support to the passenger business. Thesecond objective is to eliminate any continuing requirement beyond this year for support to the other railway business. The freight and parcels business must,as the 1974 Railways Act intended, cover all the costs, including track costs,specifically attributable to carriage of freight.224 In the next few years, the Board will need to pursue vigorously measures for increasing efficiency and reducing costs, in continued consultation with theunions. The British Rail Joint Consultative Committee, which the Board hasset up with the co-operation of the unions, provides the forum. But the targetswhich will need to be set for the different businesses will be demanding. For the freight and parcels business, the Secretary of State will expect the Board to propose and establish with his approval annual targets for a period of yearsstarting in 1978, in the light of its examination of commercial opportunities forthese businesses. Arrangements will need to be settled and brought into oper-ation for the coming year for setting targets for the contributions from thedifferent sectors of the passenger business, so that management will be able to measure progress. In due course these targets will be related to an &quot;avoidable&quot;costing base, and the Board will be asked to propose a timetable for achieving this. It will also need to be ready to act promptly under the new arrangements proposed in chapter 3 as soon as criteria for reviewing local services have been set by the Government.225 This White Paper has set out within the Governmenfs transport policy a major role for the railways and their prime financial targets. The government&apos;s decision on the support that can be afforded for the railways reflects the high priority it accords to the need for public transport. It has set out the tasks forthe railways, has provided as much stability as the Government can secure, andhas pointed to the main areas where change must be accepted by all concerned.It has thus marked out for the Board and the unions the framework withinwhich they must work together to serve the public and to build the future of therailways, and has set the challenging targets to be achieved.THE BUS INDUSTRY226 The National Bus Company&apos;s subsidiaries operate over a third of all busand coach mileage in England and Wales, about half of all stage carriage busmileage and about 90 per cent of rural services. A substantial share of busoperations is in the hands of the London Transport Executive, the passenger transport Executives and the municipal operators. Private operators run some stage services and more of the coach routes. In Scotland, the nationalised busundertaking is the Scottish Transport Group, which also provides shipping andother services: it is dealt with in the next section of this chapter. Together, these undertakings form an extensive public transport system where the services ofthe various operators complement each other within a framework of relation-ships with local and central government.227 The decisions taken on the levels of bus support, concessionary fares, newbus grant and fuel duty rebate together with the proposals for local public transport planning outlined in earlier chapters should provide a more stable
framework within which the industry can work. Bus operators should in futurehave the firm agreements they need with local authorities about the futurepatterns of services and financial support, so that planning can proceed onagreed assumptions and so that operators have sufficient time to make any necessary adjustments.228 The partnership between local authorities and operators depends on con-fidence and openness. County councils and operators will need to considertogether policies on service levels, patterns of routes and operations, and fares.Bus operators will need to supply information on costs, fares, and corporateplans. Counties in turn will need to assess with operators the impact of possibletraffic management schemes and of relevant planning proposals which will affect the provision or efficiency of bus operations. Counties will also need to assess critically with operators the room for improved efficiency and to satisfy themselves that cost and revenue information supplied fully reveals the financialposition of different operators and provides a fair basis for comparison betweenthem.229 The National Bus Company&apos;s statutory objective is to break even, takingone year with another. In achieving it, it has met the obligation to service itscommencing capital debt. That debt represents the value of the assets which theCompany inherited when it was set up. Most of the debt is still subject to a very favourable interest rate of under 5 per cent per year, but the Company is requiredto repay it by instalments. In practice it refinances the instalments at currentinterest rates which are much higher. Even so, the interest payable in 1976 onthe commencing capital debt was less than 2 per cent of the Company&apos;s total costs.230 This is one respect in which the Company operates under different condi-tions from municipal bus undertakings. As a result there are often differences between its fares and those of other undertakings over routes which they bothserve, so that there does not appear to be a properly co-ordinated fares stnicture.Few things irritate people who are using public transport more than evidencethat its operation is unco-ordinated. These differences may be due to someextent to the different financial disciplines under which the National bus company and municipal undertakings operate. The Company has to complywith normal commercial practice in the provision it makes for the replacement of assets, for pension liabilities and for other costs. Municipal bus tindertakingson the other hand follow the accounting procedures of local government andsome of their costs may not be brought out because they are borne direct fromthe rate fund. The Government proposes to explore the significance of these factors with the various interests concerned. More uniform arrangements would assist county councils in considering the services they intend to supportunder the arrangements outlined in chapter 3.231 Bus operators can run more efficiently by making better use of their assets.Public authorities of all kinds should bear in mind the contribution whichcontract services for school transport and many other purposes can make tothe overheads of stage carriage operators. Such work can help to maintainservices which might otherwise be withdrawn and reduce the requirement for direct revenue support.
232 The proposals in this White Paper will give the bus industry an assuredfuture as the main provider of local public transport services countrywidecomplementing the railways in their national role and where they provideessential local services. The White Paper has outlined the new relationship with local authorities which will be the framework for the assessment of need,and for planning and finance. It has proposed also changes in the bus licensingarrangements to allow local communities to take new initiatives, particularlyin rural areas, while not undermining the fabric of services which only theindustry can provide. But the future will also depend on the success of theindustry management and unions in exploiting imaginatively and to thefull its flexibility of operations, in securing continuing improvements in produc-tivity and in adapting to changing public needs.THE SCOTTISH TRANSPORT GROUP233 Outside the four cities the Scottish Transport Group provides all but a verysmall proportion of stage carriage services in Scotland, together with a network of express services including the very successful Scotland-to-London services.Bus services of all kinds accounted for 85 per cent of the Group&apos;s turnover in1976; of the rest 13 per cent came from shipping services the Group being the major operator on the west coast and the remaining 2 per cent from hotels,travel agencies and other minor ancillary activities.   Issues relating to theGroup&apos;s shipping services are discussed in chapter 5. The Group&apos;s bus services,although on the whole they are encountering less financial difficulty than services in England and Wales, received support from the regional councils of  3-9million in 1975 and  5-3 million in 1976. Fortunately the decline in passengernumbers eased in the second half of 1976 and this, combined with the economiesalready achieved or proposed, has enabled the Group to reduce its call on the regional councils to  2-8 million for 1977. The arrangements for paying thesegrants, and monitoring progress, have been considered by a working partyconvened by the Scottish Office, with representatives of the Convention of scottish Local Authorities and of the Group; it is intended that this working party should have further meetings, as prove necessary.234 For the immediate future, the organisational basis of the Group&apos;s bus services is likely to remain as it is. There will be a continuing need to adjustservices, manpower levels and the size of the bus fleet to meet changes in demand to secure all possible economies in those areas where progress has beenslower than elsewhere. The Group has already withdrawn from bus operation in the islands; and there are indications that in mainland rural areas also some services might be more economically handled by smaller firms able to make more flexible use of their resources.235 Over the eight full years of its existence, the Group&apos;s deficit after meetingall charges including interest is only  1 million on a total turnover of  418million including grants between 1969 and 1976. This result is commendable,particularly given the difficulties which the surface transport industries havefaced during this period. The Group started in 1976 to repay its commencingcapital debt, which represents the capital value of the assets which the Grouptook over when it was set up in 1969; a further instalment was repaid this year,and the Government considers that repayment should continue as planned.
THE NATIONAL FREIGHT CORPORATION236 The National Freight Corporation controls some 50 operating companies which together operate 21,000 vehicles and employ 42,000 staff-and overallrepresents about 4 per cent of the freight transport industry. All these companies are in direct competition with private sector hauliers.237 When the Corporation was set up in 1969, it inherited a number of severebusiness problems. The most difficult was presented by National CarriersLimited the former sundries and small freight division of the British railways board. Parliament recognised that problem by authorising grants of up to 60 million over five years to cover the inevitable deficits while the business was put on a sound commercial basis. Good progress was made in the early years; so much so that only  43 million of the authorised grant was taken up,and in 1973 the deficit had been reduced to  4 million. It seemed then that a viable future was assured. But the recession in 1974 caused traffic to fall muchfaster than resources could be reduced, and the deficit increased again. Mean-while the rest of the business had been reasonably healthy. But, in 1975, thedeepening recession forced some other subsidiaries into deficit also and the overall loss for the Corporation was  31 million. It was against this backgroundthat, in January 1976, the Government decided that the Corporation requiredtemporary grant support to meet its obligations. In 1976, grant amounted to 22 million, and up to a further  25 million may be needed this year.238 The Corporation has tackled its problems with vigour. Trading results were much improved in 1976 and the improvement continues. At the sametime it has been looking, in consultation with the Department and with the help of consultants, for a longer term plan for the business aimed at a stable and profitable future. But even on the most optimistic view of future tradingresults it is clear that the problems of National Carriers and to a lesser extentof freight liners make it impossible for the Corporation to become viable onthe basis of its present capital structure. The Government will therefore introduce legislation to change the financial structure of the Corporation so as to removesome of the burdens of the past. A detailed statement of the proposed changes will be published before legislation is introduced. Once the new structure hasbeen set up, the Corporation will be expected to pay its way without con-tinuing financial help from the Government.239 It has been argued that control of freight liners should be transferred fromthe Corporation back to the British Railways Board. There are powerful argu-ments both in favour of that course and against it. Whatever is finally decided,the first task is to carry through the financial reconstruction of the Corporation^existing business. In doing so the Government will consider the arguments in favour of the Corporation remaining as a major operator of both road and rail transport and, on the other hand, the case for joining control of Freightlinerswith that of the rail freight business. A final decision will be announced as partof the statement on the Corporation^ future financial structure.240 After reconstruction, the Corporation must produce a reasonable return on the taxpayers investment. Like the rest of the industry, the Corporationfaces short-term business problems. But management and staff must overcomethose problems together to produce a thriving public sector. Once that has been achieved it can again begin to think of expanding.
THE BRITISH WATERWAYS BOARD241 The Government has recognised in chapter 7 the contribution that inland waterways owned and managed by the British Waterways Board have made and will continue to make in the carriage of bulk freight. Since the Board&apos;swaterways are used extensively for recreation, water supply and land drainage,the future of the Board is bound up with the Governments current review ofthe water industry on which decisions are expected to be announced shortly.Whatever changes are made, however, will not significantly affect commercialactivities on the waterways.
Chapter 9ROADS242 Much of the recent debate about transport policy has been about the size of the road programme. Attitudes about roads are divided and sometimesambivalent. Investment in roads is seen by many as necessary for promotingindustrial activity and development and the national prosperity on which the achievement of our other objectives depends. Others see it as a threat to public transport. Others again press for cuts while still demanding individual road schemes to relieve pressures on communities and the environment. Even wherethe need for a road is accepted, people do not want it to affect them, and the route is seldom acceptable to all. Local inquiries about road schemes which many people in the local community want are used to mount national campaigns.Some interests have pointed to the preponderance of passenger and freight traffic going by road and pressed for more money to be spent on trunk roads and motorways, while others regard the size of that programme as a test of whether Departments with direct executive responsibility are capable of givingtheir roads a proper rather than an inflated place in national transport policy.243 The Government has re-examined the planning of road building, andparticularly the programmes, priorities and procedures for which it is responsible.This chapter sets out its conclusions. Different emphases are required in England,Scotland and Wales, and this chapter makes these clear.244 The map at the back of the White Paper shows the trunk roads, includingmotorways, in Great Britain. It brings out what has been achieved. As late asthe end of the 1950s, Britain had nothing to compare with the modern roadsystems of other major industrialised countries. But there are now over1,400 miles of dual carriageway trunk roads of two or three lanes, and1,360 miles of motorways; the trunk road network as a whole carries almost a third of all the country&apos;s road traffic. This network has transformed transport and travel between industrial centres, and many of the development and assisted areas. The M4, for example, has shortened the link between the markets andthe services of London and the previously depressed industrial areas of SouthWales. The M62, completed last year, forms a 100 mile link, coast to coast,providing a fast and safe route for goods between Hull, Manchester and liverpool, at the same time relieving over 50 towns and villages. The gradualimprovement of the Al has halved journey times from London to the north of England. In Scotland, a motorway and dual carriageway network has been developed to improve the links to and within the industrialised central belt.245 The concept which has in England dominated a decade of road building hasbeenthe&quot;strategicnetwork&quot;.Thishasrestedonplans for asystem of roads of high,uniform quality, comprehensively developed to motorway or near motorwaystandards, linking all the major towns and ports. The intention was that itshould be completed as quickly as possible and that, once it had been, the eraof intensive activity would come to an end. This concept was developed in
the White Paper of 1970 &quot;Roads for the Future&quot;, which proposed a network inEngland of 4,200 miles (subsequently increased to 4,500 miles) to be completed by about the mid-1980s. The concept was a bold one and natural after a long period of neglect.246 But the situation has been changing. First, such a road programme has now become the victim of its own success. Despite all the benefits it has broughtabout, there is now a much greater feeling about the impact of large-scaleengineering on towns and the countryside. There is more concern for the environment, even though roads often bring environmental gains to localcommunities and despite sensitive landscaping and measures to minimise the noise and dirt which new roads bring to those near them. Second, it is right to becautious about the amount of new capacity which will be needed given the changed prospects for the supply and price of oil. On these grounds alone theGovernment has already revised downwards its planning assumptions forroads. Third, measures to contain public expenditure have already resulted in large reductions in the planned level of expenditure on the construction ofnew roads by central and local government from  1,000 million in 1971-72to  630 million in 1977-78. There is, moreover, the issue of the priority whichwithin a declining level of public expenditure for transport as a whole, shouldbe given to roads as compared with public transport.247 These changes are reflected now in changes in the policy and prioritiesof the Government. The re-allocations of public money put forward in this white Paper are designed to be more favourable to bus and rail and the Govern-ment proposes to secure them by keeping expenditure on roads, including those for which the Department of Transport is directly responsible in England, at a lower level than had been previously planned: investment in the Englishmotorway and trunk road system will be no higher by the end of the decadethan the reduced level for the current year.248 The &quot;strategic network&quot; concept will be modified. As a matter of national transport policy, the Government intends to adopt a more flexible approach and to deal as urgently as possible with the most pressing needs in the ways mostsensible for meeting them. This is a matter not of building to lines superimposedon maps and to rigid standards but of deciding on the right standard for eachsection of route and producing proposals for the most economical solution,taking into account environmental considerations. It would not be using themoney available to best advantage to plan and construct roads to a uniformstandard throughout when the traffic volume on different stretches is notuniform especially when building to a lower standard on some stretches would save money which could then be spent on more by-passes to relieve hard-pressedtowns and villages.249 There will be a more selective approach. This policy will mean improvingroads in phases, dealing with the worst stretches first, and varying the standardof a road throughout its length to reflect the different degree of use. It may leadto less &quot;tidy&quot; solutions and demand more of the lorry driver and the motorist,but it is a necessary price to pay for putting resources where they are most needed. New roads will in some cases be three-lane motorways and in others
single carriageway roads. In many cases it will mean improving the existingroute, rather than building on entirely new routes, though there will still beinstances where an entirely new road remains much the best approach in bothenvironmental and economical terms.250 Results of this approach can already be seen. For example the routebetween Manchester and Sheffield was originally planned as a motorwaythroughout, but it was decided that the solution which best met economic aswell as environmental requirements was one comprising by-passes for the urban areas with only minor improvements to the existing road through the PeakDistrict National Park.251 The Government will continue to give priority to improving those routes to the major ports and other industrial areas which carry a high proportion ofindustrial traffic. Many are not good enough for even present volumes of traffic.It will also give priority to meeting regional needs. For example, the Governmentis now giving high priority to meeting the needs of South East England whichhave had to wait for the claims of the less prosperous regions to be met first.The lack of an adequate route around London has long imposed unnecessarycosts on industry and commerce and subjected residential areas to heavytraffic. Apart from industrial and regional needs the other main priority will beschemes of environmental importance. In addition to the relief brought by newroads seventeen towns were provided with by-passes last year by improvingexisting routes.252 The planning of road schemes must fit the wider economic and land-useplans in the regions, and it is the job of the joint Regional Offices of the Depart-ments of Transport and the Environment to secure, with the local authoritiesand the Economic Planning Councils, that it does so. In many places planningwill be based on the existing pattern of regional routes, often by building by-passes or eliminating bottlenecks in other ways. But that is not always possible.In the Midlands, the pre-war network has proved inadequate to serve the mainflows of traffic generated by post-war industrial development and a new net-work, mainly to motorway standards, has been provided and is being furtherexpanded.253 In Wales first priority will continue to be given to completing the M4extension through South Wales and the early improvement of the A55 in thenorth. Priority will also be given to the selective improvement of theA48/A40route beyond the western terminal of the M4 and to the A470 northwards fromCardiff, as well as to the building of local by-passes and diversions and to the elimination of bottlenecks wherever this will be of advantage to industrialtraffic or bring significant environmental benefits to hard-pressed localcommunities.254 Part of the selective approach is greater attention to value for money.Standards of design in relation to expected traffic volumes have been much reduced in recent years, and this has enabled costs of construction to be brought down. Road planning will continue to be based on cautious forecasts of economic growth, and it will need to take account of an uncertain future in which energy,and oil in particular, is likely to become scarcer and dearer. The Governmentwill keep the position under review.
255 Decisions on any road scheme, large or small, involve a careful exerciseof judgment. Some of the factors which must be taken into account can bequantified: others, such as environmental and regional effects, cannot. Thequantifiable costs and benefits provide an effective guide to the economiceffects of a scheme, and these benefits frequently promise a higher return for industry and commerce than could be obtained from direct investment in plant and machinery. But both quantifiable and unquantifiable factors are important,and no scheme is undertaken unless if offers a high economic return or othersignificant benefits. Systematic techniques have been progressively developed for making assessments. The Government will review their application in the lightof the report of the Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment, whoseindependent study of appraisal methods and forecasting is now well underway.256 Local authorities as well as central Government will need to plan for a much lower level of investment in roads than in the early 1970s. There will be much less large-scale road building in towns than a few years ago. This is in itselfwelcome. But lower levels of expenditure will also affect investment in localauthorities&apos; inter-urban roads. Though priorities are for the authorities todecide, within national expenditure guidelines, the Government believes thatthey too should give the highest priority to meeting the needs of industry, as wellas providing necessary links with the national road system and relieving areas where traffic presents particularly difficult environmental problems. Localauthorities are responsible for integrating their transport and traffic proposals with their structure and local plans and for guiding the pattern of developmentwhere they can so as to avoid an excessive requirement for new transportinfrastructure. Close working relations between central and local governmentare essential for securing that their respective programmes fit together to best advantage.257 The distinction between the trunk road system which is nationally adminis-tered and local road networks is not a hard and fast one. Some parts of thepresent trunk road system are less important as major through routes than some parts of local road systems. Over the last year some changes have been made byreclassifying trunk roads as local roads and vice versa, according to theirpresent and prospective function and use. One kind of change which has led tothe reclassification of a trunk road is the opening of a new national route built to replace it. The Government intends eventually to pass over to local authori-ties all roads which have lost their national significance.258 A smaller road programme overall will have drawbacks. There will stillbe bank holiday queues where improvements remain to be done. For many people journeys to work by car will not get easier. Many towns and villages willhave to endure the intrusion of traffic for years to come. But a substantialprogramme remains; and the more selective approach now adopted will betterenable the most pressing needs to be met.259 There will still have to be the most sensitive consideration of the effects of road building on the landscape and the ecology of the countryside and on ourhistoric, archaeological and architectural treasures. The development ofinstitutions such as the Councils for the Protection of Rural England and Wales,
the National Trust, and other national and local bodies reflects a continuingconcern with the preservation or enhancement of our heritage. An increasing number are regularly given notice when the Department is putting forward proposals for new roads, and all have an opportunity of commenting on them during the public consultations at the early stage of planning and at any sub-sequent public inquiries. The designers and constructors of roads will continueto need the informed advice of these bodies and to take full account of it.260 Sharp changes in the past in the level of work have left the construction industry with too much capacity for the domestic market, and a reduced require-ment for labour. The industry has had to adapt itself to the changed situation,and is seeking more orders abroad. Its export record is impressive: its netearnings reached a record level last year and are expected to be even better thisyear. But the Government recognises the difficulties which the industry hashad to face, and is therefore determined that the reduced domestic programme should be as stable as possible, so as to assist companies&apos; future planning.261 In Scotland the trunk road programme is based on the White Paper of1969 &quot;Scottish Roads in the 1970s&quot;. Restraints on expenditure and other factorsmean that a number of desirable schemes must be postponed until at least the1980s. The main objective has been, over the past few years, and will remain,the improvement of road communications which will be to the economic benefitof Scotland, with particular reference to the central belt and areas of new industrial development. Traffic, safety and environmental factors are also takeninto account in the preparation of the programme. The allocation of limited resources in Scotland requires careful consideration of the standards to whichroads can be constructed to meet foreseeable traffic and other requirements and a flexible approach in the determination of the schemes to be started. in considering its trunk road programme, the Government will continue to keepin close touch with the regional councils about the significance of particulartrunk road schemes for the councils&apos; own transport and other policies and programmes.262 No fundamental changes are proposed in Scotland in the assessment oftrunk road priorities or in the way in which trunk road proposals are processedand considered. Equally, local authorities will remain free to determine theirown priorities for schemes, within overall capital limits which, though to someextent restricted, will still allow road construction and improvement to continue on the most urgent and necessary schemes.INQUIRIES263 Recent years have seen increasing concern, particularly in England, aboutthe effects of road schemes on communities and their environment. People and organisations affected rightly want to be consulted about the planning of road schemes, which can have profound and permanent effects on their neighbour-hood. The inquiry processses themselves are now much longer and involve amuch more detailed examination of the Department^ proposals. The time takenbetween first including a proposed motorway or other trunk road in the&quot;preparation pool&quot; of schemes and starting construction has become much longer: the average time in the 1960s was between five and seven years; it is nowbetween ten and twelve.
264 Changes in procedures have made the inquiry system more acceptablegenerally, though not to everyone. They have however meant prolonging the uncertainty which road proposals involve: the economic, social and environ-mental benefits for which the improvements were designed have taken longer tomaterialise. The conflict between various interests is inescapable.265 The Government will continue to examine ways of reducing delays and uncertainty while maintaining the principle of consultation and the rights ofobjectors to have their views and interests properly considered. The inquiriesinto trunk road proposals were designed to ensure that those who felt that their interests would be damaged should have a statutory opportunity to expressand explain their objections, so that the responsible Ministers would realiseand understand them before reaching a decision. What is needed is the bestprocedure for ensuring that this purpose is served fairly as well as effectively.Decisions on trunk road proposals are now taken in England jointly by the secretaries of State for Transport and the Environment. They are answerablein Parliament for their decisions, as are the Secretaries of State for Scotlandand for Wales for theirs.266 The Government deplores the way in which inquiries held under proceduresauthorised by statute have sometimes been so disrupted that even the peoplemost closely affected are denied a sure opportunity to express their views and explain their interests the basic purpose of the inquiry in spite of the mostconscientious efforts by the Inspectors charged individually with the orderly and fair conduct of those inquiries to discharge their role with impartialityand helpfulness.267 The Government will continue to develop procedures for explainingalternative possible plans well before definitive schemes are prepared for public inquiry, and by providing still more information on the facts before apublic inquiry opens. It will seek to secure that discussion among those affectedcan be on the basis of a fuller understanding of the implications for them,for the local community and for any wider area to which the road proposalsrelate. The Government will as soon as possible make a statement, in the lightof discussions with the Council on Tribunals, on changes in procedure designedto reinforce general public confidence in the system.268 The Government believes, however, that the greatest contribution to public confidence is likely to spring from the restatement in this White paper of its general policy on roads, as part of national transport policy; and from its proposals, set out in chapter 11, for reporting to Parliament, so that it may involve itself more closely and regularly.
Chapter 10implications for public expenditure269 The policies in this White Paper will mean changes in the present plans for public expenditure on inland surface transport set out provisionally in thelast Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6721). They will take some time tocarry through, but they will be reflected in the allocations for the end of the decade.270 In particular, the Government has reconsidered the earlier decision thatrevenue support to buses in England and Wales should be reduced to half itspresent level by 1980-81. The Government considers that the maintenance of adequate bus networks will require support at the present level of about  150million. Within this total, support for essential services in rural areas is expectedto increase by some  15 million by the end of the decade; the Government hopes that in the longer term the need for support in urban areas will decline.271 In addition, with an end to the advice to local authorities in England andWales not to introduce new or improved schemes of concessionary fares, this expenditure is expected to increase from the present  95 million to about 120 million a year. Some extra provision for local public transport will alsobe necessary towards the end of the period as local authorities undertakeresponsibility for decisions on certain local railway services. In all, there willbe by the end of the decade an increase for local public transport of some 100 million over planned figures. The precise allocation from year to year of local expenditure will be for the authorities to determine within the overalllimits set by the annual surveys of public expenditure.272 It is too early to say with certainty what resources in total will be availablefor inland surface transport for years beyond 1978-79, but for the time beingit must be assumed that the amount will not be far different from that set forthe end of the present Public Expenditure Survey period in Cmnd 6721 about  2,200 million at 1976 Survey prices which is a reduction of about 100 million below the provision for the current year.273 The broad allocations which the Government now has in mind as a resultof this review are set out in the table opposite. This shows also how expenditureshave changed since 1971-72, and the adjustments which the Government intends to make to present plans for the end of the decade so as to provide for adequatesupport to local public transport within a declining total.274 The English motorway and trunk roads programme has already contractedfrom about  400 million in 1971-72 to about  270 million for this year, to accommodate increasing subsidy and as a result of the cuts on public expendi-ture announced in July and December last. The programme for the inter-urbanroad system will now have to be phased so that expenditure is held for the timebeing at roughly the reduced level of  270 million. The Scottish and Welshroads programmes will remain at broadly the planned levels.

275 Local road building is now at only about half the level of 1971-72. A further substantial reduction would make it difficult, if not impossible, for localauthorities adequately to serve industry and new housing, let alone providerelief for environmentally sensitive areas. But if support for public transport is to be maintained, local authorities&apos; spending on road construction will haveto continue at or below the planned level for 1977-78. A reduction of some 20 million in road maintenance is indicated also.276 The Railways Board are also being asked to make some savings. A reductionof  20 million on revenue support to the passenger railway is expected by theend of the decade. A further  40 million will be saved through the elimination of the temporary subsidy to rail freight, and of support for the National freight corporation.277 Investment by nationalised industries is no longer treated as part of thecontrol total in the Public Expenditure White Paper except for expenditurefinanced by Government capital grants and loans from the National loans fund. The introduction of the new replacement allowance for the british railways Board&apos;s passenger business proposed in chapter 8 will require achange in the presentation of the expenditures for the Board in future years.278 The pattern now set will be subject to change. As industry grows stronger,as skill and ability find their outlets, as the balance of payments improves,people can look for a rising standard of living. Better standards of public services will be part of that rising standard, and larger provision for public expenditure on transport can be in prospect. How much this may be, and howit may be best used, will be for the Government and the local authorities of theday to decide when the time has come and the prospect is certain.
Chapter 11consultation and policy-making279 The question remains: given the shortcomings of transport policy in thepast, in what way can we improve the quality of decisions in the future? as this White Paper makes clear, good management in the conventional sense(which includes good industrial relations) has a major part to play, and day-to-day Government intervention is unlikely to help. This is plainly the case wherea whole series of private decisions is involved, often concerned with personalchoice. But even in the public sector road and rail, passenger and freight the Government believes that the efficient provision of services requires manage-ment, working closely with the trade unions, to be increasingly free to makenecessary decisions on the basis of its informed judgment. If, however, thetransport system is to be flexible enough to match up to changing realities andto meet changing needs, there must be a continuing effort to ensure that majorstrategic decisions, particlarly about the overall allocation of resources, are properly made. How is this best done?280 For almost six years, until the autumn of 1976, transport had no separaterepresentation in the machinery of Government. This was the case when the consultation document was published and when most of the evidence arisingfrom it was received. It was natural to look for a device or institution of an executive or advisory kind to be exclusively concerned with the co-ordination oftransport matters and the monitoring of developments. But the setting up of anew Department of Transport allows a fresh start to be made which combinesclear responsibility for transport planning with the traditional advantages of ministerial accountability to Parliament. The Government believes that it is right to build on these foundations and not to establish, at least for the timebeing, a National Transport Council or National Transport Planning Authority.The task of representing interests and seeking the redress of grievances lies atthe heart of Parliaments role in a democratic society. This applies in the field of transport policy as in any other. It is the task of Government to reconcileconflicting claims and to identify and pursue the national interest on behalf ofall the people. It would be a mistake to abandon or compromise these principlesunless the advantages were plain and promised to be permanent.281 This does not mean that present arrangements for the discussion oftransport policy in Parliament and elsewhere are adequate or that there is noscope for bringing groups and interests into regular and continuing consultation.The proposals in this White Paper for a significant extension of local optionwill widen the circle of responsibility for planning our transport system. Atthe same time, the increased role for local authorities is wholly consistent with the Governmenfs preference for accountability to democratically electedbodies in transport planning. The Government intends to improve the means by which considered views are available to it on all aspects of transport policy.282 First, though the Government does not propose to create a national transport Planning Authority, it recognises the case for creating the means
by which Government and management and trade unions in both the public and private sectors can consult together in a regular and meaningful way soas to fulfil the essential functions which might have been discharged by an authority. There are several possible forms which the necessary arrangements could take now without a requirement for legislation. The question is whethera body can be created which while adequately representative of the wide fieldcovered by transport would not merely be a talking-shop. It should be ableto tackle effectively, without delaying essential decisions, some of the underlyingproblems whose resolution will be essential if transport is to make a full and efficient contribution to national needs and policies.283 One possibility is that the National Economic Development Office mightextend its services in transport. The Government will explore further withthe NEDO and with both sides of industry the idea of a new little NEDDYin which, within the framework of the Governmenfs industrial strategy,which the NEDO is helping to apply, plans for the future of transport wouldbe opened for discussion in the manner now familiar through the operation ofthe existing little NEDDIES. It would be able to consider requirements for new investment, technology and operating methods, manpower and productivity,and the promotion of exports of transport hardware and consultancy services.It might wish to build up its own analytical facilities as a basis for its work.284 Because the field of transport is wide, a Committee, if one were created,might operate through a number of sub-committees. One might cover inter-national freight, building on the work of the successful little NEDDY for themovement of exports. A second might cover inland freight, and, as well asquestions of efficiency, consider the priorities for road schemes in the light ofindustrial needs, particular problems arising from the distribution of freightbetween road and rail, and regulations affecting the industry. A third sub-committee might consider passenger transport problems, particularly travel towork, the better co-ordination of bus and rail services and information for thepublic about them.285 The Governments further proposals relate to Parliament and the public.Concern has been expressed in recent years that Parliaments opportunities to register its views on major issues affecting transport policy have been few andinadequate. It is, of course, for Parliament itself to decide its own priorities and the increasing pressure of business of all kinds already places an intolerableburden on the Parliamentary timetable. But the Government believes it is right to ensure that Parliament is in a position to choose to debate transportmore fully and in an informed way.286 One gap to be filled is on the Governments own road programmes. TheGovernment will go ahead with its proposals for annual White Papers on roads.They will replace the present retrospective, mostly factual, annual reports.They will carry forward each year the statement of policy outlined earlier inthis White Paper, set out the Governmenfs policy in more detailed terms, and show how roads policy and major schemes fit into the overall transport policy.They will provide a regular and better basis for reporting to Parliament and for debate there. They will also serve as an authoritative background for considera-tion of specific road schemes at public local inquiries. There will be an annualstatement on the road programme in Scotland.
287. To enable Parliament to focus in future on matters of transport policy,the Government proposes to provide, on a regular basis, statements on howtransport policy has developed, including prospects and plans for the future.These would take the form of White Papers on transport policy as a whole at about three yearly intervals, would review the significant changes that have takenplace over the period, and propose whatever adjustments to forecasts and policies seem necessary. They would also make available the essential facts and analysis, so that the continuing transport debate can be based on informedopinion and concentrated on issues of concern.288 The public sector transport industries, whether they account to centralor to local government have much to contribute to a better understanding of how transport is developing and how they have used the considerable resourcesthat the public has entrusted to them. Through their annual reports and in otherways they can help to promote and inform the continuing debate. With this inmind, the Government will be considering the recent recommendations of theSelect Committee on Nationalised Industries with the Boards for which it is directly responsible.289 The House of Commons may take the view that a Select Committee on transport, rather then occasional debates on the floor of the House, would bea better method of considering such White Papers and, more generally,scrutinising decisions. That is for the House itself to decide in the light ofcircumstance, including the willingness of a representative group of members to serve on such a Committee. But it is worth bearing in mind that the SelectCommittee on Nationalised Industries (whose recent report on the Role ofBritish Rail in Public Transport has been briefly referred to in this White Paper),the Select Committee on Science and Technology (to whose report on AdvancedGround Transport the Government has recently replied) and the expenditure committee have all considered aspects of transport policy in recent years. Itwould be important to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and to reach an understanding on the extent of the scope of any new Select Committee.290 There is a need also for some form of organisation to express the consumers&apos;particular points of view, not in order to rival elected democratic control orto replace the direct contact between the elected councillor and his constituents,but to make it easier for elected authority to consult and learn consumets&apos;collective views, carefully collated and responsibly presented. The future formof such arrangements will be affected by the outcome of the Governmentsstudy of the proposals concerning representation of consumers&apos; views generallywhich have been submitted by the National Consumer Council. Since theseproposals relate to a vastly wider field than transport alone, the governments views upon them will be the subject of a wider statement as soon as practicable.291 While national policy must be decided in the end by Government and parliament, the only guarantee that it will continue to be appropriate will beprovided by systematic reference to the views of all the interests involved including the many who have contributed to this statement of policy. It can be implemented only with their understanding. They must know that the Govern-ment will always listen, even if it cannot always accept what is said. They for
their part must accept that the Government and Parliament have the responsi-bility of decision. All concerned, Government and organisations alike, have toaccept the force of arguments other than their own and of facts and realitiesthat underlie difficult and controversial decisions. In this spirit, the Government Ministers and officials will build on the consultations which preceded this white Paper. They will do so with the intention, not merely of maintainingday-to-day contact on current issues, but also to prepare the ground forsuccessors to this White Paper which the arrangements described in this chapterwill require.
Chapter 12summary of decisions292 This White Paper has presented the first results of the Governmentsreview of transport policy, and described the lines on which action will now proceed. Its main concern has been with the problems of public transport, onwhich the Government will continue to place the strongest emphasis. the review has concentrated on inland surface transport, and has not dealt sub-stantively with some matters, notably ports, shipping or aviation.293 The principal objectives of transport policy are:- to contribute to economic growth and higher national prosperity, particu-larly through providing an efficient service to industry, commerce and agriculture;- to meet social needs by securing a reasonable level of personal mobility,in particular by maintaining public transport for the many people who do not have the effective choice of travelling by car;- to minimise the harmful effects, in loss of life and damage to the environ-ment, that are the direct physical result of the transport we use.294 The main conclusions of this review are:- expenditure in support of public transport and to moderate increases in fares will not be reduced as has been planned, despite the declining shareof public expenditure which can be devoted to transport. This will meanmore support for buses, and less for road construction;- more responsibility for planning transport to meet local needs should be devolved to local government since the most practical and democraticapproach to co-ordination is local;- greater emphasis should be placed on getting value for money, both inthe financial regimes for the public sector industries and in the framework for decision-taking on particular schemes and services;- there should be a more systematic and open involvement of people,Parliament, transport operators and unions in the continuing debate on transport and the formulation of policy; and this should be promoted bythe regular provision of information by Government and the industries.295 Transport planning must be flexible so that it can face uncertainty andrespond promptly to changing needs and developments in the short and longer term. Its assumptions and forecasts must be kept under review and revisedas our objectives and events require.296 Decisions and planning as they affect people&apos;s needs for transport should recognise the changed realities in transport. For the future we should aim toreduce our absolute dependence on transport, see that transport makes its contribution to the conservation of energy resources, and key transport in toour wider policies for the environment and our views of how we want ourcommunities to develop.
297 The main particular decisions are summarised in the following paragraphs.298 The new local planning arrangements will provide for:- more effective planning, co-ordination and integration of local public transport services, with the co-operation of operators, unions and consumerinterests, based on assessments of local needs and priorities, and underlocal democratic control;- firmer and longer term agreements between local authorities and operatorsfor the support of essential services and for greater stability;- new arrangements for reaching any necessary decisions on certain localrailway passenger services.299 For its part, the Government will:- provide local authorities with wider powers to discharge their increasedresponsibilities;- increase the planned financial provision for local authorities&apos; support tobuses;- remove as soon as practicable the present restraint on concessionary faresschemes for elderly, blind and disabled people.300 For rural areas, the Government proposes in particular:- increased bus revenue support to enable essential services to be maintained;- a new requirement for Traffic Commissioners to have regard to localauthorities&apos; policies for public transport;- to review the simplified licensing procedures, so as to extend their coverage;- an early start to the programme of rural transport experiments, backed by legislation, now in Parliament, to permit worthwhile developmentsoutside the present licensing law;- new legislation to facilitate community minibus schemes and to removelegal obstacles to car sharing.301 To improve ways of dealing with traffic problems, particularly in urban areas, the Government will consult local authorities with a view to legislation to:- remove some of the ministerial controls over the exercise of traffic manage-ment powers;- enable local authorities to licence privately operated car parks and, subjectto suitable safeguards, to control private non-residential parking.302 The Government also considers that greater attention should be given tothe needs of pedestrians and cyclists in traffic management and planning. It will:- contribute to the cost of selected experimental schemes;- improve its advice to local authorities on useful measures.303 For inter-urban services, whether by road, rail or air, the Government seesno justification for subsidy:- competition between the modes should continue as the best means of ensuring the widest choice of service, quality and price;- there will be a study of inter-urban passenger transport to secure thatoperators&apos; investment plans are compatible and avoid wasteful over-capacity.
304 The Government considers that intervention in freight transport is justifiedonly to secure a fair basis of competition between modes, or on grounds of safety, or to protect the environment, and:- that any advantages which might result from the direction of traffic and quantity licensing would be outweighed by their disadvantages.It intends:- to press on with modifying the goods vehicle taxation system to enablevehicle excise duty to be related to vehicles&apos; laden weight and the numberof axles;- that the temporary rail freight subsidy, which the British Railways board have much reduced, should end this year.305 The Government will carry forward measures for civilising the heavy lorry,including:- improved noise, braking, and smoke emission standards;- a review of the operators&apos; licensing system and the adequacy of its enforce-ment;- new legislation to tighten up on enforcement of lorry maintenance andoverloading;- a supplementary licensing scheme for operators carrying dangerousgoods;- support for research into more efficient distribution systems.306 Rail freight already has by far the major share of long distance bulktraffic. The Government will encourage the railways to win further traffic ofthe kind they are well suited to carry. In particular, it will:- continue the scheme of grants to private sidings, rejecting no worthwhileproposal for lack of funds;- sustain rolling 5 year programmes of investment in locomotives and modernair-braked wagons.307 For the railways as a whole, the Government rules out any notion of imposing major cuts in the railway network.It intends:- to set, with the Board, financial targets within which the Board can managethe business, improve efficiency and win more traffic;- to introduce a special replacement allowance for the renewal of assets inthe passenger business and to give the Board more incentive and greater freedom of action in planning and running the business;- to agree with the Board rolling programmes of investment;- to continue a high level of revenue support so that those commuter fareincreases that prove necessary can be phased as carefully as possible.308 For the bus industry, in addition to creating a new local planning frameworkand increasing the planned provision for local authorities&apos; bus revenue support and concessionary fares schemes, the Government intends:- to encourage the support of essential rural services;
- to continue new bus grant at its present level to 1980-81 and then atreducing levels until 1985;- to widen the application of fuel duty rebate to stage services.309 The Government intends to publish a detailed statement on the futurerole and structure of the National Freight Corporation later in the year, witha view to introducing legislation next session. The Government reserves its final decision on freight liners and National Carriers Limited until then.310 The Government has re-examined the road programme. Expenditure onthe English trunk road system will be kept at the reduced level of the current year.311 The programme will be based on schemes most needed to meet economicand environmental objectives, rather than on completion of national strategicnetworks. It will:- put more emphasis on selectivity;- plan and build for standards appropriate to each stretch of road, notuniform standards of provision for whole routes;- give priority to schemes serving industry and development, essential orbitalroutes, and other schemes helping to divert heavy traffic from built-built-up areas or offering other clear environmental gains.312 Finally, the White Paper outlines a number of ways in which futureconsultations on the formulation and execution of transport policy will be improved:- an annual White Paper for England and for Wales on their road programmes,and an annual statement for Scotland;- improved arrangements for public local inquiries into trunk road schemes;- periodic White Papers on the development of transport policy.313 The Government will in addition explore the case for a little NEDDYfor transport with wide terms of reference as one possible means of promotingregular consultation between Government, management and unions.
ANNEXTRANSPORT RESOURCES BUDGET1 The purpose of the budget is to show what users, including those providingtheir own transport, spend on different forms of surface transport by road and rail; the value of the resources that go into providing transport and how theyare paid for whether entirely by users, entirely from public expenditure ora mixture of the two. The presentation shows how users&apos; expenditure is splitbetween tax and purchase of resources and how central and local government expenditure in the form of subsidies, grants and expenditure on or associatedwith roads contributes to the total use of resources.2 Table 1 sets out the main part of the budget for 1976-77. It deals with themodes separately and, for each mode, comprises the following elements bycolumns:(1) users expenditure on transport actual expenditure by users in fares and charges together with motorists&apos; expenditure on car use.(2) taxes, divided into two groups(i) general taxes VAT, car tax, import duties, etc.(ii) transport taxes vehicle excise duty, licence fees and fuel duty.(3) subsidies and capital grants, divided into two groups(i) concessionary fares payments by local authorities specificallytowards free or reduced fare travel for elderly, blind and disabledpeople.(ii) other revenue support payments and other grants by government or local authorities.(4) current use of resources by operators (including motorists) the actualuse of resources excluding roads by transport users obtained bysubtracting column (2) from column (1) and adding column (3).(5) roads expenditure current and capital Government and local authority expenditure on maintenance and construction of roads, including lighting,police, traffic wardens, road safety, National Health Service, costsassociated with roads and courts, allocated to different types of traffic on the lines described in volume 2 of the transport consultationdocument. The National Health Service costs included are estimates of the medical, ambulance and hospital costs (including an allowance for hospital capital costs) of all road accidents.(rail infrastructure) (for comparison the column shows expenditureon maintenance and construction of rail infrastructure which is includedin column (4) for rail).(6) other capital expenditure less transfers from current account investmentafter allowing for that provided for out of current expenditure and byway of capital grants and that included in roads expenditure.(7) total use of resources the sum of all resources consumed; the sum of allthe expenditures set out in previous columns, whether by users, central or local government, less the tax element of users&apos; expenditure.
The figures relate to a single financial year, 1976-77 and to Great Britain. Allflows are shown at outturn prices. Public expenditure is identified as far aspossible by the use of italics but certain columns contain both public and privateelements. Because the figures in this Annex are at outturn prices, public expenditure figures do not correspond exactly with those in the main text wherefigures are given at 1976 survey prices. The presentation does not includedomestic air transport which accounts for 0-5 per cent of passenger kilometresand 0-01 per cent of tonne kilometres, or coastal shipping, pipelines and inland waterways which together account for 17 per cent of tonne kilometres.3 The budget shows that transport used some  20-4 billion of resources in1976-77; about  10-1 billion on personal travel and about  10-2 billion on themovement of freight. By far the greater part of this was on road transport.As regards personal travel, 80 per cent of passenger kilometres were by car;car travel accounted for about 70 per cent of total use of resources, and 80 percent of users&apos; expenditure. Road freight transport, which accounted for over80 per cent of tonne kilometres by road and rail, took 96 per cent of users&apos;expenditure and total resources.4 The consumer paid directly for 87 per cent of the resources used. About 2-7 billion was paid by central and local government in providing roads and services associated with roads, and in subsidies to public transport.5 The table also shows how far the users of particular modes collectively mettheir share of the costs of the resources they used. Transport taxes on motoristsand taxis covered their share of the cost of providing the road system, policingit, and of the costs to the National Health Service of road casualites. Thetransport taxes on road freight, however, fell about  10 million short of meetingthe appropriate share (though this figure is well within the margin of error in the apportionment). Fares and charges on users of the railways did not cover thefull cost of the resources used. In fact the subsidies to railways were greaterthan the cost of maintaining and improving track, signalling and the rest of theinfrastructure.6 As a result of the increase in excise duty in the 1977 Budget, the excess ofrevenue from motorists over attributed costs will be greater in 1977-78 than in1976-77. For goods vehicles as a whole the shortfall between revenue andattributed costs will be eliminated in 1977-78 and there will be no shortfall on goods vehicles over 1  tons unladen weight, or 3  tons gross weight, as a whole.Within this latter group certain categories of larger vehicles will continue toshow a deficit, although the number of such categories will be smaller and the size of the average deficit for most of the remaining groups will be reduced byabout a half. Calculations for individual classes of vehicle depend on apportion-ing public costs in a somewhat arbitrary fashion and comparisons related toaverage vehicles carrying average loads over average distances. The costs attri-buted to average vehicles in these categories increase broadly with gross weightand inversely with the number of axles for a given gross weight. On the basis of calculation used in the consultation document, it is estimated that in 1977-78the difference between revenue and allocated costs for an average 4 axle 32 tonarticulated vehicle will be around  900. An average 32 ton articulated vehiclewith 5 axles on the other hand, will cover its allocated costs in 1977-78.
7 Table 2 shows the main elements of the budget in terms of expenditure per unit of effective output, per passenger kilometre travelled or per tonne kilo-metre carried. The resource cost per passenger kilometre of public transport is greater than that of motoring, mainly because of the larger labour component of public transport costs. Some indication of the cost of providing a driverto meet individual transport needs precisely is given by the high unit cost oftaxi travel as compared with public passenger transport. Table 2 shows that theaverage unit resource cost of passenger transport by railway is higher than thecost by bus, though the difference is concealed from the consumer by the highersubsidy per passenger kilometre to railways.8 The average unit resource costs of road freight transport are much higherthan those for rail, but there are differences in the nature of the job which eachmode does. Rail freight is dominated by movements of bulk goods with lowhandling costs and the figures do not include collection and delivery costs.Road freight covers all types of movements including nearly all very shortmovements of difficult items with large handling charges.
