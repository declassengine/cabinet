confidential -until authorised for publicationDRAFTsqiATOTCWP on the non-statutory inquiryby the baroness sharp into the continijedjjseOF dartmoor for military training-Presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for the environment and the Secretary of State for Defence by Command ... etc1.   The Report of the non-statutory inquiry conducted at our request by Baroness Sharp into the continued use of Dartmoor by theMinistry of Defence for training purposes is being publishedseparately today.2-   Within the terms of reference of her inquiry, Baroness Sharprecommends no change in the Defence land holdings on Dartmoorout proposes, at paragraphs 299 to 307 of the Report, a nujnberof steps designed to reduce the impact of military training0* the amenities of the National Park,  including land held by&quot;the National Trust.    Before turning to these specific recommenda-&quot;tions it may be helpful to clarify our position on the broaderquestions which, though they lay outside her terms of reference,Saroness Sharp thought it right to raise in paragraphs 253 to 276of her Report.3-   We recognise (to quote Lady Sharp) that military training^ a national park are &quot;discordant,  incongruous and inconsistent&quot;;^ there is force in the view expressed by the Council for theProtection of Rural England that of all the national parks^trnoor is the one where conflict between the purpose of the?ark and military training is most acute.    Ideally we should wish
to see the demands of military training on Dartmoor reduced aSofsoon and as far as possible.    But,  important as the purposes the national parks are, neither Parliament nor successive governments have ever accepted that they are paramount.    Theymust be balanced against other objectives of national policy&apos;There may be circumstances in which the proven needs of defencemust take   precedence.4.    In the present instance we have noted and endorse Lady ShaI^conclusion, (which is essentially the same as that already reon an earlier occasion by the Defence Lands Committee 1971&quot;&quot;73that &quot;given -the situation as it is.......... the Ministry 0^Defence need all their training areas on Dartmoor ..........5.    However, Lady Sharp goes on to suggest that, in order todispel any uncertainty, the Government should state whethersee a continuing need for military training on Dartmoor ofabout the present intensity and nature for the foreseeable.future.    She points out that some people have suggested &quot;that areduction in training can be expected,  either as the result 0economies in Defence expenditure or because the training relment is itself evolving in a way which makes Dartmoor a lesssuitable training area than other parts of the country.tioJ16.    Those who have advanced these arguments have drawn attento the reductions in the manpower of the Armed Forces announin the 1975 Defence White Paper (Cmnd 5976) and to theannouncements on that occasion and in the 1976 Defence white paper (Cmnd 6432) of a change in the balance of UK commandoearmarked for the northern flank of NATO and of the intenti0train a proportion of these forces in arctic warfare.    Latte^
attention has been drawn to the further reductions in defence expenditure which have been announced since the publication ofthe 1976 Defence White Paper.7.   None of these developments in fact implies any significant change in the total requirement for training in the UnitedKingdom by the Army and Royal Marines.    The Ministry of Defencegave evidence to Baroness   Sharp&apos;s inquiry that despite the reductions in manpower announced in Cmnd 5976 and certain changes in deployment, the Army and Royal Marines force levels in&quot;the south-west would remain virtually unchanged, as would the&quot;total training&quot;requirement for Regular and Reserve units in theUnited Kingdom.8-    This evidence was based on a searching examination of deploy-ttents and training requirements undertaken in 1975.    These studieshave been repeated in recent months,  and the results confirm theevidence given to the inquiry.    These broad conclusions will notDe changed by the reductions in Defence expenditure which have formed   part of the reductions in total public spending announcedDy the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 22 July and 15 December 1976.Although it remains to settle in all detail how the cuts will be&quot;taken, there is no question of any general restructuring or generalRedeployment of the Army and Royal Marines.    In the case of theRoyal Marines in particular, a Headquarters and most of the units are based around Plymouth because of its suitability as a mountingPort.    The barracks occupied by the two commando units at Seaton arracks  and Bickleigh Camp have been re-built in the lastb
10 years and a major re-building project of the CommandoTraining Centre at Lympstone is currently in train.    Althoughmountain and Arctic training will be conducted in northern norway all Royal Marines units will continue to need existinglevels of training of the kind that can be provided on Dartmoo1&quot;It would be impossible to justify, either in operational or irleconomic terms, any redeployment from Plymouth of the royal marines units now based there.9.   Accordingly, whilst we shall continue to be alert to anyarehopeopportunity which the changing situation may throw up, we are bound to say that we can find no grounds for offering anyof significant reduction in the demands of military trainingon Dartmoor in the foreseeable future.    In these circumstancwe consider that the right course will now be for all par&quot;fciework together, in the spirit of paragraph 283 of the Report,to achieve the best possible reconciliation of the conflict1&apos;requirements of training,  conservation and access.    We endof5the views expressed in that paragraph that whilst the armed forces must be allowed as much scope as possible to ensurethat training is efficient, the public should, nevertheless ,enjoy substantial rights of access, their safety must be assured, and harm to the antiquities and to nature conserv^1kept to a minimum.    These are requirements which are inevito some extent in conflict; the proper balance is difficU^strike.    Y/e greatly welcome the attention which Baroness ^has given to improving the modus vfvendi in the light of ^eperceptive and constructive suggestions which were put f0^by those who submitted evidence.    It is in this spirit tha^     ^have approached the specific recommendations at paragraph3&quot;07 of the Report.
10.    in most cases these recommendations will require discussionamong several parties and it would not be proper for us toprejudge the outcome.    It may, however, be helpful if we recordour preliminary views and indicate how we envisage that further. steps can be usefully and quickly taken.11. In general, we accept in principle all the recommendationsat paragraphs 299 to 307 of the Report, with&quot; the exception ofthat at paragraph 304, read in conjunction with the parts of theReport to which they relate.    The recent reductions in defence expenditure, however,  especially in the Works programme, are likely&quot;to limit the extent to which we can contemplate proposals involvingadditional costs.   With this reservation, we have the followingPreliminary comments on the recommendations of the Report.Paragraph 299.    This paragraph recommends that very serious consideration should be given to the transfer of the small- armsrange at Willsworthy to a site outside the National Park.    Ofthp. three sites said to merit further, consideration David stow on;odmin Moor is said to be the most likely prospect and anarlier paragraph, 281, recommends that the Ministry of defence should have discussions with the Commoners and other individuals^d bodies whose interests would be affected to see how far.keir objections might, be met.    The other two possible siteswill be considered at the same time.    These discussions will beVitiated by the Ministry of Defence and decisions reached as0-uickly as possible, having in mind the concern of residentsaround these three sites to know the outcome.    If it seemedpra-cticable to move the range to an alternative site the Ministry0f defence would formally consult the local authorities underestablished planning procedures.
Paragraphs 300?  301?  306 and 307.    The - Government welcome therecommendations in paragraphs 306 and 307 for regular consult3^ofmachinery and for regular reports to Ministers.    The MinistryDefence will discuss the mechanics of providing these with the bodies concerned,  including the National Park Authority, the countryside Commission, the Nature Conservancy Council, theNational Trust and the Ancient Monuments and Historic Bv.il&amp;i-n&amp;SBranch of DOE.    As for the recommendations in paragraphs300301, which should be read in conjunction with paragraphs 283to 286, we envisage that the consultative machinery will proVla natural forum for the discussion of such matters as the i^esity of military use.    The Services must co-ooperate as fullypossible with the National Park Authority and amenity bodie3&apos;but discussions must be conditioned by the need to ensuretothe essential training requirements of the Services which, duevarying commitments, may fluctuate from year to year.Paragraph 302. We endorse the desirability of increasing puhllCaccess to Dartmoor, as recommended at paragraphs 287 and 302of the Report.    This will doubtless be a continuing topic 0^discussion in the consultative machinery envisaged above.Paragraph 303.    The possibility of transferring artillery aria.. - .....-      - -----tar firing from Dartmoor to Salisbury Plain will be re-examinby the Ministry of Defence.    The consultative machinery wi-1-prove a convenient forum to which to report the outcome.
sParagraph 304.    The limitation of public access to the landaround the road mentioned in this paragraph does not seem to u&quot;to be a matter for the Ministry of Defence, which has no power&quot;to regulate members of the public except when firing is inprogress and the Byelaws are operative.Paragraph 305.    In the light of this recommendation the Ministryof Defence will immediately begin discussions with all concerned,on the question of transfer of training from the National Trustland at Ringmoor to another part of the National Park.l*i addition to the specific recommendations at paragraphs 299 to307, Lady Sharp makes a number of individual suggestions onbatters of detail in the body of her Report.    It seems to us that&quot;these may well form suitable topics for discussion by theProposed consultative machinery.
