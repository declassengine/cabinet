DoCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S government cp(77) 57 COPY NO     020 May 1977CABINETDRAFT WHITE PAPER ON THE FLOWERS report memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. At their meeting on 17 May the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy agreed that the White Paper drafted in response to the Sixth Reportof the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, Nuclear Power andthe Environment (Cmnd 6618, &quot;The Flowers Report&quot;), should be amended as they had agreed and circulated for clearance by members of Cabinet witha view to publication as soon as possible.2. I am circulating with this memorandum copies of the revised version.    I shall assume that my colleagues are content with it unless Ireceive any comments by close of business on Tuesday 24 May.    Subjectto that, my intention is to publish it on Friday 27 May.    The Lord Presidenthas indicated that he will try to provide time for a debate on it at an earlydate after the recess.3. In the light of the discussion in the Ministerial Group on NuclearNon-Proliferation (GEN 74) this morning, I have expanded paragraph 33,which deals with the form in which plutonium is returned to foreigncustomers.P department of the Environment20 May 1977

The Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on-*ronmerital Pollution^ has made an important contribution to the wide-ranging debate on    .ls subject which is increasingly coming to be conducted at the international asWell - .ds the national level.   The most recent manifestation of this internationalgt was at the Downing Street Summit on 7-8 Lay.2.*     itGd I:inSdom has been engaged in the development of nuclear power for:&apos;Coful- Purposes for more than 25 years, and over that tine has had an excellentln ensuring the safety of nucle; r plants, their fuel and the wastes that ariseeir use.

The Royal Commission have drawn parti^attention however to other aspects of nuclear power, notably its social, environ^and security effects, which will have to be understood ana resolved before there is any large-scale commitment to this form, of energy.Pho &apos;:loy:A ::oisssion concluded th: t the abandonment of unclear fission power ^b, neither wise nor justified.

In fact,  the relatively favourable prospects for the Unitedenergy economy in the medium term give us time to develop, with the help of publi&quot;policies for this period.    Power stations built under earlier program^5will ensure a nuclear contribution to our energy supplies for the remaining yearsofid 1this century although, if there were no further stations, this contribution wou-ia peal; in the 1980s and decline in the 1990s as stations are decommissioned.    :1of our eventual coir.fi.itfi.ent can only be resolved in decisions taken progressivelythe years in the liHit of national need,  and of the acceptability to the countrylarge of the possible economic, social and environmental impact of an extended nprogramme.

The Commission recommended (40) that a Nuclear Waste Management AdvisoryCommittee should be set up to advise the responsible Ministers on broad, policy issues affecting radioactive waste management.

They felt that since the Committee would need to see the results of appropriate development work before it proffered   informedadvice, the Committee itself should sponsor and direct long-term research (forup to 10 or 20 years) and have funds guaranteed to it for that length of time.The Commission also considered that the Committee should be a statutory body.17.

Tho commission q report does not attempt to deal with the environmental implicationof the radioactive wastes which arise in the defence nuclear programme.

The Government welcome the Commission^ endorsement in its conclusions (3)of the present practice under which basic standards for permissible exposure toradiation are recommended by an independent scientific body, the international commission on Radiological Protection.   The recommended standards form the basis of ahuratofji Directive to the member states of the huropcan Communities laying down the basic standards for the health protection of workers and the general public againstthe dangers of ionizing radiations,   although advice on the adequacy of these standardhas been available to the Government from the National Radiological Protection Board(NRP3), the Secretary of State for Social  Services will now, in view of the Coiiifuissi011recommendation (4) that it should tutory responsibility in this field, pl&amp;c

The Medical Research council will continue to provide advice about the biological bases on which radiologicalprotection standards rest.24.   The Government also note the Commission&apos;o conclusions, which accord with theirown expert advice, that, at the levels likely to be permitted in relation to possiblesomatic effects, the genetic effects of radiation should not be significant (1);-rid taat, on present evidence,  the derived standards for plutonium exposure anduptake are not seriously in error (2).25.   The Government agree with the Commission (10) that there should be a clearlocation of responsibility for initiating; and co-ordinating research into the effects of radioactivity on man and the environment, and for identifying gaps and overlaps.Thifci function however can be mere appropriately performed by a J* inister than (asthe Commission suggested) by the MRPB and, in view of his new responsibility forluclear waste management policy,  it is right that it should be exercised by the secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland ana dales, acting jointly.   The-e;v.,rt:..o&quot;.tc concerned will collaborate closely with the Ministry of Agriculture,fisheries and Food (Wu?F).   Research contracts already incorporate freedom to publishpecults subject only to patent and security considerations, as the Commission wished.&quot;i:.ilar considerations apply to the Commission&apos;c recommendation (13) about thet-vcrall strategic responsibility for initiating and co-ordinating monitoring in&quot;onnection with environmental pathways, which will also more appropriately lie withWie-Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and ,/ales, acting jointly,than with the NRPB.    The Departments concerned will collaborate closely with kAFFthe *TRPB.

Jn accordance with the Commissions recommendation (12),  the Department ofthe &quot;nvironment (DCF), the Scottish Development Department and th-  Welsh office willin PutiTH publish an annual survey of discharges of radioactivity to air, water and land from all civil    nuclear installations.    for security reasons,  it will not be possible to include an account of similar discharges   from all defence installationsbut this information, will ho available within btr. so that the survey can certifythat the r.-n.;ral level of such uicchurgeo is acceptable and thus present a comprehend&apos;picture.    r&apos;he Commission also reoomuicnded that the HRP3 si oulo periouically publish a. comprehensive report on tho total radiation exposure of the public: the 1TRPB havealready published one report for the purucse and have confirmed that they will publicui    ted versions, with extended coverage, from time to time.28.    rT,he &quot;-government agree with the Commission^ conclusion (17) that the risk of serious accident in any sigle reactor is extremely small, and note their view t&apos;-u.ttin- hazards posed by reactor accidents are not unique in scale, nor of such a kindas to suggest that nuclear power should he abandoned for this reason alone.29.    The duclc r Installations Inspectorate, which now forms part cf the HealthSafety Executive (HS?&apos;)., provides advice to government on nuclear safety (for exafflpl6&apos;through the study it is at present carrying out for the Secretary of State for 5!ner on the safety of Pressurised Hater Reactors).   The Commission recommended (19) ^HST&apos;] should also ensure that there is a supplementary source of independent expert advice, and this role will be filled by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Kuclost all.at ions, which is being set up to advice the health, and Safety Commission(and., through them,  if necessary, the relevant Ministers) in place   of the formerHuetear Safety Advisory Committee.30.    In accordance with the Commission^ recommendation (15), the Secretary of St3for Social Services will rive the MRPB a direction making them formally

They also considered *(23) that the construction of a crude nuclear*eon byan illicit group is a ere dible possibility.

In fact,security measures in connection with the transport and storage0f Plutonium have been greatly strengthened over the last two years,  and will beteviewed at regular intervals.K   n,ine Commission are right to draw attention (26) to the need to consider carefully,Ang future decisions about large-scale nuclear development, the effects of possibleJ measures.    In the context of trying to find an appropriate balance between^0ssible effects of nuclear power on civil liberties and its possible benefits-   omic growth, the Government advance the following considerations which seembe cfsignificance.&apos; Hoever the hazards of plutonium are rated in relation to those posed by otherngeroussubstances, it is certainly a possible target for terrorists.

The- as*istGovernment&apos;s hooe is that,  together with this White .Japer, it will promote ana athe ^a wide-ranging debate on all aspects of esergy policy, in which the debate on *i0nuclear power should play in meeting our energy needs will be one element&apos;.propoocd Dnergy Commission     will also have a part to play in promoting such a,,Q) t&amp;Xdebate.

(CONFIDE NT!

They also accept that, before any decision is taken on CPR1, this procedure should besettled and announced.43.     The particular environmental and social problems of nuclear power are unique.   At the same time the debate about nuclear power now inProgress in this country and in other developed countries is one element in the wider debate about future energy needs, supplies and conservation.   And thatwider debate itself contributes to still more general concerns relating to the use and conservation of resources; the need for economic growth; and the goals andotGectives of society at large.   The Government will give further thought to the0mPlex problems of energy policy, in the light of the Royal Commissions report,n Preparing the forthcoming Green Paper on this subject.c(confidential)
