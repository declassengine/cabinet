document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government82cp(77) 56 copy no17 May 1977cabinetSALE OF BP STOCKMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. In his paper CP(77) 53 the Secretary of State for Energy argues thatthe sale of the BP stock should be deferred.    For the reasons given below,I do not believe that deferment of the sale is a serious option if we want the benefit of the proceeds in 1977-78.    Indeed in practice, deferment islikely to mean abandonment of the sale.    I therefore remain strongly ofthe view, which Cabinet has twice endorsed, that it is right for us to sell17. 4 per cent of BP stock from the 68. 2 per cent now in the hands of theauthorities.2.        We decided in November to sell the stock, and we confirmed thisdecision in March, because the alternatives were measures which wouldhave had damaging consequences for jobs and for prices.    Our situation iscertainly stronger than it was when we took the difficult decisions whichfaced us at the end of 1976.    But it is so because we took those decisions,and have since then vigorously pursued the policies which flowed from them.&quot;We still face major problems, not least in avoiding a wage explosion, andit would in my view be foolhardy to add to them by abandoning an important element of the package which we put together with so much difficulty.3-        It is of course true that the financial outturn for 1977-78 may bettore favourable than were the forecasts when we took our decisions.    Butthe financial year is only a few weeks old, and it is too soon to say whether there will be any scope for general relaxation of the economic policies towhich we have committed ourselves.    Even if there were, we should want to consider carefully the priorities which we should attach to the variousoptions that would be open to us.    A decision not to sell the BP stockwould do nothing tc help with the problems of unemployment and prices which we face.    Nor would it affect in any way the basis of our relationship with BP.    We have agreed to increase our permanent holding in the company to 51 per cent (at a cost of some  100 million) and this has presentational^vantages.    But the relationship will continue as it did when we held only48 per cent of the stock.
4. The timing of the sale is considerably influenced by the character ofthe operation, which is one of great technical complexity.    The issue willbe about twice as large as the biggest stock issue that has ever taken placeon any market.    It has to be carefully planned, months in advance, if themarket is to be able to absorb it at all.    The Bank of England are keepinga period in the middle of June clear of other major issues, so that themarket will have the capacity to take up the stock.    If we miss this period,we may not have the chance of mounting the sale effectively later in the year.We should in feet be limited to September if we wanted to retain the option of payment in two tranches in 1977-78, which our advisers propose as a means of spreading the load on the market.    A further review of the policyin the autumn, as the Secretary of State suggests, would be incompatible witha sale on this basis, which is designed to get the best price for the stock.5. Even if it were a practicable alternative, there would be no advantage in deferring ths sale.    Delay will not satisfy those in the Party who are opposed to the sale in principle, and whose arguments we have consideredbefore.    It would not even put us in a better position to deal with the sort ofissues raised by the Secretary of State, many of which we have also considered before.    It is idle to suppose that, over the sort of period whichit takes to mount an operation of this sort, the market will remain stableat a high level.    Of course the value of the shares might increase between now and the autumn.    We have always recognised this possibility, and indeedWe could not mount a sale of this sort on anything but a rising market.    Itis easy to imagine the arguments that would be used against any attempt tosell on a falling market.0* I believe that if we do not proceed with the sale now we shall find thatwe are unable to mount it at all in 1977-78.    Certainly the news that it hadbeen deferred (which would be bound to become obvious to the market) would call in question the Governments resolve, and would make the decision weshould face more difficult, not less difficult, when we returned to it.conclusion invite my colleagues to confirm the decision which we have already taken, to sell an amount of BP stock that will leave the total of theGovernment&apos;s and the Bank&apos;s holdings at 51 per cent.    I also invite themto agree that we should proceed with the sale without further delay, on lines agreed in the Ministerial Group which considered the arrangements.J treasury Chambers*7 May 1977SECRET
