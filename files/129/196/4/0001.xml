3CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 54COPY NO 0017 May 1977 0 &amp;CABINET1977 UP-RATINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Minister for Social Security1. In summing up the discussion of this issue on 12 May(CM(77) 19th Conclu sions, Minute 2) the Prime Minister said that there was considerable support in the Cabinet for our compromise proposal for a15 per cent up-rating of social security benefits.    We remain convincedthat, in order to carry out our legal obligations as set out in the attorney general&apos;s minute of 12 May, this is the minimum we can recommend.However, we were asked to give further information on other optionscanvassed in discussion, and to circulate a paper in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury.    The following options are costed in the annex to the paper and discussed below:-a. A lower up-rating than 15 per cent, with an interim up-rating if necescary.b. A lower up-rating than 15 per cent, with a Christmas bonus.c. An up-rating for short-term benefits lower than that forlong-term ones.A LOWER UP-RATING THAN 15 PER CENT, WITH INTERIM UP-RATINGOperationally the earliest date for an interim up-rating to restorea shortfall at November 1977 would be the week beginning 16 May 1978 -lQng after any shortfall became known in mid-December.    It could eithercover the shortfall on the November figure alone or it could also compensate*or the rise in prices between November 1977 and May 1978.    It would bevery difficult politically to avoid the latter (indeed, Parliament might forceUs to it) and this would be very expensive.    For example, if inflation were5 Per cent between November 1977 and May 1978 the additional cost would be 270 million.    There would also be a serious risk of being driven to aPermanent cycle of two up-ratings a year,    which would inevitably be farr^ore costly than our present annual commitment, both in benefits and administration.    As the Department of Health and Social Security is notstaffed for continuous work on upratings, and is trying to cut staff, therewould certainly be industrial troubles, as in 1974.
3. These disadvantages argue, decisively againet risking the need for an interim up-rating by going for an imprudently low up-rating now.A CHRISTMAS BONUS PAYMENT4. Though the idea of an extra payment to pensioners at Christmas mayhave some political appeal, there are strong arguments against it:-a. A bonus does not help to fulfil the Secretary of State&apos;sstatutory duty,    It can be presented only as something extra,beyond what is necessary to inflation-proof the basic rates.b. It requires legislation, which would have to be introduced inOctober (before we knew whether the November up-rating wouldmatch prices) and would be open to amendment on amount, and numbers of people covered,    Attempts to amend the amount cfthe pension rate itself could not be ruled out.c. A bonus is arbitrary in cover:  it has to be limited to pensioners and certain other long-term beneficiaries, andexcludes the unemployed.    It cannot easily be taxed and benefitsbetter and worse-off pensioners indiscriminately.    It is alsoarbitrary in amount:  it can only be paid at a flat rate while theamount of each individuals loss will depend on his familycircumstances.    This arbitrariness was our main argument fordiscontinuing a bonus after 1974.d. A bonus costs  100 million for each  10 - and since  10was the figure three years ago, it might be thought inadequatenow.    The administrative cost would be  2 million.    If werestored a bonus this Christmas, it would almost certainly haveto be repeated in future years.These arguments would apply equally to a bonus held back to make good any shortfall in November.    This could not be paid before February 1973,and would have no political attraction.    If we said we were ready tooontemplate it, we should be open to political and legal attack on the validity of the rates we had set.&apos; We think it would be wrong to commit extra expenditure to a bonus,rather than putting it into the weekly benefit rates to reduce the risk ofshortfall.    Certainly we could not accept the risk of a 13.1 per cent increase;and a bonus added to an increase of 14.4 per cent would in fact cost more^an a 15 per cent up-rating.    (Assuming a further  10 bonus at Christmas9^8, the cost over two years would be  360 million compared with251 million for the 15 per cent up-rating.    Even if the bonus could be confined to .1977 a 15 per cent up-rating is still  9 million cheaper. )2
A SMALLER INCREASE FOR SHORT-TERM THAN FOR LONG-TERMBENEFICIARIES7. Arguments advanced for treating short-term beneficiaries lessfavourably are that the needs of those receiving them are not so great;  thebenefit is tax-free;  tax refunds and earnings-related supplements may bereceived;  and that it would be right, on incentive grounds, because benefits are high compared with net earnings.8, We think there are stronger arguments on the other side.a. There is a statutory obligation to protect the value of short-term benefits as well as pensions.b. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) would strongly opposea lower increase for the unemployed and the sick.    So wouldmany of our supporters,c. Many people are on &quot;short-term&quot; rates for long periods -in particular the unemployed who can never get the long-termsupplementary benefit rates.d. Supplementary benefit rates for children are uprated by only the same percentage as short-term benefits, even when their parents are on the long-term scale rate themselves.e. There is already a large cash differential between long and short-term rates.    Last year we gave a slightly larger percentage increase to narrow the gap proportionately.    It would be hard tojustify a reversal this year.f. The &quot;incentives&quot; argument for a lower increase on short-term benefits is based largely on the value of earnings-relatedsupplements, which are received by only a fifth of thoseunemployed, and tax rebates, which are usually available only for short periods if at all.g. Only a minority of the unemployed on supplementary benefitreceive exceptional needs payments (which average only 40p a week).The long-term unemployed, shown by the Department of Health and social Security surveys to be the group worst off, do not in generalqualify for discretionary weekly additions, such as heating additions,which are often paid to pensioners.9. We therefore believe that it would be socially and politically wrong to depress the short-term rates further than we propose.    Under ourcompromise proposal the rounding conventions lead to 14. 7 pei cent for short-term, 15 per cent for long-term benefits.    This differential would bedefensible against the TUC by reference to the rounding conventions.    a bigger differential would be unlikely to take any more heat out of thescroungers&quot; issue and would save little money - a 14 per cent up-rating^would  save only  6 million in 1977-78*    The odium with our supporters, and,vith the TUC in the middle of phase 3 negotiations, is hardly worth it.3
10.       The Chief Secretary, on the other hand, helieves that a smallerincrease in untaxed short-term benefits, which on his proposal would still beprice protected, would be more than justified at a time when real earningshave been declining.    Any margin on the up-rating would worsen the alreadyserious disincentives problems.COSTS11. The financial implications of the various options discussed in the paperare shown in the Annex.CONCLUSIONS12.       The Chief Secretary believes that the right course is to adhere to his original proposal that the up-rating should be the 13. 1 per cent required onthe basis of the Governments published prices forecast up to the end of theyear.    He would, however,  be prepared to agree that if, in the event, theactual price movement exceeded 13. 1 per cent, the November 1978 up-ratingwould make good the shortfall by restoring benefits to November 1976 values.13.       Our own view is that the arguments against relying on an interimup-rating are overwhelming on legal political, financial and administrativegrounds.    A Christmr-s bonus may have some political attraction but it is nota fair way to distribute  any available money;  and. crucially, it would not counttowards fulfilling our legal obligations.    It is, in effect, a separate issue:do we wish to spend part of the contingency reserve on this?    If the price of aChristmas bonus was a lower up-rating and as a result we failed to matchinflation we might still have to face an interim up-rating as well.    We conclude that our compromise proposal of a 15 per cent up-rating (14. 7 per cent for short-term benefits) is the only option which we can be reasonably confidentwill fulfil the legal obligation, sustain our social priorities, satisfy our supporters and carry through the House.D ES OApartment of Health and Social Security17 May 19774
