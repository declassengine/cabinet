DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 66 COPY NO23 June 1977CABINETGOVERNMENT STRATEGYMemorandum by the Central Policy Review StaffINTRODUCTION1. The Government will face a difficult Parliamentary situation foi therest of the present Parliament.    This means that, to some extent, theGovernment finds itself already in a pre-election situation.     Ministerstherefore need to take stock.    The decisions whichhave to be taken on thebasis of such a stocktaking are essentially political decisions.    This paper is intended to provide Ministers with a basis fcr discussion of their political options:  it has merit if it highlights the right questions.    OnlyMinisters can judge whether it has actually identified the right issues; and only Ministers can decide the politically viable answers.background. Since December, confidence has improved;   sterling is stronger than expected:  the balance of payments has improved faster than expected;despite the jump this month unemployment, which was expected to go onrising, has not done so.    If the Government can secure a reasonable prospect of bringing down the rate of inflation in 1977-78 the economicsituation could go on improving;  and by 1978 North Sea oil will help theimprovement further, on the balance of payments side if not on employment.This suggests that it is probably in the Governmenfs interests to carry oninto 1978, with the intention of going to the country on its own terms at atime of its own choosing later on;  rather than have an election in 1977.3. If this is right, Ministers now need i. to decide upon their strategy for the remainder of the present Parliament, and ii. to formulate and present that strategy as a basis for continuing policies in the nextParliament.    For if it is to succeed, the Government will need to create a clear impression to the public that it has a coherent strategy, long-term and short-term;  that it knows what it is doing and where it is going.
THE STARTING POINT4. In a large number of areas, the Government&apos;s general strategy and objectives are already fairly clearly defined:a.    Macro-economic policy:   the possibility of an alternative strategybased on widespread import restrictions was discussed by ministers at length in the autumn of 1976:  the decision not to adopt a policy ofgeneral protection was clearly stated in December and reaffirmed atthe Downing Street Summit.D&apos;    Counter-inflation policy:  an agreement with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) via the Social Contract;  an orderly return to   (collective bargaining, consistent with a progressive reduction in therate of inflation to single figures by spring 1978; monetary andfiscal deflation only in the last resort.    No return to majorsubsidisation of either nationalised industries prices, or food prices.c*    Public expenditure:   after the massive increases in 1973-74(which they inherited from the previous Administration) and of1974-75 (which they inherited from Manifesto commitments)Ministers have at last - with a lot of pain and grief - got public expenditure under control;  and they have reinforced previous controlarrangements with cash limits.    They need to continue to demon-strate clearly that such increases as they do agree are not greaterthan the economy can sustain - increases followed by a run on sterling and yet another &quot;cuts exercise&quot; would be politically adisaster.d.    Public ownership:  the shipbuilding and aerospace industries have been brought into public ownership;  the realities of theParliamentary situation imply that further extensions of public ownership are effectively ruled out until after the next GeneralElection.e-    Industrial policy:   the industrial strategy has been launchedthough it has yet to produce results.    Jt will not be easy to achieveearly results against the current background of high unemployment and reduced incentives.    What is needed now is to press ahead and make the industrial strategy effective (where necessary extend and strengthen it) - this is not time to pull it up by the roots and startagain;  here, perhaps more than anywhere else, continuity isessential.The legislative achievement:   a lot of Manifesto commitmentshave been translated to the Statute Book;  eg dismantling the conservatives&apos; Industrial Relations Act;  Employment Protection;Health and Safety;  Child Benefit;  Sex Discrimination;  BetterPensions;  Invalid Care Allowances;  Pay Beds;  Capital TransferTax;  Community Land Scheme;  etc.
8* Major policy statements or consultative documents have been (or are about to be) published on -defenceoverseas aidhousingtransportinner citiesnew townsenergynuclear power and the environmentwateragricultureeducationlocal authority financepriorities fcr health and personal social servicesHere again, Ministers need i. to take credit for what they have done,and ii. be seen to be actively carrying forward and developing the policies set out in these various statements and consultativedocuments.h.    Continuing policies in areas such as Rhodesia, Northern Ireland,the North/South dialogue where the Government can claim credit forsteering a constructive course through very difficult waters.5. Against this background of the Governmenfs existing policycommitments and achievements, what are the issues which might be high-lighted i. as objectives for the longer term (ie the next Parliament) and ii.as issues for the remainder of this Parliament?POSSIBLE THEMES FOR THE LONGER TERM6- a-    The use of North Sea oil to promote national recovery - a more detailed analysis of what this would involve and what could beachieved.b. The return to acceptable levels of unemployment - the extent towhich the achievement of this depends on moderate levels of inflationthrough the period and on increased industrial efficiency.c. Regional Policy.    In recent years the significance and effectiveness of regional policy has declined.    Yet regionalproblems (and inner city problems) are greater than ever.    Officialsare examining how policies can best be administered andco-ordinated by people on the spot to deal with the particular problems of individual areas.    (GEN 58. )
d. Energy Conservation.    Increased priority to energy conserva-tion and the development of renewable energy resources would be welcomed both domestically and internationally.e. The Caring and Tolerant Society.    In the face of the economictroubles of the past three years, the Government has done well bypensioners and the very poor.    It could plan to do more forpensioners, children, the handicapped, minority racial groups.    Itcould build on the results of the Great Debate on Education.f. Increased participation in decision-making - at the place of workand in the Boardroom; in social services and education.g. Taxation.    By international standards the United Kingdom issomewhere in the middle in terms of tax levels.    But everyonebelieves we are too highly taxed.    This is partly due to the high proportion of direct personal tax and its steep and earlyprogressivity.    Any changes will take a number of years to bringabout but are there v/ays of reducing direct personal tax rates,rearranging the tax burden or simplifying the tax system so as toimprove incentives and make the system seem less oppressive?ISSUES IN THE SHORT TERM7. The issues which the Government chooses to take up in the shortterm will in part depend on those which it decides to accent for the longer term.    But there are, in addition, bound to be a number of very difficult questions which the Government will have thrust upon it -notably the next pay round;  devolution;  the level of unemployment;industrial democracy;  decisions in the energy field;and perhaps some unforecastable difficulties in Southern Africa, the middle east or Northern Ireland.THE NEXT PAY ROUND3. This is probably the most urgent and the most critical.    If the TUCsay &quot;No Stage in&quot;, meaning by that that they cannot i. formulate and agree apay formula consistent with a counter-inflation target acceptable to theGovernment;  ii. get their members to deliver it (and the signs are that theymay not be able to achieve either of these), then what can the Governmentput in its place?    One way or another the Government must find a solution which is consistent both with an orderly return to free collective bargainingand a genuine deceleration in the rate of inflation (even if not achieving the target of single figures within the next 12 months).
9. This will depeud i. on reaching by early July a minimum acceptableagreement with the TUC (preferably with some element of a &quot;norm&quot; at a level which would decelerate inflation);  ii. on a statement by Ministers inthe course of July which builds on this agreement and maintains confidence;and iii. on the ability of the Government and the TUC to handle a number ofawkward individual cases as they ariss during the next round.    The obtainingof such an agreement might be influenced by the Government policy onreflation - see below.DEVOLUTION10.        Can Ministerb envisage some form of legislation (including thepossibility of separate Bills for Wales and for Scotland) which has a good chance of getting through the House - given the hardening of conservative opposition and the view of some Northern Labour Members of Parliament?If not, can the Government retain the Liberal support (while not getting intoa position of introducing new legislative proposals which are defeated) by -a. reaffirming the commitment to devolution;b. recognising that an acceptable Bill does not command wide enough support in the House;c. emphasising the need to get devolution right - possibly a new approach to a new Select Committee;d. defeiring a new legislative initiative until the next Parliament?THE LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT11.        The Government has a good record of specific pieces of action to mitigate the short-run unemployment problems, particularly for the young.The latest package which includes the Manpower Services Commissionprogramme is. a further valuable set of measures.    But the level ofunemployment will remain unacceptably high.    Is there room for reflation?How much?    How soon?    What form should it take - cut taxes or increasepublic expenditure&apos;    To have a rapid effect it would need to be concentrated on tax cuts, or transfer payments, rather than increasedGovernment expenditure on real resources.12.        Longer term the central threat to employment remains the rate of inflation.    The growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), improvements in real take-home pay, and longer-term reduction in unemployment, will depend on how much progress can be made over the next 12-18 months in reducing the rate of inflation.    This will depend in turn on the next payround.
13.        But immediately there are good grounds for believing that there is some room for reflation -i. GDP has grown, and is now forecast to grow slower than expected at the time of the public expenditure cuts last December.ii. Largely as a result, the balance of payments current account ismuch nealthier than was then forecast.iii. With lower interest rates, and tightly controlled public expenditure, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement is nowforecast to be lower than was then expected.Buti. The Finance Bill has yet to be completed and tax receipts are more than usually uncertain.ii. This year&apos;s Public Expenditure Survey may well show great difficulties in keeping to last year&apos;s public expenditure plans evenwithout new reflationary measures.iii. The agreement with the International Monetary Fund imposesclose limits:  what would be the effect of going beyond those limits onour ability to borrow abroad, on confidence in sterling and on theexchange rate?INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY14.       Attitudes have hardened for and against the Bullock Report, and aswith devolution, substantive legislation would not get through the House.15.        The Government can make progress in the nationalised industries (onan ad hoc basis, industry by industry) and can prepare a paper (white insome parts, green in others) which sets out how the Government proposes toproceed to take industrial democracy forward, including a discussion of thearguments for and against parity, single channel representation and other areas of controversy.    It could advance proposals for an industrial democracy Commission.CONCLUSIONS16.        Ministers may wish:-a. To note the achievements so far this Parliament.b. To discuss the main areas which they would concentrate on in thenext Parliament.
c.    To consider how for the remainder of this Parliament they wouldhaadle both the difficult major issues which cannot be avoided andthe areas they would wish to concentrate on for the longer term.Cabinet Office23 June 1977
