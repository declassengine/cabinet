DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 62 COPY NO      8217 June 1977CABINETEUROPEAN ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentBACKGROUND1. At the meeting of the Cabinet on 16 June (CM(77) 22nd Conclusions),I was invited to circulate copies of the draft European Assembly ElectionsBill together with an explanatory covering note, a recommended course ofaction and the amendment which would be needed if the regional list systemwere to be replaced by a simple majority system.STRUCTURE OF THE bill. The attached Bill sets out our proposed national provisions for european Assembly elections.    We have undertaken to allow a free vote on the electoral system to be used and the Bill has been designed to enable a choice to be made between a regional list system and a simple majoritysystem.    Annex A explains the details of the Bill.3.        If the Bill were passed as it stands, the regional list system wouldbe used unless a resolution of the House of Commons were passed directingthat the simple majority system should be used instead.    The text of an amendment to provide for elections to take place on the simple majoritysystem is set out in Annex B.FINANCE AND MANPOWER4&apos; The financial implications of the Bill cannot be predicted with any certainty.    On the basis of the 1975 referendum, the cost of Assemblyelections will be at least  10 million;  but it could be considerably greaterby the time the elections are held, there have been rises in fees for election staff and in postal charges.    The manpower implications of theBill are not significant except for the temporary staff employed by returning officers on the day of the election itself.1
GOVERNMENT STATEMENT5. The Bill as drafted contains an implied preference for a regionallist electoral system, but the Liberals are pressing us to make a positiverecommendation in favour of this system when the Bill is introduced.    Inthe circumstances I believe we should do this, although our recommendations should be in terms which will not antagonise unnecessarily those of our supporters who favour the simple majority system.    If my colleagues agree, I would propose to make a suitable statement to the House on theday the Bill is introduced.recommendation.        I invite my colleagues to agree that:a. The European Assembly Elections Bill, as drafted, shouldbe introduced in the House of Commons on 24 June;  and b. I should on that day make a suitable statement.M RHome Office17 June 19772
RESTRICTEDAnnex a european ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS bill.       The draft European Assembly Elections Bill incorporates two alternative electoral systems.   The two systems are set out infull to enable Parliament to choose between them on the basis of afull understanding of both.   The Bill consists of four parts,^uese are described below. art I; Preliminary2*       Clause 1 provides for the holding of elections.   Clause 2allocates the United kingdom&apos;s 81 seats between England, Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland.   Clause 3 provides that european assembly elections shall be held on a regional list system as described in Part II; this is, however, subject to a provision&quot;that would enable the House of Commons to substitute the simple majority system (with STV in Northern Ireland).    It is intended that the main debate on the electoral system for European AssemblySections should take place on Part I of the Bill.   The provisionfor a resolution by the House of Commons is a purely technicaldevice which could be removed once a decision of principle had beentaken. art ii; Regional List System5-      Part II, which consists of Clauses 4-11 and Schedules 1-3,Ascribes the Regional List System.   This is basically the systemoutlined in Annex B of the White Paper (Cmnd 6768).The proposed electoral regions for the regional list systemScotland,Wales, Northern Ireland and the economic planning^gions of England, with a separate region consisting of greater london.   The division of England into electoral regions is set out111 Schedule 1.    The detailed arrangements for the conduct of a regional list system are set out in Schedule 2.   The basic conceptls that electors would each have one vote which they cast for a*&amp;med candidate in their region, but that the votes of all thecaudidates in one political party or group in a region are totalled,RESTRICTED
with seats being allocated in the region in accordance with thegroup&apos;s share of the total regional vote.   Candidates who wish to declare themselves as members of the same political party or group would be required to be nominated on a joint nomination paper.Nominations would have to be supported by a proposer, a seconderand*4-8 other signatures.   Candidates would be required to make adeposit of  500 which would be returnable to all the candidates ofa group which obtained one-quarter of the electoral quota orsucceeded in obtaining at least one seat (Pules 8 and 55 of schedule 2).5.       The detailed provisions for the allocation of seats are contained in Rule 50 of Schedule 2, which adopts the &quot;highest average&quot;Principle.   The form of the ballot paper for the regional listsystem is set out at the end of Schedule 2.6-       Clause 7 and Schedule 3 lay down arrangements for the fillingof vacancies that occur between ordinary elections.    In essence, the vacancy would be offered to the next candidate of the party or groupthat held the seat.    If no such candidate was able or willing totake the vacant seat, it would be necessary to hold a by-election. art III: Simple Majority System (with STV in Northern Ireland),?-      Part III, which consists of Clauses 12-17 and Schedule 4,Ascribes a simple majority system of elections for Great britain with STV in Northern Ireland.   There would be single member constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales drawn up by therespective Parliamentary Boundary Commissions.   These constituencies^ould be based on groupings of present Westminster constituencies.Northern Ireland would constitute a single three-member constituency^d elections there would take place by the single transferable vote (STV) system.8*      The Boundary.Commission procedures set out in Schedule 4follow option B of paragraph 30 of the White Paper on DirectSections to the European Assembly (Cmnd 6768).   This provides for0ne round of representations but no local inquiries for the initial^vision into constituencies in Great Britain.   This Option would
RESTRICTEDtake a minimun of 18 weeks from Royal Assent to the time thatthe Commissions would submit their reports.   Subsequent reviewswould follow the normal, full procedures involving possiblytwo rounds of representations and local inquiries.    (Schedule 4could be amended to provide for no. representations or localinquiries for the initial division of Great Britain intoconstituencies.   The Boundary Commissions would require a minimumQf 9 weeks from Royal Assent for this procedure.) art iv9.       Part IV of the Bill (Clauses 18-22) includes provisions thatare common to both regional list and simple majority systems.   Themost important of these relate to the prohibition of double voting,and the expenses of holding the elections.10*   There are other provisions that are in substance common to the regional list system and the simple majority system.   These includethe franchise, disqualification for candidature and judicialProceedings as to disqualification.   The Bill proposes that the franchise should be as for Westminster elections with the inclusionQ  Peers.    On disqualification, the Bill proposes some modifications&quot;ko the House of Commons disqualification provisions, in particular^o allow Peers and all Clergy to stand for elections.   There is noRequirements that candidates should be Members of Parliament at westminster.
HESTCICTEDANNEX BAMENDMENTS TO bill* The following amendment would make the Bill provide exclusivelyfor elections under the simple majority system for Great Britain andSTV for Northern Ireland:&quot;Clause 3, page 1, line 17, leave out from beginning to&quot;Assembly1 in line 5 on page 2.&quot;2.     There would also be a series of amendments to leave outclauses 4-11 and schedules 1-3.    These amendments would not be moved as such, but would, in accordance with normal practice,indicate the intention to omit these clauses and schedules byNegativing clause-stand-part.RESTOBCTED

Clause 6 provides that Assembly elections, whether general or by-elections, are conducted in accordance with the rules setout in Schedule 2 to the Bill. The clause also provides that,apart from these rules, the elections are governed by regulations made by the Secretary of State. The regulations may, in par-ticular, make provision as to the limitation of candidates&apos;election expenses and as to the questioning of an election orof the filling of a vacant seat without a by-election.Clause 7 provides that a general election is held on a dayappointed by the Secretary of State and also provides that, if aby-election is held to fill a vacancy, it is held on a day appointedby the Secretary of State. A by-election will not be necessarywhere the vacancy can be filled from amongst the fellow candi-dates of the former representative in accordance with the pro-visions of Schedule 3.Clause 8 provides for the appointment of regional and localreturning officers to conduct elections.

Subsection (1) provides that those entitled to voteat Assembly elections are parliamentary electors entitled to voteat a parliamentary election in respect of an address within theAssembly constituency and peers entitled to vote at a localgovernment election in respect of an address within the Assemblyconstituency.Subsection (2) describes the system of S.T.V. for use mNorthern Ireland.Subsections (3) and (4) provide that elections are governed by regulations made by the Secretary of State. The regulations may&apos;in particular, make provision as to the conduct of Assemblyelections, as to the limitation of candidates&apos; election expenseand as to the questioning of an election.
Clause 14 provides that a general election is held on a dayappointed by the Secretary of State and also provides that, ifa by-election is held to fill a vacancy, it is held on a dayappointed by the Secretary of State.Clause 15 provides for the appointment of returning officers to conduct elections. In Great Britain local government officers are placed at the disposal of returning officers to assist in thedischarge of functions conferred on them.Clause 16 provides for the disqualification of persons for theoffice of representative to the Assembly.Clause 17 enables judicial proceedings relating to the dis-tjualification of a representative to the Assembly to be taken.Part IVMiscellaneous and SupplementalThis Part contains clauses which are common to both Part and Part III.Clause 18 forbids double voting at general elections to theAssembly.Clause 19 exempts representatives to the Assembly from juryservice in the United Kingdom.Clause 20 provides for the payment of expenses incurred underthe Bill.Clause 21 contains general interpretation provisions.Clause 22 provides for the exercise of the power to make orders and regulations.Schedule 1 describes electoral regions in England and gives the number of seats for each region there.Schedule 2 contains the Assembly election rules for the con-duct of elections under the regional list system.

The combined effect of paragraphs 1, 4(1)(Wand 5 is that for the initial division each Boundary Commission
publishes a notice of their proposed recommendation withrespect to an Assembly constituency but does not hold a local inquiry or publish revised recommendations. Subsequentreviews of Assembly constituencies are made at the same tirneas a Boundary Commission reviews parliamentary constituencies and the procedure of the Boundary Commission is not curtailed-Paragraph 9 requires an Assembly constituency to consist ofaggregated parliamentary constituencies. Paragraph 10 requires the electorate of an Assembly constituency to be as near the electoral quota as is reasonably practicable having regard, where appropriate, to special geographical considerations.FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE BILL AND effects on PUBLIC SERVICE MANPOWERThe cost of elections held under the Bill is likely to be at least 10 million every 5 years. This is mainly attributable to parments for election staff and to postal charges for the free delivery of candidates&apos; election addresses. It will be necessary for lcfareturning officers to recruit temporary staff for duties at pollingstations and for the count, but the effect of the Bill on permaneflpublic service manpower will be minimal.
