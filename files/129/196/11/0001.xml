Part IINTRODUCTION1. This White Paper is the outcome of a major review of inner city policy announced by the Prime Minister on 10 September 1976, and expands on thestatement of policy made by the Secretary of State for the Environment on6 April 1977. It draws on the experience of earlier initiatives, including the urban Programme, and owes a great deal to the studies and experiments ofrecent years: the Educational Priority Areas, Community Development Projects,Area Management trials, development work on Comprehensive CommunityProgrammes, the studies of London Docklands and above all the three InnerArea Studies for which the full reports are about to be published. The white paper may be regarded as the Governments response to the Inner Area Studiesfor which summary reports were published in January of this year. The sum-maries have stimulated public discussion and have prompted the submission of comments from many local authorities and other bodies, who have therebycontributed to the review.2. Since the Second World War, much has been done to improve the conditionsof life in the inner parts of our cities. People have been rehoused; schools havebeen built; there have been improvements in transport. Housing congestionhas been substantially relieved, though in some cities the task is far from complete. While the achievement has been real, too little attention has been paid to the economic well being and to the community life of the inner areas,and the physical fabric in some parts is badly neglected or decayed. The extent and the changed character of the inner area problems are only now becomingfully understood.3. The Government believe that the time has now come to give the innerareas an explicit priority in social and economic policy, even at a time ofparticular stringency in public resources. Comprehensive action is needed.And since the regeneration of the inner cities will take time to achieve, theremust be a long-term commitment to tackle their problems.4.  This White Paper:(a) sets out, in brief, the Governments understanding of the nature ofthe problem (Part II);(b) identifies what needs to be done and records the Governmentscommitment to action (Part III);(c) describes the agencies for action (Part IV);(d) puts forward the Governments proposals for changes in public policy (Part V);(e) makes special mention of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland(Part VI);(f) indicates the Governments intentions about resources and legislation,and embodies a long-term commitment to aid the inner cities(Part VII).
Part IITHE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM5. Many of the inner areas surrounding the centres of our cities suffer, in amarked way and to an unacceptable extent, from economic decline, physicaldecay and adverse social conditions. The Inner Area Studies of parts of liverpool, Birmingham and Lambeth major studies over four years andthe West Central Scotland Study in relation to Glasgow, have underlined theerosion of the inner area economy and the shortage of private investment which might assist the processes of regeneration. They have demonstrated the prevalence of poverty, poor environment and bad housing conditions, andthey have analysed the response of Government. They have also illustrated the differences which exist between the cities they studied Lambeth sufferingstill from high population density and congestion; Glasgow and Liverpoolnow experiencing a lack of demand which is manifest in large areas of vacantland; Birmingham&apos;s situation somewhere between, facing a serious industrialsetback and still subject to strong housing pressures.6. Inner area problems are a feature of many of our older towns but they areat their most serious in the major cities. In smaller cities and older industrial areas there are substantial areas of decay, bad housing, poor employment and social problems. Deprivation exists too in some pre- and post-war councilestates, sometimes on the edge of the big cities. There is undoubtedly a need to tackle the problems of urban deprivation wherever they occur. But there mustbe a particular emphasis on the inner areas of some of the big cities because ofthe scale and intensity of their problems and the rapidity of run-down in population and employment.Economic decline7. The decline in the economic fortunes of the inner areas often lies at the heart of the problem. Compared with their own conurbations, the inner areasof the big cities suffer from higher unemployment at all stages of the economiccycle. In inner areas generally there has developed a mismatch between theskills of the people and the kinds of job available. In some cities such as Glasgowand Liverpool, there is a general lack of demand for labour which affects thewhole conurbation but is particularly severe in the inner areas.8. The inner areas have long had more than the national proportions of un-skilled and semi-skilled workers, the groups among whom unemployment ishighest. In 1971, for example, unskilled and semi-skilled men accounted for38 % of the labour force in inner Birmingham, 35 % in inner Manchester and34% in inner Glasgow, compared to 23% nationally. The loss from the citiesof a higher proportion of skilled than less skilled workers has made unemploy-ment worse. Between 1966-71 only 15% of net migrants from Birminghamcomprised semi-skilled and unskilled workers; from Manchester it was only16 %. Most of those who left were skilled and managerial people.
9. At the same time, there has been a loss of jobs in the traditional industries the older service industries like the docks and the railways and in manufactur-ing industries. A large number of firms have closed, many of them small firms.Sometimes this has been brought about by redevelopment, when the firms havenot found new premises in the area or have decided to go out of business forother reasons. Some firms have moved out of the inner cities to find bettersites. But generally, the movement of firms has been a contributory factor,not a major cause of decline. In some areas the main cause of job losses hasbeen the closure of large manufacturing firms and, more generally, the shrinkagein employment in large firms.10. There has not been enough investment in new manufacturing industry tocounterbalance these job losses. Major new enterprises have tended to preferperipheral locations to the inner city. The growth of new service industries and office jobs has benefited the inner cities broadly in line with the nationaltrend, but the jobs created have been different and have not made up for theloss of manual jobs.Physical decay11. The most characteristic single feature of the inner city is the age of itshousing. Despite the extensive redevelopment and clearance of slum propertysince the war, there still remains a great deal of poor quality housing lackingbasic amenities, not in good repair and set in a drab environment.12. In some cities the processes of clearance and redevelopment have gotbadly out of step. The bulldozers have done their work, but the rebuilding haslagged behind. Sometimes this has been caused by changes of plan as more people left the cities than expected. In other instances it has resulted fromreductions in the allocation of resources, central and local. Whatever the explanation, there is a wide extent of vacant land in some inner areas, mainly in public ownership; and there is much under-used land and property, withshops boarded up and sites and buildings neglected. The opportunitiesafforded by redevelopment to create public open space have not been taken.13. This shabby environment, the lack of amenities, the high density remaining in some parts and the poor condition of the older housing in the inner areascontrast sharply with better conditions elsewhere. They combine together tomake these areas unattractive, both to many of the people who live there andto new investment in business, industry and housing.Social disadvantage14. The inner areas of cities have a higher concentration of poor people.Partly this reflects high unemployment, but in addition the level of earningsoften tends to be lower. The Inner Area Studies have shown the importanceof work for married women in enabling families to move out of poverty. for those who are incapacitated, for the old, and for the unemployed, incomesupport is very important. Whilst there cannot be any question of higherscales of benefit for people living in the inner areas, it is desirable to encourage the maximum take up of rent and rate reliefs and discretionary benefits wherepeople are entitled to them.
15. The innermost areas, in and around the city centre itself, tend to serve as arefuge for those least able to cope in society, amongst them the homeless andthose with personal problems such as alcoholism or drug addiction. Over a wider area of the inner city there are often substantial numbers of people withsocial needs requiring help and support.16. Too many inner area children reach the school leaving age with insufficientskills in reading, writing and handling figures to hold down satisfying jobs.Where jobs are scarce, some may feel that their education has been irrelevantto the real prospects they face; others find it difficult to identify with the purposesof the school. These attitudes may find expression in truancy and various otherbehaviour problems.17. The Inner Area Studies have shown that there is a collective deprivationin some inner areas which affects all the residents, even though individually themajority of people may have satisfactory homes and worthwhile jobs. It arises from a pervasive sense of decay and neglect which affects the whole area,through the decline of community spirit, through an often low standard ofneighbourhood facilities, and through greater exposure to crime and vandalismwhich is a real form of deprivation, above all to old people. All this may makeit harder for people to maintain their personal standards and to encourage high standards in their children. Sometimes people from particular inner areasexperience extra difficulty in getting a job or a mortgage. This collectivedeprivation amounts to more than the sum of all the individual disadvantageswith which people have to contend. It is an important argument for tacklinginner city deprivation on an area basis, and for discriminating in favour of the inner areas in the working out of public policies and programmes.Ethnic minorities18. In some of the major cities the ethnic minority communities, like all otherimmigrants before them, have tended to settle in the inner areas in parts ofinner London and inner Birmingham for instance. Other cities, such as Glasgowand Newcastle, have relatively few members of ethnic minorities among theirinhabitants. There are, on the other hand, sizeable ethnic minority communities in the outer parts of some cities and in many smaller cities and towns such asBradford, Blackburn, Leicester, Wolverhampton, Bedford and Slough. Innerarea problems and racial problems are by no means co-terminous therefore.19. Where members of the ethnic minorities in inner areas suffer the kinds ofdisadvantage experienced by all those who live there, they should benefitdirectly through measures taken to improve conditions, for example, in housing,education and jobs. In addition the Government intend to ensure that their particular needs are fully taken into account in the planning and implementation of policies for the inner areas and in the allocation of resources under the enlarged Urban Programme. However, the attack on the specific problem of racial discrimination and the resultant disadvantages must be primarily throughthe new anti-discrimination legislation and the work of the Commission forRacial Equality.
20. In some inner areas immigrant communities have shown their willingness to invest their resources and energy in the improvement of the neighbourhood,particularly its housing and shops. The minority groups living in inner areasneed to be given a full opportunity to play their part in the task of regeneration.Variations in inner area conditions21. Conditions in the inner areas vary greatly from city to city. For example,unemployment is particularly severe in inner Liverpool. Housing conditions,especially overcrowding, are very bad in inner London and Glasgow. Environ-mental conditions vary greatly from place to place and there are wide variations in the incidence of social problems. The precise mix of problems to be dealtwith in each city, and the linkages between them, can be identified only bylocal examination. Action and policies need to be geared to local circumstances.The need to arrest decline22. The inner parts of our cities ought not to be left to decay. It would meanleaving large numbers of people to face a future of declining job opportunities, asqualid environment, deteriorating housing and declining public services. but without effective action, that could be the future for those who live in innerareas, bringing with it mounting social bitterness and an increasing sense ofalienation. The hearts of our cities would suffer as the surrounding inner areaswent further downhill.23. Within the inner cities, although some replacement is necessary there ismuch social capital roads, main services, public building, housing, schools,commercial buildings which has a useful economic life. It would be wastefulto under-utilise or abandon so much investment by the community prematurelyand to incur infrastructure costs elsewhere. Similarly with land: there wouldbe little sense in taking more fresh land on the outskirts of cities often of good agricultural quality if vacant or underused land in the inner areas could beused equally well.24. Some of the changes which have taken place are due to social and economicforces which could be reversed only with great difficulty or at unacceptablecost. But some of the movement of jobs and people has been facilitated bypolicies aimed at reducing the overcrowding of the older parts of the cities.In the post-war years this was an essential part of public policy, but in mostcities it has largely been achieved. It should be possible now to change thethrust of the policies which have assisted large scale decentralisation and in course of time to stem the decline, achieve a more balanced structure of jobsand population within our cities, and create healthier local economies.
Part IIIWHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE25. The first essential is a specific commitment on the part of central and localgovernment to the regeneration of the inner areas. The publication of this white Paper marks the Governmenfs commitment to play its part and to helplocal authorities to play their part in improving inner area conditions. Bothcentral and local government will be judged by their willingness to implementnew priorities, to make funds available, to change policies and to adapt theirorganisations. At the end of the day the test of success will be the improvementachieved in the conditions of life of the people living in the inner areas.26. The kind of measures required will depend on local circumstances and onthe efficient use of available resources. Some of the solutions will be outside the inner areas as well as within them. But the underlying aims must include:(a) strengthening the economies of the inner areas and the prospects oftheir residents;(b) improving the physical fabric of the inner areas and making theirenvironment more attractive;(c) alleviating social problems;(d) securing a new balance between the inner areas and the rest of thecity region in terms of population and jobs.Economic improvement27. Firstly, because of the number of jobs which have been lost through firmsdeclining or dying, it is vital to preserve the firms and businesses which at presentexist in the inner areas. Secondly, indigenous growth needs to be cultivated byfacilitating the expansion of local firms through sympathetic planning policies and by making available suitable cheap premises or sites for small businesses.New sites and premises, with good access to communications and with prospects of a trained labour supply, are needed in order to attract suitable manufacturing,service and office firms to settle within the cities. Travel to work arrangementsalso need to be improved. Both public and private initiatives and capital arerequired, and there will have to be greater emphasis on training and education.The physical environment28. Many of the country&apos;s worst housing problems are in the inner city areas.Improvements in housing to relieve overcrowding and to give older houses anew lease of life and basic amenities are essential for those who live there now.Without better housing, better education, health and personal social services in the inner areas it will be harder to stem the tide of decentralisation, and toretain and attract the more skilled workers required in inner city firms. a progressive improvement of the environment is needed, both fof the sake of thepresent residents and to attract new investment. Where possible, vacant and
underused land can be used to provide commercial sites, more public space,housing at lower densities where new housing is required. Simple facilitiesfor recreation and sport for young people might help to improve life for many who would otherwise be attracted to delinquency and vandalism. Much canbe done temporarily to put land to use, to landscape it, to grass over ugly sites,through a policy of positive land management. These measures will help to restore the confidence in the future of the inner areas without which no lastingimprovement is possible.Improving social conditions29. The relief of unemployment and the provision of decent jobs with goodwages would go a long way towards dealing with poverty and raising morale.But more needs to be done to relieve immediate social problems by reducingovercrowding, lowering the number of families with children living in flatsand, through the social services, by helping old people and others in social needwho may often suffer greater disadvantages in the cities than elsewhere. Muchcan be done on a community basis or via the voluntary bodies, as well as by thepublic authorities, to improve existing social facilities, to make wider use of school buildings, to care for the elderly and the children of working mothers,or to assist the rehabilitation of people with acute personal problems.Securing a new balance of population and jobs30. A new balance is required between the inner cities and the surroundingregion. A deliberate effort is neded to reduce, and possibly in some cases to end, the loss of people and jobs from the cities as a whole and the inner citiesin particular. This means making the cities more attractive for employers andmore attractive for people to live and work in. It means taking steps to match the skills of those in inner cities with the jobs which are available and providing the sort of homes people want.
Part iv the AGENCIES FOR ACTIONPublic authorities31. Local authorities are the natural agencies to tackle inner area problems.They have wide powers and substantial resources. They are democraticallyaccountable bodies; they have long experience of running local services, most ofwhich no other body could provide as effectively or as sensitively to local needs;and they have working links with other bodies concerned. Their local judge-ment of needs and solutions will be essential, and in large measure it is their resources which will need to be called upon.32.  The Government have considered the possibility of using new town styledevelopment corporations to tackle inner areas. They could be expected tobring to bear single-minded management, industrial promotional expertiseand experience in carrying out development. On the other hand, the task ininner areas is quite different to green field development where there is only asmall existing population. Development will be needed, but it will also be amatter of modifying the provision of local authority services and of workingwith residents to secure the improvement of housing, the environment and community facilities.   In these circumstances, it is important to preserveaccountability to the local electorate. The Government do not, therefore,propose the establishment of inner city development corporations, on the model of those in the new towns, although they will be willing to consideralternative arrangements should the need be shown.33. But changes in approach by local and central government will be necessary.Local authorities with inner area problems will need to be entrepreneurial inthe attraction of industry and commerce. A unified approach to the problemsof the inner areas will be required in which the various local policies and services within these areas are closely concerted. Local authorities will need the support and encouragement of all the central government departments andagencies concerned. The activities of central government have themselves at times been over-compartmentalised. The Government intend to develop a moreco-ordinated approach to urban problems.Local communities and voluntary bodies34. Involving local people is both a necessary means to the regeneration ofthe inner areas and an end in its own right. Public authorities need to drawon the ideas of local residents, to discover their priorities and enable them toplay a practical part in reviving their areas. Self-help is important and so iscommunity effort.35. Some things will be better done, or done more satisfyingly, if they areundertaken by voluntary groups and bodies. The improvement of the innerareas needs to harness the good will and energies of tenants&apos; and residents&apos;
associations, local councils of social service, settlements and charities, and moreinformal groups such as pensioners&apos; clubs. The interest of trades unions andchambers of commerce should also be engaged. Public policy should aim to stimulate voluntary effort and help voluntary bodies to play a constructiverole. This may require both local and central government to apply procedures and standards more flexibly to meet local needs. In some places electedNeighbourhood Councils (in Scotland Community Councils) may have a role in representing the community&apos;s views and in mobilising voluntary effort.36. The Government recognise that in some areas people feel alienated fromor apathetic to the impersonal workings of central government and indeed oflocal government too. It is important that the causes should be understood.They may lie in disillusionment with the way policies have been carried out inthe past. They may result from the neglect of the special needs of inner areas as national or city-wide policies and uniform standards are implemented. What-ever the extent and causes of such feelings, local councillors are vital in maintain-ing a link between the community and the authorities who must inevitably bethe main-spring for the revival of the inner areas.37. There is scope for the development of new methods such as area manage-ment or neighbourhood planning in which both members and officers establishcloser links with the people they serve, and seek to provide the local authority&apos;services in a way more closely attuned to the requirements of the area. Thearea management schemes sponsored by the Department of the Environmentwill show how far these new methods are effective.Role of the private sector38. The absence of much spontaneous growth and regeneration is one ofthe hallmarks of the inner areas. By contrast inner areas have been the scene of intense activity by the public sector, but concentrated very much on housing,redevelopment and, in some instances, on urban road building. Public invest-ment is still needed, but on a broader basis with more emphasis on jobs, training,the environment and the improvement of existing housing. And it must beinvestment on a more human scale, with less disruption of community ties.39. Local authorities now need (in pursuit of the aims set out in paragraph 26)to stimulate investment by the private sector, by firms and by individuals, in industry, in commerce and in housing. The resources and energies of small and medium size firms are essential if real progress is to be made and the diversityand vitality, for so long characteristic of inner cities, is to be restored.40. With the public sector ready to create the opportunities and to underpinconfidence in the inner areas, the attraction of new investment and lendingshould grow. The aim must be to encourage changes in the attitudes of industryand financial institutions so that they play their full part.
Part VTHE GOVERNMENTS PROPOSALS41.  In summary, the Governmenfs proposals are to:(1) give a new priority in the main policies and programmes of government so that they contribute to a better life in the inner areas (paragraphs44^18);(2) strengthen the economies of inner areas as an immediate priority(paragraphs 49-58);(3) secure a more unified approach to urban problems (paragraphs 59-62);(4) recast the urban programme to cover economic and environmentalprojects and to increase its size (paragraphs 63-65);(5) review and change policies on population movement (paragraphs66-69);(6) enter into special partnerships with the authorities both districts andcounties of certain cities (paragraphs 70-82).42. The underlying aims for the regeneration of the inner areas are set out inparagraph 26. A great deal can be done within the resources already available.Extra money will help, but it will not provide the sole solution. The InnerArea Studies repeatedly call for greater sensitivity to the needs of local peopleby public authorities, for the involvement of local communities, for closerintegration of services, for better use of existing resources, for positive discrimina-tion in favour of run-down areas and for changes in organisations, in attitudesand in policies.43. Generally the initiative must rest with the local authorities, but theGovernment propose to support and encourage their efforts to the efullest extent practicable. The emphasis throughout is on co-ordinated action bylocal and central government. The paragraphs that follow and the Annex refer to specific areas of activity where changes can be made to assist the inner areas.(1) Main policies and programmes44. One of the lessons of recent studies is that the main policies and pro-grammes of central government and of local government must be used to thefull in order to tackle the problems of inner areas effectively. These includeindustrial and manpower policies, financial support to local authorities and thewhole range of policies for education, health, personal social services, housing,transport and planning, together with the provision of a wide range of environ-mental services and improvements.
45. The Government intend to ensure so far as practicable that their policies and programmes are given an inner area dimension and priority in order toassist the regeneration of these areas. Measures to strengthen the economies ofthe inner areas are set out in paragraphs 49-58 below. Social, environmentaland transport policies are dealt with in the Annex.46. Local authorities, for their part, can do a great deal to redirect their policies to give greater assistance to inner areas and to bring about a moreco-ordinated approach. There is scope for making better use of resources andfor pursuing policies of positive discrimination. There are many fields wherethe need is for a change in policies, including regulatory policies, so that thebest does not become the enemy of the good. For example:(a) some local authorities, in their town planning work, have in recentyears shown much more tolerance of &quot;non-conforming users&quot; toensure that existing businesses are not displaced by redevelopment;where a move is absolutely essential, authorities should make certainthat suitable alternative arrangements are made for relocation in thearea;(b) the delivery of different social services might in some instances become-ordinated more effectively at the local level; this would particularlybenefit those in special need, for example, the aged, the handicappedand the under-fives;(c) housing policies need to take account of employment opportunities;local authority tenants can be given greater responsibility in the running of their estates; steps can be taken to improve housing mobility.In paragraphs 49-58 and in the Annex, there are further illustrations of howlocal authorities can give an inner area dimension to their policies.47. The Rate Support Grant remains the major source of Government financialassistance to local authorities. It provides over  6,000 million a year meetingwell over half local government expenditure. Given the size of each authority&apos;sgrant, rate support grant (together with housing subsidies) is bound to be theprime source of Government funds for helping in the regeneration of the inner areas.48. When allocating the needs element of rate support grant, successive governments have sought to increase the sensitivity of the grant distribution to the differences between local authorities&apos; spending needs. As a result, moreaccount has been taken of the problems of urban authorities and a greater shareof needs element has been allocated to London and the metropolitan areas.The Government intend to ensure that full account continues to be taken ofthe needs of authorities with severe urban problems. It will be up to allauthorities to use their allocations of rate support grant to assist the revival of the inner areas.
(2) Strengthening inner area economies49. An inner area dimension is essential in the fields of industrial and employ-ment policies, since it is a matter of high priority to strengthen the economies of the inner areas. The aim must be to see that these areas make a viablecontribution to the prosperity of their cities, and that suitable job opportunitiesare available for people living there.50. Industry. There is still a strong need for a continuing regional policy withdifferentials in industrial incentives for areas with major structural problems.Nevertheless in most Assisted Areas the inner areas of cities have higherunemployment than the surrounding areas. Glasgow, Liverpool, manchester and many other cities and large towns benefit from being in the Assisted Areas,but regional policy does not distinguish between the inner and other areas.What is now required is an intra-regional emphasis to policy designed to helpinner areas in the Assisted Areas, and in the non-Assisted Areas.51. Location of industry policy will be extended to give it this new emphasis.Steps have already been taken in this direction. The Department of Industry isbuilding advance factories (especially small terraced units) in the inner areas ofMerseyside and Tyneside, in Greater Manchester and in the West Yorkshireconurbation. The latest programme (announced on 28 February) continuesthis policy. Within the Assisted Areas, the factory programme, regionalselective financial assistance and the provision of advice about inner area sites and premises will be deployed by the Departments Regional Offices for thebenefit of existing local firms and to attract mobile projects. In Scotland, theScottish Development Agency is building advance factories in the inner partsof Clydeside, and the Scottish Economic Planning Department (which hasresponsibility for regional selective financial assistance) will encourage employ-ment growth within existing and new firms in inner areas.52. In the non-Assisted Areas and Intermediate Areas, the Industrial Develop-ment Certificate (IDC) control is operated flexibly with due regard to the needs and resources of the areas involved and few IDCs are refused at present. Twochanges in the control were introduced last year. In relation to inner citiesthe control is of importance mainly for inner London and inner Birmingham.It remains the intention to ensure that truly mobile projects are encouragedfirst to consider locations in the Assisted Areas, but the Government havedecided that inner London and inner Birmingham will in future take precedence,after the Assisted Areas and in front of the new and expanding towns, inconsideration of IDC applications for mobile projects coming forward fromthe relevant region.53. Local authorities can do much to improve employment prospects bylooking after existing firms, including small businesses, and encouraging newenterprises. Fresh advice will shortly be issued about ways in which they can help industry. Briefly, local authorities should administer all their powers,including those for housing, planning and the environment, so as to facilitate
the growth of employment in inner areas. They need to make sure that thereare good industrial sites and premises available with good access to communica-tions if they are to attract new industry to provide jobs for the people of the inner areas.54. Local authority powers. Local authorities have certain powers to assistindustry, including powers to provide advance factories. The government intend to introduce legislation to enhance the powers of local authorities with serious inner area problems to assist industry. The additional powers wouldenable these authorities, on terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary ofState, to:(a) make loans to firms on commercial terms of up to 90% for landpurchase and for the erection or improvement of industrial buildings whether or not the authority owns the land or buildings;(b) establish Industrial Improvement Areas where local authorities can carry out, or assist owners to carry out, the conversion of buildingsto create new employment, improvements to access and improvements to amenities;(c) provide in the partnership areas an initial rent-free period in the lettingof factories; and(d) give help in the partnership areas with the high cost of site preparation for industry in inner area locations.The Government intend to consult the local authority associations in the courseof preparing the necessary Bill.55. The development of services and office employment in the centre of citiesand in the inner areas themselves will help to provide employment. In SouthEast England office development permits (which are required for the construc-tion of offices over 30,000 sq ft) will be used to steer to inner areas outsidecentral London those firms which can demonstrate that a move to an AssistedArea is not practicable. In addition a limited number of speculative office buildings will be permitted in the inner areas where there is a shortage of officespace, reasonable transport facilities, and the development is judged to be of maximum benefit to a declining area.56. The functions of the Location of Offices Bureau have been reviewed and part of its new role will be to give particular attention to the promotion of office employment in inner urban areas, including London. Where firms are considering moving, the local planning authority will be able to steer themtowards inner city locations. Grants are available for the development of officeand service employment in the Assisted Areas from the Department of Industry.56. Manpower policies. The employment problems of inner areas differmarkedly between cities and in different parts of conurbations. The various possibilities for action will need to be looked at carefully in relation to therequirements of each locality. There will be a special review in the partnership
areas in which the Manpower Services Commission (MSC) and its agencies aswell as the Department of Employment will be fully involved. Elsewhere it willbe open to authorities to discuss the problems of their inner areas with theDepartment of Employment, the MSC and its agencies to see whether freshinitiatives are possible.58. The higher proportion of unskilled and semi-skilled people in the innerareas points to the need for some change in manpower policies to meet theemployment and training needs of inner area residents. The Manpower services commission has given an inner area emphasis to the Job Creation Programmewherever possible. The Commission intend to continue this in its proposalsfor a continuing scheme of temporary employment. The Employment ServicesAgency is introducing an experimental service of counselling and assessmentfor those with special employment needs in which the inner areas of cities willfigure largely. The Training Services Agency will seek wherever possible totailor its courses (including those at further education colleges) to meet the specific requirements of people in inner areas.(3) Unified approach to inner area problems59. The urban studies of recent years have shown that urban problems cannotbe tackled effectively on a piecemeal basis. The problems interlock: education,for example, is affected by social conditions which in turn are affected byhousing and by employment. The best results are likely to be achieved through a unified approach in which the different activities and services of governmentare brought together. Concerted action should have a greater impact. It should lead to a more efficient use of resources by avoiding duplication or conflicts of effort, and it ought to be more sensitive to the needs of the public who do not see problems in departmental or agency terms.60. The difficulties should not be underestimated. Central government andlocal authorities are organised on a functional basis. Government departments are responsible for specific fields of policy, and local authority departments with the provision of specific services. This is sensible and efficient for the mostpart. Where, however, it is necessary to adopt an area-based approach to public sector activities, as it is in inner city areas, it requires special efforts ofco-ordination and joint working which cut across established practices. these efforts are needed within both central and local government, and in theirrelationships the one with the other.61. In an attempt to secure a more unified approach, work has been going ahead on the development of Comprehensive Community Programmes (CCPs)for districts as a whole, as a means of dealing with urban deprivation. (Seeparagraph 65.) The Government now propose a further development, namely to work in partnership with certain cities to develop inner area programmes and to unify action for the regeneration of these areas (see paragraphs 70 to 82).The lessons learnt will be made available to other urban authorities, who willbe free to prepare inner area programmes themselves.
62. The Prime Minister has announced his decision to transfer responsibilityfor the Urban Programme in England and Wales from the Home Office to theDepartment of the Environment and the Welsh Office. This will help to unifythe Government^ approach to inner urban problems and to those of urbandeprivation more generally. Responsibility for Comprehensive CommunityProgrammes will also be transferred. Central responsibility for race relationspolicy will remain with the Home Office, but there will be close liaison overthe allocation of resources in areas where there are ethnic minorities.(4) Recasting the Urban Programme63. The Urban Programme, which was started in 1968, has been a visibleexpression of the concern of successive Governments with the problems of urban deprivation. It has operated on a wide front and has not been expresslydirected at inner areas or at the economic problems affecting the deprived.Grants have been paid to local authorities under the Local Government Grants(Social Need) Act 1969 at the rate of 75%. While the bulk of the money has gone to local authority projects, the grants have also played a useful part in stimulating innovation and self-help and have been used as a means of channel-ling money via the local authorities to voluntary bodies and ethnic minorities.64. The Government have now decided to recast the Urban Programme andto extend it to cover industrial, environmental and recreational provision andother matters, as well as specifically social projects; and to increase it from itspresent level in England and Wales of under  30 million a year to  125 million a year in 1979/80 (1977/78 outturn prices). Grants will be paid towards current and capital expenditure. A large measure of priority in England will be givenin the next few years to the authorities to whom partnerships are being offered.Other authorities, and through them voluntary bodies, will continue to benefit from the Urban Programme, on an increasing scale in later years. authorities who undertake inner area programmes or Comprehensive Community Pro-grammes will, so far as possible, be given preference in the allocation of grantsafter the partnership authorities; and their grants will be related to thoseprogrammes. In the early years the share of special assistance for authoritiesoutside the partnership areas will necessarily be modest, though in total it willbe greater than the existing Urban Programme.65. Comprehensive Community Programmes (CCPs) were inaugurated as a means of dealing more effectively with urban deprivation. They are a districtlevel, authority-wide approach involving the main policies and programmes oflocal and central government. A CCP will consist of a description of the stateof deprivation in the authority&apos;s areas, an appraisal of the effectiveness ofexisting central and local government policies and, after detailed analysis of selected key issues, an annual programme of action drawn up in consultationwith the various departments and agencies concerned. Interdepartmental workon the development of this approach has already been carried out. A ScottishCCP is now under way in Motherwell, and an English CCP in Gateshead.The work in England is concerned with tackling urban deprivation wherever itoccurs throughout a district, but it will also provide lessons for authorities faced
with concentrations of deprivation in their inner areas. The Government intend to ensure that this work is disseminated and contributes to the policies set outlater in this White Paper, including the development of inner area programmes.(5) Policies on population movement66. As part of the process of achieving a new balance of population withinthe inner cities and outside, which is discussed in paragraph 30, the Governmenthave been reviewing the role of the new towns. In Scotland, the review was completed some time ago when it was decided not to go ahead with the building of Stonehouse New Town. In England the results were announced just before easter.67. The further development of the English new towns has been determined inthe light of lower demographic forecasts and of the part they play in assisting the conurbations and their region at large. Long-term population targets forthe third generation new towns have been reduced. Some resources will beredeployed for the benefit of inner city areas, but over the next seven or eight years the momentum of new town development will be substantially maintained.68. There remains a need for the new towns to do more to relieve directlythe stress areas in the inner cities by taking more of those who have retired, or are chronically sick or disabled together with those unskilled or unemployed workers who are willing to move and whose prospects of employment will notbe worsened by moving. Development corporations and expanding towns havealready been heading in these directions, but will be encouraged to do so asmuch as they can, within the overall need to provide housing for workersrequired to man up new town industries.69. Inside the cities, the Government believe that policies need to be directed to achieving a more balanced structure of population in the various localities,thereby reducing the mismatch between the skills of the people and the kinds of job available. This will entail encouraging housing improvement in the innerareas and, where appropriate, new housing, not only for rent but for owner-occupation; and facilitating some movement of the least skilled from the innerareas of some cities to districts where suitable jobs are more likely to be found.If people lived nearer their work, demand for transport would also be reduced.(6) Special partnerships for certain cities70. The Government consider that if real progress is to be made in tacklingsome of the major concentrations of problems, special efforts must be focussedon a few cities in the next few years. Inner area problems are inter-dependentand complex. There is much fuller understanding of their character now, butthey remain to be tackled successfully. The powers and finances of central andlocal government will need to be used in a unified and coherent way. Newforms of organisation and new methods of working may need to be tried. Inthe Government^ view, success is more likely to be achieved by concentratingspecial attention and the major part of urban aid on a few major areas initially.Spread too thinly, any special efforts will achieve much less.
71. The Government intend, therefore, to offer special partnerships to a strictly limited number of authorities-districts and counties-to assist in theregeneration of inner city areas. The participation of central government isintended to underline the Governmenfs commitment to the inner areas andto instill confidence in their future; it will help to bring national experience tobear; it will enable ways of unifying the actions of central and local governmentto be worked out. The initial task of the partnerships will be to draw up aninner area programme for early implementation, based on an analysis of localconditions. These inner area programmes will be supported by Urban Pro-gramme grants. They will also help to indicate the priorities within the mainpolicies and programmes of central and local government. For example, innerarea programmes will be taken into account in settling block housing allocations to local authorities; and the work of central government agencies will take account of programmes in whose preparation they will have had a hand.The results of the programmes will be monitored.72. The Government have given careful thought to the selection of areas forpartnership arrangements. There are no satisfactory objective criteria, corn-parable between one area and another, covering the whole span of problems economic decline, physical decay and social stress. Nor are there agreeddelineations of the inner areas of various cities. Census data is available at local authority level showing population loss and job loss, housing conditions,overcrowding, social composition and unemployment according to place of residence. Unemployment figures published by the Department of Employmentgive an up to date picture on the basis of areas defined by travel to work patterns,but not generally on a local authority basis.73. While inner area problems are a feature of many of our older towns theyare at their most serious in the major cities. The sheer scale is greater. the inner areas of Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester/Salford eachcontain over a quarter of a million people and Inner London is very much larger. Each of them still has a heavy legacy of old housing, lacking modernamenities, and of outworn industrial, commercial and educational buildings in need of repair, renewal or improvement.74. In the big cities, the rapid rate of decline in population and jobs, and the ways in which they have got out of step, have compounded the difficulties.Between 1966 and 1976, Glasgow lost 205,000 people (21 %), Liverpool lost150,000 (22%), Manchester 110,000 (18%), Inner London 500,000 (16%),Birmingham 85,000 (8 %). Among the smaller cities only Newcastle, with morethan 40,000 population loss (over 12%) and Nottingham 25,000 (8%), experi-experienced such a fall of population. A greater proportion of skilled than unskilledpeople have left the cities. In nearly all the big cities there have been big joblosses generally much greater than in other cities. These changes have been associated with large scale change in the physical fabric often the result of necessary and massive slum clearance and redevelopment. But the effect hassometimes been one of continuing disruption of local life and a loss of the sense of local community.
75. Inner area problems are made worse also by the size of the big cities, bywhich the difficulties and cost of movement, both for employed and unemployedpeople, are magnified. New manufacturing work now tends to be located on theedge of the cities, several miles from the inner areas. It is difficult for inner arearesidents to move their homes to be nearer to suitable jobs. Many of the mare dependent on public transport, and as suitable inner city employmentdeclines, they may be faced with longer and more expensive journeys to work.Finally, it is particularly in the inner areas of the big cities that the various forms of deprivation economic, environmental and social tend to cometogether and to reinforce each other.76. In the light of the Inner Area Studies and of the factors mentioned above,the Government have announced their intention of offering partnerships toLiverpool and Birmingham, to Manchester/Salford, and in London to Lambeth,and to the Docklands authorities who are ready to start a major programme of urban renewal for the Docklands area.77. The Government are considering proposals for partnership from other authorities with major inner area problems. It will be necessary, however, to limit strictly the selection if the best use is to be made of special assistance.The criteria will include those mentioned in paragraph 72 though the limitations of the data are recognised. Account will be taken not only of the intensity of problems, but also of their extent and any wider effects on surrounding areas.78. Joint machinery. The Government envisage joint machinery for eachpartnership to secure the preparation and implementation of inner area pro-grammes. Different arrangements may be needed for different areas, especially for the London Docklands where a Statutory Joint Committee is already in being. The Government will wish to discuss them in each case with the authori-ties concerned. In general, however, the intention is to bring together the localauthorities at district and county level (London Boroughs and the greater london Council) and central government, through departments and agencies,eg Manpower Services Commission, Health Authorities. Local communitieswill need to be involved in the planning and execution of the programmes.79. It is envisaged that there will need to be a small team to analyse inner areaneeds, to draw up the programme and to oversee its implementation; togetherwith some steering machinery comprising representatives of central and localgovernment (including Ministers and local authority elected members) to guide the preparation and implementation of the programme, co-ordinate central andlocal government activities relating to it, help to remove constraints in the wayof action, ensure that the community are involved in the work, and monitorthe effectiveness of the programme. The Government will take the necessary steps to concert their contributions and responses to each inner area programme.These arrangements must take account of the separate responsibilities of theSecretary of State under his statutory functions relating to any matter which comes before him for determination under statutory provisions, includingplanning appeals, applications for confirmation of compulsory purchase orders and the like.
80. Inner area programmes. The preparation of inner area programmes will need to be based on a diagnosis of the problems of particular inner areas. Insome areas, the main weight might be on economic measures, in others itmight be on social action or on housing improvement but in all areas the approach must be comprehensive.81. The programme will need to deal with the totality of local authoritypolicies and programmes for the inner areas and with other public sectoractivities, for example industry and employment. They must cover not onlyspending, but also any policy changes required, for example in the fields of housing, planning or further education. They will have to be linked with the structure plan for the conurbation. They will need to cover any necessaryadaptation of local authority organisation and administration. They must bebased on an effective and worthwhile use of existing and additional resourcesso as to achieve value for money. Wherever practicable, there should be someswitch of resources to the inner areas from other parts of the city. The pro-grammes will be rolling programmes, and they must be aimed at early anddemonstrable results. The results of the programme will need to be assessedto see that they are achieving the results desired, and so that lessons can belearnt.82. The Government intend that in the partnership areas grants under the urban Programme should relate to the inner area ^^^J^Surban grants to the partnership authorities will continue for the time being,but will need to be reviewed in the light of these programmes.
Part VISCOTLAND, WALES AND NORTHERN IRELANDScotland83. The problems of inner city areas, as analysed earlier in this White Paper,in Scotland and particularly in Glasgow, have already led the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to mount a major urban renewal project in the Eastern Area ofGlasgow and to reinforce regional economic policies by giving special preference to inner area problems in policy formulation generally and in his dealings with local authorities.84. The Urban Programme in Scotland has already been redirected pro-gressively to concentrate its support on comprehensive regeneration proposals in areas of severe deprivation. It is used to support and encourage a jointapproach by the providers of all the services relevant to the problems of thedeprived and, although the resources available under the Programme have inthe past been modest, their strategic and flexible use in this way has assisted inunlocking local initiatives and encouraging a number of regeneration schemes in small areas of deprivation. A number of such small area regenerationschemes have been started or are in preparation, mainly in deprived peripheralhousing schemes. The Secretary of State will continue to give assistance to localauthorities to mount such projects.85. A range of other policy decisions will be of particular help to those localauthority areas most affected by problems of social deprivation and inner citydecline. These include housing policies aimed to conserve and improve theexisting stock and diversify housing provision in inner areas, assistance fromthe Scottish Special Housing Association to local authorities with particularslum clearance problems, and the decision not to proceed with StonehouseNew Town.86. The problem of unemployment is of course fundamental and the situationin inner Glasgow reflects the state of the regional economy in addition to thespecifically urban dimension. As is noted elsewhere in the White Paper, stepscan be taken to avoid the displacement of existing industry and to encourageits stabilisation and development, to encourage local initiative, for example bythe provision of small nest factories at low rents, and to create the environmentaland other conditions that industry will find attractive in the longer term. TheScottish Development Agency has been established to assist industrial develop-ment generally in Scotland but it is expected to have a large impact in thedeprived urban areas and it is, through its participation in urban renewal efforts in Glasgow in particular, sensitive to the special needs and problems of these areas.87 The Secretary of State also has regard to general urban priorities mconsidering all main capital expenditure programmes, and he will continue totake account of the problems of social deprivation in his discussions with the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, not only about the annual distri-bution of rate support grant but also in the review of needs assessment to beundertaken following the recommendations of the Layfield Report. Since thegeneral conclusion of this White Paper is that the rehabilitation of inner areascan only be achieved through the effective exercise of main policies and programmes (which requires resource discrimination in current as well as capitalexpenditure), these decisions are of primary importance; they will however onlybe effective to the extent that the priority and the commitment to action isshared by local government, which has to deal with most of the problems atfirst hand, and by relevant statutory and other bodies. In this connection the commitment of Strathclyde Regional Council, in their recent Regional Report,to give priority to tackling urban deprivation is particularly welcome. In thewest of Scotland, the Greater Glasgow Health Board also recognises theparticularly important contribution that health services have to make in dealingwith this problem.88.  The Secretary of State concluded over a year ago that extra effort was required in Glasgow in view of the exceptional scale and severity of problems in that city. He therefore mounted a major urban renewal exercise (GlasgowEastern Area Renewal GEAR) to undertake the comprehensive regenerationof the East End of the city. This involves the co-operative efforts of GlasgowDistrict Council, Strathclyde Regional Council, the Scottish Special housing association (SSHA) and the Scottish Development Agency (SDA). The SDA,in addition to undertaking its normal functions of industrial generation and environmental rehabilitation in the area, also provides the co-ordinatingmanagement for the Project which is overseen at a strategic level by a GoverningCommittee chaired by the Secretary of State or one of his ministerial colleagues,on the pattern now proposed for the partnership cities in England. It is designedto regenerate the part of the city with which it is directly concerned, and toprovide new confidence to the communities living in it. The latter objective isof particular importance and every effort will be made to establish effective means through which people living in the project area can be consulted and make their voice heard in the process of developing proposals. This should be greatly facilitated by the work of Community Councils. The purpose of thevery substantial involvement of the two agencies, the SDA and the SSHA, inthis pioneering project is to free resources of the two local authorities concernedso that they can devote additional attention to other parts of the city wheremajor new initiatives are required with almost equal urgency if the problemsare to be dealt with effectively and in time.89. As a further support for such projects the resources devoted to the urban programme in Scotland, presently running at about  6 million a year, will be built up to reach an overall total of  20 million a year by 1980/81. From theseaugmented resources, funds will continue to be available at about the present level for the kinds of projects currently assisted under the Programme ie pro-jects providing for particular needs or (increasingly) designed as componentsof renewal strategies in smaller areas of deprivation within otherwise settledcommunities, for example in peripheral areas of public sector housing. It is,however, proposed that most of the additional resources will be available toassist in funding agreed renewal programmes submitted by local authorities
with major areas of urban deprivation or dereliction (by far the greatest concen-tration of which is, of course, in Glasgow). Programmes will be negotiated withthe Scottish Office, and should encompass the responsibilities of the two tiers oflocal authority, both of which will be eligible for the grant. The levels and standards of service provision in the inner areas and for the deprived generally are considered to be of particular importance; much of the extra resources will therefore, at least in the early years, encourage the provision of additionalservices financed by revenue, such as education, social work, housing manage-ment and management of the environment. The Secretary of State hopes thatthis will include assistance to appropriate voluntary services. There will bedetailed discussions on the form and administration of the new arrangements with the local authorities likely to be concerned.90. The present proposals for Scotland therefore mark a significant furtherstage in the evolution of an urban policy that has been developing for several years. The scale and severity of the problems are, however, substantial and theultimate success of the policies will depend on the close co-operation of local and central government and on a sustained commitment to urban regenerationfor many years ahead.Wales91.  There are several areas of industrial and urban decline in Wales which need constant and unremitting attention.   The Welsh Office&apos;s derelict landclearance programme has been taken over by the Welsh Development Agency,which, by reclaiming land for industrial and environmental use, is now givingsubstantial assistance to local authorities with the regeneration of the worstareas; and the Land Authority for Wales is empowered to purchase land required for development projects. At the same time, the Urban programme has previously provided grants for a variety of primarily social purposes inespecially deprived areas. Full responsibility for the Urban Programme in wales has now been transferred to the Secretary of State for Wales. This willmake it easier to identify and co-ordinate the wide range of special measureswhich can be brought to bear on special areas of urban decline. The Secretaryof State is now reviewing these programmes to see what changes are requiredin order to reflect the new emphasis given in this White Paper and, followingconsultations with local authorities and other bodies, will announce hisdecisions in due course. The Government will be prepared to consider proposals from local authorities for dealing with major inner area problems although, as explained in paragraph 77, the selection of areas for special treatment will belimited strictly to those where the problems are intense. The Secretary of state will be similarly prepared to consider the extension of powers and assistanceto authorities in areas of particular need in Wales, in accordance with theproposals in Part V of this White Paper.
&quot;Belfast: Areas of Special Social Need&quot;, which was published earlier this yearfollowing extensive research by a project team. Northern Ireland suffers fromthe poor condition of its housing stock, which is worse than that of any otherregion of the United Kingdom, and the problem is particularly acute in Belfast;in addition the rate of unemployment in some inner city areas is exceptionally high. The approach adopted to deal with inner city problems in NorthernIreland differs from that proposed for the other regions of the United Kingdom.Under the overall control of the Secretary of State, a planning team under thechairmanship of the Minister of State, whose responsibilities include social services in the Province, will co-ordinate the work of the various Governmentaland non-Governmental agencies, in close association with the local communities,councillors and representative groups, towards the solution of inner city prob-lems and the best use of the money available for that purpose. The planningteam will maintain the closest possible contact with the Housing steering committee under the Minister responsible for housing, which is co-ordinatingwork on the housing front in Belfast.
Part VIIconclusionsResources93. The resources required for the inner cities will need to be found withinthe private sector as well as the public sector. Investment is needed by firms and individuals, in industry, commercial pursuits and in housing. In the public sector, the bulk of the expenditure will have to be found within the main pro-grammes of central and local government by giving a new priority to the innerareas. The rate support grant will remain the principal source of financialassistance to local authorities.94. Special assistance to the inner areas will be given through an enhancedUrban Programme. In England and Wales, the present level of under  30million a year will be increased to  125 million in 1979/80 (1977/78 outturn prices). Within this total, the Secretary of State for Wales will be prepared tomake available up to  5 million. This increase will be met by modest savings in the new towns programme, and by a redirection of resources within other programmes. In Scotland, the Urban Programme will be increased from  million to over  20 million a year by 1980/81. The Government hope it willbe possible to increase these programmes further in later years. Their intention is that these additions to the Urban Programme should form part of a continuingcommitment over the next decade.95. The Chancellor of the Exechequer in his Budget Statement on 29 March1977 announced an extra sum for construction works to be found from the contingency Reserve.  83 million will be available in England over the next two years for certain inner cities. The Government have allocated  57 million to the partnership areas mentioned earlier. This sum will enable the new policy to be launched in advance of the preparation of inner area programmes.Further allocations will be made to other cities with serious inner area problems in the light of additional proposals for partnership arrangements and special assistance.96. In Scotland, the Secretary of State is consulting selected local authoritiesto identify suitable projects for similar programmes of construction work inScotland totalling  10 million over the next two years. In Wales  5 million will be available for projects in selected areas, and in Northern Ireland  3 million.of the proposals in the White Paper can be implemented admini-
which might be designated in London (Annex). Other changes in the law maybe found to be desirable following discussions with local authorities.Long-term commitment98. The proposals in the White Paper embody a long-term commitment onthe part of the Government to tackle the problems of inner areas, not onlyin the big cities where special arrangements are proposed but where they occur in other cities and sizeable towns.99. The current state of the inner areas has its roots in social and economicevents reaching back to the last century and beyond. Much has been done to ease their problems since the Second World War, principally through the relief of overcrowding. But much remains to be done, and the regeneration of the inner areas will inevitably take some time.100. The Government think it right to pay special attention at the start to the inner areas of some of the bigger cities on the basis of partnership arrangements.The aim will be to see that the powers and finances of central and local govern-ment are used in a unified way to improve economic and social conditions andto deal with physical decay. The partnerships will enable new forms of organisation to be tried and new methods of working to be adopted. Everyeffort will need to be made to establish and maintain good relationships with local communities who have a vital part to play.101. It is the intention to seek lessons from the progress of the partnershipsand to monitor action in the inner areas. It is hoped to publicise the resultsso that other authorities may benefit.102. Authorities outside the partnership areas will be able to continueimproving inner area conditions, using the very considerable resources at their disposal. It will be possible for them to redirect their policies and programmeslocally in order to help their inner areas. They will be free to adapt their ownmethods and organisation to bring about a unified approach and to give greaterpriority to these areas. They will be able to prepare and implement inner areaprogrammes and the Government will consider linking urban aid to thoseprogrammes, though necessarily on a modest scale in the early years. But as time goes by, it should prove possible to direct more special assistance to authorities tackling these problems.103. The regeneration of the inner areas is not, however, a job for centralor local government alone. A new and closer form of collaboration is requiredbetween government and the private sector, between government and the comm-unity including the various representative organisations in the cities and biggertowns, with the voluntary bodies, and above all with the people living in the inner areas. It is their welfare, immediate and longer term, which must be theultimate touchstone for success.
ANNEXMain policies and programmes policy changes to assist inner areas. Paragraphs 59-62 of the White Paper emphasise that urban problemscannot be tackled effectively on a piecemeal basis, and set out the Governmenfscommitment to a unified approach, bringing together all the relevant activitiesof government. This commitment must be expressed through all the individualpolicies and programmes of central and local government. This Annex sets out ways in which it will be possible for central government and local authoritiesto give an &quot;inner area dimension&quot; to their social, environmental and transportpolicies. It is not exhaustive. Other ideas may well emerge as a result of further study by departments and local authorities. In England a few of the changesmay be limited initially to the partnership areas, but most will be of widerapplication. The reshaping of industrial and employment policies is dealtwith in the main paper (paragraphs 50 to 58).Housing2. Despite the great emphasis given in this White Paper to the strengthening ofthe economy of the inner areas and to environmental matters, there remainsa great deal to be done to improve housing conditions in inner areas. Poorhousing, often lacking amenities, and overcrowding are still serious problems.Some inner areas have considerable numbers of homeless people, includingsingle people; and there may be problems with difficult-to-let estates and theletting of high rise flats to families.3. In the past, housing policies concentrated on relieving quantative housingneed and on replacing the slums. Two years ago, the Government advisedauthorities to place increasing emphasis on rehabilitation. Housing action ininner areas needs to be sensitively attuned to local circumstances; the rehabilitation-tation of houses, coupled with environmental improvement and selectivereplacement, should normally be the practice rather than wholesale clearanceschemes. The Government are introducing new arrangements whereby housing authorities will formulate strategies for their areas, on the basis of whichblock allocations of resources can be made. These arrangements HousingInvestment Programmes in England and Wales, Housing Plans in Scotland will help by focussing attention on special problems and increasing flexibility in the deployment of resources. The Government will seek to give priority to those authorities with severe inner area housing problems.4. A better balance is needed between housing and employment in the innerareas. Housing authorities will need to take account of employment prospectswhen planning their housing programmes. A greater variety of tenure formsmay well help mobility. Greater housing mobility should be promoted, withunskilled and semi-skilled workers having improved opportunities to move out to areas where job prospects are better and those who work in inner areas
having a better chance to live near at hand. Opportunities for private housedevelopment will need to be encouraged in the inner areas, so that people whowork in those areas or in the city centres can return.5. The state of the private rented sector is especially significant in some innerareas where it plays a bigger role than in the country at large. The currentreview of the Rent Acts will be particularly relevant to the needs of these partsof cities.6. Housing management and allocation is also of particular importance in the inner areas, as the Inner Area Studies have shown not least because of theneed to avoid the creation of &quot;dump estates&quot;. The Department of the Environ-ment will be issuing guidance to housing authorities on these matters, based onthe work of the Housing Services Advisory Group.7. A Green Paper on Housing Policy will appear shortly and will indicateprospective policy changes, including their relationship to inner areas.Land8. In some cities the presence of a great amount of vacant, underused orderelict land is one of the more difficult aspects of the inner city situation. Itis bound to affect the morale of those who live in the areas and it may welldeter prospective developers who will tend to see it as evidence of the weakness of economic activity in the areas. Steps to improve the attractiveness of innerarea sites and to bring land into use must rank among the urgent tasks of theregeneration of the inner cities.9. Much of the vacant land is in the ownership of local authorities or other public bodies. In this situation there should be positive land management toensure that land which is not immediately needed, but which will eventuallyfind a public use, is brought into temporary use for recreation or as open space.Private owners also hold vacant land or, more often, have empty or underusedbuildings. There will always be land and buildings in transition from one use to another. At the present time, however, changes of use are taking placeslowly; large areas are affected; and in the meantime much of the land which isidle and many of the buildings which are underused or disused stand ugly andneglected. It is for this reason that it is proposed to enable local authorities inthe partnership areas to provide assistance for industry with the costs of sitepreparation and to declare industrial improvement areas (para 54).10. It is frequently said that in inner areas, a deterrent to development and the transition of land to fresh uses is the cost of the land itself. Indeed in somecases the total cost of acquisition and clearance exceeds the market value of thecleared site for development, which is all that potential developers can beexpected to pay. Nevertheless it is possible to exaggerate the significance ofthis point. Developers are more concerned with the total cost of development,of which land at market value may not be a critical element for them. Above all they are concerned with the prospects of achieving a profitable development and with the risks, and they will only pay what they consider to be worth their
while. Land prices respond to market demand but at times when marketactivity is low they tend to respond slowly. Owners often have high hopes oftheir land and are prepared to wait in order to realise their expectations. Anyunwillingness of developers to go ahead is likely to be due more to the economic climate or a lack of confidence in the future of a particular inner area. Re-creation of such confidence must be one of the central objectives of innercity policy.11. Even though in some cases local authorities have large holdings in innerareas they may need to acquire land for selective purposes or by way of landassembly for disposal. The compensation code is in general adequate to ensurethat the price payable on compulsory purchase is based on current market conditions and prospects, and not on the prices that might have been obtainedhad boom conditions continued. One of the uses to which the Urban Programmegrant can be put is to help local authorities to activate development throughland acquisition, clearance and disposal, or to improve amenities.12. Local authorities in England and Scotland have powers under theCommunity Land Act to buy land required for subsequent disposal for privatedevelopment. Proposals by those authorities for inner area purchases wherethere are prospects of early development will be given preference. Differentarrangements apply in Wales, where the Land Scheme is operated by theLand Authority for Wales.13. Disposal of land by local authorities, with appropriate safeguards toavoid speculation, may in some instances mean having to accept a loss ondisposal in relation to its historic cost. It is, however, a way of stimulatingearly development and desirable developments, and of testing and influencingprices in the open market.14. Some nationalised industries and statutory undertakers own land in the inner areas which is either surplus to their requirements or not needed in theimmediate future. There have been major disposals of surplus land to localauthorities in the past, especially for housing. The Government propose tosee whether there are ways of securing more quickly the release of surplus landin inner areas, or of improving the appearance of land which must be held for future needs. In the first instance, discussions will take place in the context ofthe partnership arrangements.Derelict Land15. In future, greater priority will be given to grants for the reclamationof derelict land and buildings in inner areas. Some local authorities say thatthe present definition of &quot;dereliction&quot; for grant purposes is too narrow. Onthe other hand, there are substantial areas in many inner cities within thepresent definition and these could be reclaimed with the aid of grant. TheGovernment will be prepared to examine evidence that the scope of the derelictland grant should be widened in inner areas. In Scotland and Wales, grants for derelict site clearance are the responsibility of the Scottish DevelopmentAgency and the Welsh Development Agency respectively which are being asked to take these points into account.
16 In the Assisted Areas and in Derelict Land Clearance Areas (DLCAs),reclamation grants are available at the rate of 100%. In the rest of the country the rate of grant is 50%. When designating DLCAs in future, particular attention will be paid to the serious problems of dereliction and unemploymentin some inner city areas. Legislation would be required to enable local authoritiesin London to receive DLCA grant should parts of inner London be so designated.Planning17. In recent years, the Regional Strategies prepared under the auspices ofthe Department of the Environment have paid increasing attention to theproblems of inner areas. It will be for local authorities to follow a similarcourse in the preparation of structure plans and local plans.18. The importance of great flexibility in planning policies when dealing with industry has been referred to in the main Paper. Greater preference in theallocation of land can be given to industrial and commercial activities. controls over the expansion of light industry in residential areas can be relaxed where this can be done without serious objection on noise or nuisance grounds.Already many authorities have begun to take a more relaxed view of &quot;non-conforming&quot; industry so that businesses are left undisturbed. Where redevelop-ment involving industry is essential, the satisfactory relocation of businesses is vital. It may be necessary for authorities to provide sites or premises.19. In the previous section on land, reference is made to the amount of vacant,underused or derelict land in some inner cities. Local authorities have beenasked to review their urban road programmes with the object of deletingschemes that are unlikely to be built in the foreseeable future, thereby releasingblighted land for development. Similarly the future use of idle land in innerareas held for other purposes by public bodies or by private bodies needs to be examined and, where necessary, reallocated to new uses.Environment20. The improvement of the environment goes beyond the treatment ofvacant land. Wherever possible, it needs to be part of a progressive programme,contributing to other inner area objectives. In the housing field, environmentalimprovement is an integral aspect of the rehabilitation of older houses. Withinthe limitations on resources, a sustained programme is likely to be called foron a wide scale in many parts of the inner areas.21. The fall in population in many cities provides opportunities, as fundspermit, for creating more open space in inner areas for recreation and visualenjoyment. Dual use arrangements with local schools may be possible. Not allenvironmental improvement requires a lot of extra resources. It is open to all local authorities to amend existing policies or to switch resources in order tosecure environmental benefits in the inner areas. For example they could:(a) adopt lower densities for any new housing development in the innerareas, with more houses with gardens;
(b) give priority to the inner areas in the provision of small-scale sportsand recreation facilities, especially for young people, and places for children to play;(c) remove heavy traffic from unsuitable residential streets by means oftraffic management schemes;(d) provide a more frequent street cleaning and refuse service than in therest of the city.22. Nor is environmental improvement a task confined to public authorities.Local residents have a major role in caring for and improving their houses and maintaining their surroundings. Voluntary bodies, community associations,schools, local trades and industries can likewise play an important part in raising the quality of life in inner areas.Education23. Schools and colleges have an important educational and wider social role in inner areas, as elsewhere, both as institutions and through their buildings and facilities. Many inner area schools are old, on cramped sites, and lackingin essential facilities. They need to be modernised or replaced. The Govern-ment are giving urgent attention to the need for capital resources for schoolimprovements and replacements, particularly in deprived inner city areas. the inner city programmes in the partnership cities will be able to include educationalbuilding work, such as the remodelling and renewal of existing schools. the fuller involvement of schools and colleges in the life of the community, and the fuller use of their buildings and facilities out of hours by local people, willcontinue to be encouraged by central government; such development could alsobe supported through the inner city programmes.24. Many inner city schools contain a higher than average proportion ofdisadvantaged children. These children may benefit from extra staff to help with special needs, including the linguistic and cultural needs of ethnic minorities.On a wider scale there is a need to expand in-service training for teachers inthe interests of improving the quality of teaching; much of this training will be relevant to inner city problems. Both more favourable staffing ratios and anadequate expansion of in-service training as well as other improvementsdepend on resources being made available. In the partnership cities the innercity programmes will include a review of all such needs and should be able tomake some provision to meet them. HM Inspectors will continue to payspecial attention to inner city schools in their local work and, more generally,they will give special attention to the monitoring of activities relevant to innercity problems. The Government will encourage the greater involvement of schools and colleges in the life of the community, in particular increased op-portunities for local people to use their premises after school hours and duringweekends and holidays.25. The Department of Education and Science and the Department ofHealth and Social Security have already drawn the attention of localauthorities to the scope for better co-ordinated services for the under-fives,
involving nursery schools and classes, day nurseries and child minders, and theuse of spare accommodation in primary schools. In some areas, there may be a need to reinforce local educational welfare services. There is also a generalneed to improve the co-ordination of the professional work of the educational and social services.26. Youth and community services have an important part to play in innerareas, but more generally in helping young people to make their way into adultsociety (and in so doing help to reduce crime and vandalism). Local authorities may wish to provide for some enhancement of services where that is of high priority in the area concerned.Social Services27. Authorities aim to concentrate their provision of social services wherethe need is greatest, and many social problems are most severe in inner cityareas. For that reason they already receive in general a higher level of provisionthan elsewhere. There is particular need for work with those disadvantagedgroups which are found in large numbers in the inner areas: lonely and isolatedmothers might benefit from the provision of play groups, day nurseries ormothers&apos; and toddlers&apos; clubs; potentially delinquent children could be helpedthrough the provision of intermediate treatment schemes; the elderly maybenefit from the provision of day-care facilities, good neighbour schemes ormobile meals. It may also be necessary to make special provision within anumber of services for the needs of ethnic minorities.28. The Government intend, however, to continue to explore ways of makingbetter use of existing resources and of improving collaboration with health,education and housing services. The inner city partnerships will provide anopportunity to develop such collaboration. They may also point to the need to redeploy staff resources between the outer and inner parts of districts, andto strengthen services or develop new ones. For example, in particular areasmore home helps may be needed or more community workers, or more social workers to care for children in trouble. It will be necessary to look in detailat the pattern of local need and the pattern of provision.Health29. Many inner areas are for historical reasons relatively well supplied withhospitals compared with some other areas; very generally there is disparity of provision between the south of England and the north. The new formuladevised by the Resource Allocation Working Party of the Department ofHealth and Social Security for distributing resources will therefore tend to settargets for a greater share of resources to northern regions in England, and within some regions to areas outside the conurbations. But in inner areashospitals have traditionally played a greater part than elsewhere in primaryhealth care through, for example, the work of their out-patients departments.The Government intend to see that this role is not overlooked when the detailedre-allocation of resources takes place. In Scotland the proposals to be madeby the Working Party on revenue resource allocation will be directed towards
the particular distribution problems in that country which are complicated inthe west of Scotland by the fact that the population within Glasgow districtis falling steadily while general hospital provision in the surrounding areas isbeing expanded to meet the needs of the local communities.30. In the partnership areas the appropriate Health Authorities will be broughtinto the local machinery. This will help the hospital and community health services in inner city areas to play the wider social role required of them andwill reinforce their links with other services. In Scotland, the Greater GlasgowHealth Board is closely associated with Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal.31. In the case of primary health care, there is considerable variation in thelevel of provision in inner areas. They have, however, generally tended tolag behind other areas in the development of team work, group practices and health centres. In some inner areas there has also been less progress in co-operation with social services.32. Health authorities are well aware of the inter-relationship betweensocial conditions and health. They are seeking to develop a balanced pattern of provision which takes account of health needs as a whole and is planned inconsultation with the corresponding local authorities. There should be further steps towards improvement in local co-operation, both between health and social services, and within the health service itself. The recruitment and dis-tribution of district nurses, health visitors and midwives as well as doctors,will all be considered, as will the provision of health centres from which theycan work as teams.Transport33.  Commerce and industry in inner areas need to be serviced by transportconveniently and efficiently and those living in inner areas need to have public transport to get them to work.  Therefore transport serves employment intwo ways.  In all areas local authorities will need to give weight to the implications-tions for local firms when designing traffic management schemes to improveaccess for central traffic, to ensure efficient loading and to provide adequate and convenient parking.  Traffic management schemes can also make lifemore agreeable for the residents of inner areas.  The main practical require-ment is likely to be for better and improved local roads and in some cases for better access to the primary road network.  The Department of transport would ask all local authorities, including those in the partnership areas, to identify their proposals for inner areas in their annual Transport policies and Programmes which provide the basis for the Governmenfs assessment of the provision to be made for roads and transport expenditure.    Thenational trunk road programme is mainly concerned with links betweencities and therefore has only a limited role to play.  However, some trunk roads may be of help to inner areas and the Department will ensure that thespecial needs of such areas are considered in deciding priorities.34. Local authorities and bus operators will need to review bus routes andschedules to make sure that they cater as well as possible for actual and potentialities-
tial journeys to work by those living in the inner areas and by those employedthere. This means identifying the main centres of employment and theircatchment areas. It may then be necessary to adjust service patterns as partof the overall programme for a particular area, perhaps in some cases improvingcross-town routes where this can be done within the resources available.In some cases where the cost of travel restricts job opportunities, it may benecessary to consider at local level the possibility of specific subsidies to particular groups of people or for particular routes. This would accord with the Governments general policy of concentrating revenue support for public transport on specific objectives or categories of user.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Metcalfe Cooper Limited, LondonDd 159327   K40   6/77
