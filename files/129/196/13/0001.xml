DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 63 COPY NQ   820 June 1977CABINETEDUCATION IN SCHOOLS - A CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster General and the Secretary of State for wales. We submit a draft of a Green Paper for presentation to Parliament.It sets out the Government&apos;s conclusions and proposals arising from the debate which the Prime Minister started with his Ruskin College speechlast October.2. The paper needs both to recognise the genuine achievements of the schools, often in face of great difficulties, and to assure a wider audiencethat legitimate criticisms are accepted and will be dealt with.3. It must also accept certain constraints.    In particular -i. proposals must be compatible with our public expenditureplans;ii. it must respect the accepted division of responsibilitieswithin the education service if we are not to antagonise both the localauthorities and the teachers.    The success of our efforts depends onthe co-operation of both.4. The draft illustrates at several points the limitations on policyimplied by divided responsibility for the system, including the absence ofany power to make selective grants.    Consequently positive discriminationcan be advocated but Education Ministers can do little to ensure it.5. At their meeting on 15 June 1977 the Home and Social AffairsCommittee (HS) generally endorsed the scope and content of the draft and invited us to submit to the Cabinet a version revised further in the light ofthe points made in discussion.    These points included the following -i. There should be a clearer affirmation of the Government&apos;scommitment to comprehensive education.
ii. There should be a stronger commitment to positivediscrimination in favour of special groups.iii. More should be said abouta. the changing role of women in society;b. provision for under-fives;c. the contribution of education to the Governmenfsindustrial strategy.6. We have consulted further with colleagues as invited by HS and haveembodied in tne attached draft amendments to take account of the discussion and of suggestions since made by colleagues.    The appendix to thismemorandum draws attention to the principal passages involved.    In generalthese can speak for themselves, but there is one matter which KS wished usto bring to the specific attention of the Cabinet.    This is the question ofcounting members of ethnic minorities in the various sectors of education.It is dealt with in paragraph 97 of the draft but in terms which stop short ofa firm commitment.    We see great difficulty in making a commitment in avery controversial matter just when we are entering into consultation witha very wide range of educational interests about it. and other related matters,but we consider it sensible to mention the Governmenfs concern.7. The Green Paper has to address itself both to the educational world and a wider public.    Our consultations leave us reasonably confident of a sympathetic reception from the local authorities.    There will be a mixedresponse from the teachers&apos; associations.    The National Association ofSchoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers will consider it does not go far enough;  the National Union of Teachers is likely to be divided, but at the organisational level suspicious and defensive.8. Debate about education is never-ending.    We attach great importanceto early publication of this paper both to enable us to put some actions in train before the summer holidays make it impossible to talk to the teach(and the local authorities, and also to maintain the credibility of the government&apos;s initiative in the light of all that has gone before.lersS WJ MDepartment of Education and Science20 June 1977

FOREWORDby the Secretary of State for Education and science and the Secretary of State for WalesEducation in the last decade has undergone great changesin both size and structure.    The speed and pace of thosechanges are remarkable.    Twelve years ago, the labour government issued its first circular on comprehensivereorganization, an objective which is largely but not yetwholly achieved, and which the Government is determined tocomplete.   Already in three quarters of our schools, the selective system is now a thing of the past.   In 1973the school leaving age was raised to 16, following adecision also made by a Labour Government, in 1969.The content, as well as the structure, of education has changed.    There has been a wide range of new demands onthe curriculum, the introduction of new methods of teaching, and the gradual acceptance of a new examination,the CSE.   These changes have brought with them a gooddeal of controversy;    controversy over what has been achieved, over standards, and over the aims educationought to have.The period of change coincided with a rapid expansionof the number of children in the schools, and of thenumber of young people in higher and further education.This in turn created a demand for many more teachers.Not surprisingly, both the turnover of teachers and theproportion of teachers with only a year or so of teachingexperience have been very high.   And these factors - the speed of change, high turnover, inexperienced teacherstrying to cope with new demands and new methods - have put considerable strain on the schools.   There are some areas of weakness in education and some unmet needs.This paper sets out proposals for dealing with them.
None of this should mask the remarkable work being undertaken in many of our schools.    It is the vigour,imagination and talent of the teachers in them thatimpress     the visitor:    schools that open their facilities and their resources for learning to the entire local community;    schools that emphasize creativity in design,in making things as well as learning things;    schoolsthat tackle with sustained enthusiasm the problems ofchildren from other cultures or speaking other languagesand make a little microcosm of a happy and co-operativeworld.We hope, therefore, that those who read this Green paper and note its recommendations will do so against this background of much that is exciting and even outstanding.So far as possible the Green Paper focuses on the educationnormally provided for children during their years of compulsory attendance at school.   References are made tosome areas of special need, but it does not deal witheducation in special schools, or with further education;and there is only brief reference to nursery education.These important subjects are being dealt with in otherways.   Some involve discussions with other Governmentdepartments.The proposals may be built upon, altered in the course ofdiscussion, or superseded by developments that will emerge&apos;There can never be final answers nor an end to debate.But there are times for self-examination followed by the setting down of new objectives and new ways of reachingthose objectives.   We believe we have now reached sucha time, and this Green Paper is a response to it.
R&amp;STRICTZDSUMMARYThis paper deals with the schools of England and Wales.    Itconcentrates on the main stream of education from 5 to 16.During the past thirty years the schools have been understress because of population growth, wider social changes,and educational reorganisation.    Pupil numbers are nowdeclining and will continue to do so for a decade at least.The schools will have; to work within tight expenditure limits for several years.We have more new school buildings and smaller classes than ever before.    Great progress has been made in establishingcomprehensive secondary education and getting rid of the 11 plusexamination.    The completion of this process remains a priority in education policy.    Both primary and secondary schoolshave developed in the breadth and variety of the educationthey offer and their sensitivity to children&apos;s needs.Nevertheless there are many criticisms of the schools, from employers, parents, and others. They concern the standards of work achieved, particularly in certain key subjects likeEnglish, science, mathematics and modern languages, and, tosome extent, children&apos;s behaviour.Some of the criticisms commonly made are not well founded;there is no evidence of a general or widespread decline in standards of performance in schools.   But others have some justification and must be taken seriously; among them is the gap between industry and the schools.    Young people should reach maturity understanding our democratic society and its economic dependence on industry.    The schools must measuretheir aims and achievements against society&apos;s growing needs.R&amp;S7RIC7Q,&apos;
In a free and pluralist society there are bound to be many different views about the aims of education.   But there isenough common ground in what most people want for their children to provide a basis for curricular planning.The allocation of responsibility at three different levels inthe educational system, between the school, the local educati011authority and the educational departments, is basically sound and does not need to be changed.    But there is a need for more consultation and cooperation between the different levelsthan in the past on both the content of the curriculum andthe standards of performance achieved.    The Green Paper sets out proposals for a review of the curriculum by localeducation authorities, as a first step towards establishingan agreed framework.Parents are playing an increasingly important part intheeducation system.    They should be fully informed about the schools to which their children go, and encouraged toparticipate in their education.    The report of the Committeeof Enquiry into the Management and Government of Schools,due to be published later this year, will deal in detail with the relationship between governing bodies and theirschools, the local education authorities, parents and thecommunity at large.The maintenance and development of the Welsh language gives rise to special needs in the schools in Wales.Effective methods of assessment must be developed and used at each of the three levels in the system, the school, thelocal education authority and thecountryat large.    Goodrecords of the educational progress of individual children and special attention to the problems of transition fromschool to school are also essential.
Positive policies are needed to meet the special needs ofcertain disadvantaged groups: ethnic minorities, travellers,the physically and mentally handicapped, and those sufferingfrom the effect of environmental deprivation.    Teachersneed to be trained to serve in a multiracial and multiculturalcommunity.In the last resort, the quality of education depends on the teachers.    It is more important than ever to attract goodrecruits to the profession and to improve the quality ofinitial and in-service training, and to increase opportunities for professional development.Schools serve the whole community and schooling is a preparatiofor the responsibilities of adult life.    Schools should developcloser links with the community, with parents, with employersand trades unions.    Closer understanding between schools andtrade and industry is vital to enable them to serve eachother and, in so doing, to contribute to the future prosperity of the whole nation.
1-     In retrospect 1977 may be seen as a turning point in education.    The school population is now at its peak; it willdecline for a decade at least;.    The reorganisation of the secondary schools in England and Wales to eliminate selectionis largely accomplished.    These two facts mark the end of aperiod in which the reorganisation of the school system andthe demands of growing pupil   numbers have overshadowed alleducational debate and educational planning.2.     Secondary education for all was introduced in 194-5*Since then the school leaving age has been raised twice,in 194-7 and 1972. Opportunities to move on to further and higher education have greatly increased:the proportion of young people benefiting from post-schooleducation has more than doubled since 1960.    The developmentof the General Certificate of Education (GCE) and subsequentlyof the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) have provided a flexible system of examinations which four-fifths of allpupils now attempt.    The changes in school leaving age,the    growth   of      the relevant age group, and the increasein the proportion of those starting school before five andof those remaining at school after 16, have together led toan increase in the maintained school population of over 80% sinci3*     Large scale expenditure by successive Governments wouldhave been needed merely to match this increase in the numberof pupils and to provide schools in new housing areas.    Butin addition many old secondary schools have been rebuilt, theremaining all-age schools have been eliminated, and the quality of     new    school buildings has been greatly improved.   Classsizes have been reduced. The minimum college of education coursehas been lengthened from two to three years and, with minorexceptions, professional training is now required for graduatesentering the teaching profession.   Recruitment to the profession,already fully qualified,will soon become all-graduate.
cooperation.    Ideas about the reorganisation of schoolscontinue to evolve.    The end of selection for secondary eduC9-5to which the Secretaries of State remain strongly committed^in sight.    With the benefit now of substantial experience,      -AEduCtime is ripe for a conference the Secretary of State for        jand Science will organise later this year. This conferenceprovide an opportunity for sharing experience of successfulpractice in comprehensive schools.RESTRICTEDH.     During the last ten years the schools system has changedradically.    Secondary schools have been most affected, and about 80% of all secondary pupils are now in comprehensiveschools;   but in many areas primary schools have also been involved.    There have also been related changes in the quaii^-&apos;of education provided by the schools.    Primary schools have in recent years adopted methods and approaches to learningwhich reflect an improved understanding of children&apos;s growthdevelopment.    Children have responded with interest and enth1151to an eyperience of learning going far beyond the oldelementary concept.    The comprehensive secondary schools haveresponded imaginatively to the opportunities provided by theirbringing together pupils and teachers who would previously been kept apart.    They have devised many new courses of studjto engage the interests and meet the needs of their varied Pu^and have led the way in the development of new systems ofpastoral care designed to ensure that children1s individualcircumstances are taken fully into account when decisions are taken about their educational programmes.    Many of the sch00have placed a new emphasis on service to the local community&apos;and have involved a wide range of boys and girls in social-other community work.5.      The rapid development of comprehensive schools has ^eqgreat efforts by teachers, local education authorities a110-churches, and could not have been achieved without their        ^
6.     During the last 30 years, the schools have felt the impact of massive social change.    Britain has ceased to be the centre of an Empire, and has become instead a medium-sized european power with wide international connections and responsibilities.Many of the problems our country faces can only be resolvedinternationally;    so we need to educate our children in anawareness of international interdependence, and in a sense ofinternational understanding.    Our own society has alteredsubstantially, because of the large scale movement ofnew people into Britain, many of them from the Commonwealth.Ours is now a multiracial, multicultural country, and oureducation must reflect that too.7.     The changes are not only in our relations to othercountries and other people.    The development of newtechnologies makes some traditional skills obsolete,and demands understanding of new ones.    Our population is both socially and geographically more mobile than before the war.    All this requires   us to educatechildren to be adaptable and resourceful.    Yet the ways in which we teach, the discipline we employ andthe means of communication., have to take account ofthe earlier physical maturity of pupils, the socialtrends and influence of the media which together makeyoung people less willing to accept authority uncritically.RESTRICTED
RBSIKICTFO8.   These social trends have brought a new attitude towardsgirls and women, many of whom now expect to have jobs and bring up a family.   The old division of labour between thesexes, and the educational stereotypes that went with it,are being challenged.   The schools increasingly have toeducate both boys and girls not only for the world of work,but also for shared domestic responsibilities.I.    RESPONSIBILITIES WITHIN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM9-   The education system in this country is not, as is often ^assumed, run by the Education Departments alone.   The EducatiActs divide responsibility among several partners.   At thefirst level are the teachers, on whose relationship with individual pupils all learning depends.   The teachers work    ^within a framework set by the local education authority, w^xis represented in individual schools through the appointmentof governors and managers.   The management and governmentmaintained primary and secondary schools in England and Walehas been under examination by the Committee of Enquiry undei^Mr P Taylor&apos;s chairmanship.   The Committee&apos;s terms of refereinclude an examination of both the composition and functionj^of bodies of managers and governors, and also the relation between those bodies and local education authorities, schoolstaffs, parents and the local community.   The Committeesreport has recently been submitted to the Secretary of St at and it is to be published later this year.10.   The governors, in conjunction with the head teacher ^^his staff, are responsible for what goes on in the indivischool.   At the second level is the local education auuuanswerable to its electorate and responsible for providingeducation within its area.   Third, there are the Secretary     ,nti011of State, responsible in law to Parliament for the promoting   ^the education of the people of England and Wales.   They 111     ^know what is being done by the local education authoritieS^through them, in the schools.    In addition there are cer^matters, such as qualifications and superannuation arrant     ^Consulwhere the Departments have a direct responsibility. abetween the Departments, the local education authorities&apos;    ^the teachers, is a vital element in the working of the esystem.
II.     RESOURCES11.     In looking at the prospects for education we must avoid two traps.   One is to ignore the need for economicrestraint which is necessary both to control inflation and to regenerate industry - the Government1s top twopriorities.    The other is to assume that the difficultiesassociated with restraint make any improvement impossible.Although some improvements call for additional resourcesothers, including many of those proposed in this paper, do not,The extent to which increased resources for education willbe available in the future depends largely on the success ofthe Industrial Strategy.    It is vital to Britain&apos;s economic recovery and standard of living that the performance of manufacturing industry is improved and that the whole range ofGovernment policies, including education, contributes as muchas possible to increasing industrial performance and therebythe national wealth.12.     Although firm decisions on public expenditure havebeen taken for 1977-8, the figures for future years areprovisional and will be subject to review in the 1977 survey of public expenditure.   The education budget increased very substantially between 1965/66 and 1975/6, by no less than60% in real terms.   Between 1975/6 and 1977/8, education hasto take its share of public expenditure cuts amounting to 152 millions, a cut of 2.4%.   Other programmes, such ashousing, roads and defence have also suffered reductions.It should, however, be possible to resume a modest rate of growth in public expenditure by the end of the decade.
13*   The greatest strength of the schools lies in theirteachers.    There are about 4-59*000 qualified teachers in maintained schools in England and Wales.   This is50% more than in 1966, an increase achieved through a major expansion of training coupled with strenuous efforts to persuade former teachers to return to service.This additional teaching strength has been used toreduce class sizes substantially in the last ten years.In 1966 two-thirds of all primary school classes had more than 30 pupils, by 1976 the proportion had fallen to under half (45%).   For secondary schools, theimprovement was from 27% in 1966 to 15%.    Only onesecondary class in 4-0 now has 35 or more pupils, and only one in 100 has 35 or more pupils and is in thecharge of only one teacher.14-.    In addition more teachers have been needed to dealwith a growing range of tasks outside the classroom.Apart from the duties carried by head teachers and those with special responsibilities, these tasks includecareers advice, pastoral work and home-school links.For this reason, average class-sizes are necessarilyhigher than the corresponding staffing ratios.    Theseratios improved, between 1966 and 1976, from 28.0:1 to23.9:1 in primary schools, and from 18.4:1 to 17.0:1 in secondary schools - the best figures ever achieved.15.   This rapid and sustained growth in the teacher forereflected the determination of successive governments toimprove staffing standards even when the school population was rising.     By theearly 1970s, however, it became clear that the school population would not continue to rise as fast as had previously been forecast;       a slower rate of growth inthe number of teachers designed to produce a total of510,000 teachers by 1981, was provided for in the white paper of 1972 (Cmnd 5174).   For the last three years,RESTRICTED
the continuing steep fall in projected births and the economicsituation have combined to reduce further projections of thenumber of teachers to be employed.    The Governments expenditureplans, however, provide for sufficient resources to enablestaffing standards within the schools to be maintained attheir current levels, and additionally for a substantialexpansion of in-service training and induction in theperiod up to 1981.    It will be the Government&apos;s aim to resume improvement of staffing standards within the schoolsas soon as economic conditions allow.    These and othermatters related to the training and employment of teachersare discussed further in Section XI below.16.     Teachers&apos; and children1s performance are inevitablyaffected by their working conditions.    The number and quality of non-teaching staff-schoolkeepers, laboratoryassistants and office staff;    the school site and itssetting;    the amount and distribution of teaching space,basic services, furnishing and equipment, and the provisionof specialised teaching areas all affect what schools can offer their pupils.    A recent Government study,/shortly tobe published.7, which assessed the educational suitability ofthe stock of school buildings in England and Vales for thedemands of the next ten years, showed that about half the primary and nearly three-quarters of the secondary teachingaccommodation has been built since 19^-5.    In general thefabric of permanent school buildings is in good condition and most schools are safe and healthy places.    But,particularly in older schools,   classroom and other accommodation can fall far short of today&apos;s standards.17-     The number of school pupils is declining and will continueto do so for many years despite a projected upswing of the birth rate after 1978.    Pupil numbers are expected to dropby more than a fifth between 1976 and 1989 - from 9.1
million in 1976 to 7.4 million by 1966 and to 7.1 million byThereafter a slow recovery to 8.1 million by 1996 is projectThe decline in numbers will reach the primary sectorfirst, falling from 5.2 million in 1974 to 3*8 million in 1986, while secondary numbers will peak at 4.1 million in 1979 and then fall to 2.8 million in 1991.   Substantialbuilding resources will still be needed over the next10 years to provide for the movement of population from one area to another but the decline inpupil numbers should enable a substantial number of oldand inadequate school buildings to be taken out of use.Other surplus accommodation can be adapted to make good the inadequacies of buildings that will still be needed.    But there will still be a backlog ofdesirable improvements which cannot be met in full.Priorities must be established between categories ofimprovement and the claims of areas and schools ofdifferent types;    the inner cities (whose schools will benefit from the programme of capital expenditure announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget spee ch)and other deprived areas must be given full weight.    the secretaries of State hope to announce their buildingpolicy for the next few years after there has been anopportunity for public discussion of this paper and ofthe school building study itself.16.    As to the other running costs of the schools, which include items as diverse as expenditure on books and onschoolkeepers pay, it will not be possible for expenditure(in real terms) to rise as fast in the next few years asin the past.    Non-teaching costs cannot be considered in isolation from teaching costs since the two   interactclosely.     The   Government   has   given priority to   employing        teachers; accordinglyexpenditure restraints will fall more heavily oncapitation allowances and expenditure on heating, lightingcleaning and ancillary staff.   Work is going on to secureRr.v-;selected
RkSlKICikDthe best value for the money spent in this way.19.   Everything that is said in subsequent sections must beseen against the background of the resources available.Each local education authority and each school has to assessits own capacity, in terms of qualified teachers, educationalequipment, accommodation and so forth, to achieve its objective;For instance, if a school wishes to offer a modern languageoption but has no qualified language teacher, it will be ableto achieve its wish only when that gap is filled.    Resourceconstraints of this kind were not always taken into accountduring the period of rapid development in the curriculum andin teaching methods that occurred in the last decade, and theconsequences for the schools were serious.    They must be borne in mind in any proposals for the future.III.    CRITICISM AND DEBATE ABOUT THE SCHOOLS20.   Much recent comment on education has been strongly criticalSome themes recur.    Children&apos;s standards of performance intheir school work are said to have declined.    The curriculum,it is argued, pays too little attention to the basic skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and is overloaded with fringesubjects.    Teachers are said to lack adequate professional skillsand not to know how to discipline children or to instil   in themconcern for hard work or good manners.    And underlying all thisis the feeling that the educational system is out of touch withthe fundamental need for Britain to survive in a highlycompetitive world through the efficiency of its own industryand commerce.    Boys and girls, it is said, are not equipped to earn their own living, and do not understand how vital it isthat they contribute to the future prosperity of the country.21.    Some of these criticisms are true.    There is a wide gap between the world of education and the world of work.    Boysf-ind girls are not sufficiently aware of the importance ofindustry to our society, and they are not taught much about it.R STR!CTm
In some schools, the curriculum has been overloaded, so thatthe basic skills of literacy and numeracy, the building blocks*i cof education, have been neglected.    A small minority of schoolhas simply failed to provide an adequate education by modernstandards.    More frequently, schools have been over-ambitiousiintroducing modern languages without sufficient staff to meetthe needs of a much wider range of pupils, or embarking on nevmathematics without making sure the teachers understood whatthey were teaching, or whether it was appropriate to the pup1capacities or the needs of their future employers.22.   Other criticisms are misplaced.   They assume uniformlyhigh standards in the past from which we have fallen.   Yetof the two million illiterate or semi-illiterate adults in britain today, many were educated before comprehensive schooor modern methods were ever heard of.   Recent studies haveshown clearly that today&apos;s schoolchildren read better thanthose of thirty years ago.   School curricula are moreambitious than they were:    far more children, over a wider range of ability, study a modern language or science thandid a.-generation ago.   And far more proceed to full-timehigher education.   This means that employers recruitingschool-leavers or A level leavers are looking at a much more heavily &apos;creamed&apos; group of young people than their predecesa decade or more ago.23.   The picture, then, is far from clear.    Much has been achieved:    but there is legitimate ground for criticism andconcern.    Since education, like any other public service, lSanswerable to the society which it serves and which pays -orthese criticisms must be given a fair hearing.24.   It was against this background that the Prime Ministercalled in his speech at Ruskin College, Oxford on 18 October4- to last for a public debate on education.    The debate was no^
be confined to those professionally concerned with education,but was to give full opportunity for employers and trades unions,and parents, as well as teachers and administrators, to make their views known.    In the autumn of 1976 Ministers held aseries of meetings with national organisations representingamong others teachers, parents, local authorities, teacher training institutions,RESTRICTED
education officers and advisers, the Schools Council andthe churches.   Then in the opening months of this yeara series of regional conferences was held, seven in Englandand one in Wales, with invitations issued to local authoritieSin each region, to teachers, employers, trade unions, the churches, parents and students as well as other individuals and organisations with a special concern with education.In this setting many valuable ideas were put forward, both at the conferences themselves and in written documents.After that, a further round of meetings was held withthose consulted the previous autumn.   This process identifie^a substantial measure of agreement on the direction in whichwe need to look for improvement in the schools.IV.    AIMS AND WORK OF THE SCHOOLSA.     General aims25.   Education   necessarily assumes certain values;a complex and diverse society, as Britain is today,includes groups committed to many different systems ofvalues.    So if we are to agree as a community on oureducational aims, they must be simple andfirmly founded on the individual concern which parentswant the   education  service   to have   for   their children.   The majority of people woiild probably agree withthe following attempt to set out these aims, though theymight differ in the emphasis they would placeon one or the other :i. To help children develop lively, enquiring minds,the ability to question and to argue rationally&apos;and to apply themselves to tasks;ii. To instil respect for moral values, for other ^people and for oneself and tolerance of other ^a^Slife;To understand the world in which we live, andinterdependence of nations;

Most schools would find little difficulty in subscribing tthese common aims as a framework for the exercise of teachers&apos;professional skills and judgement.    But they are bound totranslate them differently into classroom practice since theymust take account of local circumstances, the teachers&apos; knowledgeof their pupils, and available resources.    Some aims vary in importance at different periods of a pupil1s education; others are constant throughout.    All these aims apply to both boys and girls.    Equal opportunity does not necessarily mean identicalclassroom provision for boys and girls but it is essential that,in translating their aims into day-to-day practice, schoolsshould not by their assumptions, decisions or choice of&quot;teaching materials limit the educational opportunities offered to girls.B.      The work of nursery and primary schools2?.    Entry to nursery or primary school is an important event.For many children it may be their first big experience of lifeaway from the family.   More than half our children now start&quot;their schooling before they are five in nursery schools andclasses, or in the reception classes of primary schools.    In
the last few years there has been a big expansion of nursery education, mainly on a part-time basis; and as the age groupsdecline the proportion of under-fives who are in school will rise steadily, even though limitations on resources willconfine further expansion of provision in the immediate future to the areas of greatest social deprivation.28.    Nursery education is valuable for almost all children.But it should supplement, not replace, what a child learns a*home.    The experience of the playgroup movement has shown thatparents often wish to be closely involved in the education anddevelopment of other young children as well as their own; and professional guidance parents can play a valuable part in nursschools and playgroups and by so doing can come better to ful^their own role as parents.    The Government has in recent year3encouraged local authorities to improve the coordination ofall available services for under-fives so as to make themaximum use of existing resources in the education, social services and health fields, as well as those which the commim1can provide through volunteers and voluntary bodies.    This Isan area of provision in which there is a growing interest,especially in relation to the needs of children with backgro^of disadvantage of various kinds, and in which a number of ^eideas are being tried and tested.    The Department of Educati011and Science and the Department of Health and Social Securityhope shortly to issue a further joint circular to localauthorities on this matter.29.    By five years of age most children have acquired aconsiderable degree of physical co-ordination, and all buta few are able to use and to make themselves understood in      ^everyday language.    But even by that age children are notice3different from each other in emotional and social maturity^in achievement and in what interests them.    The differencesbecome more marked as the children grow older.    Over the yea?3&apos;primary school teachers have become increasingly conscious 0the need to cater for the individual characteristics of chi-1-RKTrjCTFD
and more adept at doing so.    But at the same time childrenhave to learn to   work together so that they may develop thesocial skills, concepts and attitudes necessary to membership of the school and the wider community.    Religious education,the one compulsory subject, has an important part to play inthis,30.    Primary schools have a special responsibility for improvinchildren&apos;s powers of language, particularly their capacity to read and write.    Since 1948 standards of reading, as measured in a series of national surveys, have gone up but more needs to be done and can be, if teachers are givenenough help.    Some schools, particularly in inner urban areas,give cause for special concern and action.31.    The schools have also a special responsibility for teachingarithmetical skills; the importance of these is not diminishedby the introduction into schools of a wider range ofmathematical ideas.32.    The primary school curriculum today properly goes far beyond what used to be considered sufficient for elementary education.    It has been enriched by a feeling for colour,shape and music, and by the early introduction of simplescientific ideas.    Children engage in work designed toincrease their control over themselves, physically andmentally, to extend their knowledge of the world about them,and to inform them of man&apos;s achievements.33.    A child&apos;s primary education will go a long way todetermine his attitude to learning, and the extent to whichhis potential will be fulfilled.    A child who falls behindat primary school, or who fails to learn how to read, writeand do simple arithmetic with confidence and ease, may not beable to catch up during the rest of his schooling and beyond.It is at primary school that educational foundations arelaid for a lifetime.
34.    Individual teachers in primary schools are usuallyresponsible for most of the work done in theci. r classes.Within the school they can often pool their special strength3)in for example art or music, physical education or historybut, because of their importance to the children, all primaryteachers need a sound basic knowledge of English andmathematics,.    The possibility of requiring those enteringcourses of.&apos; teacher education to satisfy certain entrancerequirements in these subjects is discussed later in paragraph114.35*    Primary schools are not all the same; different schoolsemphasise different aspects of the work or choose differenttopics for the pupils to work at.    Each school has totake into account the needs of its pupils, the resources available and the strengths of its teachers.    At the sametime it should ensure that all the important things receiveadequate attention.    It is unfortunately true that in someschools the work is unduly restricted while in others,though wide-ranging it is desultory.    Overall there may be too many and too wide differences.36.    Primary schools also differ in their methods of teachi^and in the ways they group their pupils.    There is room for wide variety.    There is nothing to be gained fromteachers trying to use techniques that are beyond theirabilities or alien to them.    The teachers must, however,keep their methods under review and extend their competencewherever innovation can serve the needs of the childrenthey teach.    In-service training and the work of localadvisers are both necessary support:&apos;; to this development.The test of any method, new or old, lies in the quality and extent of the children&apos;s work.    The judgement aboutquality cannot be made in the isolation of a singleclassroom: education is a continuous process.    Care has tobe taken that in moving from one class or school to another.
rthere is sufficient continuity in content and techniques. the lack of planning in this respect is a deficiency which we hopediscussion will remedy.C.      The Work of Middle Schools37.    Middle schools are mostly for children from 8-12years or 9-13 years.    They are relatively new in themaintained system.    Some were formed from secondary schools, some from primary schools and some are newinstitutions.    The teachers in them differ widely in their previous experience.    Trie schools reflect these differences,especially in the forms of organisation they use.38.    The choice of age range affects the size of schoolthought appropriate as well as the size of teaching staff;these in turn influence the way the school is organised and what can be taught.    Where pupils move on to secondary schools at 12 there is usually little scope for specialisationby teachers; the work of the middle school then has muchin common with that of primary schools.    Where pupilsmove on at 13, more specialised teaching has to be introducedthough specialisation is not usually taken as far as itis with many 11 and 12 year olds in secondary schools.    Inthe smaller 9-13 schools as in 8-12 schools, if specialistteaching on the secondary pattern is introduced, it islikely to be at the cost of too much specialisation forthe younger children.   A balance of specialist and generalteaching gives the best results overall; it still means that 11 and 12 year olds in middle schools are less likely

The most successful m t rile schools provide a gradualtransition in organisation and method between first andupper schools.    The aims of all three tiers are kept intune.    The later the age of transfer to the upper : choolthe moiv   vital continuity becomes especially j or ;;upilsgoing on to take public examinations.D.   Transition between schools4-0.   Substantial problems can occur at the point of transition between primary and secondary schools.   Lackof continuity between successive stages, whatever the organisational pattern, can have especially severeconsequences in subjects like mathematics, science andforeign languages, where progress depends heavily uponwhat has already been learned.   The difficulties can beaccentuated where pupils move from one part of the countryto another;    even within a single local authority area,problems may arise from the differing approaches adoptedamong primary schools.and the different standards of performance achieved.    Some local education authorities v/i^substantial responsibility towards families in the Armed Sefmake special efforts through the use of educational recor Breduce the difficulties -which the children of such familieSencounter, and it may be that there are lessons here, for application.4-1.   Difficulties of transition   within an areacan often be reduced by regularcontact  among    the teachers of a secondary schoolsandtheir   contributory primary or middle schools.Where, as is often the case, children go from one lowerschool to a number of upper schools, or, as is almostalways the case, an upper school   takes children from anumber of lower   schools, close contacts between schoolsare needed both across tiers and within them.   Problemsoccurring when children move from area to area are lesseasily resolved, but it is important that they should beca
kept to a minimum, not least to ensure that parents whosejobs demand mobility should not be deterred by fear ofdisruption in their children&apos;s schooling.E.   The work of secondary schools42.   Secondary schools must build on the work of primary and middle schools.   They offer opportunities for pupilsto advance their formal learning on a broad front.   Theyseek too to develop the pupils&apos; awareness of and attitudesto society and their potential contribution to it.   Atthis later age the acquisition of self-discipline assumesgreater importance.43.   The range of learning offered to the great majorityof secondary pupils, particularly from the ages of 11-14,has been considerably extended in the last 15 years, assecondary education for all has become a reality.Schools organise thecurriculum in different ways but, in the first three years,almost all offer their pupils the opportunity to go ondeveloping their linguistic and mathematical skills and tobe appropriately  introduced to   the traditional range ofacademic disciplines, including science and a modernlanguage.   The arts, crafts and physical education arealso generally considered essential.44-.   From about the age of 13 pupils begin choosing their ownsubjects, generally those which they do or like best or which willbe necessary to their later employment or careers.    In manyschools careers education becomes part of the curriculumat this stage.   Usually at the age of 14 a wider range of subjects is offered:    some new ones are introduced,others, like science, may be subdivided into physics,chemistry, and other specific disciplines.   For some pupils coursewith particular slants towards employment or tho modern worlds
may be specially devised.    In the interest of keeping pupils&apos;career prospects open and of providing for all a broad educatioDto match the foreseeable needs of the individual and society,most schools require their pupils either to continue to studycertain subjects or to choose their subjects of study from SroU*so constructed as to ensure that no essential element is omiFor schools which 1 protect1 a group of subjects in this way, the al1110universal choices, apart from religious education and physica^education, are English and mathematics;  science and less oftena modern language may be similarly protected.4 5.     To present the schools&apos; practice in terms of subjects    ^to over-simplify.    A familiar subject name like science concemany differences of content and purpose.    In addition it niuremembered that schools use and group traditional subjects t0   ^serve the broader educational purposes listed in paragraph25&apos;pupil&apos;s programme is therefore a limited guide to the effect*of his education.    Widely different programmes within and schools may well be compatible with a single set of aims.i e ao^46.    There is probably more variation in secondary schools    ^their performance than in primary schools.   Much of it reflecurrent understanding of the tasks of secondary education,explained by differences in available resources or teachers-From 14 to 19 pupils are probably at most divergent in maturity, attainment, attitudes, motiva     ^and aspirations.    Schools must provide for   ^ cgto go their different ways; but at the same time they have for these diverse pupils&apos; common needs.F.     General---47.    Schools constantly seek to improve what they do for         pupils.    The point now at issue is how far their individualadd up to an effective realisation at local and national
the aims of the schools.    We consider in turn how far existingcurricula can be shown to match these aims and what further developments in curricular planning may be necessary;    what cancurrently be said about standards of performance in the schools,the available tools of assessment and possible additions to them;and the need for school records of the educational development of individual children.
V.    CURRICULUMA.   Primary Schools4-8.   If children&apos;s learning is to keep pace with the increasing demands of society, primary schools will need to go on improving standards.    This does not imply any great change in the range of what is taught, but the followingfeatures, characteristic of the most effective schools,might with advantage be adopted more widely:i.    in all schools the teachers need to be quite clear about the ways in which children make and show progress in the various aspects of theirlearning.   They can then more easilychoose the best materials to advance their pupils*Many good examples of working definitionsof progress in English, to which the wholecurriculum contributes, have been inspired bythe report of the Bullock Committee of inquiry and subsequent in-service training.ii.   The teachers should be able to identify quiteprecisely the levels of achievement represented by a pupil&apos;s work.    In this way children andparents can more readily judge the progress made.Different children, of course, reach objectivesat different ages.   In parts of the curriculum,such as the development of arithmetical skills,it is comparatively easy to organise a seriesof targets for the pupils according to a logicalsequence of difficulty.    In other parts ofmathematics, it is not possible to be so precise&apos;Precision is even more elusive where teachersare planning to develop their pupils&apos;  imaginationor social awareness.   They can none the less pi911a progression in these parts of the curriculumand ensure that they make their proper contribute to the child&apos;s education.
lii.   The teachers in successive classes or schoolsneed more generally to establish a measure ofagreement about what is to be learnt.   Theyshould as a matter of professional habit passon clear information about work done andlevels of achievement.    Time is not then lost in attempts to discover what pupils knew and can do and how their existing performancerelates to future aims.49..   If there is to be continuity of learning, schoolshave to agree on certain aims.    This does not mean totalconformity but, even allowing for local and individual needschildren throughout England and Wales have many educationalrequirements in common.    It is therefore reasonable to expect that children moving from a primary school in one part of the country to another elsewhere will find much thatis familiar in kind if not in detail.    It is for the teacherto choose the most effective way, for their pupils andfor the local community, of meeting these common requirements50.   A suitable balance has to be maintained between various parts of the curriculum.   Two matters, however, requirespecial attention:a.   Society has recently become more multi-racialand multi-cultural.    All children need tounderstand what this means, to appreciate theadvantages and the problems of such a society and the adaptations necessary for all of uswithin it.b.   Learning in one part of the curriculum can be helped on by activities in another.   TheBullock Committee made this point with regardto English and  i t Is one of the importantarguments in favour of a wide-ranging curriculum.There are, however, some skills that are the particulresponsibility of primary schools.    Literacy and
numeracy are Lhe most important of these.No other curricular aims should deflectteachers from them.B.     Middle Schools51.     For the most part middle schools do not present uniQuecurricular issues, though their size and organisation high116certain problems and particularly those connected with ^continuity.   Furthermore, resources, and especially teachersparticular training or expertise are often, rightly, depl0^it!rather differently in areas with middle schools as comparedothers where pupils transfer at &quot;11 years of age.   This, wl   ^careful co-ordination between the phases of schooling can wwell, with some aspects of school work being started earlierand others later.    It can, however, eause some difficulty ^orpupils who transfer into or out of the area.   Since middleschools are in a minority, this is a matter to rwMch the jyeeducation authorities and teachers in such areas need to Bspecial consideration.52.   The resources available in a school, and particularlytraining and expertise of the staff, have direct consecjuen0for the range and depth of work that can be offered.   T^e    ^small sizes of middle school staffs as compared with thosetraditional comprehensive schools have a particular effeC*&apos;example, on science, modern languages and handicrafts; maD^gmiddle schools, including the smaller 9-13 schools, areto allocate more than one post to each of these specialisinSland some none.
53.    Like primary schools, secondary schools need to go onimproving standards to keep pace with the increasing demandsof society.    Their teachers too need constantly to keep in mindclear definitions of educational progression, identifiable levels of achievement and a concept of curricular balance, togetherwith an awareness of the range of purposes the pupils&apos;education must serve when they leave school.    This is a complex and difficult task.54.    Further progress must both build on the achievements ofrecent years and take account of current criticism.    Since theearly sixties there has been substantial curricular diversificationand experiment in secondary schools, in direct response toperceived needs for change.    In particular the early years of theCSE examination stimulated fundamental consideration of thecurricular needs of young school leavers.    In seeking further to improve the work of schools it is important to recognise andexploit this experience.    The fact that some teachers have notunderstood sufficiently clearly the nature of the changes on whichthey were embarking, and that implementation of some intentionshas proved a harder and slower task than was initially envisaged,must not be allowed to obscure the fact that progress has beenmade.55.    Appreciation of the advances made should go hand in hand withan understanding of the reasons underlying the weaknesses which need attention.    In science and mathematics the introduction ofnew content and new styles of learning has helped to make these subjects more interesting and more accessible for many pupils,and has enlarged the perceptions of many teachers.   But too manyPupils are not gaining a firm grasp of essentials.56.    Similarly, the learning      of modern languages is not satisfactory.   This is partly because attempts have been made toextend the opportunities to learn a foreign language, both to young pupils and to pupils of a much wider range of ability than previously.   The pace of change has outstripped the supply ofRESECTED
appropriately qualified and experienced teachers, and thegreater variety of institutional arrangements resulting fromsecondary reorganisation has complicated the problems - not mthemselves new - of ensuring progression and continuity.   But the expectation that a higher proportion of pupils will desire andbe able to learn a foreign language has been established.57.    The improvements which now seem called for combine an ex^of the best practice of recent years with a change of emphasis*The curriculum has become overcrowded in response to constantlyexpanded demands.   Although each may be worthwhile in itself *there is now a case for considering whether or not the essenti8-1-3of education have been put at risk.    In addition, greaterattention needs to be paid to the preparation of all pupilsfor the transition to adult and working life, which manyof them have to make immediately they leave school,    Specifi0 ^ ^aspects of this receive attention in Section XII, but the possiimplications for the curriculum need to be recognised here.58.    Young people need to reach maturity with a basic understandof the functioning of our democratic society and political sysof the advantages and problems flowing from the ethnic variedof our population, of international interdependence and of ^eeconomy and the activities, especially manufacturing industry?which are necessary for the creation of Britain&apos;s national wealth.    It is an important task of secondary schools to devel0?this understanding.   Some may consider introducing into thecurriculum &quot;subjects&quot; for this purpose: the majority are more likely to take advantage of the opportunities to add new ma^cwithin the framework of existing subjects.59*    Schools need to find ways of building up their pupils1confidence and aspirations without limiting their opportunities ^for learning, or type-casting them for certain occupations-Schools need to help them to see the relevance of what schooloffers and to understand how their skills can be used for theiradult working life.    It is not the task of schools to prepare
pupils for specific jobs but experience has long shown thatstudies and activities that are practical and obviouslyrelevant to working life can be valuable as a means oflearning,    including the learning of basic skills.   Preventingadolescents who are highly motivated towards learning in thisway may serve only to promote boredom, frustration andalienation.60.    The balance and breadth of each child&apos;s course is crucialat all school levels.    This is especially the case during the later years of compulsory education.    In most secondary schools the curriculum of the main school course is broadly traditionalfor the first two or three years.   Options are usuallyincreased in the fourth and fifth years.    It is not truethat many pupils drop mathematics at an early stage of thecourse, but the offer of options and the freedom to choosedo lead some boys and girls to abandon certain areas ofstudy at as early an age as 14, or even 13 in the case of modernlanguages.    This is questionable in a society in which the naturalsciences, the social sciences, languages and the arts all playvital roles; few, inside or outside the schools, would contestthe conclusion that English and science and mathematics, devolped in up-to-date terms to the limit of the pupils&apos; skill and understanding, together with religious   education should find a place in the curriculum for all pupils at least to the age of 16.61.    Some narrowing of the range of subjects studies after 16is legitimate and perhaps inevitable, but traditional practice in England and Wales may have gone too far in this direction.Some of those who follow academic sixth form courses devote almost all their time to only 2 or 3 closely related subjects, withouteven the substantial broadening element of general studiesProvided in many schools.    There has however been much discussionelsewhere of this feature of secondary education, and it will come under scrutiny again in relation to possible changes in the examination system.
62.   Both before and after 16, care must be taken to seethat girls do not by their choices limit the range ofeducationaland career opportunities open to them.   Positive steps may benecessary to encourage girls to broaden and modernise theiraspirations and to feel confident of success in unfamiliarfields of science and technology.   This is particularly importantnow that there are many fewer places available in colleges ofeducation to which a large number of girls have traditionallygone for their higher education.63.     The curriculum for the less academic sixth formeris not well defined.    The same general principles apply as atearlier stages in the secondary school but particular care hasto be taken to ensure that in all cases the education given tothis very wide range of pupils furthers their career prospectsas well as their personal development.    It is important thatthey understand the range of opportunities open to them and what they stand to gain or lose by following one or other courseD.     Curriculum Development and Determination64-.    Control of secular   instruction in all maintained schoolsexcept aided secondary schools rests with the local educationauthority, subject to the provisions of the rules of management ^or articles of government.    In practice, much of the responsiD^for deciding the curriculum of each school is devolved by thelocal education authorities and the governors or managers uponthe teachers and head teachers in the schools.    The relativeinterests in this matter of the governors/managers, the tea&apos;cheJ^and the local education authorities are under consideration ^RESTP?CTr&apos;
consultativelaylor Committee; and it is not the intention of this /documentto anticipate the debate which their conclusions will initiate.But, however matters maybe resolved      between local educationauthorities, governors/managers, and teachers in the schools,section 23 of the Education Act 1944 lays upon the Secretaryof State for Education an obligation to have regard to widernational needs-.   It would not be compatible with thelegal duty of the Secretaries of State to &quot;promote theeducation of the people of England and Wales&quot;, or with theiraccountability to Parliament, to abdicate from leadershipon educational issues which have become a matter of livelypublic concern.65.     The pattern of responsibility in relation to theschool curriculum should reflect closely the general considerationsabout the structure of the education service stated in paragraphs^y-/ 9 and 1CL/ above.   The Secretaries of State are responsible for educationpolicy at the national level.   It is therefore for them, inconsultation with their partners in the education service, toconstruct a framework for the school curriculum.    It is then in turn for the local education authorities to oo-ordinate thecurriculum and its development in their own areas, taking accountof both the work of the Schools Council and local circumstances,and consulting local interests.   They will thus provide the curriculunplanning within which the proper professional freedom of individual schools and their teachers can be exercised to thebest advantage.66.     The Secretaries of State are entitled to expect that,nationally and within any one local education authority area,&quot;the school curriculum matches up to national educational objectives.They may seekevidence,for example, that local authority and school decisionsensure that primary school pupils are adequately equipped with the basic tools of learning, that the provision and performance in modern languages in secondary schools matches&quot;the needs of a member of the European Economic Community, and&quot;that pupils in our schools are being made aware of the needs
of our industrial society and that they are given theproper educational preparation to play their part within it.   To this end the Secretaries of State will seek toestablish a broad agreement with their partners in theeducation service on a framework for the curriculum,and particularly on whether part of the curriculum shouldbe protected because there should be aims common to allschools and to all pupils at certain stages.67.     As the next step in this direction the secretaries of State propose to invite the local authority and teacherassociations to take part in early consultations about theconduct of a review of curricular arrangements in each localauthority area.   The Schools Council will be invited to play a part in these consultations.   Appropriate provision willalso be made for other interested organisations  to express their views.6*1.     The intention of the Secretaries of State is that,following these consultations, they should issue a circularasking all local education authorities to carry out the review in their own areas in consultation with their teachers and to report the results within about twelve months.   TheDepartments would then analyse the replies as a preliminary to consultations on the outcome of the review and on thenature of any advice which the Secretaries of State might thenissue on curricular matters.69.     The circular initiating the review would call forinformation about the existing practice of local educationauthorities and schools in their area, and any plans already in hand for developing it.   The following broad headingsindicate the ground it is intended the review should cover:Local arrangements for the co-ordination of thecurriculum and any plans for its development.The transition of pupils between schools
The keeping of school records of pupils&apos; progress (see paragraphs 9R5-97)Balance and breadth in the curriculumPreparation for working life, including all aspects of schools/industry understanding and liaison and careerseducationThe study of selected subject areas (eg English, MathematModern Languages, Science).
VI      WELSH IN THE CURRICULUM OF THE SCHOOLS OF WALES70.    During the recent public debate consultations have been held(with the local education authorities, teacher associations anainterests) on the place of Welsh in the curriculum and theattainments which might be expected in and through the two langua^eof Wales.   English is the language of the majority of the peopleWales and is universally spoken and understood.   The need forcompetence in English referred to earlier applies equally to s&amp;00^in Wales.   But Welsh is the first language of a significant ^proportion of the population and is a national language in Wales*language has played an important part in the shaping of contemptWelsh society; it is the key to a literature in which much of Wels^culture is embodied: and it is the focal point of the heritage owhich children in Wales need to become aware if they are to be **     ,to understand their identity and their place within the UnitedIt is because language carries these cultural values that learntthe language involves more than the learning of a skill, althoughthe additional language experience provided has educational value in its own right.    It is for reasons such as these that children ^fWales should be given the opportunity to have Welsh included incurriculum in accordance with parental wishes and where practic^ ^considerations allow.   The evidence does not suggest that eitherinclusion of Welsh in the curriculum or its use as a medium of teaching has harmful effects on general educational progress.71.    Welsh is taught either as a first or second language inmajority of the schools in Wales but the linguistic composition  ^communities in Wales is now so varied that in each authority s6    ^different kinds of provision are made.   In areas where the use 0Welsh language is widespread it is the general practice to educ&amp;*Welsh-speaking children through the medium of Welsh at the inf^stage, and at the junior stage too Welsh is used increasingly        palongside English.   Its use in secondary schools is also growing&apos;
areas where Welsh-speaking children are a minority, their interests have been served increasingly through the establishment, in response to parental demand, of officially designated bilingual schools orunits.   Substantial numbers of children whose home language isEnglish now attend these schools.   A number of other primary schools in the more anglicised areas are now making some use of Welsh as a medium of learning for children whose first language is English.However, Welsh as a second language is for the most part taught as aseparate subject, starting in some schools at the infant stage butin others at the junior.    This type of provision continues into the secondary schools, in most of which children are expected to takeWelsh for the first 2 or 3 years, after which it becomes an optionalarea of study.72.     In recent years there has been an encouraging volume ofdevelopmental work in the teaching and the use of Welsh and support for the preparation of books and other materials in the welsh language has been given by several agencies.   In both the more Welshand the more anglicised areas there are schools which succeed inenabling children whose home language is not Welsh to reachcommendable levels of fluency.   But in the consultationsdisappointment has been expressed with the levels of attainmentreached by many other children.   This disappointment is in partrelated to a concern that the continuing fall in the number ofchildren whose home language is Welsh is not being counterbalancedby a comparable number who acquire fluency in Welsh as a secondlanguage.    It also derives from doubts about the educational value tothe individual child of studies in which attainment levels are low.73.     In those areas where most people still use Welsh extensivelyand in which both English and Welsh are required to varying degreesand in varying contexts it is a proper objective of the curricula ofthe schools to enable pupils to develop a command of the welsh language which will allow them to enter fully into the life of theircommunity.    In some schools this objective is being achieved, but notin many.    In those areas where Welsh is spoken only by smallMinorities schools do not have the initial advantage of the presence
of substantial numbers of Welsh-speaking children.   But even mareas, and even in schools where the teaching of Welsh is limitedto a few weekly lessons, some children whose home language isEnglish have become fluent speakers of Welsh.   These, however, ubeen a very small proportion of those who learn Welsh as a secondlanguage.   It is axiomatic that the educational value of learnin&amp;Welsh as a second language increases with the extent to which i*enables pupils to become proficient users of the language.Nevertheless levels of attainment lower than fluency can represena worthwhile achievement; although only a limited ability to produlanguage activity may have been acquired, levels of comprehensionmay be high and substantial appreciation of the history and societ^of Wales may have been gained.   An awareness of the history 01and the roots from which present society has sprung is importantitself.   Attitudes are among the most powerful predeterminants 0*success in language learning and parents more readily accept thevalue of Welsh when the teaching of the language is seen to be effective.74..     A number of reasons can be offered for the low levels ofattainment which are evident in many schools.    In some areas thepedagogical task is made more difficult by the varied languagebackgrounds of pupils within the same class.   Social mobilitycompounds the difficulties.   But there is also evidence from ?eCesurveys conducted by HM Inspectors, particularly where comparis05Jhas been made of pupils&apos; achievements in the learning of Weisntheir attainments in other areas of the curriculum, that the expectations of many teachers are unduly low.   This is reflected in the   meagre time allocations which are afforded the languagemany schools.   Welsh tends to be taught in isolation from otherlearning experiences.   And there are widespread weaknesses inteaching techniques.   The schools which stand out as successfu-1-the teaching of Welsh as a second language are the designatedbilingual schools, attended by large numbers of children from     0where Welsh is not spoken, and those other schools which conce on promoting communication skills in the second language.   Bot-1 ^formal research and more general observation, in Wales and else
support the view that children learn a second language more effectively to the extent that native language learning conditionsare simulated which allow the learner to use the language he islearning.   Progression and continuity are also basic to success in the learning of Welsh.   But serious deficiencies in thecontinuity of the teaching in many areas of Wales, both betweenstages and within schools, indicate insufficient oversight ofchildren&apos;s learning programmes.   These and other considerationspoint to the need for clearer policies to ensure continuity andfor the growth of in-service training.        The level of outputof trained teachers from the colleges is at present geared toknown needs.   The proportion of teachers needing to be trainedto teach Welsh or to teach through the medium of Welsh could begauged and planned more adequately if authorities were to examinetheir needs in relation to the present shortcomings in provision.clear language policies formulated by authorities in consultation*ith parents and teachers so as to reflect in a purposeful waythe linguistic character of their areas would provide an element of motivation and would enable individual schools in turn to formulate positive policies within the framework provided.Authorities in Wales are therefore invited to include suchPolicies in the report on curricular plans for their areas whichhave been called for in this paper.75.   The Secretary of State for Wales is considering requestsfrom several bodies for specific grants to be made towards thecost of bilingual education.   In this connection the Governmenthave indicated in their Green Paper on local government finance(Cmnd 6815) that they will wish to discuss any proposals involving a wider use of specific grants with local authority associations.
VII     STANDARDS76.   At the regional conferences there was no widespreadview that there had been a serious decline in educationalstandards.    But elsewhere, the conviction has been expressed that deterioration has occurred,    what has undoubtedly made higher standards difficult to achievein recent years has been the high rates of wastage andturnover among teachers in both primary and secondary schools, especially in some deprived urban areas.   In1962, the proportion of teachers who left the professionthe wastage rate - was 8.4%;   by 1972, it had risen to-5%i and in addition a further 11% changed schools.    Inthe urban areas the percentages were much higher.    Pupilsin some of the older city schools often suffered fromfrequent changes of teaching staff.   Added to this were
the demands of change itself on teachers&apos; time, skillsand energy:    for example the raising of the school leaving age, reorganisation of secondary education and newapproaches to the syllabus, such as modern mathematicsor Nuffield science.   One important reason for expectingeducational standards now to improve is the marked declinein wastage among teachers in the last 2 years.   It isestimated that in 1976 wastage was between 6 % and 7i%and in many urban authorities turnover was less than halfthe 1974 figure.   A period of stability would do a greatdeal of good for our schools.77.   Within the general broadening of the curriculumthere has been an extension of the range of skills andideas that have been looked for in children.   It has beenalleged that, in primary schools, improved fluency inwriting has been achieved at the expense of accuracy inspelling and punctuation;    and that efforts to introducemodern aspects of mathematics and to reduce apprehensionin pupils have been accompanied by diminished accuracy intraditional arithmetic.   Undoubtedly some teachers in both primary and secondary schools have been strugglingto teach beyond the limit of their previous experience and professional competence, and this is an importantcause for        concern, for example, in relation tostandards of achievement in French.   Some of these problemsare essentially transitional; they will disappear as teachers gainmore experience of the new methods. Others can be overcome bypreparation, in-service training and as CD   It will be insufficient justto maintain present standards; like the nation as a whole the schoolsmust be prepared to meet the growing and changing demands of the future.VIII     ASSESSMENT78,    Growing recognition of the need for schools to demonstrate their accountability in the society whichthey serve has led the Secretaries of State and also many local authorities to the conclusion that standards of performance of the whole system should be regularlymonitored.   Assessment is often undertaken with a view to
maintaining or raising standards, but it is not its solepurpose;   for instance, much assessment of individualpupils is of a diagnostic character.   Assessment of the performance of the educational system, assessment of schools, and assessment of individuals are considered in turn below.   In all cases it is important to apply propermethods of assessment and to interpret findings with care.A.   Assessment of the performance of the system79.     There are two separate systems for&quot; inspection, KMInspectorate and the local education authority advisory service.   They provide well established methods of describingand assessing the performance of the system and institutionswithin it, and, on this basis, contribute to the support anddevelopment of schools and teachers and to any necessaryremedial   action if a school is consistently less than satisfaCBoth need to be staffed to match the demands made upon them.   Inspection is concerned with the process ofeducation, with the educational performance of the pupils,and with the relationships between the two.   It seeks inthe first place to answer the question: is the work inwhich the pupils are engaged suited to the circumstances inwhich they are growing up, and is the work pitched at a level and conducted in a way that will enable them to makethe progress they should?   It then seeks to analyse andinterpret the findings of the inspection process in orderto arrive at wider educational conclusions.   The uses towhich the results of inspection by local inspectors and advisers are put are at the discretion of the localeducation authorities.   As far as HM Inspectorate isconcerned, their conclusions must (in the aggregate) be capable of being related nationally to the performance ofthe system.80.    A complementary approach to assessing the system asa whole involves the use of tests, designed to producefactual descriptions of performance in specific aspects oflearning.   When these are to be used to judge the performance--i ....... t. &apos;.; U ft &apos;
of the system as a whole, or major parts of it, they donot need to be given to all pupils.   It is sufficient onlyto test a statistically valid sample, and this has theadvantage that it minimises the impact on individualpupils and schools who need only occasionally beincluded among those to whom   tests are administered.   Thenature and detailed design of such tests is, however,important on whatever scale monitoring is undertaken.81-   Choices of various kinds have to be made about theaspects of performance to be measured.    Should all majoraspects of the curriculum, however defined, be included?Within, say, English language, should oral competence be tested as well as reading and writing?   How far is it important to test competence in the different forms of pupils&apos; writing?   How important is it to assess pupilattitudes to school work and behaviour   as well as their skillsand the ability to apply general principles to specificcircumstances?   The ages at which the samples of children are tobe tested also need careful consideration.82.   The Assessment of Performance Unit (APU) of theDepartment of Education and Science, within its general
Dterms of reference*, is concentrating at present on thedevelopment of tests suitable for national monitoring in english language, mathematics and science as they are found across the school timetable.   Working groupscomprising teachers (both from schools and higher education)local education authority advisers, HM Inspectors, experts in the techniques of educational testing and others aredetermining, under the oversight of a co-ordinating group,what should be tested and how;   and these groups willoversee the production of test materials.   Their work isguided by a consultative committee representing a wide*   The terms of reference of the APU are:-To promote the development of methods of assessingand monitoring the achievement of children at school,and to seek to identify the incidence of under-achievement.The tasks laid down are:-1.   To identify and appraise existing instruments and methods of assessment which may be relevant for these purposes.2.   To sponsor the creation of new instruments andtechniques for assessment, having due regard tostatistical and sampling methods.3.   To promote the conduct of assessments in co-operationwith local education authorities and teachers.4.   To identify significant differences of achievementrelated to the circumstances in which children learn,including the incidence of under-achievement, and tomake the findings available to those concerned withresource allocation within the Department, localeducation authorities and schools.
KSTRI.CTEDrange of educational interests.     This machinery, besidestackling the detail, is concerned with questions such asthose mentioned in paragraph 84;  and also with what samplingsystem should be chosen so as to ensure reliable results insufficient detail without unduly disturbing the work of schools.    It is intended, as has already been announced, to embark on a programme of national assessment in 1978.    this programme will start in the area of mathematics, probablywith 11 and 15 year olds, and move secondly into the field of english language.B.     Assessment of Schools83.   Local education authorities need to be able to assess the relative performance of their schools to reach decisions about staffing, the allocation of resources, and other matters.In particular, they need to be able to identify        schoolswhich        consistently perform poorly, so that approp-riate remedial action can be taken.   Such assessments will nodoubt often take account of examination and test results, but will also depend heavily on a detailed knowledge of thecircumstances of the schools by the authorities&apos; officers,their inspectors and advisers, and such self assessment as mayhe undertaken by the schools.    The work of the assessment of Performance Unit will not provide a basis for assessing the relative performance of individual schools.    &quot;Leaguetables&apos; of school performance based on examination orstandardised test results in isolation can be seriously mis-leading because they fail to take account of other important factors. This danger will be recognised by local education^nthorities which are operating assessment practices (of whatever type)Welding results for their schools individually.   Increasinglyschools should assess their own performance against their ownQhcectives as well as external criteria.    In so doing they may be*Pected to keep under review much information useful totheir governors, the local authority and HM Inspectorate.
C.   Assessment of the performance of pupils as individuals84.   The main purposes of the assessment of individual pupils aIa. to provide teachers with information about theprogress and needs of pupils for whom they areresponsible, and to enable them to assess the effectiveness of their own planning and teaching;b. to enable the pupils to know how they areprogressing and to provide incentives to betterperformance;c. to enable parents to be informed about theirchildren1s educational progress..d.   to provide information about pupils at points of transition within the educational system and whenthey leave school to start work or to go on tofurther and higher education.85.   The first of these functions of assessment is toprovide the evidence that teachers require in judging theprogress of their pupils and what next needs to be taughtand how.   To these ends teachers adopt a variety ofprocedures, alone and in combination.   There is, forexample, the minute - to-minute questioning and scrutiny of children&apos;s work that is an ordinary part of the schoolday.   There are        the setting of objective tests and ofperiodic internal school examinations.   It is necessaryto judge        general levels of performance in particular aspe0the curriculum and tne variation of performance across thecurriculum.    Teachers also need to pin-point individual weal^ethrough diagnostic assessment, including testing.   here the professional competence and knowledge of the teacher isof prime importance.    The APU, despite its orientation to
assessment of the system as a whole, will also producesome tests suitable for use by local education authoritiesand teachers for this purpose.   The Education departments will encourage the development of such tests.   It is hopedthat they will become widely used by schools;   greaterconsistency of practice   can   only be beneficial.86.   Some kinds of assessment are an incentive toperformance;    often   the   incentive   effect is incidental   to other objectives of assessment although no less important for that.   But assessment can distractand burden the pupil or the tender.   This can be avoidedin external examinations since not allindividual pupils need be entered.   It may be more difficultto avoid applying to all pupils tests developed and usedwithin the school;    and no doubt schools will continue toconsider carefully the extent of internal testing inrelation to their own circumstances, and the needs andabilities of their pupils.8?.   Assessment (often continuous, supplemented by tests)is a necessary part of the process by which a teacher comes to know and understand his or her pupils: so assessment also helpsprovide the information needed for transmission to parents.The needs of parents are considered further in Section XII.88.   The importance of transmitting useful information aboutchildren when they transfer between schools has already been emphasised in paragraph 41.   Again, assessment can contribute to the relevant information.The retrieval of this information needs to be assured bya system of record-keeping (on which more is said inSectionlX).D.     The idea of a leaving certificate for all pupilsTraditionally, information about pupils on leavingschool for employment or further and higher education has
been conceived chiefly in terms of the results of publicexaminations taken at 16+ and 18f.    The General certificate of Education &apos;0&apos; and &apos;A&apos; levels provide for the more academicpupils and the Certificate of Secondary Education provides forother examination candidates:    some four fifths of all schoolleavers now have some graded examination results.    Thereare,however, limitations to the usefulness of this information&apos;First, examination results do not offer a comprehensive picture of the abilities of any individual school leaver and onlya very partial view of the many who have only one or twosubject grades to show.    Second, it is clear that even with a further increase in the proportion of school leaverstaking examinations, many pupils will continue to leavewithout achieving graded examination results, and it isdoubtful whether the pupils or the schools would be helped by further examinations.    Attainments, motivation and personal qualities not reflected in examination resultswill be of interest to employers and others, and it maynot always be possible to assess these simply by interview.This raises the question whether there should be leavingcertificates for all pupils.90.     There are a number of practical difficulties.First, it is not clear how widely the value of suchcertificates would be recognised, even locally,unless it can be demonstrated that the standardsportrayed by the teachers completing the certificatesare consistent.    Second, there is the risk that thecertificates might be more of a discouragement to those whose certificates were unfavourable (as some must balfour the system is to attain credibility) than a stimulus to the rest.    Third, the production of honest and
frank reports on certain pupils could engender controversy between parents and teachers.   There are nevertheless a number of relevant local experiments which the secretaries of State will   watch   with   interest:    they   willalso consider commissioning a national study into thepossibilities for a leaving certificate.E.   Public examinations91.   The Secretaries of State are at present consideringthe Schools Council&apos;s proposals for changes in the single-subject examinations taken normally at the age of 16+ andfor the introduction of an examination for some pupilsaged 17+.   The Schools Council is also actively pursuingthe possibility of changes to 18+ examinations.   this review is designed to meet the concern (noted in paragraph61) that exists about the present degree of specialisationin the sixth form curriculum.   There are also criticismsat the fourth and fifth form stage of diffuseness andinsufficient regard for certain basic educational essentials.The Government accept the need to end uncertainty over thedevelopment of 16+ and 17+ examinations and the value of implementing desirable changes without delay.   But, equally,they are determined that any changes introduced shallstand the test of time and that the examinations of thefuture as of the present shall have national currency and acceptance.   Decisions will therefore only be taken when this can be done with confidence.92.   Reference has been made in paragraph 60   to the dropping of certain subjects as early as 14 or 13.   Thepresent system of single subject GCE 0 level and CSEexaminations at 16+   is healthy in that it helps schoolsto tailor the curriculum to fit the needs of individualpupils who are taking external examinations, and it canbenefit those unlikely to be successful across a wide areaof the curriculum.   It has, however, been suggested that
a &quot;grouped&quot; certificate awarded to candidates successful ina number of specified subjects including mathematics and english, and possibly science and a modern language, might provide a useful incentive to pupils to follow morebalanced courses.93.   Study of this possibility would not imply thatsingle-subject examining at 16+ should be abandoned.Those for whom it may be appropriate to take subjectsincluding none or some only of those specified could stilldo so and could receive notification of awards inessentially the present style.   Likewise, if issue of a&quot;grouped certificate&quot; was conditional on the achievement ofcertain grades in one or more of the specified subjects *lesser grades could still be recorded as they are now.Presentationally the award of a &quot;grouped certificate&quot;might simply be indicated by the addition to a certificateon the present pattern of a suitable form of words, whosesense could be &quot;The foregoing means that the candidatehas also qualified for /a grouped certificate/&quot;.   Alternatian additional separate certificate might be provided, andthis would seem to be necessary as things are today if a candidate obtained the qualifying grades partly by wayof GCE 0 level and partly by way of CSE.94,   This outline description of the possibilities leaves of detailed points for further consideration.The uses to which such a grouped certificate might be putby employers or further and higher education would need careful scrutiny,   when such issues have been studied,it will be necessary to consult further on the issue ofprinciple, whether a &quot;grouped certificate&quot; on the trestbasis that can be devised should or should not be introduce&apos;The Government intend   to take that decision in due course,but are under no illusion that the appropriate study canbe completed quickly or that it will not be controversial&apos;At the same time the sooner it is started the better.
the Government will be embarking on talks with the SchoolsCouncil and other bodies (including the Examination Boards)about the possibility of fitting the exploratory work intothe former&apos;s current programme.P.   Tests for all individual pupils in the schools95*   The Government are not directly concerned with thegeneral run of testing within schools of the kindsindicated in paragraph 84   above.   It has, however, beensuggested that individual pupils should at certain agestake   external &quot;tests of basic literacy and numeracy&quot;, the implication being that these tests should be of nationalcharacter and universally applied.   A number of localeducation authorities have already decided on or are considering using such tests in their areas.   The secretaries of State reject the idea that rigid and uniform nationaltests should be applied to all children at certain ages.Because of the differing abilities and rates of developmentof children of school age tests pitched at a single level would be irrelevant for some and beyond the reach of others.Moreover the temptation for schools to coach for suchtests would offer a serious risk of distortion of thecurriculum and possibly of lowering rather than raisingaverage standards of performance.   The legitimate aims ofattesting the individual competence of all pupils is more likely to be satisfied by individual monitoring, improvingschool records and possibly through exploration of theidea of the leaving certificate.IX-    RECORD KEEPING96.   The need for keeping school records of the educationaldevelopment of individual children has long been recognised,It is more than ever true today, bearing in mind both thegreater number of transfers between schools which now takeD
place as a result of increased parental mobility, and the wider range of opportunities for further education andcareer choice, that clear and reliable records of progressare necessary if individual help and counselling are tobe provided.    The keeping and transmission of records need to be systematic and understandable;    they should be subjectto clearly understood and agreed controls on what information is and what is not kept;    and on what is disseminated and towhom;    and full regard must be paid to the rights of parentsas well as those of teachers and pupils, to know what material-is included.97..   The Secretaries of State therefore propose that aspart of the review outlined in paragraphs 67-69,   localeducation authorities should examine and report on theirexisting practices in relation to records of pupils&apos;progress.   The review would cover the records themselves,arrangements for parents to see records, and the currencythe records should have.   There is a need for high standards of professional accuracy in record-keeping and for areasonable consistency of practice between different areasof the country.IJ.   v ;i      I 1
x   SPECIAL NEEDS OF MINORITY GROUPS98.   This consultative document is mainly concerned with the performance of schools and their pupils.   An important factornot dealt with at length is that for a significant number of pupils their performance (and indeed that of their schools) is affected by educational disadvantage of one kind or another.   TheGovernment&apos;s general policy on the needs of these children(otherthan the handicapped) was set out in a White Paper &quot;EducationalDisadvantage and the Educational Needs of Immigrants&quot; (Cmnd. 5720)in 1974.    It announced the establishment of two special unitswithin the Department of Education and Science, to be concernedwith different aspects of performance.   One of these, the assessment of Performance Unit, is described in paragraph 82.The other is the Educational Disadvantage Unit whose terms ofreference are:&quot;To serve as a focal point for consideration of matters, atall stages of education, connected with educationaldisadvantage and the education of immigrants;   to influence the allocation of resources in the interests of immigrantsand those identified, on the best currently availablecriteria, as suffering educational disadvantage;   to develop in association with the Assessment of Performance Unit other relevant criteria to improve this identification;    toestablish suitable arrangements for promoting good practice by the educational system in its treatment of the dis-advantaged and of immigrants.A-     The Needs of Ethnic Minority Children99.   Some children belonging to ethnic minorities, both recentimmigrants and the descendants of earlier immigrants, have specialcultural and educational needs.   For some of them there aredifficulties of adjustment to life in an alien language andculture.   The educational needs of such children have received^ch attention over the years from the teaching profession, from local education authorities and from the Education Departments;^his work has received useful impetus from reportsof the House of Commons Select Committee on Race Relations, the
latest of which has drawn particular attention to the needsof young West Indians.   The Secretaries of State have invitedviews from a wide range of bodies on the recommendations inthis report, including those concerning the statisticalmonitoring of pupils, students and teachers.   The Departmentsaim will continue to be to alleviate inequalities of opportunityfully as possible within the education system and to co-operate with other departments in joint social policies.   As well asseeking to improve the inadequate academic performance ofsome pupils of immigrant origin, the education service will need to encourage more of these young people to enter teaching,special courses of preparation for teacher training may also need to be arranged for mature students.    Such practical steps would be in the context of existing policy.   The Secretaries 0^State are also prepared to set up a committee of inquiry toconsider directions of future policy.   They are however concern that there should be a broad basis of agreement about the objectives of such a committee, and have invited views on whetherit should be concerned for example with West Indians only (as recommended by the Select Committee) or be extended to includethethe needs of other minority groups, or alternatively embracewider concept of the education of all children for life in a multi-racial society.100.     It would be quite wrong to think of the establishment 111this country of communities of overseas origin only in termsof the problems they present.   We should welcome the enrichmentof our culture which these communities can provide if we havethe imagination to accept it; schools and further and highereducational establishments have a key role to play.B. The Needs of Travelling Children101.     Children of travelling parents, such as gypsies, tendpresent problems to the education service, whose duty to them is nonetheless as great as its duty to others with special need 
Many authorities are to be commended on the particular measureswhich they have taken to help this section of the community, andthere are many success stories in the schools where suitableprovision has been made and integration into the school communityachieved.   The Secretaries of State hope that progress will bemaintained;    their Departments and HM Inspectors will assist.c.The Needs of the Handicapped and other Disadvantage^102.     A few children suffer from physical or mental handicap ormental disturbance so severe that dedicated and specialised efforts are needed to help them achieve the most modest (thoughnevertheless worthwhile) 1 evels of educational performance and social adjustment.   Many others have less serious handicaps whichcall for special education - in the traditional sense of the term - either in special schools or increasingly in ordinaryschools.    The integration of handicapped children into ordinaryschools, where this is in their interests and practicable, willbe helped when Section 10 of the Education Act 1976 is broughtinto force, and will receive close attention in the report ofthe Warnock Committee, due to be published next year.103.     Then there are those whose educational attitudes and performance are affected by other adverse factors.   These factorsare of many kinds - for example, inadequate parents, familypoverty or a squalid environment.   Sometimes more than onecombine to constitute a major handicap for a particular child.For such children a sensitively administered education servicemay offer the best hope of avoiding an adult life narrowed ordistorted by these beginnings.    It remains a tenet of theGovernment&apos;s educational policy to discriminate in favour ofthose who are under-privileged for whatever reasons.    different kinds of help may be needed by the various groups mentioned inthis section of the paper, wherever    they may live;   but it isalso right to devote extra resources to areas in which disadvantagexs notably concentrated - as for example is proposed in the recently announced policy for the inner cities.
XI.    THE TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT OF TEACHERSA.     General104*   Any plans for bringing about improvements in the schools&apos;curriculum and maintaining or raising standards will dependfor their success not only on the availability of the necess-aryhitsresources but also on the full understanding and support of the teacprofession, the quality of its membs rs and their adaptability to theto the. changing demands made on them. Both the Government1 s and localeducation authorities 1 policies must recognise this truth if theyare to succeed.1Q5-. The number of qualified teachers in maintained nursery,primary and secondary schools is about 459,000.    Every yearsome teachers retire and others give up teaching, if onlytemporarily (women often for family reasons).   Against thisloss newly qualified teachers are recruited and others return-after a period of absence.    In 1975? the peak year, over40,000 newly qualified teachers completed their training.The rapid fall in the school population,coupled with much reduced wastage from the profession, has led to a plannedcontraction of the training capacity.   When this has beencompleted, the output of newly qualified teachers will by theearly 1980*s be under 20,000.106. Both advantages and disadvantages flow from the new situation of reduced wastage and new recruitment.    On the onehand, the recent dramatic improvement in the stability of staffing of some schools in difficult areas has alreadyafforded a very welcome measure of relief.    Widespreadinexperience is no longer so serious a problem as in therecent past: whereas five years ago the proportion of teachers with less than two years&apos; service was one in five,it is now one in eight, and is likely to fall further.This greater stability is already having a favourable effecton educational standards in the schools.
107- On the other hand, though the normal non-graduatetraining course is now of three years1 duration, about half(150,000) of the non-graduate teachers at present in service were two-year trained; and, towards the aim of a fullygraduate profession, just over a quarter (120,000) of allteachers are graduates now.    The reduction in the recruitment of newly trained teachers limits the rate at which improvedinitial training arrangements can be effective in improving the qualifications and skills of the teaching force as awhole.   This emphasises the importance of measures directed at improving the efficiency of teachers already in service.108. After a period of great and rapid changes in the size and character of the school population, accompanied by continuing reorganisation of the schools system, it would besurprising if there were not some degree of &quot;mismatch&quot; betweenthe needs of the schools and the capacity of the presentteaching force to meet them.   Shortages of teachers ofparticular subjects persist and school curricula have oftenhad to be trimmed to square with the staff available.Whatever remedies may be applied it is clear that, in times ofeconomic stringency, everything cannot be put right at once and priorities will have to be established for both initial andin-service training.109.Apart from tackling problems of &quot;mismatch&quot;, it remains the Secretaries of State&apos;s intention to secure furtherquantitative improvement in staffing standards as soon aseconomic conditions allow.    The impending large scale declinein the school population means that this objective no longerrequires the continued growth of the teacher force.   If,for example, this   were to remain at its present level, therewould be no fewer than 60,000 teachers by the middle of the1980s available to improve staffing standards.   Even if the
RESTRICTEDteacher force were at a level a little below this during the1980s, a marked improvement would take place year by year instaffing standards.   If local authorities and the schoolsdeployed their teachers with this aim in view, there would behardly any classes of over 30 by the middle 1980&apos;s.   And, evenif the number of teachers were gradually to decline,betterstaffing standards could still be achieved, though more slowly-The plans recently announced for a further contraction of the teacher training capacity to a minimum of 45,000 places ofwhich 35,000 will be available for initial training, should ^esufficient   with the recruitment to be expected from other sources   to support a teacher force at any of these levels andso to allow for a continuing improvement in staffing duringthe next 10 years.110.   The reduction in opportunities to train for teaching comeSat a time when the numbers of young people seeking places in further and higher education are rising.   If the abilities ofthese highly motivated young people are not to be wasted, newcourses will need to be devised to help those who might otherwise have become teachers to find other satisfying and useful careers.111*   Society asks many things of its schools, often too manyibut there remains a range of tasks which are the special conce?11of schools and which make complex and changing demands on tneteachers collectively and individually.   The content of thecurriculum, even in traditional subjects, must reflect thecurrent state of knowledge and the needs of the individual       0citizen together with the requirements of employers.   As hasnoted earlier in this paper, the balance of the curriculum mustreflect the need to prepare both girls and boys not only &quot;todevelop personal gifts but also*to live responsibly withincommunity and to make a substantial and lively contribution t0our industrial, technological and

They must be constantly alert to ensure that their teaching, guidance andassessment help their pupils to make the best of the opportunitiesavailable.   No teacher can properly stand aside from these requirements.    Some have functions which cannot be carried out without a high degree of special expertise.   In particularthere must be within the body of teachers a number highly skilled in the creation of relaxed and efficient schoolcommunities, whatever their size and type.    This means teachersnot only gifted in management, but aware of the strengths andweaknesses of their colleagues and open to the community theyserve.112*    A coherent approach is needed in which policies forthe initial education and training of teachers, induction,in-service training, and other aspects of the deployment andcareer development of the teachers will combine to providestaffs for the schools better equipped to deal with theirPresent and emergent tasks.    The following paragraphs set outthe provisional ideas of the Secretary of State for Education and science (who is responsible for the supply and training of teachers in both England and Wales) on these matters.    Many of the proposalsdescribed will need discussion with the representatives of teachers and local authorities and other interests concerned, and she will seek the advice of the Advisory Committee on the Supply anddraining of Teachers (ACSTT).
five years following the James Report.   Three and four yearBEd courses have been developed and provision has been madefor a proportion of students to follow four year courses.Some educational interests have advocated four year courses for all but lack of resources precludes this development.The new patterns have not yet had time to prove theireffectiveness but it will be important to monitor themcarefully and to judge what modifications may be needed.The regional conferences have, however, revealed fairlywidespread misgivings in relation to the following issues:.-a. whether entrants to the teaching profession havea sufficient command of the English language andare adequately numerate;b. whether teachers have an adequate appreciation of world outside the education system, particularly taeimportance of industry and commerce to the nationalbeine and the problems facing.an industrial societyourisin an increasingly competitive world; vc. whether existing courses of teacher education give enoUattention to the role of teachers in a multi-culturalsociety;d. whether existing courses of teacher education furnishf the students with the essential intellectual mastery 01subjects they will teach;e. whether they provide students with a sufficient graspof the professional implications and practicalapplications of sound educational theory to make thee1effective teachers capable of directing children&apos;work and of ensuring their good discipline;f. whether the Governmenfs policy of a large measureof integration of teacher education with higher education generally is or is not likely to enhancethe quality of training and allay the misgivingsreferred to above.
114.   The aim of the Secretary of State is that there shouldbe as soon as possible an all-graduate entry into the teaching profession and that from about 1979 or 1980 the entry to theexisting Certificate courses should be phased out, except forthe shortened courses in particular subject areas for matureentrants with relevant qualifications or experience and thatthe normal minimum entrance qualifications to BEd coursesshould be 2 A-levels.    She proposes also that entrants to suchcourses should have qualifications at a minimum of 0-levelgrade C or CSE grade 1 in English and mathematics or shouldotherwise satisfy the institution concerned and its validatingbody of numeracy and literacy to the equivalent level.115.    The Secretary of State is,  however, particularly conscious of the value for the schools of a flow of entrants to teachingwho have broad and diverse backgrounds, experience and interestsshe has particularly in mind those who belong to the ethnicminorities or who have had experience of the problems of innercity areas as well as those with a wide variety of industrialor commercial experience.In her consultations with ACSTT on the proposals for phasingout the Certificate courses she has   asked in particular for advice on what special measures might be necessaryto ensure that these categories of potential teachers have adequate opportunities to qualify themselves for entry toteacher training courses.116-.    The Secretary of State shares the misgivings of thosewho believe that too many entrants to the teaching professionhave inadequate experience and understanding of the worldoutside education, including its multi-cultural and multi-racialaspects, and of the problems of an industrial society, whichare of crucial importance to careers education.Opportunities provided by the integration of teachereducation with other forms of higher education  especially intechnology and business studies, will help to reduce theisolation of the former and give teachers a better acquaintancewith, and understanding of, the industrial world.
Already some institutions have developed strategies to thisend.   The Secretary of State is also anxious that where possible preference should be given in recruitment to applicants who have had some employment outside the world ofeducation so that the traditional cycle of school/training/school can be broken and that eventually thegreat majority of teachers will have had at least somepersonal experience of the world of employment outside educati011for which the majority of their pupils are destined.117.   Suggestions have been made that the teacher educationcurriculum should be changed to place greater emphasis onacquainting intending teachers with the national importance ofindustry and commerce, and, their problems, career opportunityeSopen to school leavers, and the challenges which our societyas a whole must face.   The Secretary of State believes thatthese aspects should be given greater attention in initialteacher training and that training establishments should makespecific provision to cover them.   Establishments should be vable to do this effectively if those in training include areasonable number with first hand experience of these problems and if good.use is made of this resource, supplemented by the118. Subjects should be taught in a way that keeps in view therelevance to life outside school, whether in the sense of theirpractical and industrial applications, as in the case ofmathematics, science and technology, or in the sense of theirsignificance for understanding society, as in the case of history, language, literature and religious education.    Theseideas are not new and in varying degrees already influence the teaching in many colleges.1J .   The Secretary of State shares the widespread view thatteacher education and other higher education should be more closely integrated, both institutionally and in course structThis policy, together with the phasing out of the Certificatecourse and the raising of entry standards, should ensure thatteachers have a thorough knowledge of their subjects.    Doubts
are, however, felt lest, as a corollary, insufficientattention may be paid to teaching skills and that in more general-purpose institutions of higher education the specialresources needed for professional aspects of training may bedissipated and lose their impact.C.     Possible Developments in Support of Greater ProfessionalSkillsThe Secretary     of State has   in mind three proposalswhich she   believes would help to avert this danger and to reinforce the professional aspects of teacher education.First,    she would like to see introduced a policy for muchgreater exchange of teachers between schools and colleges sothat each has a better understanding of the other role.Second, she   proposes to foster the growth ofa network of centres of scholarship and professionalexpertise within the reorganised teacher training system.She   would hope that, over a period, some institutions would cometo be recognised as national or regional centres of development and resources in particular fields in relation to both initialand in-service training. .   Thus a centre might be subject-oriented, or it might specialise in development work for particular age ranges of children, as certain colleges alreadydo; other centres might take the lead in recognised problem areas suchas remedial education, or the teaching of the mentally handicapped.Some might make their special contributions in areas of concern to teachers generally, such as the problems of inner city schoolsor children suffering deprivation, or education for life in a multi-cultural society, or the development of careers education.Some would be more directly concerned with professional skills andteaching techniques, others with developments in particular subjectfields, but these two elements are complementary and need to be closely related.
121.   Third, the Secretary of State sees a gap in thecurrent arrangements for the development of the content of teacher education and training, in that those who areprofessionally concerned with these matters at presentmeet separately under the auspices of the CNAA andvalidating universities, in committees established byteachers&apos; associations and in UCET.   The Secretary of Stateproposes to discuss with the teachers&apos; and other interestedorganisations how this gap might best be filled.D.   Induction122.   It has long been recognised that newly trainedteachers could benefit from more systematic help in overcoming the initial problems encountered during their first year of teaching.    In 1971 the James committee recommended improved arrangements which should include,among other things, release of new teachers from schoolduties for training for at least one-fifth of their time.123.   Pilot schemes for the induction of newly trainedteachers were introduced, with special financial assistancefrom the Government, in the areas of two local educationauthorities - Liverpool and Northumberland - and several other authorities introduced pilot induction schemes ontheir own account.
The Department of Education and Science through its research budgetits financing work by the University of Bristol School of Educationwhich is promoting and co-ordinating the monitoring and evaluationof the pilot schemes; and later in the year it will sponsora conference of those most closely concerned with a view todrawing together the practical lessons which can be learned.124. Tne Secretary of State  considers  that the time is ripeto devise more comprehensive arrangements for supportingteachers in their initial period of service on entering the profession, and for assessing their progress during thatperiod.    The general spread of induction schemes within thenext few years should provide newly qualified teachers with more systematic support than has normally been the casehitherto.    It should be possible for the workload and levelof responsibility which new teachers undertake during thisperiod of practical apprenticeship to be reduced and more closely defined, and there should be no necessity for the moredifficult teaching tasks to be assigned to them.   The Secretaryof State also envisagesthat designated experienced members ofstaff should be given special responsibility for overseeingtheir work and progress.125.   The reduction in the^rate of recruitment of newteachers should make these developments possible withoutadding unduly to the burdens of experienced staff;    itshould also enable a closer watch to be kept on theprogress of new teachers (for longer than just the first year of service if necessary), and a higher standard of practical competence to be required for the passing of probation than was feasible during the years of severeteacher shortage.   It would be consistent with this approach that the status awarded on successful completionof training should be an interim one, and that the achievement of full status, as a passport to a teaching career, shouldawait the satisfactory completion of probation.   the teacher&apos;s permanent appointment might also be deferred until that time, his probationary service being undertaken on a separate contract reflecting his interim status andlightened responsibilities.
126,   Clearly such changes could not be introducedimmediately;    in the meantime the Secretary of Stateintends to consult the local authority and teachers1associations on the best way to embark on a study of measures of this kind intended to improve the levelof professional competence among teachers at the early stagof their career.E.     In-Service Training12? Normal in-service training, as distinct from the re-trai11^mentioned in paragraph 137   , is that which everyteacher would expect to undertake from time to time throughouthis career, in order to keep abreast of his subject, to extendand refine teaching techniques, to accommodate to new pattern of school organisation, or to prepare for new responsibilitieSThe need may spring from such diverse things as, for example&apos;the adoption of new examination syllabuses, the creation of middle schools, new technological applications of science, anchanges in systems of pastoral care or careers guidance.128.. The fall in the number of births and in wastage from the teaching profession means a declining inflow of newly quali^1teachers to schools, so that there is both        opportunity and     greater need for in-service training.   At the same time&apos; llthe shift in school population from primary to secondary   wlrequire changes in the roles of many teachers if widespreadredundancies are to be avoided.    This will be followed by 9contrary shift if the birth rate recovers.129.. Already local authorities through professional centres and their advisory services, subject and teachers associa^j-colleges and universities - especially the ,Open University - provide a wide range of courses, workshop5conferences which enable many teachers, often in their sparetime and at considerable personal sacrifice, to improve thei3-&quot;  ^qualifications.   But provision varies widely from area toin some authorities is quite inadequate:   moreover there ig
evidence to suggest that existing provision has been reduced.Release for full time training has in particular suffered inrecent years and has been only partially replaced by equivalentpart-time courses.130.   The Government&apos;s expenditure plans (Cmnd 6721) envisageincreasing financial provision for in-service training.    Theexpenditure plans, which are of course subject to annual review, assume that the number of full-time equivalentteachers released for in-service education and inductiontraining will rise from the full-time equivalent of 4,500 in1977 to the full-time equivalent of 18,500 in 1981.131.   The Secretary of State&apos;s plans for the reorganisation ofteacher education make provision for resources equivalentto 10,000 full-time places in polytechnics and colleges tobe available in support of in-service training of all kinds,which could include not only longer full-time and part-timecourses but also consultancy services, related for example to school-based training and co-operation in the work of teachers&apos; centres.    In addition, university provision amountsto perhaps 3,000 full-time equivalent places.    The provisionof resources on this scale is a necessary but not in itself a sufficient guarantee that programmes will develop on thescale the Government would wish to see.132-    Because of their direct responsibility for the quality of education in their schools and for the complicatedadministrative and logistic arrangements which an expansionon this scale will require, local education authorities willhave the major responsibility for developing programmes ofin-service education and training.    The Government believethat, to ensure the fullest co-operation of teachers andtraining institutions, each authority should establish advisorymachinery on which both should be fully represented, to helpdevelop its plans.    Many authorities have in fact already done s
135* While the greater part of in-service training will hedeveloped on a local authority basis, provision of longer,more advanced and more specialist courses will need to be organised at sub-regional or regional and sometimes national level.    The Government regret that their earlier proposalsfor regional committees were not acceptable and will putforward fresh proposals on this matter when the working group on the Management of Higher Education has reported.1^4-. Programmes of in-service education and training will need to reflect the special needs and problems of the areaconcerned.    The Secretary     of State believes, however, thatoverall there are certain priorities which need to be borne in mind, in addition to the re-training courses referred toin--paragraph 137 below.    These include:a. provision for in-service training (and      induction-programmes) in relation toihe special problems ofmulti-racial schools, immigrant communities and schools in deprived inner urban areas;b. the development of language skills and mathematicalskills at all levels but with particular attentionto the primary stages;c. improvement of professional competence to recognisepupils&apos; handicaps of various kinds and to counterthem as far as possible; mainly therefore, butnot exclusively, in the field of remedial educationat both primary and secondary stages;d. the continuing need for the training of seniorteachers, especially heads of departments and headteachers, for the complex tasks of schoolorganisation aid management, including the design and planning of the curriculum, to help them makethe most effective use of all available resources,not least the talents of the school staff itself?in providing for the diverse needs of their pupil3&apos;
135-   The Secretary of State believes that, while coursesinvolving substantial periods of full-time release arerequired to meet particular needs, full benefit will onlybe secured if in-service training is focused on the specificobjectives and problems of individual schools and is therefore to that extent school-based.136.   The Government are making arrangements to channel fundsthrough the Manpower Services Commission for the first year ofretraining and, indeed, initial training of teachers of certainshortage subjects listed in paragraph 137a.   In the longer term,in-service training might be considered appropriate for specific grants if the scope of such grants were to be widened.   TheGovernment have indicated in their Green Paper on local government finance (Cmnd 6813) that they will discuss with the localauthority associations any proposals for an extension of specific grants.F.     Making the best use of our Teachers137*   During a period of declining pupil numbers, the need to match the changing requirements of the service should be understood and accepted by both teachers and employing authoritiesRe-training, as distinct from initial and from normal in-service training, may be necessary, for example to enable teachers with suitable potential to fill vacancies in shortage-subject areas.It will include:a. meeting the need for specialist teachers inthe physical sciences, mathematics, craft,design and technology, which are particularlyrelevant to the country&apos;s industrial needs and where there have been persistent shortages ofadequately qualified teachers for many years;b. retraining teachers to work with children ofdifferent ages, to take account of the changes inage structure of the school population;
c.     the further training of suitable candidates with experience in ordinary schools for teaching thehandicapped.138.     Employing aithorities will need todevelop more systematic approaches to the recruitment, careerdevelopment, training and deployment of their teacher force.For these purposes, they may well need to improve theiravailable stock of information about their teachers.   Forexample, if schemes for the training and retraining of teachersshortage subjects are to prosper, there must be, as far as circUstances  allow, an assurance of employment for those who succescomplete their training.   Local authorities will accordingly neeto forecast their requirements by subjects, at different levels of qualification, with some reliability.   Againlocal authorities will need to study the age distribution of their teachers in relation to particular subjects they are competent to teach; this mayreveal an impending crisis, for example if thebulk of teaching staff available for a particular subject isnearing retirement age.   The Government in response to an initiative by ACSTT are instituting a 10% sample survey this autumn of the qualifications and present duties of secondary school teachers,      A    number of individual authorities havealready decided to extend this in their own areas into acomplete census of their secondary teachers.139    The character and quality of the head teacher are by far the main influences in determining what a school sets out to do and the extent to which it achieves those aims,as HM Inspectorate^ recent   report on &quot;Ten Good Schools&quot;illustrated.    It is thus not surprising that the regional conferences emphasised the importance of such appointments.   Authorities will wish to&apos; considerwhether their present arrangements are securing the best possible appointments, and also whether they are doing enongby way of training to foster the qualities of leadership aI1^management that a headship requires, both amongst aspirants1in order to improve the supply of good candidates, and up011appointment and at intervals thereafter.
KfcbiKKJTED140,   In some areas . schoolrolls are already falling sharply and reductions in teachingcomplements are proving necessary.    This process is likely tocontinue   and become more widespread, even if it should become possible to allow some improvements in staffing standards.    Localeducation authorities are expected to do all they can to makeother posts available for teachers who are no longer required attheir present schools, and in suitable cases to offer themopportunities for retraining.    But there can be no guarantee thatthese efforts will always succeed in avoiding redundancies.The Government are glad to note that procedures for use in that situation have been agreed between the local authority and teachersassociations, and commended to individual authorities.Authorities will only be able to take full advantage of the availability of well qualified teachers of shortage subjects to theextent that less suitably qualified teachers already in post canbe redeployed or retired.141.     The overwhelming majority of teachers give devoted and efficient service throughout their careers.    But there remains the problem of those teachers at all levels whose performanceclearly falls below any acceptable level of efficiency, one ofthe topics on which concern was expressed at the regionalconferences.     In a period when more well-qualifiedapplicants are likely to be available than the schools canrecruit,   all those concerned need to - deal       with this problem.    Some teachers may prove early intheir careers to have made a mistaken choice of profession;    otherswith the potential for efficient service may have got off to abad start, or may never have received the help and guidance needed to establish their competence.    Others, again, after an honourableperiod of service may find it difficult to come to terms withchanging circumstances, or may have become exhausted by the demandsof the work.    In none of these respects is the teaching professionunique; much the same could be said of other professions.142.    Just as the causes for shortcomings in performance are manyand varied, so are the possible remedies.    Some teachers may decide in their own interests to seek other careers;occasionally it may be possible to arrange a transfer
to some other post within the authority&apos;s service which is&quot;better suited to the teacher&apos;s capabilities.    In other casesspecial help from within the school&apos;s own resources,supplemented by those of the authority, may be the rightanswer. So may a systematic period of further training.    Inall these matters an authority which readily offers full consultation should be able to count on the help andsympathetic understanding of the teachers1 associations,concerned as they must be not only to protect their individual members&apos; interests, but also to promote the standing of the profession and the quality of the education service.143.   Nowhere is this partnership more necessary than inthe framing of the procedures for handling the difficultresidue of cases where no effective remedy presents itself?and where the interests of the schools would best be served by dispensing with the services of the teacher concerned.Here, above all, local authorities face the difficult task of striking a proper balance between their duty to provideeffective education for the children in their area, andtheir responsibilities as a good employer for the welfare and career prospects of their staff.    The establishment of standard procedures for the assessment of teachers1 perform911for advice, and where necessary warning, to teachers whoseperformance is consistently unsatisfactory, and for all theother steps required by employment protection legislation,or judged necessary as part of a fair procedure for considerdismissal of staff, are        matters which unquestionably caxfor the most extensive consultation with the teachers&apos;associations.    Once these procedures have been satisfactorilyestablished, and when the distasteful necessity arises forthem to be invoked in a particular instance, the teachers1associations, while immediately concerned to assist any 0?      ^their members in the conduct of his or her case, could reasoexpected to take account of the broader interests of theeducation service in forming their view of the authority&apos;transaction.
144.   With the agreement of the local authority and teachers1associations, regulations are now in preparation under the superannuation Act 1972 intended to facilitate the earlyretirement of teachers aged 50 or over on redundancy, or where this would be in the interests of the education service.    Theregulations will provide that, where retirements in thesecircumstances take place, pensions will become payable assoon as those concerned leave teaching,    and employingauthorities will be empowered to enhance their accrued super-annuation benefits at their discretion within prescribed limits.145.   Other aspects of teachers1 conditions of service may need to be reviewed through the normal processes of negotiation between the local authority and teachers&apos; associations inorder to promote the more flexible and effective deployment of teachers, in the interests of the schools and their pupils.The Secretary     of State will stand ready to consider any changes identified in the course of such reviews as requiringaction on   her  part, providing they serve those aims.
XII.    SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY146.   For several years there has been increasing emphasis on the need for schools to become open to the community.Parents, industry and commerce should be aware of whatthe education system and individual schools are trying to achieve.   Likewise within schools there should be a greaterawareness of the community at large;    the needs of thenation as a whole;    the working of a modern industrialsociety;    and the role of the individual participating ina democracy.147.   The chief emphasis remains, as in the past, on opennessto those most closely associated with schools and their interests, such as parents and other relatives.   Many school5have for years been making substantial and successful effort6to involve all members of the community in their activities and to make school facilities available to them.    &quot;Communityschools&quot; in some areas offer services to the entire communityFalling school populations will provide new opportunities for wider community use of existing school buildings.   the range of possibilities is wide.   It extends from mother-an^toddler groups based on nursery and infant schools throughopen use of sports facilities in secondary schools to visiby senior citizens to school plays.   Local employers andtrade unionists may be involved in discussions of thecurriculum, the provision of work experience and othermatters of mutual interest.   Schools may offer opportunities for adult education outside normal school hours, and organ^6extensive community service by school pupils.   Communityinvolvement of this kind creates problems as well asopportunities for staff and pupils, and requires a high degree of dedication and sheer hard work.   Nevertheless 4wherever such community involvement takes place those conceare enthusiastic about its benefits.   The Education Deparhave long sought to encourage community involvement andconcept of &quot;community schools&quot;;    they promote design and building experiments intended to foster such activity.e
148.   As soon as pupils achieve a degree of independence and a capacity to make decisions of their own about theirbehaviour, they influence, for better or worse, the lives of others.   In spite of the community involvement described in the previous paragraph, which has helped many young people to understand the contribution they can make to the wider community, some schools have become associated inthe public mind with truancy and vandalism.   It is not theintention to attempt an analysis of this issue in this paper - let alone to apportion blame;   but both as part oftheir educational responsibilities to the children in theircare, and in their own interests, schools and teachersmust continue to strive for high standards in behaviour aswell as in learning.   They will need the support of parentsand local education authorities.A.   Parents149.   The group most deeply involved with the school must always be the parents.   Their role will be one of the issuesreviewed by the Taylor Committee, but some of their needsare already clear.150.   It emerged from the regional conferences that parentsare asking for much more information about what is happeningin schools.   This wish can be met by extending further theaccess that many schools now offer to parents, at timesconvenient to parents.   More comprehensive and comprehensibleschool reports would also help.   These reports, on an annualor termly basis, vary greatly in the amount of informationthey give.   Parents - and the pupils themselves - have aright to know how well the pupils are doing in different parts of their school work, to have information on their conduct, attendance, and application.   Parents for their part should have the opportunity to comment on how their children are developing and to make any observation they wish about the school.   Schools should satisfy themselves
that individual parents are aware of the progress madeby children and any difficulties they may have and should welcome response to the information which has been supplied to parents.   If leaving certificates for all pupHsare introduced (see paragraph 90), it goes without sayingthat parents should see them.151.   There is also a place in the system for parentscollectively.   Parent-teacher associations and parents&apos;associations have greatly helped many schools, throughassistance with careers education and co-operation withextra-curricular activities, as well as in such basicmatters as fund-raising.   The Taylor Committee will reportsoon on relationships between parents and individualschools.152.   Local education authorities should therefore reviewpresent arrangements in their schools, spread good practicewithin their area to all their institutions and consider further improvements on the basis of good practice elsewhei&apos;e153*   The Secretaries of State would like to see localauthorities make more information about schools availableparents.   This is particularly important in relation to the&apos; tilmove from primary to secondary schools.   In accordance wiundertakings given in Parliament, the secretar.es of state will issue to local authorities later this year a circuitdescribing the kind of information about secondary sc^o0^^gthat they consider should normally be given to parents,will include details of size, admission arrangements, the range of courses available, which public examinations are taken, pastoral care arrangements and similar matters.Representatives of local authorities, teachers and parent5have already been asked for comments on the draft of sucbcircular.
B.   Prepare on ^jfftf^gp154-.   The entire experience at school contributes topreparation for adult life and one of the great potentialgains from extended education is increased breadth,balance and independence of outlook.   It is not the purposeof schools to train children for specific jobs:   schoolsmust provide a   sound broad base which will enable an individual to acquire a variety of more specific skillsas this may well be necessary in a fast moving technologicalsociety.   But well-directed vocational experience can greatlycontribute to the development of practical and mental skillswhich provide a firm foundation for vocational competenceand thus help young people to weather more successfullythe initial period of adjustment to employment.   For manypupils this may be among the most effective means of learningand broadening their knowledge and skills.155.   Education for good health and happy personalrelationships begins in the home but throughout childhoodand adolescence will be greatly influenced by teaching and example at school.    Attitudes towards smoking, drinkand exercise, for example, will be set in these years;healthy children are unlikely to be worried by fears of future   ill health but can be led to habits which willprotect them from illness.    The school can also helpparents in making children aware of the emotional painand tragedy that can follow irresponsible or simplyunthinking sexual behaviour and in preparing them foradult human relationships.C.   Preparation for working life156. of adult life is devoted to work, and theimportance of the schools&apos; task in preparing children forthis has been stressed at various points in this paper.   Asa minimum this needs to embrace understanding of how thecountry earns its living, including the central role ofindustry and commerce in this, and the acquisition of knowledge and skills to equip pupils for their own working life and to contribute to the national well-being.   the suspicion that exists in many areas between schools and theworld of employment generally stems from, and is fed by,mutual ignorance.   The Secretaries of State believe that inmany cases commu^^i^yrl^t^QJI,(^ ^nployers, trades unions and the schools needs to be improved.
157*    There was encouraging evidence at the regionalconferences that at local level some direct contact existsand that some authorities are already pioneering new approachesBroadly these contacts exist at two levels:   first,opportunities for those from industry to visit schools and vice versa;    and second, working parties to discuss commondifficulties, for example in mathematics.158.   Local initiatives are especially important, includinglinks between individual schools and individual firms.Consideration should be given to the appointment of suitablepeople from management and trades unions as governors of schools.   Industry and commerce should be involved in thecurriculum planning and processes discussed in Section VD,national and local level, to ensure that their points of v^eWare taken into account.   Employers and trades unions can maksignificant contributions to careers advice and to improving ^understanding of productive industry by offering opportunit1for work experience and work observation, and every effort should be made to make full use of such activities and relatethem properly to school programmes.   Representatives of management and the shop floor can visit schools to talk to,and work with, pupils and their parents, and to improveunderstanding of industrial activities and objectives.can in particular help girls to widen their career horizotlSby taking advantage of the much wider range and variety  0^tojob opportunities now available to women.    Opportunitiesan  understanding of industry should be offered to pupil5of all abilities:    in many ways these opportunities are needed not only by those who may have careers in industrylater but equally by those who may work elsewhere so thatthe role of industry becomes soundly appreciated by society in general.   Employers can offer opportunities to gainexperience of working in industry to serving and potential-teachers.   They can also foster direct contacts between their own staffs and teachers in local schools, and thosein education should encourage employers to participate i11this way.n
RESTRICTED159*   Local education authorities, schools and industry should consider in the light of local circumstances whatinitiatives would best draw schools and industry together,and so help them to collaborate in matters such as careerswork, work experience, and other familiarisation schemesfor pupils and teachers.    Most parents are glad to seeschools organising activities to improve pupils&apos; unstanding of the economy and working life, including direct contacts with people from a range of occupations.   For more able pupils,liaison with universities and polytechnics can help todevelop subject interest and open possibilities for further study; this is especially relevant to engineering which,while it is not   generally taught in schools, is of greatindustrial and national importance.    Schools should make apoint of telling parents about their programme of such activities and seek the ideas and   assistance of parents inextending them. The choice of higher education course is ofconsiderable economic importance, for manufacturing industryrecruits some 80% of its graduates from amongst engineering,science and technology graduates, and there has been a shortageof school-leavers applying to take such courses, and particularlyengineering.160.    Close liaison between schools and colleges of further education is valuable, especially for pupils in their finalstatutory year in school.    Before leaving school every childshould have the opportunity to visit the local further educationcollege to see the range of opportunities it offers andwherever possible should receive information about coursesavailable.    Pupils should have the opportunity where appropriate, of taking part in linked courses.    The Governmentare encouraged by the development of co-operative efforts ofthis kind by national and regional bodies.161.    In all these initiatives the Careers Service has a majorcontribution to make.    This service is now (since 1974)provided in all areas by local education authorities, subjectto guidance from the Department of Employment and, afterJuly 1977, from the Welsh Office in Wales.    Careers officersprovide vocational   guidance and placement services for pupilsin their last years at school, on the basis of a detailedknowledge of occupations and jobs and training opportunitiesobtained through close links with employers in the area.

dealing with individual pupils, careers officers provideliaison between the schools and industry, advising employersrecruitment, training and induction problems, helping schoolsto plan and carry out their programmes of careers education)and arranging careers conventions and other occasions whic&amp;help to bring the schools and employers into direct touch.^62.    At the level of the individual pupil, careers educati011and the work of careers officers are of crucial importance.The effectiveness of the vocational guidance offered bycareers service depends very largely on the foundation whicbis laid by school programmes of careers work.   A careerseducation programme has an essential part to play in giving to all pupils a wiser appreciation of the many occupationsavailable, of the structure of modern industrialised society^&apos;and of all that is involved in the transition from schoolto work.   Although most secondary schools have designated 0or more 1 careers teachers&apos;, the time and attention allocate^to this subject as part of the curriculum vary widely.Many schools will need to adjust their priorities to makein the curriculum for careers education for all pupils fr0innot later than the age of 13, as recommended in theDepartment of Education and Science&apos;s Education Survey 18,&quot;Careers Education in Secondary Schools&apos;.   High priority should be given to the appointment of careers teachers,whose status within schools should reflect the crucial importance of their work.^63.    Many schools do not yet have specially trained careteachers.   In-service training and the recruitment of ^teachers with experience in other employment will improveposition in time, but in the shorter term local initiativeSto invite individuals from a wide range of employment in*0schools to promote understanding of working life and careetneopportunities will be especially valuable.   Long beforequestion of which job to take has to be decided there nw*jimportant decisions to be take on, for example, subjectoptions, which will effectively determine which careerremain open.   At present many young people and their Vaxe^are inadequately prepared to make such choices:   they nesystematic help and advice from teachers and eareers ox
RSSTRLCTED164.    It is not the function of either teachers or careersofficers to direct choices.   Their job is to give full andunbiased information about the education and employment opportunities which are open and to give the pupils helpin making what for many is a highly perplexing choice.165.    Many in the education service do not believe thatidealism and altruism can find expression in industry aseasily as it can in the social services.   All too often the explanation is offered that industry is noisy and dirty andthat it is understandable that pupils find it unattractive.The truth is that working with the sick, the disabled or thehomeless is not always attractive either.   But many schoolshave little or no difficulty in showing pupils how they can contribute to meeting these human needs.     Yet the veryexistence of the social services, let alone any improvementin them, is dependent on national wealth which is principallycreated by industry.   Idealism and altruism in Britain todaycan find no better practical outlet than in making a directcontribution   to improving industrial performance,particularly in manufacturing industry where Britain*sperformance has compared very unfavourably With that of our competitors in recent years.CONCLUSION166.     The studies and discussion of the past year or twohave been, in part at least, a response to anxieties aboutthe performance of our education system.   Some of thoseanxieties arose from misleading or even distorted reportsabout what is going on in the schools.   In this paper, theopportunity has been taken to put the record straight, andto impress upon the world at large that some accusations of failure are unwarranted.   There are many major gains to the credit of our schools.   Some genuine anxieties should bedirected elsewhere than at the schools;   they have been madescapegoats for other pressures and forces working in society.But some anxieties are justified and this paper makesproposals for dealing with them.
It is right that the Government should give a lead inmaking these proposals.   But because of the way education is organised a major part in carrying them out will fall to others, particularly the local education authorities and the teachers with whom continued discussions will be needed, andare planned.    In the short term remedies requiring additional resources on a large scale are not available, but the GovernmeIlthope that the case for easing existing restraints can be metas soon as conditions allow.168.   Each child&apos;s education is a unique experience.    We, thepartners in the education service, owe it to our children toprovide them with the best education our means allow.
XIII   PROPOSALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS169.   During the past ten years major changes of organisationand practice have taken place in our schools.    Primary schoolshave adopted approaches to early education reflecting a better understanding of children&apos;s growth and development; a funda-mental reorganisation of secondary schools is largely complete- more than three-quarters of secondary pupils are now incomprehensive schools.    The Secretaries of State believe thatthe process of comprehensive reorganisation must be completed;secondary education in this Green Paper is assumed to be equally available to children of the full range of ability.Teachers, the churches, and the local education authorities havetogether striven to make these changes: much has been accomplished.Now we must look for a period of stability in organisation and improvement in educational standards.   This is the common threadrunning through the proposals that follow.170     The education system in England and Wales depends oneffective co-operation and consultation between the EducationDepartments, the local education authorities and the teachers(Paragraphs 9-10).171 .    It is an essential ingredient of this partnership thatschools should be accountable for their performance: accountable to the local education authority (and those who elect it) aspart of the public system of education; accountable through theschool governors and managers to the local community that theyserve.   The Taylor Committee were required to examine the relationship between school governors and the local community as part of their study of school government.   The secretaries of State look forward to   widespread discussion of the Committee&apos;sReport, which they have just received which is to be publishedlater this year (Paragraphs 9-10).172. All proposals for the improvement of the education service must take account of constraints on the resources available (Paragraph 19).
RESTRICT^173*     Nursery education needs to be more closely coordinatedwith other provision for the under-fives, especially wherechildren suffer from disadvantaged backgrounds.   The DES andthe DHSS hope shortly to issue a joint circular on this matter.Paragraphs 27, 28).CURRICULUM174.   The design and management of the school curriculum play a central part in determining the educational standards achieved by our schools.   Much enlightened and intelligent development has taken place already, but existing practice needs to be reviewed as a preliminary to defining a new framework.175.   The Secretaries of State propose a review of curriculararrangements, to be carried out by local education authoritiesin their own areas, in consultation with their teachers, asa preliminary to consultations on the nature of any advice which   might     issue to local education authorities oncurricular matters (Paragraphs 68-69).176. They   will in the light of the reviewseek to establish a broad agreement with their partners in theeducation service on a framework for the curriculum, and on whether part of the curriculum should be protected because there should be aims common to all schools and to all pupilsofat certain stages. These aims must include the achievement 0 ^basic literacy and numeracy at the primary stage (Paragraph177.   As an element of this review the Secretaries of Statepropose that local education authorities should examine andreport on their existing practices in relation to records ofpupils1 progress (Paragraphs 69, 96-97).178.    In addition to their responsibility for the academictocurriculum, schools must prepare pupils for the transitionadult and working life.    Care must be taken to see that gi^3do not, by subject choices, limit their career opportunities&apos;Young people need to be equipped with a basic understanding the functioning of our democratic political system, of the economy and the activities, especially manufacturing industry&apos;
183. We must have coherent and soundly-based means of assess-ment for individual pupils, for schools and for the educational system as a whole.184.    The professional competence and knowledge of teachersis of prime importance in assessing individual pupils.   TheAPU, despite its orientation to assessment of the educationsystem as a whole, will yield tests of value for this purpose.The Education Departments will encourage the development ofsuch tests.    It is hoped they will become widely used byschools; greater consistency of practice can only be beneficial(Paragraph 85).which create our national wealth, and of our industrial society(Paragraphs 57-58, 62, 154T164).179-     The traditional division of labour between men and womenis rapidly breaking down.   The curriculum should reflect thisby educating boys and girls according to their needs andcapacities as individuals and not according to sexual stereotypesBoth sexes ahould learn how to cope with domestic tasks andwith parenthood (Paragraphs 8, 26, 62).180.     Our society is a multicultural, multiracial one, andthe curriculum should reflect a sympathetic understanding ofthe different cultures and races that now make up our society.We also live in a complex, interdependent world, and many ofour problems in Britain require international solutions.    Thecurriculum should therefore reflect our need to know about andunderstand other countries (Paragraph 6).181.     In Wales local education authorities should formulateclear policies for the Welsh language in their schools.    Thecurriculum review proposals in this paper should cover this aspect in Wales (Paragraph 74).182.     The Secretary of State for Wales is considering requestsfrom several bodies for specific grants to be made towards thecost of bilingual education (Paragraph 75).ASSESSMENT
RESTWC1 6D185.     Local education authorities need to he able to assess the relative performance of individual schools taking accountof examination and test results, reports by inspectors and advisers, and self-assessment by the schools.   But &apos;leaguetables&apos; based on examination or standardised test results in isolation can be seriously misleading (Paragraph 83).186.    The Assessment of Performance Unit is concentrating atpresent on the development of tests suitable for nationalmonitoring in English language, mathematics and science.   Itis intended to embark on a programme of national assessment of the school system in 1978.   The work of the Unit willnot provide a basis for assessing individual schools, whichmust depend on the detailed knowledge of the circumstances ofthese schools (Paragraphs 82-83).187.     Local experiments in the provision of leaving certificateSfor pupils will be kept under review.   The Secretaries of state will consider the possibility of commissioning a national study(Paragraph 90).188.     The Secretaries of State are considering the SchoolsCouncil&apos;s proposals for changes in the examinations normallytaken at 16+.   The Secretaries of State will discuss with the schools Council the possibility of fitting exploratory workon a &quot;grouped certificate&quot; into their current programme.   Thereis no intention of abandoning single-subject examining(Paragraphs 91, 93-94).189.     The Secretaries of State reject the idea that rigid anduniform national tests should be applied to all children at certain ages (Paragraph 95)*TRANSITION BETWEEN SCHOOLS190.   Substantial problems can occur at the point of transiti-011between primary and secondary schools and when families move from one area to another.   The difficulties can be reduced by-a.   regular contacts between the teachers concerned;
RESTRICTEDb. co-ordination of primary and secondary schoolcurricula and assessment procedures;c. good record-keeping practices(Paragraphs 40-41, 87-88, 96-97)SPECIAL NEEDS OF MINORITY GROUPS191.     A Committee of Inquiry on education policy towardsethnic minorities is under consideration.   A wide range of bodies is being  invited      to give their views on statisticalmonitoring as a basis for positive policies towards equallisingopportunities and on encouraging young people from the ethnicminority groups to enter teaching,(Paragraph 99)*192.     The Warnock Committee will give close attention to thequestion of integrating handicapped children into ordinaryschools.(Paragraph 102).193.     Extra resources need to be directed to the alleviation ofdisadvantage in such areas as the inner cities (Paragraph 103).TEACHERS194.     It is upon the supply of good teachers in adequatenumbers that the strength of the education system must rest.We cannot hope to implement successfully the proposals inthis paper without the full understanding and support of the teaching profession.   The key to the quality of the professionlies in standards of recruitment, in training and in careerdevelopment: it is upon these aspects that this section thereforeconcentrates.195.     It remains the Secretaries of State&apos;s intention tosecure further improvements in school staffing standards assoon as economic conditions allow (Paragraph 109).196.    The aim of the Secretary of State is that there should beas soon as possible an all-graduate entry into the teaching profession.   The existing Certificate courses should be phased out and the normal minimum entrance qualification to
RESTRICTEDBEd courses should he 2 A-levels.   Entrants to such coursesshould also have qualifications at a minimum of O-level gradeor CSE grade 1 in English and Mathematics or should otherwisesatisfy the institution concerned and its validating body ofnumeracy and literacy to the equivalent level (Paragraph 1W*197.     The Secretary of State considers that preference where-ever possible should be given to applicants for teachereducation courses who have had some employment outside theworld of education.   She has particularly in mind mature stude^and those who belong to the ethnic minorities.   She is consult^with ACSTT on what special measures might be necessary to eQS^ .gthese categories of potential teachers have adequate opportuneto qualify themselves for entry to teacher training courses(Paragraphs 115-117).198.     The Secretary of State considers that specific attend00should be given in initial teacher training to acquaintingteachers with the national importance of industry and commerce and to helping them in their responsibility for conveyingto their pupils.   Attention should also be given in courses lDall colleges to the importance of training to teach in a mul 1racial society.    (Paragraph 117).199* To reinforce the professional aspects of teacher educthe Secretary of State supports proposals for:a. the introduction of a policy for many more exchange5of teachers between schools and colleges;b. the growth of a network of centres of scholarshipand professional expertise within the teacher training system (Paragraph 120).200.     The Secretary of State intends to consult the localauthority and teachers&apos; associations on measures to improveinduction training, and hence the professional competence 0teachers at the early stages of their career (Paragraph 126)*201.     The Secretary of State considers that each localeducation authority should establish advisory machinery *0develop programmes of in-service education and training ^orteachers.   She will herself put forward new proposals for
RESTRICTSregional or national level courses when the Working Group onthe Management of Higher Education has reported.   In the longer term in-service training   is an area which might beconsidered appropriate for specific grants if the scope ofsuch grants were to be widened (Paragraphs 132-133, 136).202.     Local education authorities should develop moresystematic approaches to recruitment, career development,training and deployment of teachers.   After consultationwith ACSTT, the Government are instituting a 10%   samplesurvey this autumn of secondary school teachers, which willindicate how their time is divided between teaching and other duties.   The Government believe   that senior and experiencedteachers should devote as much time as possible to teaching.Regulations now in preparation under the Superannuation Act1972 are intended to facilitate the early retirement of teachers where this is in the interests of the education service.   Other aspects of teachers&apos; conditions of servicemay need to   be reviewed in order to promote the more flexible and effective deployment of teachers in the interest of the schools and their pupils (Paragraphs 138, 144-145).SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY203.     We believe that schools and industry must work closelytogether.   There are already admirable schemes - national and local - in operation, but much more needs to be done andit is clear that great scope for improvement exists, particularly for local initiatives.204.     Communications between employers, trade unions and the schools need to be improved.   Joint efforts should relate tosuch matters as improving understanding of the importance toour national life of productive industry and trade, and theprovision of work experience as part of a school course(Paragraph 156).205.     Schools and firms should establish links at locallevel.    Consideration should be given to the appointment ofmanagers and employees as governors of schools.    It is important that those engaged in industry and commerce visit schools, aswell as school pupils visiting factories and officer (Paragraph158).RFSTWCTFH
RESTRICTED206.     Industry, the trades unions and commerce should be consulted in the curriculum planning process (Paragraph 158)*207.     Local education authorities, schools and industry should consider in the light of local circumstances how best to collaborate in careers education and work experience(Paragraph 159).208.     Every school child should have the opportunity to visitors&apos;tthe local further education college, and where possible shouldbe given information before leaving school about coursesavailable there (Paragraph 160).209.     Careers education and the Careers Service have importantcontributions to make to improving arrangements for the transition from school to work.   Schools may need to adjust their priorities to make room in the curriculum for careerseducation for all pupils from not later than the age of 15(Paragraph 162).210.     More can be done to involve the community in the school3One way is to make school buildings and playing fields availfor community use.   Schools can   run courses for parents.A draft circular has recently been issued setting out theinformation that should be available to all parents aboutschools.   The Taylor Report on school government makeother proposals on involving parents in the local administra^1of schools (Paragraphs 147, 150-155).
