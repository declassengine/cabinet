Two aspects of the new prices policy which I intend to put into effectunder the Pri ce Commission Bill from 1 August require statutory consul-tations with interested parties before the necessary subordinate legislationcan be made.     They are the margin controls in the Price Code, which Ishall have power to maintain for a further year, and the safeguards from theeffects of the new investigatory powers.2. For the purposes of these consultations I propose to publish a white paper on Monday 4 July setting out my proposals.    Attached for information is a draft of the White Paper in the form in which it is being sent forprinting.    The exposition of the proposals in Part I has been agreed in correspondence with members of the Ministerial Committee on Economicand Industrial Policy.

PRICES POLICY: A CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENTTHE PRICE CODE and THE SAFEGUARD REGULATIONSPART I - SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSALSIntroduction1     The Price Commission Bill, now before Parliament, makes provisionfor the continuation of controls over gross percentage margins and net**ofit margins for one year from 1 August 1977.   The Bill removes theResent powers to apply cost-based controls to individual price^creases by manufacturing and service firms.2     The Bill accordingly requires the Government to amend the PriceCo*e which has been in force since 1 August 1976 (SI 1976 No.1170). TheRifled Code, limited to margin controls, is the subject of theCo&amp;consultative Document, which is issued further to S.2 of the Counter-nation Act 1973.5     The Government have made it clear that the continuation of the^gin controls discussed in this Consultative Document is conditionalJtoi the approval by Parliament of a White Paper on pay policy after^     Part I of the Consultative Document describes the main changes^ich the Government propose in the margin controls.Part II contains a draft of the new Price Code, with a factualCotDlBentary on the changes.Part III is of a different kind. On 15 June the Secretary of***** for Prices and Consumer Protection issued a Consultative Document011 Ms proposals for giving effect to Clause 9 of the Price Commission^,which provides that he shall make regulations establishing theVnum levels of profit which enterprises are not to be prevented^0tQ earning by the operation of the investigatory powers in the Bill.^e Secretary of State undertook to supplement the statement of his
proposals by making a draft of the Clause 9 regulations available forfurther consultation.   The draft   regulations appear as Part III ofthis Consultative Document.5      Comments on the proposals contained in this Consultative Documentshould be sent to the PPC Division of the Department of Prices and consumer Protection, 1 Victoria Street, London SW1H OET to arrive not later than   $flonday, 18 JulykA new Price Code6      The main sections consist of - the controls over the net profit margins of all enterprises; the controls over the gross percentagemargins of distributors; the continuing relief for investment; certain provisions for particular sectors; and provisions providing a sanction(both through the margin controls and through the investigatory system)against the payment of increased remuneration in excess of the paylimits applying under section 1 of the Remuneration Charges and GrantsAct 1975.Net profit margin control - minimum reference level7      The net profit margin control imposes ceilings on profit marginsdetermined by each firm&apos;s performance in a reference period. For thesmall minority of firms which made negligible profits throughout the reference period, the present Code prescribes profit margin ceilings(reference levels) equivalent to 12 % on capital or 2%% on turnover,if the reference levels calculated on past performance   would other-wise be lower than this.   For the enterprises whose low capital stockforces them to rely on the ceiling related to turnover if they areto remain viable, the Government recognise that a ceiling of 2%% is inadequate for a further year of control.   It is therefore proposedto raise the minimum reference level to 3% on turnover.   Thealternative of 12^/0 on capita^^^jSffff[^unchanged.
Modification of reference levels8      Individual enterprises may apply to the Price Commission for modification of their net profit margin reference levels if theyconsider an increase is justified. The Government propose that the criteria which guide the Price Commission in considering such applications under the present Code should be supplemented by reference to the factors specified in Clause 2(2) of the price commission Bill, to which the Price Commission are to have particular regard, so far as they consider them relevant, in operating the newinvestigatory powers.   Enterprises would be able to invoke any ofthese factors in applications for increases in reference levels. ^Trent cost accounting9     The Government would in principle be prepared to accept the useof. Current Cost Accounting for calculations under the margin controls,if these controls were still in operation at the time when an accountingstandard for CCA was published and if the enterprises&quot; concerned were also adopting CCA in their published annual accounts. The GovernmentYHi-.consult interested parties, including the Inflation AccountingC0dBering Group, about the form which any future adaptations of the for this purpose might take.10    In the meantime, it would be impracticable to make provision forth* use of CCA from 1 August whilst the contents of the accountingR**hdard are still under consideration.   The Government therefore&apos;0Pose that adjustments of depreciation charges (which permit firms*lther to base depreciation on revaluations which have alreadyspeared in their annual accounts or to raise historic costVeciation charges by a multiple of 1.4) and stock relief (which^ows 70% of any stock value increase to be disregarded in calculatingCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmargins) should be maintained.   However the drafting of the stockrelief provision is to be revised to improve the protection for firmsagainst any unforeseen damage which might result from exercising the option to claim relief.   Although the Government have been urged toraise the allowance for depreciation, they do not consider that anincrease in the 1.4 multiplication factor is necessary at present,taking account of the continuing availability of 50% investment relief on replacement as well as new investment (see paragraph 13 below).Interest11     The present Code gave enterprises a once-and-for-all option, whichhad to be exercised in the first few months after its introduction on1 August 1976, to leave interest out of account in Price Codecalculations.    The disappearance of cost controls and unforeseenchanges of circumstances may alter the balance of advantage for someenterprises.    It is therefore proposed that enterprises should havean opportunity   to reconsider their choice in the first few monthsof the new Code.Distributors12    Distributors will remain subject to the existing controls over their gross percentage margins as well as to the net profit margincontrol.   A number of changes are proposed to deal with specificdifficulties which have arisen for particular groups of distributorsfrom the operation of the gross margin controls(a) The net profit safeguard, which at present allowsdistributors whose net profit margins are below80% of reference levels to achieve this level by raising gross margins up to a maximum of 110?6 of4
CONFIDENTIALtheir level in the base period, will be improvedto allow enterprises to set gross margins nohigher than 115% of base-period margins in orderto obtain 85% of net profit margin reference levels.(b) The definition of small distributors exempt from the10% cut in gross margins will be revised in line withthe changes to be made in the   categorisation ofenterprises for the purposes of the administrativerequirements of the controls (see paragraph 22 below).Accordingly retailers with annual sales of less than 600,000 and wholesalers with annual sales of lessthan  1,200,000 will be exempt from the 10% cut; thecurrent limits are  500,000 and  1m respectively.(c) The criteria which the Price Commission should take into account when considering applications fromenterprises for increases in individual permittedgross percentage margins are to be supplemented, inthe same way as for the equivalent provision relatingto net profit margins (see paragraph 8 above), by the factors specified in Clause 2(2) of the price commission Bill.fe^Cgstment Relief13beThe Government propose that investment relief should continue toavailable at the present rate of 50% of firmly budgeted expenditure.-v, strict monitoring system to*ie Price Commission will maintain their strict mo,   .    a +r,arl is justified by actual*teure that no more relief is obtained than is 0-.  - will De available on the^vestment undertaken.    Investment relief wi-p^r. ypiief: in addition,**ne types of assets as at present qualify for relief,therelief which at present applies to the construction of new5
confidential industrial buildings, warehouses and shops will be extended to allpurchases of these types of building, but only where the building is for occupation   by the enterprise claiming relief.14     In the light of the disappearance of cost-based controls, underwhich it was possible to identify particular price increases made on investment relief grounds and thus to allow enterprises to carry overspecific amounts of any unused relief into their claims for future years, there will no longer be a facility for enterprises to continueto obtain relief on a particular year&apos;s investment expenditure after their &quot;relief year&quot; has expired.   However, there will be transitional provisions for enterprises with &quot;relief years&quot; straddling 1 August 197*7permitting unused relief to be carried over in certain circumstancesfor a further year. Details of this and other minor changes to the investment relief provisions are contained in Part II.Indirect taxes15     The Government adhere to the principle that enterprises should notbe permitted to add a profit margin to any indirect tax increasesapplied to the prices of their products.   Accordingly the opportunityof a new Price Code will be taken to increase the standard rate of duty deduction from sales of tobacco products by 2 percentage points to take account of the excise duty increases introduced following the march Budget.   The Governments intention is, wherever possible, todeal in a similar way with any future changes in excise duties onalcohol and tobacco products, by amending the standard rates of dutydeduction in the Price Code when the next opportunity for generalCode amendments arises, rather than by a special amending Order atthe time of the duty change.6
16     Experience of the standard rates of duty deduction since theywere introduced in August 1976 indicates that, having been primarilydesigned to deal with the problems of distributors, they areunnecessary and unduly generous for manufacturing firms.    In future,manufacturers will therefore be required to revert to the rulesapplied up to August 1976, whereby the exact amount of the duty changesince the Price Code was introduced should be excluded from sales.Nationalised industries17 In line with the Government&apos;s policy of treating nationalised industries in the same way as the private sector in the new pricesPolicy, and with the disappearance of the cost-based controls, thespecial rules in the present Code for nationalised industries willoe discontinued, and nationalised industries will be subject to thesame rules as the private sector.l-xemptions18     The list of exemptions from the Price Code will continue to bekept to the minimum.    However, the Government consider that, inEdition to the existing exemptions, the following prices and charges should be exempted: prices charged by Tenderers of bone andoffal and by scrap dealers (in both these cases prices are determined on a basis very similar to commodity markets, which are alreadyexempt); and fees charged by shipbrokers and harbour and port charges(most of these fees and charges are already outside control becausethey relate to international traffic, and attempts to separatedomestic from international traffic have in these cases provedartificial and unsatisfactory).
Transitional arrangements19     The new Code will, in accordance v/ith established practice,contain provisions to preserve the restrictions imposed under previousCodes.  In particular, contractors will be precluded from recoveringdeductions required by previous Codes from the prices payable undercontracts, and the productivity deduction will continue to apply tosettlements of claims (under contracts) for labour cost increases inrespect of work executed before 1 August 1976.20     it is intended that the new Price Code should come into operation on 1 August.    Price increase notifications received by the price commission before that date will, by virtue of Clause 21(3)(b) of thePrice Commission Bill, be considered under the rules of the presentCode.Pay sanction21     The new Code will contain a pay sanction which will apply throughthe margin controls on the same lines as in the present Code, and also by virtue of Clause 15(3) of the Price Commission Bill, through thenew investigatory powers in the Bill.    It is proposed that, where thePrice Commission receive notice from the Secretary of State for employment that an employer has breached the pay limits contained ina White Paper under section 1 of the Remuneration Charges and GrantsAct 1975, the Commission shall be obliged to investigate the prices or charges for the products or services which they consider relevant8
and shall recommend restrictions (including price reductions, where necessary) sufficient in their opinion to ensure the deduction ofthe cost of the settlement from the prices which would otherwise be justifiable under the criteria in Clause 2 of the Bill.   The Secretaryof State will have power to enforce the Commissions recommendations by order under Clause 7 of the Bill. A similar procedure would applyif the Secretary of State directed the Commission to undertake an examination under Clause 10 of the Bill where a settlement in excessof the pay limits affected more than one employer.    It is proposedthat the sanction should also apply to investigations of margins ofdistributors, and that all distributors who are required to furnishquarterly reports to the Price Commission - and not (as at present)only those who invoke the net profit margin safeguards - will infuture have to give information about relevant pay settlements intheir reports.Notification and Information requirements22     The Government intend, as last year, to adjust the monetarysales limits, which determine firms&apos; categorisation for the purposeof the notification and information requirements, to take accountapproximately of the effects of inflation.    The new lower limits of&quot;the categories will be as follows (existing limits in brackets):-Lower limits for categorisationSector (total value of sales on the home market of allproducts in the latest complete year of account)Category II Category III(pre-notifying (record-keeping)and/or reporting)Manufacturing           12,000,000 ( 10,000,000)  2,400,000 ( 2,000,000)Construction             9,000,000 (  7,500,000)  2,400,000 ( 2,000,000)Commercial Services  9,000,000 ( 7,500,000)     600,000 (    500,000)Professional     &quot;           900,000 (      750,000)     240,000 (    200,000)distributors            18,000,000 ( 15,000,000)     600,000 (    500,000)9
CONFIDENTIAL23     The information requirements associated with pre-notifications of price increases will be substantially revised in consequence ofthe removal of cost-based controls on individual price increases.Details of the new requirements and of the slightly revised require-ments for quarterly profit reports will be set out in Orders to bemade as soon as possible after the Price Commission Bill is enacted.Safeguards regulations under Clause 9 of the Price Commission Bill24     A Consultative Document issued by the Department of Prices and consumer Protection on 15 June set out proposals for safeguards fromthe effects of investigations or examinations under the new powers inthe Bill.    The document explained that these safeguards were set in a quite different context, and intended for a different purpose, fromthe safeguards in the existing Price Code.   An undertaking was, howevergiven to publish the draft safeguard regulations in this consultative document, so that interested parties had an opportunity to comment onthe details of the proposals.    Accordingly, Part III of this Documentcontains draft regulations to give effect to the proposals in the consultative Document of 15 June, without prejudice to the furtherconsideration.which the Government will give to comments already received on these proposals.\0
THE NEW PRICE CODE25.     This Part of the Consultative Document contains a completedraft text of the revised Price Code.    The commentary whichprecedes it indicates the changes from the current Price Code -SI 1976 No 1170 as amended by SI 1976 No 2207 - covering boththe main proposals set out in Part I and other minor adjustments.26.     As a result of the proposed deletion of the provisions inthe present Code dealing with cost-related controls on manufacturing and service firms, the Code has been substantially restructured.For ease of reference, the index to the draft Code indicates the paragraph numbers used in SI 1976 No 1170 where there arecomparable provisions in the draft Code.27.     Where a paragraph is not mentioned in the commentary, nochanges are proposed apart from either minor draftingadjustments or the changes directly consequential upon the removalof cost-related controls on manufacturing and service enterprises.Commentar:/- on the Proposalsparagraph 5:    Drafting amendments are proposed to take accountof the removal of cost-related controls and the inclusion of paysanction provisions to operate through the new investigatoryPowers as well as through the margin controls. aragraphs 4 and 3(a) and (b) (previously 4,5 and 6(a)): Draftinamendments are proposed to bring the wording of the Code,in itsCONFIDENTIALPART II
references to the exemption of export and import prices, into line with the more precise wording of the exemptions from pre-notification in Schedule 3 to SI 1976 No 1171.   No change of substance is involved.    The point at which North Sea oil entersinto margin control is clarified.Paragraph 5(f).(h), (i) and (v): Exemption is extended to theprices and charges mentioned in paragraph 18 of Part I.Paragraph 5(p) and (q):    These provisions make clear the coverageof the exemptions already given under paragraph 6(m) of thepresent Code for bus and domestic air fares which are under thejurisdiction of other bodies.Paragraph 5(w), (x) and (y):    These provisions consolidate certainexisting exemptions from the margin controls which are mentionedin paragraphs 120 and 130 of the present Code.Net profit margins (paragraphs 10 to 32)Paragraph 11: Minor drafting changes are proposed, includingclarification that profit should be expressed as a percentage ofturnover.Paragraph 12:    The proviso to the existing sub-paragraph (1)is transferred to sub-paragraph (2) and expanded to ensure thatenterprises are not required to add decreases in the value of stock to their net profit margins which in total amount to morethan the stock value increases on which they had previously claimedstock relief.    It is also made clear that stock includes workin progress.Paragraph 13: This paragraph and the corresponding provisionrelating to distributors - paragraph 39 - are amplified to make it
clear that excesses over reference levels may be eliminated byensuring that margins subsequently fall short of referencelevels by appropriate amounts.Paragraph 14: Enterprises will now be permitted to seek the PriceCommissions agreement to the use of units set up afterApril 1973 as separate profit margin units, if they fulfil the other requirements of sub-paragraph (c).Paragraph 15: The application of the definition of &quot;enterpriseas a whole&quot; to bodies other than companies is clarified.Paragraph 19:    The drafting is revised to make it clear that changes in the membership of partnerships do not have the effectof creating a new enterprise.-ssion areParagraph 22: As proposed in Part I, the Price Commi;to be required to have regard to the criteria in Clause 2(2)of the Price Commission Bill, so far as they consider themrelevant, in considering applications for modifications ofreference levels.paragraph 23:    The minumum reference level is raised to 3% onturnover, as proposed in Part I.    The basic safeguard of 10%on capital or 2% on turnover in paragraph 9^(1) of the presentCode will be relevant only to distributors when cost-relatedcontrols are removed and is therefore transferred to paragraph 38.paragraphs 27-50- Three changes of substance are proposed,^irst, paragraph 28(3) corrects an anomaly, whereby professionalservice firms which elected to leave interest out of account were
CONFIDENTIALrequired to adjust reference levels in respect of interestreceipts on clients&apos; deposits, even though such interesthad to be included in net profit and turnover by virtue ofparagraph 149(2) of the present Code (now paragraph 64(2)).Secondly, as proposed in Part I, enterprises are given anopportunity, under paragraph 29, to reconsider their choice underthe 1976 Code as regards the treatment of interest. This furtheroption must be exercised within the same timescale as was allowedunder the 1976 Code and must apply to all appropriate calculationsunder the margin controls thereafter. Thirdly, the treatment ofinterest following acquisitions and mergers is clarified inparagraph 30.Paragraph 31:    It is proposed that Regional Development grants should be left out of account in Price Code calculations.Gross Percentage Margins of distributors (paragraphs 33 to 42).Paragraph 33* The exemption limit from the 10% cut in grossmargins is raised as proposed in Part I.Paragraph 34:The safeguard level is raised as proposed in Part 1*Paragraph 35- No change of substance is proposed. The way inwhich stock relief may be applied to gross percentage margins isclarified. The existing reference to the treatment of indirecttaxes has been transferred to paragraph 52.Paragraph 37- The application of the exemption from theprohibition of repricing by retailers which relates to a low rateof stock-turn is clarified. The rate of stock-turn should be calculated in relation to particular descriptions of goods overthe entire distribution activity of the enterprise.14-CONFIDENTIAL
Paragraph 38: The calculation of the minimum 2% margin for gross percentage margin units of distributors is revised to take account of the removal from the Code of references to total costs.    The current low-profit relief for the net profit marginunits of distributors is incorporated unchanged in sub-paragraph(3).Paragraph 39- See commentary on paragraph 13.Paragraph 4-0: In line with the change proposed for the net profit margin control - see commentary on paragraph 22 - the criteriain Clause 2(2) of the Price Commission Bill are included in the considerations to which the Price Commission are to have regard,where relevant, in deciding whether to permit increases in gross percentage margins. Paragraph 116 of the present Code, whichpermitted the Commission to modify the gross margins ofenterprises or groups of enterprises, is superseded by the newinvestigatory powers and is therefore dropped.Paragraphs 41-42: No change is proposed, except in consequenceof the fact that the relevance of these paragraphs is now almostentirely confined to distributors.Investment (paragraphs 43 to 48)Paragraph 44: Investment relief is extended to the purchase of buildings as proposed in Part I - see sub-paragraph (l)(e).Sub-paragraph (1) also makes it clear that the termination of anHP or conditional sale agreement is not a disposal if it resultssimply from completion of the purchase.    Sub-paragraph (2) lays down the rules to be applied where an asset on which relief hasbeen taken by a lessee or hirer is returned to the owner andsubsequently qualifies for a second tranche of relief.CONFIDENTIAL
Paragraph 45: For enterprises which have not yet made a claim for relief under previous Codes, sub-paragraph (1) providesthat relief cannot be claimed in respect of investment expenditure earlier than 9 months before the beginning of the first year of relief.Paragraph 46: No change is proposed, other than the deletionsconsequential upon the removal of cost-related controls.    Thesedeletions include, as proposed in paragraph 14 of Part I, theremoval of the provisions allowing carry-over of unused reliefafter the end of a relief year.Paragraph 47: Transitional provisions are proposed for enterpriseswith relief years straddling 1 August, in consequence of theremoval of the provisions permitting carry-over of reliefafter the end of a relief year.    All such enterprises shouldrecalculate their unused relief as at 1 August in relation to theturnover estimated for the remainder of the relief year.    amounts of relief which would consequently produce an addition to reference levels exceeding 2 percentage points maybe carried overinto the calculation of the following year&apos;s relief.Indirect taxes (paragraphs 49 to 52)Paragraph 49: The changes proposed in paragraphs 15 and 16 ofPart I are incorporated.Particular Sectors (paragraphs 53 to 67)Paragraphs 34 and 55* These minimal accounting adjustments of the
general rules are preserved to take account of the specialcircumstances of certain nationalised industries. Other special provisions in paragraphs 120 to 127 of the present Code aredeleted because of the removal of cost-related controls and because, as proposed in Part I, the private sector rules will apply to nationalised industries.Paragraph 61: The drafting has been revised to clarify theintention behind the 1976 Code adjustment, which was to retainwithin control only those separately identifiable fees and chargpayable by the debtor to the creditor.Paragraph 62:    In consequence of the changes incorporated inparagraph 61, the existing paragraph 138(b) has been divided to distinguish the calculation applying to HP and conditional salesfrom that applying to other financial services.Paragraph 64: The provisions relating to changes in the numbersof partners are extended to services other than the professions.Paragraphs 65-67: No change of substance is proposed. It is made clear in paragraph 67 that trading activities of non-profit-making organisations as defined in paragraph 65 will not be controlled if separate accounts for these activities cannot bemade available.General (paragraphs 68 to 73)Paragraph 69: The transitional provisions are up-dated andincorporate the proposal in paragraph 19 of Part I to preserve the effects of the productivity deduction provisions of previousCodes in relation to escalation and variation-of-price clauses.17CONFIDENTIAL
l&amp; CONFIDENTIALPay Sanction (paragraphs 7^ to 82)Paragraph 77 &apos;- The introductory paragraph is revised to take account of the amended pay sanction provisions proposed in paragraph21 of Part I.Paragraphs 77-80: These are new provisions - under the powers in Clause 15(3) of the Price Commission Bill - applying the paysanction through investigations or examinations by the price commission.Paragraph 82: In the application of the pay sanction through thenew investigatory powers, the only relevant exemptions will be thoseBelating to investigations or examinations in an order under clause 22(2) of the Price Commission Bill.   Accordingly thisparagraph provides that the exemptions from the margin controlsin the Price Code should not have effect for these purposes.
