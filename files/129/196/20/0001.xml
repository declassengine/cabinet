DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 70 COPY NO       g 1 July 1977CABINETIPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  THE ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. I set out in this paper the economic background against which we must consider our public expenditure plans over the period to 1981-82.    It drawsextensively on the latest medium-term projections made in the Treasury.These projections, which were also reflected in my paper CP(77) 65, arenot a forecast but are. a tool for the development of policy options based onthe extrapolation of current trends, assuming that past relationships between economic variables remain valid in the future.    This assumption isa fragile one, particularly so far as the relationship between output andemployment is concerned, for reasons I explained in my earlier paper.    Thecourse of the economy over the next few years will, however, be cruciallyaffected by developments in the year ahead - especially the rate of inflation -and this means that the margins of uncertainty for later years are wide.The balance of risk, unhappily, is not symmetrical:  there is a greaterchance, particularly if pay increases are excessive, that we shall do worserather than better than the projections suggest.THE OUTLOOK TO THE END OF 19782. The present economic situation is in many ways far healthier than last year, but we must not allow ourselves to be deceived by the revival ofconfidence, the improvement in the balance of payments and the prospects for some growth in output and investment into thinking that the difficult period of adjustment of the economy has now been completed.    We aremaking good progress, but we have still a long way to go.    The revival ofconfidence is closely associated with the measures to reduce public expenditure and to control the money supply which we took last December,and which led to agreement with the International Monetary Fund and thearrangements for underpinning the sterling balances;  it could easily beshattered by any apparent weakening in our resolve to keep to those policies.The improvement in the balance of payments, though helped by the increasing flow of North Sea oil, owes much more than we would wish to thelow level of domestic activity.    World problems of inflation, unemployment and payments imbalances are expected to continue beyond the end of the decade and depress the level of world trade.    In these circumstances it willnot be easy to achieve sustained growth of non-oil exports.
3. But the biggest uncertainty at the moment, and the biggest threat toour hopes of higher output and employment, is inflation.    Only if the rate of inflation is reduced can we expand sufficiently to get unemployment movingdown.    This is not simply because of the needs of the balance of payments,critical though these are, but also because high rates of inflation wouldseverely damage business and consumer confidence, would tend to force an excessive depreciation of the pound, and would have to be countered by tightmonetary policies, high interest rates and a severely constrained public sector Borrowing Requirement.    Investment would be hit hard.    We wouldbe back in an atmosphere of crisis in which it would be more a question of trying to rein back demand than to expand it.    All the gains we have madesince last year would be lost.    Moreover it is doubtful whether this government would survive a further crisis of this nature.THE OUTLOOK FOR 1978-79 ONWARDS4. In looking forward to 1979 and beyond, we have had to assume that wecan avoid high inflation and that confidence is not seriously impaired.    It isnot feasible to make projections on any other basis.    But we cannot closeour eyes to the dangers.5. Two cases are examined:  one in which earnings rise by 10 per centin 1977-78 and - much more tentatively - a less optimistic one in which theyrise by 15 per cent.    It is also assumed that the increase of 15 per cent isnot sufficient to bring about a serious weakening of confidence.    this assumption must include a large element of faith, and many would regard itas unrealistic.    The projections made on the basis of these assumptionsare shown in the two tables appended.6. In the optimistic case where earnings increase by 10 per cent in1977-78 (shown in Table 1) it should be possible to sustain a growth rate ofabout 4 per cent a year on average from 1978-82, while maintaining a surplusof 2 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on the balance of payments to cover structural capital outflows (such as export credit and earningsreinvested overseas) and to start repaying the debt accumulated in the yearsof deficit in anticipation of North Sea oil.7. This would be a significantly faster rate of growth than we have beenable to sustain in the past.    The projection of a 4 per cent rate of increaseof GDP, of which about \ per cent is directly attributable to North Sea oil,may be compared with an average growth rate of Z\ per cent over the20 years to 1975 and of 2,\ per cent in the decade before the oil price rise.But to achieve this we must improve our international competitiveness andraise the level of industrial investment.    These two conditions to aconsiderable extent go together.    Both would be jeopardised if inflation isnot contained.    Both would be helped by the successful implementation of our industrial strategy.
8. The projection makes only a modest allowance for the effects of theindustrial strategy and assumes, as is conventional in medium-termassessments, that the required degree of competitiveness is secured byexchange rate depeciation.    To the extent that we do not sacure thecompetitiveness we need by improved industrial performance - that is, bybetter design, delivery, salesmanship, etc - we mujt accept that theexchange rate will have to decline.    We dare not take credit for improvedindustrial performance before there is hard evidence for it.    But on allcounts, and particularly because of the implications for inflation, it would be far better if the improved competitiveness assumed in the forecasts is brought about by greater efficiency.9. In the projection it is assumed that the Government acts to raisedemand partly by increasing public expenditure on the scale we discussed inMarch and for the rest by reducing taxation.    Since the scope for suchreflation is the residual in the projections, it has a very wide margin of error, and is particularly sensitive to changes in the projections of output,prices, and the personal savings ratio.    Subject to this, it appears possiblethat the combination of economic growth with tax reductions could allow realtake-home pay, which has fallen sharply in the past two years, to begin torise again in 1978 and to rise by 4 or 5 per cent a year from 1979 onwards.By 19S0 one could hope that it would again have moved above the peak reached in 1975.    By comparison, public expenditure in the projections would be4j per cent above 1975.    As can be seen from the last column of Table 1,taking the period 1973-82 as a whole the growth of public expenditure would show an average rise of Z\ per cent a year - twice the rate of growth in realtake-home pay.    If inflation were more rapid than in Table 1 and the public expenditure programmes were maintained the divergence would be evenwider.10.        All this adds up to an opportunity for sustained growth in output,employment and living standards of a kind that the British economy has not seen for many years, though the prospect is clouded by a continuing problemof unemployment.    But it remains an opportunity, not a certainty.    Theopportunity could be lost - as similar, though perhaps lesser, opportunitieshave been lost in the past - if inflation accelerates or if we do not use our new resources wisely.REDUCING THE TAX BURDEN11.        I recognise that arguments will be put forward for doing more of thereflation through higher public expenditure - especially expenditure with a low import and high employment content.    Some growth in public expenditure is already implied in our planning assumptions;  but to the extent that we canreflate beyond that there are in present circumstances compelling reasonsv/hy we should give priority to reductions in taxation.
12.        First, even on the optimistic assumption that earnings will rise by only 10 per cent in 1977-78 price increases are likely to remain high for aconsiderable time to come.    To the extent that we have to rely ondepreciation as the means of improving our competitiveness, they will be higher still.    So it is essential to take all possible action to reduce the rate at which prices increase.    Reductions in almost all kinds of taxation can help in this.    Reductions in income taxes increase real take-home paywithout addi..ig to industrial costs, and can help to reduce the pressure for increases in money incomes.    Reductions in taxation on industry s inputsreduce production costs, thus helping exports as well as domestic prices.Reductions in indirect taxes cut prices.    The projections in Table 1 assumereductions in taxation sufficient to make the level of prices in 1982 some5 per cent below what it would otherwise have been.13.        Secondly, until 1975-76, public expenditure had been growing,rapidly, financed not on]y by borrowing but also by an increasing burden ontaxpayers.    There is a widespread feeling that the tax burden is nowintolerably high at all points on the income scale.    At the lower end of thescale the combination of taxation and social security leads to all the anomalies of the poverty trap.    Removing these anomalies is extremelyexpensive.    The middle ranges of taxpayers, many of whom have sufferedconsiderable reductions in real income in the past two years, would not easily accept any additional burden, and the upper ranges are alreadysignificantly more heavily taxed than their equivalents in other countries.It is only by using all the elbow-room which can be made in the economy for tax reductions that any impact can be made on these problems, which bearon questions of incentive as well as equity.14.        Thirdly, tax cuts are more likely than public expenditure increases to stimulate the demand for tradeable goods and services, and so help inexpanding the manufacturing and private services sectors of the economy,to which we must mainly look for future employment growth.15.        Finallv, the scope for reflation is itself extremely uncertain.    In theeven there may be much less room for manoeuvre than the projections imply.Tax policy can be more readily adjusted than public expenditure programmes.A HIGHER INFLATION CASE16.        The vulnerability of the economy to internal pressures is illustrated by the second projection, shown in Table 2, which assumes a 15 per cent increase in earnings in 1977-78, but no runaway wage explosion.    Growth islower, averaging 3j per cent per annum over the period 1978-82.     exports and investment are lower and unemployment is above 7 per cent.    Realtake-home pay of those in work still rises fast, even though the scope forreflation is less than in the 10 per cent earnings case.    Earnings increasesremain in double figures throughout the period and the increase in prices
does not fall to single figures until 1982.    Interest rates are much higherthan in the 10 per cent earnings case, and the exchange at the end of theperiod is 7 per cent lower.17.        In practice this is an improbable scenario.    It is difficult to envisage inflation continuing at this rate without having serious effects on confidence both at home and abroad.     Table 2 should be read together withTable 1 as showing how narrow is the path towards stability, and howcritical are pay developments over the next 12 months.UNEMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY18.        Even in the optimistic case unemployment remains a formidableproblem.    If relationships between employment and output were maintained(and last year&apos;s experience casts real doubt on this), then even with GDPgrowth averaging 4 per cent from 1979-82 there would be little prospect of getting down to 3 or 4 per cent unemployment during this period.     Theprojections show employment rising substantially in manufacturing and services but this is not sufficient both to absorb the large growth in thelabour supply in the years ahead and to bring down unemployment as fast aswe would all wish.    We expect the labour force to be nearly one million higher in 1982 than in 1977.     This growth of the labour supply arises from two sources.    First, the high birth rates at the end of the 1950s and in thefirst half of the 1960s lead to many young entrants to the labour force at atiKae when much smaller numbers of those born around the time of the first world War are retiring.    Second, more women are seeking work as their children grow up, whilst reduced marriage and birth rates encourage moreyoung women to remain in the labour force.19.        The difficulties of projecting unemployment are greatly increased byuncertainties about the rate of growth of productivity.    Since 1974productivity has been growing only very slowly, and employment is morethan one million higher today than past trends would lead us to expect giventhe level of output.    We cannot tell how fast productivity growth willrecover once output starts to grow again.    We do not know how far the oilprice rise rendered some of our capital stock obsolescent, or how far lowinvestment in recent years means that the capital stock is now inadequate to employ all those who wish to work.     But over the whole range ofassumptions that appear plausible, unemployment remains a major problemuntil well into the 1980s,,    It is clear that because of the growth of the labour force full employment will be achieved more slowly than we had earlierthought.     This of course is not a problem for the United Kingdom alone;  it is common to all the Western industrialised countries.
LIMITS TO GROWTH20.       It may be asked why it is not possible to grow faster than the 4 percent projected in Table 1, and so help to reduce unemployment.    There is,first, the risk that more rapid growth might reduce the balance of paymentssurplus, even with North Sea oil, below the level required to finance our debtrepayments and our export credit and other capital flows, though there maybe some possibility of meeting these requirements with a lower surplus thanthe 2 per cent of GDP assumed for 1978-82.    Secondly, the increase in manufacturing output might run into capacity constraints as it did in 1973.In the first projection it grows at the historically fast rate of 5 per cent perannum from 1978-82.    More than this should be possible if a climate ofbuoyant expectations can be maintained and the industrial strategy yieldsresults, but this cannot be taken for granted.    Thirdly there is the problemof inflation.21,        If inflation can be brought well down into single figures, the effect on confidence and competitiveness could create the conditions which would allowfaster growth in the 1980s.    But the most optimistic projection, whichstarts from 10 per cent earnings growth in 1977-78, suggests that inflationwill remain high for a considerable time.    It would be unsafe to make plansnow on the assumption that we shall do better than this.THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE22.        For 1978-79, public expenditure projections have already been published.    Any upward revision to these would cast doubt on our ability tomaintain the course set last winter.    The outlook is so uncertain that wecannot take even our present plans for granted.    If pay increases are so large that confidence is undermined, it is impossible to forecast what willhappen, but we might even have to consider cutting demand rather thanincreasing it.23.       Looking beyond 1978-79- the important thing is not to over-commit ourselves.    Again and again in the past, successive Governments have adopted public expenditure plans based on over-optimistic hopes of growth inthe economy.     Even though the prospects for growth in the medium termappear more hopetul than for a long while past, I have referred to the majoruncertainties that could yet prove those hopes false.    Outside observersare fully aware of these uncertainties.    If they think that we are againfalling into the same trap as previous Governments, our improved reputationfor economic and financial management will be lost.    The confidence ofthose in the private sector to whom we are looking for increased investmentwill be undermined because they will expect that once again &quot;stop&quot; willquickly follow &quot;go&quot;.
CONCLUSION24.       The lesson of this assessment is that provided we successfully carry through the adjustment now under way we can look forward to a period of growth at a faster rate than we have achieved in the past.    But the crucialproblem is to curb inflation.    Only then can the economy move on to thesustainable growth path that would allow us to plan for the increases in public expenditure we would like to see.25.       For the present we must stick to the course we have set.    The cutsin public expenditure programmes agreed last year have played a vital partin restoring confidence and reducing interest rates.   The current outlook is far too hazardous to allow us to commit ourselves to additional expenditurebefore we know that such plans can be fulfilled.    As we have seen in the pastsuch commitments can only be reversed at great pain and cost.    i recommend therefore that we should confirm the levels in the White paper for 1978-79, and thereafter keep to the guidelines suggested at the start ofthis year&apos;s survey.D W treasury Chambers30 June 1977
