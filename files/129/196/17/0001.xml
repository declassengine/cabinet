confidential the GOVERNMENT&apos;S STRATEGYA NOTE BY THE NUMBER 10 POLICY UNITA.THE POLITICAL OUTLOOKGiven our recent performance in by-elections and the opinion polls,no detached observer would conclude that we had a good chance of winning an Election this year.    Of course the situation could improveSickly.    Governments do often recover several percentage points inan election campaign - and we might well do this with a long campaign to expose the unattractive face of Thatcherism.    But any rationalanalysis must begin from the point that our best chance and first objective must be to stay in office beyond present discontents.    we might not win even in 1978/9.    But at least it will be a quite different game from now;  and there is every chance that we would emerge from a later Election either as the clear winner or as thelargest Party in a minority situation (depending on what happens inScotland).*t obviously follows from this that maintaining the Liberal &quot;allianceis of prime importance (and that detaching the Scottish Nationalistsf*&quot;om committed Opposition by a Devolution Bill would also help).is even worth considering the possibilities of negotiating a renewal of the Liberal pact for a fixed longer period,  certainly the next session,  possibly through until 1979.    At present,  their conditionsElating to Devolution, Direct Elections and Industrial Democracydo not seem excessive.    Something agreed on the Tax/Reflation side^ight also be mutually acceptable (NB they actually supportWgalth tax).aHow long can the &quot;Alliance&quot; maintain a majority^ijL-11115 Commons?Labour (plus Fitt but without McGuire and Prentice) has 310seats,   and the Liberals 13 - a total of 323.    The other parties(including the Scottish Nationalists but excluding McGuire)can muster 306.    Therefore we have the prospect of a majority for the &quot;alliance&quot; unless and until we lose 8 seats.    That should enable us,  given the political w ill,  and the supj^grt of ourbackbenchers and the Liberals,  to survive for roughly two yearsvirtually to the end of this Parliament if we wish.    On post-war experience,  four or five by-elections would statisticallybe expected a year in Labour-held seats.    We could lose most
of these - because two-thirds of our seats are vulnerable   0swings up to 15% (roughly the present going rate).    But we ought not to lose them all,  since our older MPs tend to holdrtfgthe safer seats.    Thus,  assuming the Liberals lose none,should only be likely to lose the 8 by-elections,  and the&quot;alliance&quot; majority, before Parliament runs out in autumneither if we had a bad run of deaths and desertions or i*swings against us were all of Ashfield proportions.Whether,  in fact,  the Government would wish to go on to thebitter end,   and whether the Liberals would wish to go ale^with the Government, will of course mainly depend upon wheour prospects improve and demoralisation can be kept at b&amp;y*The Prospects of RecoveryElectorally,  there is no doubt that Governments can recover from the kind of unpopularity which now faces this Governs1In June 1968,  to take a valid comparison,  excluding &quot;don     ^knows&quot;,  the Tories were 24% ahead of the Labour Governmentthe Gallup poll.    (In June 1977, we were only 101% behind)&apos;   ,Despite the subsequent divisive effects of &quot;In Place oiand despite a continuation of restrictive economic poli0^5&apos; ^after we recovered to lead the Tories in the polls two yearsand came fairly close to winning the 1970 Election,  evena campaign which many believed to be misjudged in itsPresidential and low-key style.Certain aspects of the polls are more encouraging now thanthey were in June 1968.    Then the percentage of respondendissatisfied with Harold Wilson as Prime Minister exceededthose satisfied by 33% - and a substantial &quot;negative&quot; ra      ^continued for some time.    Last month,  even at what isthe nadir of our fortunes,  as many voters were satisfiethe present Prime Minister as were dissatisfied.As far as the Party is concerned,  the activists are nowcertainly not happy.    But at least we do not have (and&apos; f e&apos;&apos;make sure we do not get!) Vietnam and &quot;In Place of Stngut moral issues alienating the activists and the tradepaI-tyunionists. We do need in the coming year to give the rsomething to raise morale and get them out on the doors
This means giving something in policy terms.    We could drawhere on proposals made in Labour&apos;s Programme 1976 - forexample,  setting up a National Housing Finance Agency and aCo-operative Development Agency;  strict controls on adver-advertising;  more action on empty houses,  and abolishing charitablestatus for public schools.    We shall need in the year aheadthe right kind of inspirational rhetoric,  and Ministers maywant to use their speeches to try to raise eyes to the future.And we must,  of course,  minimise damaging Party splits onissues such as Direct Elections,  which divert attention from our fundamental battle against the Tories.However,  there is a real problem here in trying to appealsimultaneously to the general public and to Party activists.The latter&apos;s appetite is for &quot;Leftish&quot; policies and rhetoric.But among the wider electorate,  there seems to have been anattitudinal shift to the &quot;right&quot; (eg the apparently increasingconcern with  &apos;scroungers&apos;,  and the fact that those favouringlower public expenditure now outnumber those wanting it higherby about 10 to 1).    This public trend,  if it continues,threatens to favour the Tories;  and we must admit that Thatcherhas exploited this opportunity by her appeal to materialisma.nd individualism.    She will be further strengthened if weallow the Government to appear to be against individualfreedom,  against enterprise,  against the car-owner,  againstthe house-owner/mortgagee,  etc.In fact,   a basic political/electoral problem facing Labour in1977 is to find a credible electoral theniejvhich both appealsto our most active supporters and halts the apparent rightwarddrift in the middle/floating vote.Such a theme would need to be coined in punchy and memorablewords;  but it must also be credible in fact as well as inwords:  it must convey a sense of the underlying approach ofthe Government to policy issues and should consistently be reflected in the image which the Prime Minister and Cabinetproject.Our electoral strategy must also deliver actual materialbenefits to Labour voters and potential voters.    We must be
in a position to argue that the recent sacrifices wereworthwhile because people can see some rewards coming thrThere must be some fruits of this sacrifice - and of theofSea - to distribute.    We cannot hope to rewrite the lawspolitics.    Living standards have fallen dramatically; f00^prices have practically doubled since the last Election;unemployment is still high and rising.    Unless there areof an improvement,  as Mr Cosgrave&apos;s Government recentlyout the hard way,  voters are likely to punish us,  howeveri sickint&apos;strong the justification for our policies and however 1*in credibility our opponents may be.Everything, therefore, depends on the economic basis^fo^.National Recovery. Below is the economic scenario aheadwe see it.B.        THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOKIn the early months of 1977,  all the items upon which economicconfidence is based have moved strongly in the Government&apos;s f&amp;vPublic expenditure was brought under firm control for the fi1&quot;inin the 1970s;  the PSBR fell from  10.6bn in 1975/6 to C8.8bn1976/7; MLR fell by 6% in four months;  the exchange rate recoveto $1.72,  from its all-time low of $1.57 last autumn;  the rej^;more than doubled to $10bn;  the current account of the bajlanc,^^payments showed a deficit of only about  300m in the first 9.ualof 1977.fide^The inflow of funds which followed the return of market conJ-J-t tneand the improving balance of payments position,  ensured thaiUK&apos;s chronic foreign exchange shortage rapidly disappeared an^(barring a dramatic collapse of pay policy, or other disaster6&apos;  ..eg in the Middle East) the Government can now be reasonably. of avoiding further crisis packages before the next Generaj^--^This remarkable transformation from foreign exchange shortage-1 neforeign exchange abundance has been extremely sudden,  but 1Lnot be temporary.    By the early 1980s the flow of North Sea        j-(coil)&quot;1will be worth over  10bn a year to the balance of payments to about  2bn a year of scheduled debt repayments)  and there      ^consequently a good chance that the UK can,  for the first LJ-    ^the war,   look forward to many years free fx-om serious balancepayments difficulties.
It is not important,  at this stage,  for Ministers to discuss the medium-term outlook in any detail.    Economic policy for the 1980sc-annot,   and need not,  be determined now.    However,   it is crucialto appreciate the broad shape of the outlook.    Provided that.Agflation is brought under control, GDP growth of at least 3-4%a year should be possible;  there may be scope for perhaps  20bn orttore of net reflation in the next five years; the balance ofPayments will be much stronger than in the past, but perhaps notstrong enough to be compatible with full employment unlesscompetitiveness improves;  real personal disposable income couldgrow by 4-5% a year.This prospect of rapid growth and massive cuts in taxation (or^creases in public expenditure)  is sufficiently robust tosuggest that it might be very difficult to unseat a rulingGovernment in a General Election in the early 1980s.    This,  ofcourse, makes the next Election  (in 1978 or 1979) an extremely important one to win.    But,  unfortunately for this Government,the period before the next Election is likely, or. present policies,to see a continuation of slow growth and high unemployment.    Hence,the fruits of economic recovery may not become obvious to the electorate until it is too late,  and the central strategic problemIgiLthe Government is whether it is pgssj^^through, an earlyReflation in domestic demand,  to bri &amp;Jon!2* -*^ gom the early 1980s to the late 1970s.3^6^Scope for Early ReflationAlmoat all the current short-term forecasts,  including theasury&apos;s, published after the Budget,  suggest that there is good deal of room for early inflationary action. On present policies, we can expect the following developments in the next two years:a.GDP will continue to grow extremely slowly - perhaps by only 1% in 1977,  and 2% in 1978.    Exports and stockbuildingwill provide most of the expansionary impetus;  investment and consumption (both public and private) will remainrelatively depressed.As a result of the slow GDP growth, unemployment will probablycontinue to rise,  though much more slowly than in the lasttwo years.
c. The balance of payments should improve rapidly, under the impact of the sluggish growth in domestic demand and theeffects of the 1976 sterling depreciation.    The currentcould show a surplus of over  lbn in 1978.d. The rate of price inflation will slow down in the secona *of 1977,  perhaps reaching 13-14% by December.    After that,developments will depend on the next round of the pay po-1-110% settlements in the next round would imply 8% priceinflation by end-1978;  20% settlements would imply 14-15%price inflation.e. The PSBR is likely to be a little below the IMF limit of 8.7bn in 1977/8, perhaps falling to under  6bn in 1978/9-This suggests that the money supply should remain under fir&apos;control, with M^ keeping within the Bank of England&apos;s targzone of 9-13% annual growth.    Interest rates may begin toshade upwards towards the end of 1977, with further developments depending on the course of American rates, and the 1150of the gilt market,0&quot;It therefore seems that the UK&apos;s short-term economic prospects Prvide a classic case for reflation - increasing unemployment,improving balance of payments,  abating inflation,  and a contract!itsPSBR.    The economy is at present operating at least 10% below J-productive capacity,  which means that,   in the absence of otherconstraints,  it would be appropriate to take reflationary aetiaround  5bn or more in the next two years.    However,   it is mostt-i   th1unlikely that it will,   in the end,  prove possible to reflate oyiSamount.    This is because there are two factors which will Prrestrict the scope for tax cuts and/or expenditure increases,are:cbabiy1.        The Pay PolicyIf pay settlements can be held at around 10-12% in the nextround,  price inflation will reach single figures early in 1978,and should slowly decelerate thereafter.     In these circumstancethere would be no problems of market confidence in either the domestic or international money markets and it would be possito take reflationary risks in the 1978 Budget.    If,  however,were trade union pressure for pay settlements in the 15-20;&amp; r   0the outlook would be much more menacing.    The Government wouldforced to choose between two unattractive alternatives:p-ej
1.       Resistance of Pay Claims.    Having failed to persuade the tradeunion movement to accept pay settlements of 10% or less,  theGovernment could attempt to impose low settlements upon the economy.    In the public sector,  this would mean sticking tothe cash limits wherever possible,  forcing the weakerbargaining groups to accept much lower settlements thanthose which would almost inevitably be conceded to the stronger groups.    In the private sector,  the Government couldstick to a. low money supply target, hoping that this woulddeter both unions and management from reaching settlementswell in excess of the public sector norm.    But if,  forexample,  a 10% money supply target failed to prevent 20% pay settlements,  then unemployment would certainly be pushed upsubstantially (though the precise timing and extent of theincrease could not be predicted in advance).ii.      Acquiescence.    The alternative approach would be for theGovernment to accept that high pay settlements were inevitablefor one year at least,  and to adapt its policies accordingly.Cash limits would be revised upwards,  and the money supply would be allowed to rise fast enough to accommodate the goinglevel of pay settlements.    Further increases in unemploymentmight then be avoided (at least in the short-term) but therewould be no brake on the rate of inflation, and a repetition of the 1974/5 level of pay settlements could not be entirelyruled out.Either of these alternatives would be likely to seriously damage theGoVernment&apos;s election chances.    Any attempt to resist high pay claims would lead to industrial disputes,  a sense of unfairness in the^public sector,  and rising unemployment.    Furthermore,  it would notbe Possible to reflate significantly if the Governmenfs counter-elation policy hinged upon tough cash limits and monetary targets.0n the other hand,  if the Government simply accepted the higher rate of pay settlements,  price inflation would start to re-accelerate,  and the return of difficulties in the money marketsWouid also restrict the scope for reflation.    Living standardsWouid temporarily rise,  but the electoral benefits of this would soon be offset by higher price inflation and smaller tax cuts.
Pay settlements are therefore crucial, not only for the control 0*prices,  but also because they will be an important factor in determining whether or not a major demand reflation will be po^3-1  ^in 1977 and/or 1978&quot;.    This is why it would almost certainlyJoeJtS^making considerable policy concessions now in order to get thg^Jj^-possible understanding on pay,  even if the policy changes t hernshave important disadvantages.    One of the key problems which the strategy Cabinet needs to consider is whether there are avail3-0-1-6any Government policy options which could,  even at this late stagchange the whole pay atmosphere.    These would have to recogniseedthat living standards cannot fall any further,  and could be hasa. Direct action on prices, particularly public sector price5,b. An indexation agreement, with the threshold payments be(iecancelled if basic settlements exceeded the agreed normagreement which would help to police the policy,  insteadhelping to undermine it,  as in 1974/5).A Government package based on one or both of these two suggest0might give the TUC leadership something to sell to its members^1It would certainly involve risks, since there could be no watetight guarantee that eventual settlements would be within thecentrally-agreed guidelines.    But perhaps the riskiest policyis to offer nothing to the TUC, hoping that pay settlementsstay within bounds,  regardless of Government policy.g2. The IMFThe second possible constraint on Government reflationary a,c^&apos;^C&apos;   $the IMF Letter of Intent.    For 1977/8,  the Government is comm^to a PSBR of less than  8.7bn,  DCE of less than  7.7bn and Puexpenditure within the limits laid down in the last White PaPer    ,It is doubtful whether these constraints can be relaxed infuture.    The return of confidence to the foreign exchange marka. laJis still fragile,  and our newly-increased reserves containelement of extremely volatile funds.    Any immediate attempt tgdisengage from IMF discipline could cause sterling and intereproblems to reappear as quickly as they disappeared last DecHence, we should plan on the assumption that the PSBR will n   ^exceed  8.7bn in 1977/8.    This may leave the Chancellor a sma       -.the e&apos;amount of extra money to give away this summer or autumn -
amount depends on the Treasury&apos;s summer forecast - but it is possiblethat the Parliamentary amendments to the Budget have absorbed mostOf the additional fiscal reflation which will be possible in 1977.However,  in 1978/9 there should be much more scope for reflation,even within IMF ceilings.    The Letter of Intent provides for apSBR of 1978/9 of  8.6bn.    On present forecasts, this would allowover  2bn net reflation in the 1978 Budget, most of which wouldhave to come through tax cuts rather than expenditure increases.However,  it may be possible to over-ride the present terms of theLetter of Intent for 1978/9,  either by agreement with the IMF inthe substantive negotiations scheduled for later this year, or byrePaying the IMF debt at some strategic moment early next yearwhen the balance of payments is sufficiently strong.j^he^jgcope for Reflation - Summaryxhe most important constraint upon Government fiscal action in theUext twelve months is likely to be a collapse of the pay policy.*f pay settlements are running in the 15-20% range in the nextr&apos;Qund,  the Government will find it extremely difficult to reflatebJ7 more than a token amount (eg up to  2bn?).    But if wage settle-aents can be held to significantly less than 15%,  then the Government&quot;^ght be able to afford considerably more net reflation, eg afurther  lbn in the autumn of this year, \vitii^anConditional  3bnin the spring 1978 Budget.    These sums should be compatible both with our IMF commitments (which could be considerably relaxed,  oreVen eliminated,  by next spring) and the need to protect our balance of payments position.^g^Foi-m of Reflation^Jg^Cabinet needs to give as much thought to the fo^J^J^tl^ll2.tL^Ito the amount.    In particular,  the following choices areCruc.!al:a*       Tax Cuts vs.  Expenditure Increases.    In 1976/7, much of theGovernment&apos;s efforts were devoted to getting both taxes andpublic expenditure down.    But it is possible that the bestform of reflation next year,  and the form which will have the biggest political pay-off, will involve some expenditureincreases.    Present public expenditure plans allow 2% growth in 1979/80,  but this will have its impact after an Election.
In the electorally critical year oi&apos; 1970/9, public expendistuplans allow for zero growth,  and the Contingency Reserve 15already over-committed.    Thus,  the only way of making room&quot;political&quot; expenditure next year is either to cut other programmes,  or to allow total public expenditure to in-crga^above present plans. (2% expansion would yield about  &quot;ibn 0-extra expenditure).    If the resources are available, thefollowing might be given highest priority for extra expenditure:i. Measures to help on prices (eg freezes on rents, schQ0meal prices, nationalised corporation prices, especiafuel).ii. Measures to help on unemployment (eg youth unempl0^116job creation,  construction,  energy conservation/insulation).iii. Measures to improve social welfare (eg family supPor &apos;disabled mobility allowance).Direct vs Indirect TaxesCurrent Government strategy is to reduce direct taxes whileincreasing excise duties on beer,  tobacco, petrol etc to       papproximately keep pace with inflation.    This has the advof putting money in people&apos;s pockets, but the severe disabled vtage of pushing up the price level.    In the past year,indirect tax changes have increased the RPI by over 3% (aDdirect Government action has,  in total,  increased the Vxlevel by over 6%).    We need to consider whether it is advto continue pursuing this policy in a possible election yCertainly,  the polls are still showing that the price^l^H ^is still by far the most important issue (eg in the MORI P0on the Grimsby and Stechford by-elections.  75% thoughtprices was &quot;an important issue&quot;,  compared with 30% forunemployment,  22% for strikes,  and only 10% for irnniigra^
With Liberal and backbench support to survive in Parliament, labour has every prospect of winning an Election in 1973 or 1979.    But weSo need a Government strategy for the run-up to that Election whichhas as its political objectives:1.       to deliver material benefits to Labour&apos;s voters and potentialvoters;2-       to raise the morale of Party activists;3-       to neutralise Thatcher&apos;s appeal,  and to exploit her weak-nesses (the &quot;Selsdon woman&quot;?).Some of the policies necessary to achieve (1) and (2) requireboth public money and tax cuts.    In our view,  some resources can and should be made available.However,  it would be unfortunate if the discussion at Chequerswere to deteriorate into a long wrangle between spendingDepartments bidding for more resources for particular projects.Nor would it be helpful to have too much &quot;nuts and bolts&apos;Especially of Devolution, Direct Elections or industrial democracy) as opposed to the strategic considerations whichare the purpose of the exercise.    The aim should be to try toSet some agreement on priorities with an Election in mind.    Wecannot afford to do everything - and to be seen to be cynicallybuying votes could be politically counter-productive.    We mustnet lose financial control.    But as a Government we cannot afford to go into an Election having extracted nothing but blood,  sweata*d tears from our people.    Therefore, we must:  (i) select the1Tlost politically rewarding policy measures, which,  in our view,must include action on specific public sector prices;  and (ii) fitthem into a theme and strategy which makes sense from the nationalas well as the political viewpoint.V/e no not,  unfortunately, have any magic form of words to offeras an Election-winning theme.    However, we believe that theGovernment&apos;s strategy over the pre-Election period might:a.       Eg based on the general theme of National Recovery(bringing in aspects of Roy Battersley&apos;s still-germinating National Recovery Programme).CONCLUSION:   STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
b. This would have at its heart econoinic recovery, based on ou&apos;economic,  industrial regeneration,  and industrial relationpolicies,  and on the benefits of North Sea Oil.c. It might also have as a sub-theme our strong concern withhov; the fruits of Recovery are to be distributed - all0^110Labour to stress its difference from,  and superiority to,the Tories.    Eg by our commitment:to have planned investment for industrial regenerationrather than fritter away the North Sea proceeds in briefconsumer boomsto set up an Industrial Development Fund (with a strongregional slant) using a specified allocation of North Searevenuesto create jobs (especially for young people) rather thanproperty speculatorsto have energy policies in the interest of the nation, not of the multi-national corporationsto finance tackling such major problems as the deterioraof our inner citiesand,  above all,  to pursue compassionate policies so thatthe less well-off - the old, the poor,  the disabled andsick,  the unemployed,families,  etc - can share some of benefits of economic recovery and the North Sea.    (&quot;LetEveryone Share&quot;).Such a theme of National Recovery, positively pursued,  could provide a coherent framework within which we could give somebenefits to long-suffering voters,  encourage our activists, aIlC*lift the spirit of the nation.    It would give some coherencepolicy proposals,  and Ministerial speeches, which otherwiseto be depressingly ad hoc.It is also essential for the Government to appeal more to thecaring,  non-materialist side of the Party and the country-Certainly we will lose if we get our economic management wrong&apos;but the Labour Movement represents more than efficienteconomic management.    This is an area where Ministers at chequers,  and Transport House, should be able to contributeideas and themes which could be pursued in the next eighteen months.
Above all,  Ministers should leave Chequers with the conviction that, providing they stand together, providing they actPositively and politically like a Government that knows what it is doing and where it is going, then it can and will win the next Election.    The opportunity really is there.    With aPay and prices policy and politically-intelligent reflation(Perhaps requiring loosening of the IMF ceiling on public expenditure),  there should be a &quot;window&quot; in 1978-9 when(a) unemployment is steady or falling;   (b) the balance ofPayments is in surplus;  (c) the rate of inflation is steady,though at 13-15%;   (d) real take-home pay is increasing;  and(e) public memories of Government tax reductions and sensitivePublic expenditure increases are still fresh.    In theseCircumstances, public approval of the Government should increaseVery rapidly.Be23gnard DonoughueJune,   1977
APPENDIXGALLUP POLLSMinisters might be interested in the main points emerging fromanalysis of the combined results of Gallup&apos;s political surveysconducted between 31 March and 2 May 1977:i-        The Government is in bad odour with the majority of thepublic,  only 1 in 5 women now saying they approve of theGovernments record,  and a majority of trade unionistssaying they disapprove of it.2-        The gap between Tory and Labour in terms of votingintention is twice as great among women as among men.While the public is marginally better satisfied withMr Callaghan than Mrs Thatcher, Mrs Thatcher*s recordwith women is comparatively better regarded,  and mrs Thatcher is especially well regarded by Tory women.There is no difference in attitudes towards theGovernment/Leaders/voting intention between&apos; people living in marginals,  and people in the country as awhole.The skilled working class (representing 32% of thepopulation) express a voting intention for the Tories9% greater than that for Labour.    This is traditionallyLabour&apos;s strong area and, unless it can be improved,we will have difficulty in winning the next GeneralElection.Forty-one percent of trade unionists (who represent27% of the population) say it is their intention to vote Conservative;  and only 41% say it is their intention to vote Labour,  a decline of ten percentagepoints over the usual findings.Twenty-four percent of home-owners say it is theiiintention to vote Labour (and over half the populationown their own homes).More 18-20 year olds say it is their intention to voteTory rather than Labour.
