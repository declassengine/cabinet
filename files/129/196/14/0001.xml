DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 64 COPY NO21 June 1977CABINETCOUNTERING UNEMPLOYMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The Ministerial Group on Unemployment among Young People have considered the Manpower Services Commission (MSC) recommendation fora new programme of training and work experience opportunities tor young people;  proposals from the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster General for a complementary educational initiative;  and therecommendation of the MSC for unemployed adults and the future of two existing schemes - the Youth Employment Subsidy (YES) and Job R.elease.This report presents our recommendations.YOUTH PROGRAMME - THE proposals. The MSCs recommendations for young people (age 16-19) are basedon the recently published MSC Working Party Report (the Holland Report).The proposed programme, brief details of which are given in Annex B,would replace the range of ad hoc schemes for young people introduced overthe last 18 months and would particularly improve the employment prospects of the less able and least qualified.    All young people on courses under theprogramme would be paid an allowance of  18 a week in place of the presentrange of allowances above and below that figure.    There would be about13 0, 000 places with the maximum annual throughput of 234, 000 - aboutdouble the present provision.    The programme would be in full operation by1 April 1978 with the build-up of places beginning in September 1977.3. The Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster general has recommended that this programme should be complemented byan educational initiative.    She put forward two possible options -i.     As a minimum, to raise the level of support for non-advancedfurther education to provide places for an additional 10,000 students,including courses to meet the need for remedial educationidentified by the MSC.    She argued that without this help the localeducation authorities would be frustrated in making their full1
contribution for unemployed youngsters.    Arrangements would bemade to ensure that local education authorities spent the additional resources for this purpose and did not divert them to other uses.ii.    To introduce a better system of means-tested supportallowances in England and Wales analogous with present Scottishpractice, which would increase the number of young peoplecontinuing in full-time education by about 44, 000.4. The Secretary of State for Employment also recommended to theGroup that YES should be extended from its present expiry date of31 August 1977 to 31 March 1978.    Introduced last October, the schemesubsidises employers who take on a person under 20 who has beenunemployed for six months or more at a rate of  10 per week.    It has on average helped about 1, 000 people a month so far.    The Secretary of Statefor Employment argues that even if the MSC programme is approved, it will still be essential to maintain the impact of the subsidy whilst the MSCprogramme builds up to full effect.ADULT PROGRAMME - THE proposals. The MSC proposals for adults cover temporary employment opportunities. They recommend replacement for adults of the existing JobCreation Programme by -i. Employment of 8, 000 adults from the unemployment register assupervisors etc in the MSC programme for young people.ii. A Special Temporary Employment Programme (STEP)providing temporary jobs for those aged 19 and over, with projectslasting 12 months on average and providing 15, 000 places.6. These 23, 000 places compare with 22, 000 under the Job CreationProgramme.    STEP would be a temporary programme reviewed annually.7. The Secretary of State for Employment proposes some modificationto the MSC proposals to ensure that provision for the 19-24 age group is notreduced below the present level, and to concentrate on the longer-termunemployed by restricting eligibility for the over-24 group to thoseunemployed for more than 12 months.    He would also like to expand the size of the programme by 10, 000 places to provide more help for the longer-term unemployed.8. The Secretary of State for Employment also recommends extensionof the Job Release Scheme, due to run out at the end of the month, until31 March 1978.    This scheme is restricted at present to the assisted areas and provides  23 a week tax free to those within a year of pensionable2
age who retire or take themselves off the unemployment register.    TheSecretary of State for Employment suggested that as an alternative to continuing the scheme in its present form, it might be restricted to those inemployment but should no longer apply only to the Assisted Areas.DISCUSSION9. The unemployment rate among young people is twice as high as in therest of the working population and has been rising faster than the adult rate.The number of young people entering the labour market each year willcontinue to rise well into the 1980s;  in 1981 there will be 50, 000 moreschool-leavers than in 1971.    Both the Trades Union Congress and the confederation of British Industry take the view that first priority should begiven to young people and are opposed to marked increases in temporaryemployment provision for adults because they consider that any extraresources would be better spent on producing permanent jobs.    however the total number of unemployed for 12 months or more has been going upsharply, at 1 January 1977 it was 284, 000 of whom 100, 000 were in the25-49 age group with the heaviest family responsibilities.    The Group willbe considering further the problems of the long-term unemployed.    Weconsider however that it is right at this stage to go for a major expansion of opportunities for young people.10.        The MSC programme for young people would be an important move towards the objective we expressed in the social contract that &quot;everyyoungster leaving school, including the physically handicapped, should havea job or a training place or a relevant further education opportunity&quot;.    Itdoes not guarantee the offer of a place for all young people who becomeunemployed.    But the Secretary of State for Employment proposes to ask the MSC to guarantee the offer of a place under the programme before easter to summer school-leavers from the previous year who have been continuously registered as unemployed since leaving school.RECOMMENDATIONS11. The Group unanimously recommend that the MSC proposals for a programme of 130, 000 places for the 16-19 year age group should be endorsed, subject to annual review.    Apart from the Chief Secretary,Treasury, who reserves his position the Group also recommend that afurther 10, 000 places should be made available in full-time non-advancedfurther education and that the YES should be extended until 31 March 1978.12.        We do not recommend the introduction of a better system of educational maintenance allowances but agree with the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science and Paymaster General that there should be abroadly based examination of support arrangements for those continuing their education beyond school-leaving age.    The Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster General will be proposing terms ofreference for this study.3
13.        The Group recommend that the MSC proposals for replacing the JobCreation Programme for adults by provision of 8, 000 places for unemployedadults as supervisors in the work experience courses for young people andfor a new STEP, with criteria as recommended by the Secretary of State for employment, should be endorsed.    Apart from the Chief Secretary,Treasury, the Group also recommend that the STEP should be expanded by10, 000 places above the 15, 000 proposed by the MSC.    In reaching thisdecision the Group had regard to the smaller number of places available under the STEP programme as compared with Job Creation, especially inthe 19-24 age group, and the risk that the target of 8, 000 places for adultsupervisors in the work experience courses might not be met.14.        As regards the Job Release Scheme the Group noted that it had been expected that 70, 000 people might apply but the outturn was likely to bearound 20, 000.    So far nearly two-thirds have been from the unemploymentregister and po did not release jobs.    On the other hand by the end of theyear the scheme may reduce the unemployment register by about 30, 000 andits withdrawal could be seen as a weakening of regional policy.    some members of the Group favoured itu continuation in its present form;  butothers had strong re nervations.COSTS AND MANPOWER15.        If all our recommendations were accepted, and the Job Releaseextended, the additional Exchequer costs involved, on the basis of theestimates put to us, would be  17 million in 1977-78;    155. 5 million in1978-79 and  223 4 million in 1979-80.    A breakdown between the schemesis given in Annex A.    These costs would need to be met from the contingency Reserve which is already under particularly heavy pressure in1978-79.    We do not expect implementation of the MSC programmes to go ahead as fast as the estimates assumed and we have asked the Secretary ofState for Employment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to review theestimates with a view to establishing more realistic figures especially for1978-79.    The net costs, apart from YES, are between one-third and two-thirds of gross costs.    Continuation of the existing level of provision for young people would cost approximately half the  140 million par annumestimated as required for the new programme when fully operational.    Thecost of the MSC proposals for a STEP is less than the cost of the existingJob Creation Programme but if expanded by 10, 000 places it would costsomewhat more.    The MSC proposals for young people would havesignificant manpower implications (see Annex A) and the MSC have in handurgent study to reduce the estimate of 900 additional staff in the MSC Group.CONCLUSIONS16.        The Group recommend to Cabinet the measures for expandingopportunities for young people, comprising the MSC programme and, subjectto reservation of the position of the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the-4-
expansion of further education by 10, 000 places and extension of YES to31 March 1978 (paragraph 11).    We also recommend the measures for providing temporary employment for adults (paragraph 13);  apart from theChief Secretary, Treasury, the Group consider the target for the new STEPprogramme should be 25, 000 places rather than 15, 000 as proposed by theMSC.17. CabLiet will wish to consider further whether the Job Release scheme should be extended (paragraph 14).M RHome Office21 June 1977

1^    \^ L* - 4 i   I U tmt^ * * S-\lm   J ANNEX BCOMPONENTS OF THE NEW PROGRAMME AND THS COHERENCE QF, THE PROGRAMME^ ONENTS OF THE FROGRAM4EThere are two main categories of opportunities - courses designed to prepare young people for work end different kinds of work experience.1 HPRK PREPARATION   COURSES&apos;   Assessment or employment induction courses.   These would be short courses possiblylasting two weeks and modelled on the first module of the TSA&apos;s Occupations!Selection Courses.   The objective would be to improve the young personJ semployability by helping him to assess the type of work he would like to dc, andwas best suited for;    to improve his awareness of the requirements of working life,including particularly how to find and retain suitable employment; and to improvehis social skills, including his ability to communicate with others orally and in^     writing, and to present himself confidently.    - at interviews and in group discussions.i Short Industrial Courses     These courses would last 13 weeks.   The objective is tointroduce young people to, and develop skills needed for, a fairly specific (thoughbroad) occupational area as a basis for employment at operator or semi-skilled level,8-nd also to motivate young people to work and help to equip them with skills to dealwith the demands of adult working life./Remedial or preparatory courses.   These would last for a maximum of 26 weeks. . Theywould be designed for those with more severe educational handicaps., including anumber with a very low level of functional literacy or numeracy.^ HO^JXPERIENCEH^kJSxperience on Employers&apos; Premises. The provision would be for up to six months.*t would represent a development of the current Work Experience Programme but with-^creased emphasis on the provision   of life and social skills courses and theopportunity to participate in this sort of training and in further education courses,    Would become a feature of the schemes.lU) p., .  Qjject-basedWork Experience.   Work   xperience opportunities would be provided throughProjects funded specifically for the purpose and designed to give young people an-introduction to the world of work, a chance to try one or more kinds of job, toacquire some basic skills through performing tasks, and to have the opportunity .encouragement to participate in life and social skills training and further education.   As well as local authority work, it is hoped that the projects wouldQver a wide range of industry and commerce provided that they were not undartaken0r personal gain..^E^lning Workshops.   Places in training workshops would be provided for up to 12 months.ne objective of such workshops is the provision of training and work experience for* S^oup of young people working together on a number of different tasks undersupervision.   The group produce :goods or services but the main purpose is to giveMoving -people experience in a variety of skilled areas doing a variety of different kinds of work.
Community Service,   Young people could take part for up to 12 months in individual or small group schemes in institutions, such as primary schools,schools for the educational sub-normal, hospitals, youth clubs, play groups,adventure playgrounds, and in projects sponsored by a wide variety of voluntary organisations, including those providing services such as housingadvice and community relations help.   Opportunities could also be provided in connection with the provision of special services (eg road safety) or services for the cronically sick and disabled, the homeless and young children.All these schemes would include the mandatory provision of training and further education opportunties.^^PjSRBNCE OF THE NEW programme the coherence of the new programme (as compared with its predecessors) derives0m the fact that it would be planned and administered as a unified programme, both^tionally and locally.   The individual elements of the programme would therefore be^6l?ted to each other in a way that is not possible at present.The range of opportunities would be- structured so as to provideau   opportunities which provide for all ability levels (for example, incentivetraining grants for the more able, Short Industrial Courses for those with less ability, and remedial courses for those with particular hardships);b. a balance of opportunities as between boys and girls (for example, the formal work preparation courses may be more attractive to boys than to girls,whilst girls may be more attracted to the work experience opportunities andto community service projects);c. a balance between opportunities for those who might profit from   formal&quot;classroom type&quot; learning and those more likely to learn and benefit from&quot;learning by doing &quot; (eg in training workshops or project-based workexperience).Moreover, the programme as a whole is designed to provide the following ladder0Pportunities:a. assessment (eg employment induction courses);b. allowing the young person to try out a variety- of jobs (eg work experienceon employers&apos; premises);c. learning a range of basic skills (eg short industrial courses);i       3.   learning a range of more specific skills (eg in training workshops).^      Further, the different opportunities are of different duration, according to^ede they are designed to meet:a. very short (eg employment induction courses)jb. 3 months or so (eg short industrial courses)$c. 6 months or so (eg work experience on employers&apos; premises);up to 12 months (eg training workshops, community service or training awards).d.^ble 1 attached)
v____________________________.....__JThe programme is structured so that it is possible for any individual toprogress from one opportunity to another.   Thus,a.,     a young person without a job can progress through a variety of opportunities (eg from an employment induction course to a shortindustrial course or a work experience opportunity);b.     the individual young persorfs   choice of opportunity should be determinedby his needs., interests and abilities rather than by such factors asdiffering rates of remuneration,(see table 2 attached)6.     At national level, the National Management Board, MSC and Ministers would eachyear review the programme, determine its size and offer guidance to localunits onthe balance of opportunities within the programme.   Thus, what have, up to now, beenseparate programmes with separate criteria and organisation would be brought togethera-id managed as a whole.7.     At local level the programme would be planned and administered by a single localunit on which interested organisations (ie employers, trade unions, careers service,l A, MSC) are all represented.   Resources would be allocated to the local unitsaccording to variations in the level of youth unemployment.   thus a. the scale of the programme would be determined by the size of the problem in the locality (at present there are wide variations in provisionunrelated to differing unemployment levels);b. the balance of opportunities within the programme would reflect the needsof individual young people in the locality, its industrial structure andthe kinds of jobs open to young people who go through the programme.
