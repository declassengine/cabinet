DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(77) 65 COPY NO   &apos;J223 June 1977CABINETTHE MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. In both the December Statement and my recent Budget I went out ofmy way to present the measures which we were then taking as the basis ofa coherent strategy for national recovery over the medium term.    Toooften in the past the economy&apos;s long term interests have been sacrificedto short term considerations.    We have now changed the emphasis;  andwe have received some credit for that (for example, in the recentOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economic survey of the United Kingdom).    In purely political terms too I believe thatthere are dividends to be gained from our being seen to be taking a longerview of the economy.2. To the extent that short term problems have allowed, I have been examining the policy options for the medium term, when the balance ofpayments will be back in surplus and we have regained our financial independence.    I should say at once that my examination is far from complete and in some ways it would be wrong to think of it as ever beingcomplete.    Medium term policy options have to be adapted to changes inthe economic environment as they occur.    But I would hope to be able toput a paper reflecting the work on the medium term before Cabinet sometimenext month, when we shall be taking decisions on the 1977 Public expenditure survey.3. Thanks to the firm measures we have taken over the past year andto the increasing flow of North Sea oil, we can now see the prospect otresumed growth in the economy over the next five years, at a historicallyhigh rate.    This prospect will be realised, however, only if we are successful with our counter-inflationary policy and do in fact bring down therate of increase of money earnings well into single figures by 1979.    this note assumes that we are so successful, though the instruments we have for achieving this are far from perfect.    We depend in fact on Trades UnionCongress (TUC) co-operation and public support.    If these are absent,restrictive monetary and fiscal policies cannot guarantee success against inflation.    If we fail to master inflation we shall destroy the confidence at
home and abroad on which we depend for any long term improvement of our economic performance.    And in so far as we have to rely mainly onrestrictive policies in the absence of an adequate incomes agreement withthe TUC, we are likely to lose the prize of resumed economic growth which now lies within our grasp.    So incomes policy must continue to play a keyrole in our economic strategy.4. Provided that we are successful in our present counter-inflationarypolicy we should be able to start providing&apos; a controlled fiscal stimulus nextyear, and thus to resume the growth of output, employment and personalliving standards;  and this should be consistent with maintaining firmcontrol of domestic monetary conditions and a viable balance of payments.The trend of unemplovment is projected to turn downwards from about thelatter part of next year.    However, if the traditional relationships betweenoutput and employment prove still valid, the viable rate of growth does not seem likely to be fast enough, at a time when the labour force is growing athalf per cent per annum, to bring the unemployment rate down nearly asfact as we all wish.    The projections suggest that, even by 1982, after several years of rapid growth which would involve rapidly rising industrial investment, unemployment would still be at levels we used to regard asintolerable.    It is possible in view of our recent experience that theunemployment projections are too high.    But it could equally go the other way.THE PROBLEMS AND THEIR REMEDIES5. The policy questions which are raised by the medium term prospect(apart from that of inflation, which I have referred to above) are:-i. What rate of balance of payments surplus should we aim atin the early 1980s, given our debt repayment obligations and the inevitable persistence of the structural capital deficit?ii. How do we maintain the competitiveness of United kingdom goods in international (and domestic) markets?iii. How can we use the advantages of North Sea oil so as toimprove the industrial base on which we are bound to dependprimarily for our future prosperity?iv. How can we reduce unemployment which, even in the periodof sharply rising gross domestic product (GDP), is likely to remain at levels which involve hardship and economic waste?6. To none of these questions is it possible to arrive at firm answersnow.    But the general shape which policy should take is becoming clear.On the external side we shall have to think in terms of maintaining a largecurrent account surplus for several years.    We need to show that our growth
will not be interrupted by balance of payments difficulties so thatbusinessmen are satisfied that we have broken out of the stop-go cycle so often imposed in the past b/ recurrent sterling crises.    The precice size of the current account surplus we need is an important question, since a rough rule of thumb is that a reduction in the surplus equivalent to half a per cent of the GDP could allow us to reduce unemployment by about150, 000.    However, we will need to cover the deficit on structural capital account which is expected to be about 1 per cent of GDP.    And the schedulefor debt repayments in the early 1980s is equivalent on average to a further per cent or so of the GDP.    We must stick to this schedule but we shouldbe able to offset this at least to some extent by further medium termborrowing or by prepayment of some of the debt.    In these ways the required current surplus could be shaved and the level of activity raised.How far we can safely do this will depend on the success of our policiesgenerally.7. Subject to this constraint and to the rate at which our industry canincrease supplies from domestic sources, there is a good case for allowingdomestic demand to expand significantly faster.    We are not yet in a positionto begin this process, since we are still bound by our commitments to theInternational Monetary Fund, and to break these now would put at risk allthe advantages we have secured since the end of last year.    But I think it quite probable that by the early part of next year some fiscal stimulus wouldbe both sensible and possible - and, if so, I would propose to justify suchaction to the International Monetary Fund on the basis that it was consistent with the line we have jointly established.    I do not think that we can take decisions on this before at least the autumn.8. Such a programme over the medium term, provided that the stimulus continued to be achieved mainly through tax reductions, would bea valuable back up to our incomes policy, since it would enable us to showthat a sustained increase in real living standards could be achieved withoutlarge increases in money wages.    It would also greatly help businessconfidence, which as always depends on a buoyant domestic market for thebulk of its output and its profits.    The stimulus to personal consumption would in particular help the industrial strategy by increasing the market for manufactured goods.9. It will be important that any stimulus we may be able to give toconsumption neither sucks in a disproportionately large volume of imports(particularly of finished goods) nor diverts potential exports to the domestic market.    Some will argue that this outcome can only be secured bygeneralised import controls.    But, for reasons with which the Cabinet are familiar, import controls would not be the answer.    The proper way tokeep - and improve - our share of markets is by being competitive both in price and in other respects.    We must hope to improve non-pricecompetitiveness as our industrial strategy proceeds.    Price competitivenesswill depend on higher productivity and lower costs, otherwise we shall be
compelled to rely on depreciation with all the pressure that imposes on wage restraint.    We have already lost about 5 per cent of price competitivenesssince last autumn.    Depreciation will face us if our inflation remainshigher than that of our competitors.    But the timing of its incidence will be important.    If we can avoid it in the near future, it will do less damage toour present price objectives and it is more likely that real take-home paywill be stable (or even rising) at the time:  this should make depreciationmore acceptable and hence much more likely to be effective in improvingcompetitivene s s.10.        North Sea oil gives us a golden opportunity to develop our industrial base and recover some of the ground we have lost since the Warcompared with other countries, so that as supplies of North Sea oil diminish,we shall be able to balance our accounts through an increased share of world trade in industrial goods.    But we have at present no adequate machineryfor ensuring sufficient investment by the private sector.    We must of coursedevelop our existing selective instruments such as Section 8 assistance andthe National Enterprise Board, so ar- to induce industrialists to expand in areas which are in the national interest.    But, however important it may beto produce further instruments for this purpose, we shall have to recognisethat large-scale, broadly-based investment will not take place in a mixedeconomy unless businessmen can see the prospects of a good rate of return on their investment.    This means reducing the fear of sudden interruptionsto the steady expansion of demand and ensuring that the share of national income going to profits i3 not depressed by too strict a control of prices orby excessive wage increases.    A major purpose of the industrial strategy isto improve the use made of investment.    Meanwhile I shall be reportingfurther on the work in progress on various aspects of the investmentproblem.11.        The most disturbing feature of the medium-term projections, despite the prospects for rapid growth, is the unemployment outlook.    The growth of the labour force and the physical limits to the rate at which we can atpresent expand the economy mean that although we can reasonably hope tosee the peak of unemployment passed within the next year or so, there is little prospect of getting down to 3 or 4 per cent unemployment for at leastfive years,    Moet countries of the free world face similar prospects andare as baffled as we are by the apparent uncertainty of the old relationship between output and employment and by the possibility that there may benovel structural factors at work which are not susceptible to traditionaldemand management.    If in fact unemployment looks like being much higher at the peak of future cycles, we may have to develop labour marketmeasures which are not designed as short-term palliatives but as permanent features of our economic policy.    On this as on industrial investment intensive interdepartmental work will be required.
12.        There is unlikely to be any single answer, though the key, apartfrom beating inflation, is bound to be an improvement in our industrial and trading performance which will among other things require a substantial increase in industrial investment, stimulated by tax cuts as well asselective intervention.    We should probably think in terms of a range of measures, each of which may by itself have a relatively modest effect.    Oneelement in this might be further support for tradeable &quot;invisible&quot; services;they should certainly be eligible for selective support on the same terms asmanufactures.13.       As I have said, Cabinet will have a further opportunity to consider atleast one important aspect of our medium-term prospects when we take thePublic Expenditure Survey next month.D W treasury Chambers22 June 1977
