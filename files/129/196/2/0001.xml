HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 52 COPY NO       8-.17 May 1977CABINETHOUSING POLICY REVIEW - scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. The Lord Chancellor&apos;s note CP(77) 50 which is due to be discussed at cabinet on 19 May confirms the conclusion of the Ministerial Group on housing Policy (GEN 65) that I should circulate to my Cabinet colleagues forinformation Part I of the Green Paper on housing policies and finance inScotland, which we have agreed I should publish at the same time as theSecretary of State for the Environment publishes the Green Paper for england and Wales.2. A copy of my draft Part I is attached:  this, subject to minor draftingchanges and tidying up, i3 now in the form in which I propose to publish it.Chapter 4 sets cut my proposed strategy, the details of which will be filledout in Part II.3. My policy objectives run broadly in parallel with those for Englandand Wales.    On questions of mortgage finance for owner occupation my proposals are of course the same as those for the rest of Great Britain andthe references to proposed measures to adjust tax relief are subject to thesame reservations for the present.    But on other matters there areinevitably some differences in emphasis reflecting the different circum-stances north and south of the border, notablv the higher proportion of public sector housing in Scotland.In accordance with the views of colleagues on GEN 65 I have adjustedmy initial proposals to include a commitment in principle to security of tenure for public sector tenants (Chapter 4, paragraph 9).5. I have also considered how far my Green Paper can take account ofthe proposal - which my colleagues consider it appropriate to offer for england and Wales - that a minimum subsidy rate might be prescribed for individual local authorities, broadly similar to the basic rate of tax relief on mortgage interest.    However, to offer a susbidy floor to individual Scottishauthorities would run counter to the aim, which I have emphasised in discussion with them, of bringing about a fairer distribution of housing
subsidy among authorities.    I would instead be prepared to give an vnder-taking that subsidy to Scottish public tenants as a whole should never fall below a floor:   but the Secretary of State for the Environment feels that thiswould simply draw attention to the difference of approach.    While I believe the difference can be justified in terms of the contrasting circumstances andattitudes to housing north and south of the border, we can probably bestavoid any basic difficulty of presentation by omitting altogether from theScottish White Paper any mention of a subsidy floor for Scottish authorities;and the draft is presented accordingly (Chapter 4, paragraph 24).6. I shall be writing to Cabinet colleagues shortly with Part II of myGreen Paper so as to secure clearance of both Parts in time forsimultaneous publication with the Secretary of State for the Environmentspaper, as was agreed in GEN 65.B MScottish Office16 May 1977/2
CHAPTEH &apos;!INTPODUCTION1.   Housing policy ha. far-reaching effects on our personal life.   It is not simplyabout the physical facts of the supply and condition of houses nor about figures on a balance shoot.   It is at the centre of peopled lives and their style of living.Housing therefore inevitably has social significance no.less than economic andpolitical significance.2.    The living conditions of largo numbers of people in Scotland have been transformedover the past half-century.   Housing provision has improved steadily:   the overallhousing shortage is virtually a thing of the past and the worst problems of overcrowdingand bad conditions have been dealt with.   Put some serious problems remain and newProblems are emerging.   Moreover, housing has to adapt to new social patterns by providing not only for families but also for single people.   Housing policies have come to a turning point and are due for re-appraisal so that they are aligned more closely with housing needs, whether these take the form of recognised deficiencies in existing housing, or aspirations for which people are willing and able to pay.3.   Variety of problems requires a policy approach which embodies both variety andcommitment, recognising the inter-relationships between different aspects of housing*M the contributions of a range of activities, financial arrangements and orgaiusatxo oboth public and private.   The Government wish to encourage discussion of Scotland future housing policies and so ensure that they are soundly based.   But mearr^g^discussion requires good information and knowledge.   The Government hopes that this ,Green Paper will supply that need.A. Qovernnent have recognised that there is a need to review the arrun^onts tor jfinancial support given to housing to ensure that available resources are darec.eaj     t-^ --rh-:.- fiir! the government as effectively as possible to meeting housing need.    Ic tU endVitiated in the Spring of 1975 a comprehensive review of housing policies and finance in Scotland,   This Green Paper represents the main output of that review,5-   The Review has been carried out within the Scottish Development Department withthe advice of a sub-committee of the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee.   A list o&quot;embers of the sub-committee is given in appendix A-   The Review was carried out inMallei with a review covering England and Wales.   Work on the two reviews was&apos;Wly co-ordinated, particularly on those aspects of housing - such as mortgage^anee - which for reasons of taxation and practical administration have to be
1.     )d at together.     A separate Green Paper on housing policies and finance inEngland and Wales is being published at the same time as this volume and it will cover in more detail those areas of joint concern with Scotland.   This Green paper is self-sufficient, covering all relevant areas of housing policy as they affectScotland; and the strategy which it sets out has been devised to meet Scottishcircumstances.6.   The Scottish Review was carried out on the assumption that housing policy would shortly become the responsibility of a devolved Scottish Assembly and this remains the Government&apos;s intention.   The Government hope that discussion of this Green paper will provide a helpful focus for the Assembly when it assesses its new housing .responsibilities.7.   In the time which has elapsed since the review was launched, a number of officialstudies relevant to housing policy have been in progress:- A study of housing needs in the Dundee sub-region, undertaken by research team for the Scottish Development Department (&quot;Local Housing needs and Strategies - A Case Study of the Dundee Sub-Region&quot;) wan published in- A manual of guidance to local authority officials responsible for assessinglocal housing needs was issued in 1977;- in February V)7? the report was published of a sub-ccmaittee of theScottish Housing Advisory Committee, under cue chairmanship of Mr W A Gordon f;Uiron training and career structures in the housing management profession(&quot;Training for Tomorrow - An Action Plan for Scottish housing&quot;);and Wale?: has been initiated and a consultation paper was issued in May 1977?- mThe report of the Committee of Inquiry into Local Government Finance (theLayfield Report, Cinnd 6453) was published in May 1976;    the Government&apos;s rennonc.&apos;the report /was published in the form of a Green Paper (title and commandnumber) in May&quot;1O       c;Home developments have taken place during the course of the review,.   Of particular1,:1Portance is the introduction of a new system of &quot;Housing Plans&quot; to be drawn upnnually by local authorities based on comprehensive assessments of housing need in
areas.   A circular inviting local authorities to prepare Housing Plans was issued on Ji May 1977-    Discussions have also been started with local authorities on proposals to reform the system of public sector housing subsidies.,   The sectionsin this Green Paper on these subjects therefore report and assess the developments which have been taking place as well as outlining proposals for the future.the Green Paper identifies a range of policy objectives and proposes a number of specific policy iniatives to meet different demands and problems in housing as ithas developed in Scotland.    It has, however, been written against a wider public expenditure background: the priority given to housing expenditure has to be weighed against other claims for socially desirable expenditure and for the resources requiredto implement the Governments industrial strategy.   Resources for housing will have tobe limited and progress must be gradual.   The emphasis must constantly be on makingthe most effective use of what resources are available.10.   The Green Paper is in two main parts.   Part I is mainly descriptive and analyticaloutlining what has been achieved, the problems which remain and the financial frame-work within which policy decisions must be taken.    It concludes with a summary of r ;objectives for the future.    Part II discusses in detail how these objectives mightbe realised.1L   The Government intend to hold consultations on the main proposals in thisGreen Paper with all the major interested parties concerned with housing in Scotland.Ihose who wish to comment on the proposals should write w i-ua Secretary, oco   i^a development Department, 83 Princes Street, Edinburgh, by /fl October ^77J.
1.   Over the lost 50 years, the Scottish housing scene has changed out of allrecognition.     in 1917 a Royal Commission on Housing painted an evocative andgrim picture of Scottish housing conditions characterised by &quot;groups oi ligntlessand unveh.tilat.ed houses in the older burghs&quot;; &quot;occupation of one-room houses by;, 1large families&quot; and &quot;clotted masses of slums in the great cities&quot;.     Sinoo then,largely due to the sustained building efforts of local authorities, that picturehas been transformed and there have been particularly striking   developments since the Second World War with intensive programmes of new building, clnsranceand improvement.2.   The state of Scottish housing today is a tribute to past achievement.     the overall shortage of houses which has dominated housing policy in the past has beeneliminated and housing conditions are vastly improved; a higher proportion of scottish households than in the rest of Europe now hove the use of basic amenities.But housing problems remain: compared with the problems of the past they are morelocalised and varied - but they are rone the less reel for that.     They includethe persistence in some areas of the old problems of overcrowding and shortage ofbouses and a failure of types and aisseu of houses available^to match householdrequirements.   There is also a new generation of problems, particularly in someurban estates whose houses have all the internal amenities but may be drab,&quot;one-class&quot; and poorly serviced by shops, community facilities and other personal services.   This Chapter describes the present rousing stock in Scotland and out-lines changes in the different forms of tenure. Wider social problems are discussed in Chapters 6 and 8.?er of Households and Number of Dwellings3. Although the population of Scotland has increased only slowly over the past50 years, there has been a sharp increase in the number of households and theaverage household size has decreased.    (Table 2.1)confidential-   -PTER 2SCOTTISH HOUSING IN 1977 - PAST ACHIEVEMENTS AND EUTURE TASKS
3    addition, the need to replace old poor-quality stock, has led local authoritiesto undertake vigorous programmes of new building.     Between 1921 and 19/1 the totalhousing stock increased by about .75$,(by some   - million houses) though more than-c-r.il!ion were demolished in that time.     The progress made in the post 19&apos;*5 periodhas been particularly impressive:   in the 20 years between the ware, 337,000houses were built.     Since 19^5 over 970,000 new houses have been completed.Indeed, by the end of this year the one millionth post-War house in Scotland willhave been completed.     As a result, the increase in the number of dwellings inScotland between 1951 and 1971 has out-paced the increase in the number of house-,holds, (see Fig 2.2)POPULATION, HOUSEHOLDS AMD DWELLINGS					Year	Population (thousands)	Average household siiie	Households	Dwellings (thousands)	Average no of rooms per dwellingdune   1921	if,883 &apos; -                -	4.4	1,099	1,058	3.1419.31 -      ,	4,843	4.1	1,173	1,147	3.221951	5,096	3-5	1.^36		3o6April 1961	5,179		1,570	1,627	3.501971	5,229	3-1	-, c 0 c i, boo	1,809	3.0 10   ihe figures for diffin definitions.Source:   Census of Populationerent years are only broadly comparable because of changipig 2.2/CONFIDENTIAL

-      amenity, provision end condition of houses5.    The quality of Scottish housing as well as the quantity has greatly improvedover the past half-century*     Half the houses in Scotland today were built later than 19^5:   this proportion not only exceeds the figure for Britain as a wholecut is also higher than in any   other e.c. country, with the exceptions of Germanyand Holland.     However, as in Britain as a whole, almost a third of Scotland^ .nousing stock dates from before 1919 (Fig 2.3).     Scotland has a smaller proportion of inter-V/ar houses.pig 2.3OF HOUSING STOCK (SCOTLAND/GREATBRiTAIiM)DECEMBER 1 075ScotlandGreat Britain-----.- 	--^ 31 %------	19%- -   -  --..........- .	-:;^:.-;33%;4*5&quot;Percentage of housesPro 19 19 &quot;]l 919-1944[T     IPost 1945Source: Housing and Construction Statistics6.ke public sector has made a massive contribution to the creation of a moderng stock (Pip; 2.4).     iloarly three-quarters of the public rented stock (includln0   wriecj by New Town Corporations .and the Scottish&apos; Special Bousing Association&apos;as local authox-ities)&quot;was built after 1945.     In contrast, around half ofc occupied houses and over 702 of privately rented and other housing wereut before 1919,FiS 2.4/COliPIPPNTIAT,

Extensive programmes of slum clearance, now building^nd rehabilitation havecombined to raise the quality of peopled living-conditions, although   there isroom for further improvement.   A convenient indicator of progress is possessionof the basic amenities an inside WC, a hot water supply and a fixed bath.     In1951, 1*3* of Scottish households did not have use of a fixed bath;   by W thatPercentage had dropped to 12*.     And between 1*1 and 1971 the percentage of households without use of a hot water supply dropped from nearly 21% to 7*.     By1971, about 86% of Scottish households had exclusive use of all three basiclenities - a higher percentage than in England and Wales (825*).     The evidencesuggests that since 1971 the number of amenity-deficient dwellings has declinedstill further.     For&apos;example, estimates based on the annual Genera]. HouseholdSurvey suggest that the number of households in Scotland without an inside WC has declined from 5^%&quot; to around 5$.S-     The contribution of the public sector again deserves special mention.     It is because of the size of the public sector and its near complete provision of basicamenities that Scotland&apos;&quot; average amenity provision is better than the rest of thecountry..

Privately rented housing is tovided of all (Fig 2.5).
Further improvement is needed, for since 66;.&apos; of households in 1971 Hadexclusive use of all three basic amenities,it follows that there were 1^ who did not.     Some typos of household   - for example, mobile single people inbedsitters - may find it no great hardship to shore certain amenities, but theseare only a small proportion,,     In any case, there are still many houses whichthemselves are physically deficient.     Estimates, based on returns from localauthorities, suggest that there could be 160,000 houses which do not meet thestatutory tolerable standard.     A substantial proportion of those sub-tolerablehouses - at least 10$ - are, however, vacant.     The lack of a fixed bath orshower does not itself make a house officially sob-tolerable.     To meet thetolerable standard, houses must satisfy the conditions set out in Appendix/.andthe chief points arc that they must be structurally stable and substantially free from rising or penetrating damp, and must possess a suitably located WC, nr. adequhot and cold water supply and satisfactory facilities for lighting, heating,cooking and drainage.10.   The estimated total of 160,000 sub-tolerable houses embraces a wide varxety of circumstances.     Some are fit; for demolition, while others pose a complex and expensive rehabilitation task.     Others may have only minor deficiencies relatingPerhaps to the unsuitable location of a WC within the house - these may no, call for urgent or expensive treatment.     Now that the worst slums have been dealt with,those that remain are likely on average to be deficient in lower or less seriousaspects than previously, and the latest estimate is that perhaps two thirds of sub-tolerable houses arc capable of rehabilitation to *eet the required standard,^cal authorities estimate that just under 5,000 houses below the tolerablestandard were in fact improved in 197&quot;.11.   Efforts to improve the housing stock have gone further than simply tacklingWes below the tolerable standard.     Improvement grants are available to private^ners to bring houses to a satisfactory standard which includes all the basicunities (including a bath) and some 130,000 grant applications have boon approved^ the Psst 2 years.     And of the * million local houses built between the Wars,about 100,000 have been fully modernised - in recent years.   pIndeed, now that the^rst houses have boon dealt with, it is possible to broaden/on house condition^ cover not only cures for sub-standard housing but preventive measures as well.Houses can Blip below accented standards if there is neglect of their internCities or external fabric.    There are no national statistics to measure the**e at which houses become sub-tolerable, but a survey.in Dundee, for oxamp e,(reference) found that 1* of Pre-1919 Houses, while meeting the tolerable standard,Bbowed evidence of serious repair defects.
-12,     Public sector housing, although almost wholly post-1919 in origin and wellequipped with basic cir.cni.ties, has its own examples of deficient quality - deficienciewhich arc clear to the consumer if not readily measurcable by national indicators.For example, some modern housing developments have problems of severe condensationand high heating costs which many councils arc now seeking to alleviate. . Buta number of housing estates - some of them of very recent origin - show thatdeficient quality in public sector housing is less a matter of internal standardsthan of external environment.     Because in the past so much effort - understandably -went into meeting the sheer shortage of dwellings, the result too often has beendrabness and uniformity.     In our large towns and cities these features havesometimes been compounded by seze, with the result that many thousands of people-live in single estates of largely continuous housing with hardly any shops, pubs,public buildings, trees or playing fields, far from sources of employment cadill-served by public transport.     The proportion of households living in conditionsof environmental deprivation cannot be precisely quantified-     Such conditions are by no moan;-, typical of the public sector nr. a whole, which contains many examples of mature inter-War estates and imaginatively planned modern developments whichare as agreeable as any to be found in the private sector.     Moreover, much hasbeen done in recent years to improve council housing environments.     By the end of1976 nearly 160,000 Council and SSHA houses and over 3,COO private sector houses hadbeen included in approved schemes for environmental improvement involving forexample, landscaping and the provision of ploy areas.15.   Environmental deficiencies are sometimes associated with social, problems,eg vandalism, concentrations of so-called &quot;problem families&quot; - and the stagmatisationof certain areas as being of low social status which can be both cause and effectof problems.     Tho interacting   nature of housing, environmental, social andeconomic problems is summed up in the term &quot;multiple deprivation&quot;.    The present government has &quot;within the last dW-years identified the tackling of .multiple   .deprivation as one of its top priorities.Many problems of quality in public sector housing are of long standing.     Theyhave been thrown into sharper focus in recent years by the easing of the generalhousing shortage.     People are now able to be more selective about their housing sothat houses which previously were simply less desirable have become difficult to let and in some instances &quot;unlettable&quot;.     From the national figures of vacant housesit is not possible to distinguish the unlettable from the normal turnover of thohousing stock.     But the number of fit public sector houses which have been
demolished in recent years - some because they were unlettable - has run intoL/eral hundreds. . The policy implications of this problem and the alternatives to demolition are considered more fully in Chapter 8.Variety end.....utiliention of the housing stock15.   Some houses, while not inadequate in themselves, present problems because theyare unsuitable for the households who live in them.     This type of problemsometimes produces similar systems to inadequate housing, eg difficulty in letting,but the range of possible policy responses is wider because some attempt&quot; can be    .ru&amp;de to-.improve the matching of households&apos; needs to what is available.  .16.   Scottish households no   enjoy much improved standards of living space comparedWith Previous generations.   The properties of household^liviB^.^above L5 PersonsPer room has dropped iron, 61% in 1921 and 55% in 1951,/and acute overcrowding is nowrare.     Proportionally, however, overcrowding is still more of a problem inScotland than in England and Wales (5% at more than 1.5 Persons jar room).     Abetter measure is the &quot;bedroom standard&quot; devised   by   the Social Survey Divisionor the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys.     This standard calculates eacnhouseholds requirement as a number of bedrooms calculated according to the age,and marital status of the members of the household. These requirements are thencompared vita the actual number of bedrooms available.     Evidence from the 1975General Household Survey indicates that just over 8% of Scottish households (about^5,000) had too few bedrooms by this standard compared with just over &apos;*% inEngland end Wales.     The proportions with more rooms than this basic.standardwere    % and    % respectively.1?.   A larso proportion of the households living in cramped conditions are to befound in the rub]ic sector.     Moreover, as Fig 2.6 shows, overcrowding in terms of^ bedroom standard is greater in each sector of housing in Scotland than in GreatBriatin as a whole.Fi8 2.6/

1*.     One reason for overcrowding is the size range of Scottish houses.     Only.-, of houses have more than 5 rooms while       have 3 or fewer.   The corresponding figures for England and Wales are        end 12*.     An examination of 1971 censusdate suggests that most of the overcorwding in the public rector consists of 6or more people living in 5 or h roomed houses.     these figures indicate a currentneed for some large houses, though with the falling birthrate this need shoulddiminish   substantially.19-     Overcrowding has to be seen in perspective.     In .all forms of tenure the proportions of households who are overcrowded are much lower than the proportionswho have more rooms than the bedroom standard.     The number of households in thelatter group seems likely to grow because of the steadily increasing proportion ofemail households.     The commonest conception of &quot;households&quot; is in terms oifamilies - parents with children - but in 1971 nearly yjS fche households in Scotlandconsisted of only one or two people, and this proportion is expected to rase,The reasons are many - for example, the lower birthrate, the tendency for youngadults to ret up independent households, the incidence of marriage breakup.     but even mere significant is the growing proportion of elderly people in the populationen-5 the tendency for them to live separately from their grown-up families.Although over &apos;iO;i of Scottish houses have 3 rooms or fewer, the percentage of or 2 roomed houses in good condition is relatively email - the public sector hasa high proportion of 3 roomed hour.es, and a lot of 1 or ? roomed houses are in   ^the private rented sector and are sub-standard.She tvr* of housing which re^Py&apos;- n.....ire is partly a matter of family----irute^tt^o aad parmty one of porec:::,, preference. for exalte, few people would 1regard a house up severs! stairs as iieal for a family with young children or /or*o ,pw.-i. . -,. i. jn . an--pi. rar.es h-a * iyri my be 1       s  .....-location.

Source: General Household Survey 197521.    The contrasts are more marked in the public sector.     Over hair of Scotland public rented dwellings are flats, compared with a third in Great Britain, and evenbigger proportions are found in large urban areas.     There are, of course, many different types of flat, including multi-storey, deck-access blocks, Victoriantenements and their modern walk-up equivalents.     Many authorities have foundincreasing difficulty in recent years in letting high-rise flats especially tofamilies with young children.     The proportion of terraced houses is similar tothat in Great Britain, but the Scottish proportion of semi-detached houses is much. smaller.     In recent years, however, new building in Scotland has included a lowerProportion of flats then before and a correspondingly higher proportion of houses(80g of all public sector approvals since 1973)--There is evidence from the preceding analysis that there are still needs tome*- in Scottish housing, despite the overall national surplus of dwellings.

In addition, population trends vary widely, with differing rates of growth or decline affecting the overall demand, for housing in each area..   it follows that the planning of housing provision cannot rely on national analyses;it calls for careful local assessments of local needs.Forms of housing tenure27.     &quot;housing tenure&quot; - which is fundamentally the package of conditions on thebasis of which people obtain access to and occupy their homes - is no less importantthen physical housing circumstances.     Sixty years ago the groat majority of households rented from private landlords and they had few rights over their homes.This situation has boon transformed: over half of Scotland^ households are tenants of a publicly   accountable authority, 1 in 2 are     owner occupiers; and theremaining private tenants (1 in 10) have greatly increased rights.     These arcsubstantial achievements by the standards of the past, but restrictions remain on public sector tenants in particular which affect their expectation of free and secure enjoyment of their homos and of choice about where and how they live.28.    Between 1966 and 1973 the proportion of dwellings in both the public rentedar,d the owner-occupied sectors rose both in Scotland and in Groat Britain as a wholebut there was a particularly striking expansion of the public rented sectorfigure 2.8).     More than 970,000 dwellings have been built since 19^5 and of thesefor cent wore oui.it by the public sector - in England the comparable figure was- ;r ecnU     As ;,kc .-. of this intense activity, p&apos;- per cent of allit from 1 - - &apos; &apos;- -: s (local authorities, ScottishOPGCXal i!0&apos;Uiinf: delation and New Town Development Corporations.)2.8/

In 1975, owner.occupied housing accounts for 33 per cent of households inScotland compared with 53 per cent in Great Britain as a whole.

There are several possible reasons for the historically low level of owner-occupation in Scotland.     A major factor has been the development of different andeep-seated attitudes towards housing provision and ownership.     A lower propoi.of households in ell income groups are owner-occupiers in Scotland than in GrcoBritain as a whole.     A comparison in terms of socio-economic groups would produce a broadly similar picture.     In Scotland, more than half of all households with a combined household income of more then  6,000 in 1975 lived in rented accommodation.One important materiel factor has been the high level of public sector activityWhich 1ms resulted in the availability in the public sector of modern houses atcomparatively low costs to the occupier.     Other factors have made some people
unable to buy even if they wanted to: for many years, average household inin Scotland were low, reflecting unemployment above the British average anrelatively low incomes.     In addition, house prices have been and remainrelatively high, partly reflecting the higher cost of building houses inScotland compared with many parts of Britain.Fig 2.10/CONFIDENTIAL17

31.     There is evidence, however, that traditional attitudes are changing arc&apos; thatthere-is a notable and sustained increase in the demand for owner-occupation mScotland, especially by recently forced household.-:.   This has been reflected in a generally rising trend of private house building over the post-war period, ana in1976 for the first tine in that period more rev: houses were started in the private sector then in the public sector.     As a result of this trend the gap between theproportion of owner-occupied dwellings in Scotland compared with tho rest 01Great Britain may soon begin to diminish.     There is a clear upward trend in theScottish percentage share of private house completions in Britain over the past ten years (Figure ?.11).Fig 2.11.PRIVATE HOUSE COMPLETIONS If-!

sector which has gone on. steadily over the pnsfc f.0 years.     The downward trend is unlikely to bo reversed although it may now be levelling out.     Today probably lessthan 10 per cent of households live in privately rented accommodation.     Estimatessuggest that at present there are about 23,000 occupied rented furnished dwellingsand just under 100,000 occupied ranted unfurnished dwellings.     In addition thereare probably some 70,000 &quot;tied&quot; houses, rented by virtue of employment or with afarm or business premises, and houses rented from housing associations which have some features of the privately rented sector and some of the public sector I.seeAppendix c).33.     The immediate causes of the drop in the number of privately rented housesinclude the demolition of old property - for development or slum clearance - thenegligible amount of new building for private renting, and the sale of houses for owner-occupation.     The underlying reasons for the decline are numerous.     It begin the late 19th Century when building and public health regulations requiredlandlords to meet minimum standards whose costs the poorest tenants could not afford.     Real restrictions first introduced in the First World War signalled the start of a steadier decline.     Since then, new local authority houses at comparativlynodest rents have been a strong counter-attraction.     Over the years the introductionof further safeguards for tenants in the shape of security of tenure and rentcontrols have further limited the private landlord*y ability to maximise the profit0* the property which he owns.     Consequently there has been some incentive to-     &quot;ea,.. to sell off their property when It becomes vacant and to limit t.Th. total r,su,cha.s been a decline in the quality afc well as in h,e quantityManv of these houses were in bod condition and of poor quality.

Surveys conducted inD*mdee for the Dundee Housing Heeds Study found that in the areas surveyed two-thirds of the pre-1919 Private rented housing fell below the tolerable standaro.35.

On the one hand there are those for whom renting from a private landlord has been and will continueto be their permanent scarce of housing.     This group consists almost entirely of middle-aged or elderly households living in unfurnished accommodation.The second group consists of various categories of people who make only short-termuse of the sector and who usually rent furnished accommodation.     They include mol-lcworkers and their families, the newly married,  those suffering from family break-up,students not accommodated by educational institutions and other young people who wish or need to live away from home.

jVturg Trends3^last year there was a notable reduction in the level of proposals for new housebuilding put forward by local authorities (which have traditionally accounted to the major part of public sector building).     They sought approval to build fewer than 5.0C0 houses in 1976 in contrast to figures of over 20,000 which werecustomary until 5 years ago.     On the other hand private building has increasedand1976 was a record year for private sector completions.     This gives an uncer a background for a review of future policies and finance, and a study was carried out as part of the Review to establish what levels of new building effort might meetlonger-term needs for new housing.     The aim was not to arrive at a nationalWilding forecast or target;   housing programmes can only be formulated sensitivelyas a result of local assessments ox need.    The object was simply to obtain a picture of the relative significance of new building in future housing strategy, anthe poriod 1976 to 1936.4o.   Future house building need is very sensitive to a number of different assump-Uons:   the range of possibilities is wide.     Bat the study shewed that on any   &quot;reasonable combination of these assumptions, the need for new building in the public sector is likely to bo substantially below the numbers provided in recent years.M.   The study concentrated on producing a range of assumptions for each of the mainfcctora influencing house building need and examining what their combined effect&quot;iGht bo.    It also examined-the implications for the housing system of providing*ny particular level of new house building programme.VI.   It was assumed that Scotland&apos;s total population would bo static, so that any increase in the number of households would come from a further redaction in the^erage household size.   - (in fact the 1975-based projections ox home populationSpared by the General Register Office (Scotland), published in January 1977, ohow* slight redaction in population over the period 1976-1986, from 9199 thousand to5182 thousand.)    Another constant assumption was that the vacancy rate for private**tor housing would bo the same in 1936 as in 1976,    This meant that the need xorpublic sector housing was assumed to arise from the combined effect of fourActors:(a)   cmy further reduction in average household size?   a reduction of 0.1 would produce 6.5,000 additional households over 10 years,CONFIDENTIAL22
(b) any change in the public sector vacancy rate; a Vf0 rice in vacancies wouldmean about 10,000 additional vacant houses.(c) the number of houses expected to be demolished between 1976 and i960; thiswould affect the total number of new houses required.(d) the number of houses expected to be built in the private sector (includingbuilding by housing associations); the remaining need would have to bo met by nowpublic sector building. &apos; .An attempt war made to assess for each of these factors in turn the implications of continuing past trends and also departures from those trends which might result fromchanges in housing circumstances or of policy,   The various values for each factor coulhe combined in a large number of different ways.   Table 2,12 illustrates three possibleoptions for total building need:A. projection of recent trends for each factor,B. incorporating possible future trends - a lower estimate ie combining thosevalues which imply a relatively low need for new housebuildingC. incorporating possible future trends - an upper estimate, ie combining thosevalues which imply a relatively high need for now housebuilding.The way in Vftich these needs might be met by private and public sector buiidmgrespectively ie shewn as a further range of possibilities within cases .8 and C.1&apos;ABLE  2.13POSSIBLE HEW HOUSEBUILDING REQUIREMENTS 1976-86(i)   Average household siso\2)   Public sector vacancy rate-1286Ij)   Increase in housing stockimplied by (l) and (2).U)   Demolitions\j)   Gross increase in housesrequired ((3) * (4))Private sector buildingVincluding housing associations)u)   liocd for additional publicrented houses ((5) - (6))A	B	C	Al1owin	5 for now&quot;Current trends	trends and policies	continuing&quot;	Lo&apos;. rn r	I Inner	/ Estimate	Estimate2.67 %	2.72 Thousands	2 = 62110 100	80 80	145 120210	160	263130	100-130	100-16080	30- 60	105-165CONFIDKr-JTIA L

t0&quot;    It must be emphasised that the purpose of this national assessment of futuree* 8 i52 simply to illustrate the interactions between the si so cf housing programmesa resul* of sensitive assessments of local housing needs.   Such local assessments.- sod on none detailed knowledge of variations in need - in particular, shortages of.    -in types of housing and the needs of special groups, might add up to somewhatAfferent figures than the estimates produced here.   Moreover, all the estimatesSQ3Re that Scotland&apos;s population will bo static between 1976 and 1935.   This depones^   w na*oer of separate assumptions (for example, about future levels cf migration and*n the birth rate) which themselves could change.   Therefore, assessments need&apos;e regularly updated.   This exercise does- however, confirm that the shift of18 ln r--:-nt years from new building to expenditure en the existing housing slock-iionstrated by local authorities&apos; programmes - is a sensible one for Scotland as a&quot;     which in future years should be reinforced.A-:-s Chapter has painted a picture of paet achievements, particularly in theq     3Xon oi&quot;&apos; new public sector housing, the reduction of overcrowding and improvement- aadaa^ai   p-t it has also highlighted important problems which remain, includingcontinue.;.&quot;    o/orcrowding in seme areas, houses below the tolerable standard, a serious&quot;^snatch r*r n*    L &quot;ho sizes cf houses to household sise and a need to provide more war- -on ior the --,^wir&apos;&quot; clde-**&apos;&apos;v *vu w] &quot;tie&quot;.   nn-n ch^mth^r trr-p^d Ln^^Tsi&apos;&apos;^ *5 i*^t ^. &apos; -   *ons about standards of housing and en increasing demand for owner-occupation,*:-:.oa.; nswiv-formed households.

CHAPTER 3FINANCIAL TRENDS1.     Capital expenditure on housing in Scotland - ie expenditure on the creationand improvement of the housing stock - reached a peak in the mid-1960s.     During^he first half of this decade there has been a slight overall decline, although inrecent years the volume of capital expenditure has recovered slightly from thelow level of 1972-73-     Despite this slow-down in capital investment, total public expenditure on housing in 1975-76 was 10$ higher in real terms than in 1970-/1.This is because there has been a dramatic increase in the total value of housing subsidies - including Government subsidies to local housing authorities, optionmortgage subsidy and local authority rate fund contributions.     The total valueof these subsidies increased by 53$ between 1970-71 and 1973-76.     These trendsare demonstrated in Table 3.1 *-Table 3.1LIC EXPENDITURE ON HOUSING- IN SCOTLAND(&amp;u at 1975 prices)	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76Capital expenditure	354	300	272	299	322	329Tolal subsidies^&apos;	144	136	159	190	?12	219To,-al public expenditure (including Ministration)	499	436	433	500	536	550Government subsidies to public housing authorities, rent rebates andent allowances,  option mortgage subsidy and local authority rate fundcontributions.    /To be converted to 1976 prices^0* Pub        haVe been markCd increasos over the same period not only in expendituretax .   &quot;&apos;C Subsidies but also in expenditure on option mortgage subsidy and total&apos;0,n0 lorco&apos;one through tax relief on mortgage interest payments.

Why have subsidies increased so much over a period when new investment has declined?     To find the answers, it is useful to look more closely at the way in which housing is financed and subsidised in the two main sectors of housing -local authority housing and owner occupation.     The main features of financefox- each sector, including the Scottish Special Housing Association, Now town development Corporations, housing associations and the privately rented sectorarc summarised in Appendix C.LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSING-4.     A local authority finances th? building of new houses and the improvement and modernisation of existing houses by borrowing from its loans fund, which covers all its housing and non-housing borrowing.     Debt is repaid to the loans fund over a long period which broadly corresponds to the expected life of the investment - usually 60 years for new building and around 20 years for improvement.     Annual debt repayments and interest, charges are charged to theauthority&apos;s statutory Housing Revenue Account, the rate of interest being theaverage for all the loans in the authority&apos;s pool.     The existence of the loansi&apos;,0ol tends to insulate housing interest charges to some extent from the sharpfluctuations of interest   rates in the open market (Pig 3-3).

6.     The authority is required to derive income from these three sources to balanceits Housing Revenue Account each year.     It is not permitted to make a profit;    itmay carry over reasonable annual working balances.     Under the present arrangements the amount of Government subsidy is determined by the authority&apos;s expenditure and bythe number of houses on the HRA.     The authority then decides for itself how tomake up the balance of costs from rents and rate contributions, but there is a limit(currently  39 per annum) to the amount by which any tenant&apos;s rent may be raised aa single year.

%     An important and distinctive feature of public seotor housing finance is the&quot;pooling&quot; of expenditure and income over the whole of an authority&apos;a housing stock.Expenditure and income must balance for the IIRA as a whole but not in terms of individual houses.     Eaoli house must have a standard rent, which does not vary .according to the tenant&apos;s financial circumstances or his length of tenancy.A national system of rent rebates provides help for tenants whose incomesare not high enough to support the standard rent.     Each authority is free to adoptits own rent structure and to decide what standard rent to charge for particularhouses.     Generally speaking, rents are fixed not by reference to the cost ofProviding or maintaining particular houses but more frequently according totheir rateable value or some other assessment of their relative size and amenity.8.    While authorities cannot budget for an overall sorpLus on their housingRevenue Account, it is possible to charge rents for older housing which not onlycover their historic costs of provision and upkeep but also make a contribution tocosts of newer and consequently more expensive houses.       This makes it possible^spread the high cost of new development across the whole stock, thereby reducinge need for direct subsidy to keep down the rents of new houses.     However, thec0Pe for moderating the financial impact of new investment in this way dependsneatly on the age structure of the authority&apos;s housing stock.     In Table 3-5 theeffect of the pooling of expenditure throughout the local authority stock is illustrated by a comparison between the average cost per house of financing thetotal council stock and the average cost of a new council house:th-hie 3.5COMPARISON OF THE COSTS OF FINANCING A NEW LOCAL AUTHORITYHOUSE WITH THE AVERAGE COSTS OF FINANCING THE TOTAL COUNCILHOUSING STOCK	Fi rst year cost of average new	Average	HRA per dwelling,	1976-77 (2)			/ Ant hority with	Authority wi * &apos;:.	4-porcon house		iii.-;:.osI total	Lowest ave:-	( )   &apos;     &apos; 1975-71 (1)	Scot land   per house	expenditure per house   per house	total exrvf--- v:.-per hon.,   per &quot;a- - vT0&quot;;AL EXPENDITURE		391	840	262Lc** Pharges,       -Rinded in total	/T5007	284	735	175Estimates made by SDD Housing Division (being revised)(2) Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy Rating Review,Juno 1976
9.     In recent years authorities have had to contend with unprecedented increases in the costs of building and improving house?;   and in the rates of interestPayable on outstanding loan debt,     Together these factors have produced a massiveincrease in initial housing costs;    thus, the loan charges payable on a newlybuilt local authority house in the first year are estimated to have risen fromin 1970-71 to / i,5007 in 1975-76.     But the low outstanding debt on olderhousing investment has had an important &quot;dampening&quot; effect.     Once housing debtis incurred, it is fixed in money terms, and annual debt- charges thereafter vary0^-ly insofar as interest rates change.     As a result, for Scotland as a whole,average loan charges per house have increased more slowly than prices and incomes.10.   The costs of managing and maintaining houses have, however, increased sharpl;Nonetheless taking all the costs of providing and running local authority housinginto account the average cost per house has gone up less fast than pricesgenerally and substantially slower than earnings.

11.   Since inflation has greatly increased the initial costs of financing new.investment while reducing the &quot;real&quot; harder, of financing old debt, widedifferences have developed in the level of housing costs experienced by individual authorities.     Authorities which have rapidly expanded a small housing stock tomeet, for example, the needs of oil-related development, have experiences astaggering increase in loan charges.     On the other hand, authorities with a gooddeal of older housing and small investment programmes have average loan charges which are remarkably low by comparison with the current costs of new development.12.   Over the 5 years since 1970-71, the share of Housing Revenue Account costsmet by Government subsidy has steadily increased, from 26$ to 40$ in 1975-76.Part of the increase was caused by the provision of special subsidies designedto help keep rents down, as part of counter-inflation policy, after 1973-74-But, taking the 5 year period as a whole, the mam effect of the increasedGovernment contribution was to reduce dependence on contributions from authorities&apos;general rate funds.     Unrebated rents met a somewhat higher percentages ofexpenditure in 1975-76 than 5 years earlier and rose on average faster than thegeneral increase in prices /Though more slowly than income^.     However, thePart of gross rental income&apos; actually met by rebates has increased:   rebates,Whose costs are met from Government subsidy and rate fund contributions (onlyrate contributions prior to 1972), accounted for over 6$ of HRA income in1375-76 compared with under 6$ in 1970-71:   thus the share of costs met by rentsactually paid by tenants has declined.     These trends are illustrated in Table    .

and subsequently, through the public subsidies - Government subsidies and ratefund contributions - which help to. finance the debt incurred. The Governmentexercise a number of controls with the broad aim to ensure that:- the overall level of public investment in housing is in line withits planned share of public expenditure;- public housing investment is undertaken to adequate but economicalstandards;- there is a limit to the taxpayer*s commitment to subsidiseaut horities&apos;  e xp end itur e.16.   The statutory backing for these controls consists of the Secretary of StatePower under section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 to approveall capital expenditure undertaken by local authorities, his various powers to approve expenditure qualifying for Government subsidies and his general power oioversight over New Town Development Corporations and the Scottish Special HousinAssoc Lation.17. The present controls are primarily applied to individual projects and opera0n tip.e following principles:- projects must conform to certain minimum design standards (Parker Morris)Which for new building differ from, and in some respects are more stringentthan,&apos; the statutory building regulations applying to privately but:cneir tender costs must be approved by or come within limits laid downhy the Scottish Development Department;the Scottish Development Department applies separate limits to theount of expenditure on a project which may attract Government subsidy.18.     y.re recently, controls over the size of certain programmes have been0 uced:    since 1974, each local authority has had an annual quota, for theValue ofnew improvement and modernisation projects approved;    and since 1975&quot;76there i n&apos;uVe been annual expenditure quotas for mortgage lending.     However,^ uure on new building has continued to be controlled on the basis of*u.uaj. project approvals.COTJlmlDWITTAL101
19.   A feature of the present control arrangements is the strong emphasis onensuring that projects are economically planned, rather titan upon the extent andurgency of the housing need which they are intended to meet.     The introductionQf quota systems for improvement and lending has required some broad assumptionsto be made in recent years about authorities&apos; relative need for expenditure,but so far this has been done centrally.     The new arrangements described in chapter 5 will provide for the allocation of housing investment resources to&quot;become more responsive to comprehensive assessments, made locally, of the widelyvarying degree and extent of housing need which nowFinance for owner oocupati on20.   The provision of housing for owner occupation is primarily a commericalactivity undertaken by private developers.     Nowadays most owner occupiers finance the purchase of housing by borrowing from a building society or a local authority over 20 or 29 years;   hut over &quot;half of all existing owner occupiers own outright;having either paid off the mortgage, inherited their house or bought outrightin the first place.     The size of mortgage granted to a borrower depends on hisincome, the kind of property and the policies of his building society (or localauthority);    on average (for Britain as a whole) new mortgages cover 65$ of thePurchase prices, although first-time purchasers tend to obtain somewhat largerPercentage loans.21-   Types of mortgage arrangements also vary, but the normal &quot;repayment&quot; mortgagea&amp;opts the annuity principle;    that is,  it provides for equal monthly payments of^Pital and interest combined - in the first years, payments consist largely ofMerest.     The total amount payable is fixed throughout the life of thohanges in interest rates, which can of course have a substantialeffect.     When In owner occupier changes house, the outstanding mortgage debt is paid off from the sale proceeds and a new mortgage taken out on the new house,*aich again involves mostly interest payments in the first years,be&apos;s is important because mortgage interest&apos;tween interest and capital paymentPayments (but not capital)&quot;may be set against income before tax is deducted,30 that relief is obtained at whatever marginal rate of tax the mortgager is liable to pay. ^ At the basic rate of tax it is equivalent to a flat rate subsidyOr^% (to be reduced to 33$33/o when a satisfactory agreement on a new pay policyCached) on interest payments.

Owner occupation, like public sector housing, has experienced spectacularcost increases in recent years.     Between 1970 and 1976, average house prices in Scotland rose by more than 150/b, with increases since 1974 faster than inany other region of Great Britain.

Moreover, mortgage interest rates rose in a single year (from 1972 to 1973)Increasing interest payments by 33?o.     In consequence, the newhouse purchaser&apos;now faces (1973) - on average - gross annual mortgage payments of 859 compared with  383 in 1971 - a rise of 224 $ compared with the increase inPrices and average earnings over the same period otfstf and  v  respectively.&apos; 24.

They have hadtn &quot;    - .    . iprpM. rates - either by extending the life of theirto cope with the rise m interest r^e.     uluu    -mortgage or increasing their cash payments;   but because of the rapid rate of inflation many people have seen the real burden of their mortgage payments,relative to incomes, diminish considerably.25.   in both the mam housing sectors, inflation has increased the initial burden* investment, but reduced the real burden of financing old debt.     Bit the effectsc* -dividual households are very different.     &quot;Pooling&quot; of HRA costs and income^s^les local authorities to share among all their tenants both the high costs oitesting today and the benefits of having acquired housing several years ago.TW is no such averaging process for owner occupiers.     Each mortgagor bearshis own initial costs and secures the eventual benefits of ownership as an individual      This makes it inevitable that at any given point in time individualshouSing costs vary more widely in the owner occupied sector ihan in 1he public rented sectorBuilding societies are well established as the main financial institutions for we purchase.

27.    Tho growth of demand for owner occupation in Scotland has been very sharp,especially among younger households.     With this growth has occurred a sustainedrate of annual increase in Scottish house prices.     In the years 1973-76ginclusive the increases over the previous year have averaged 36%, 14$,  14$ and17$.     The increases were particularly marked for older tenement property, winchis often the first step for new buyers.     Recent sample returns show that thePrice increases have now made Scottish house prices third highest among the regions of the country.27a. The growth in demand for owner occupation and the rise in Scottish housePrices have led to an increase in the share of building society funds going to scottish mortgagors;    since 1973, this has been broadly in line with the share ofdeposits obtained from Scotland.

Overall lending has beencontrolled since 1975-76, hut it has been maintained with only limited reductionsand in 1976-77 local authorities were allocated almost  14*.     These allocationshave enabled local authorities to play a small but important role in supporting the lower end of the horsing market in urban areas and enabling younger householdsto make their entry to the owner occupied ladder.     Local authorities have alsohelped to support owner occupation in the more rural areas where building societyfunds are not so readily available.assistance  Rjstanee to Owner Occupiers s29.   Because only around U$ of Scottish households (almost half of all owneroccupiers) have a mortgage, the volume of mortgage tax relief/option mortgagesubsidy is small by comparison with public sector housing subsidies, but relief for owner occupation is growing more rapidly (Table 3-2).30.   The reasons for the faster growth of owner occupation relief are complex.*ret, owner occupation is growing faster and as the sector grows, an increasing proportion of its households arc mortgagors;   an increasing proportion ofEngagers are first-time buyers with relatively large mortgages, and a growingProportion of mortgages are in the early year- in which payments consist almoste*itircly of interest, which is the clement qualifying for relief.31&apos;   Moreover, the process.of changing houses by established mortgagors alsote*ds to increase, entitlement to relief.     Owner occupied houses are periodically&quot;^valued&quot; as they are bought and sold at successively higher prices and this has^iio produce increases in mortgage debt.     In recent years, however, buildingPieties have increasingly required mortgagors to &quot;plough back&quot; the proceeds ofinto their new home.   &apos; This reflects the fact that a mortgagor who buys^ house for, say,  6,000, sells it five years later for  15,000 and buys anbivalent house for  15,000, does not &quot;need&quot; a significantly increased mortgage.The tax relief earned will rise in any event, because the mortgagor goes backto ^ar one of his mortgage, making payments almost entirely of interest once againPi-^SlILoial aanistance in different sectors?entmie comparative levels of financial assistance received by householders whore^-i.

0w much assistance does a council tenant receive compared wi th an owner occupierin similar financial circumstances?     In fact, because of the different ways inv&apos;hlch the main sectors are financed, it is not possible to compare in any direct and meaningful way the assistance currently received by individual households:although owner occupiers receive support as individuals, general subsidies inthe public sector are pooled for the benefit of all the tenants in each authority.^*   Comparisons are sometimes made in terms of individual houses, but these areaiSo misleading, because the relative changes which take place over time.A newly-Duili council house is initially subsidised much more heavily than a newlyailt private house, but in time this may be reversed;    rents are likely to rise*n money terms while mortgage outgoings are fixed (apart from changes in interestfates)5   and the debt on the council house gradually diminishes as it grows older,Whereas if the private house is bought and sold the mortgage debt could rise inine With rising house prices.34&apos;*   It is somewhat more meaningful to make comparisons in terms of bread averagesile these give no picture of hov.&apos; individuals fare, they provide somella^taation of hov/ much it currently costs the State to support  the two sectors,-&quot;-ag account of their different sizes.     The average tax relief in Scotland inis estimated to amount to  170 per mortgagor or  70 per owner occupiereluding those who have no mortgage).     The estimated figure for public sectoridies (including rate fund contributions but excluding rent rebates) isper house.     The gap between the two sectors is narrowing over time for theeasons given in paragraph 30.comparison of average levels of assistance per household is open to the motion that it fails to take account of the difference in average levels ofh which arise - at least in part - because of the different rate at which the- -* are growing.     Average public sector loan charges arc estimated to beJ per annum in 1976-77 whereas average mortgage repayments are estimatedround fz 7 per mortgagor.     Thus assistance, expressed as a percentageebt charges, averaged  * in the public sector and f&quot;      cfJ in the ownerCuPied sector.35&apos;    Tham lesson to be drawn from these comparisons is that both sectors arecantly subsidised.     Further attempts at conclusions can be misleading.
Per example,  the figure, might suggest on average it is more costly to supportPeople as public sector tenants than as owner occupiers.     Eat the figures donot compare like with like:    the public sector accommodates a high proportion of low income households who simply could not afford owner occupation at present levels of assistance.      Besides,  owner occupiers and tenants acquire differentthings for their money:   the tenant, for example,  gets a management and maintenanceservice and a rent rebate scheme to help with his housing costs if he is less well^f, and does not face the initial legal and other expenses which the owneroccupier has to bear.     The owner occupier,  on the other hand, has theopportunity to amek a capital gain (or loss) on resale of his house, and to passon the property to an heir;    and has greater freedom in the use of the house aswell as greater responsibilities for its upkeep.     The relative costs and benefits of owning and renting contain so many intangible factors, which will vary fromhousehold to household according to personal preference, that it is impossibleto draw up a universally acceptable &quot;balance sheet&quot;.&quot;Hidden&quot; subsidy to housing  /paragraphs 36-39 being revised/^.   This Chapter takes a simple view of what constitutes housing subsidy.      In^e public sector it is assumed to consist of direct subsidies to bridge the gaphetween rents and the &quot;historic&quot; cost of housing (ie the running costs and the costs of paying off capital debt).      In the owner occupied sector, it consists of the pare of mortgage payments which is either offset against tax or met by option&quot;^tgags subsidy.     The justification for regarding mortgage interest tax reliefas subsidy is that no other personal borrowing attracts tax relief;    in practice^tgage tax relief has an effect on households&apos; costs broadly equivalent to adireet subsidy.37&apos;   It is sometimes argued, however, that there are in addition other &quot;hidden&quot;tidies to housing, which should be taken into account in any assessment of thee*tent to which housing is subsidised by comparison with other forms of expenditure.ne most frequently mentioned examples are:(a)    in the public sector, the difference between historic costs and&apos;true economic rents&quot;;(h) in the owner occupied sector, the exemption for capital gainstax of the profits from house sales;    andconfip initial18.
(b)    the absence (since 1963). of any tax en the &quot;imputed&quot; rent income of owner occupied housing.38. The reality and importance of those so-called subsidies is of some doubt.*or example, it is no simple matter to work out what a true economic rent forcouncil housing would be; but if the argument is accepted that housing shouldnot need to earn as high a money rate of return as other investments - because it appreciates much more in value - then the average true economic rent forcouncil housing might be considerably nearer the average historic cost of manyauthorities than the much quoted first year cost of a new council house (Table 3-5)35.   Similarly, it is doubtful whether the tax treatment of owner occupationPreviously mentioned should be regarded as forms of subsidy.     To do so would be^ assume that housing was analogous to a commercial investment;    in that case it would no longer bo legitimate to regard mortgage interest tax relief as aS*bSidy, since the tax system allows relief on interest on borrowing for business purposes. utnre Financial Prospects40.   On present policies, the public expenditure outlook for housing in the second half of lhe 1970s is a continuation,  in less extreme form, of the trends of theear^ 1970s (Table 3.11) - a further increase in the real level of publictidies and a slight reduction of total new investment.     The public expenditureRecasts include the assumption that local authorities will increase rentsto -eet a bigger share of costs.     If in the event authorities decided to makelo^r rcnt increases and higher increases in rate contributions than forecastU Kould take more public expenditure to achieve the same level of capitalVestment.

41.   Under the present subsidy system Government subsidies would drop suddenly in1932-83 by nearly C150ia in cash because, under the terms of-the 1972 Act, housing expenditure subsidy earned in the 1972 to 1977 period is due to be withdrawn.The exact impact of this reduction on local housing finance would depend upon&quot;hat happened to inflation between now and 1982 but it would certainly have adisrupting effect for local authorities,     The Government is proposing,however,that a new subsidy system should be introduced before this position is reached^ee Chapter 8).-   Owner occupation seems likely to increase further if a sufficiently steadymortgage funds can be assured for lending in Scotland and an increasingsupply of houses is available for sale.     In that event rapid growth in theievel of tax relief and option mortgage subsidy would continue.Sghclusjons43.   Recent years have seen a startling growth in the level of public assistanceto households&apos; housing costs.     The increases are explained partly by the^precedented increases in the costs of financing new housing investment - owingto the combined effects of high interest rates and house price inflation - and pr^ly by the rapid ruse in public sector management and maintenance costs.     Thefull ;unuaet of these increases has been fell by only a minority of households,heoause the real burden of financing old housing investment has diminishedSiShificantly.     For public sector housing &quot;pooling&quot; enables costs and benefits* inflation to be distributed among an authority&apos;s tenants,  but the extent tothey can be &quot;averaged out&quot; varies greatly from one authority to another and* Present subsidy system does not take full account of this factor in allocatingG0vernment subsidies.      For owner occupiers existing financial arrangements provide*o way of redistributing the costs and benefits of inflation among individualhouseholds.     In consequence there are mush larger variations in the housing cososV*e by individual owner occupiers, which tax relief does little to offset.

This imolics not only a house but also a due share of the socialc*eatsional and commercial facilities which arc necessary for a healthy modernHousing policy has to be associated with policies for community welfare
development.   The only practical solution lies in a joint approach by housing authorities and other authorities and agencies meeting community needs, notablysocial wool: and education authorities and Health Boards.   This approach is vital^ producing the co-ordinated short-term measures required to combat the more extreme instances of &quot;multiple deprivation&quot; which are found in some parts ofScotland, often in relatively small geographical areas of modern counci*&apos;e aJ-so need to recognise that people want - and are entitled to - more choic&apos; heof Vimousing and more say in decisions affecting their homes.   The growing demand for.e ownership is the most obvious reflection ofsuch aspirations.   But morersonal choice and responsibility for one *s home are reasonable expectations forants as well.   As private rented housing has diminished many local authoritiesXq gradually established a virtual monopoly of the housing market for those who&apos; Qt afford or who do not wish to become owner-occupiers.   Reconciling greaterand freedom with the fair and efficient administration of a valuable publicnousing asset is not easy, but prerequisites are such policy measures as:choice^ctorueveiopin0- more nooral alioca.uj.uii c-.nu iian.jj.i;i poi^j-v-j ,j.^^. authorities and encouraging exchanges between authorities for people whoLave to move, particularly those moving t.n new jobs;- removing unnecessarily restrictive conditions of let;- offering tenants a greater variety of conditions of tenure including equitysharing schemes and arrangements whereby tenants, if they wish, can take responsibility for repairs ana improvements with annroorinx adlustmenencouraging various forms of tenant participation in housing management, anwhere appropriate, the establishment of housing co-operatives.V
,&quot;    &quot;ho Government will encourage public housing author.!Lien to adopt management-oii-cioa which lighten restrictions on tenants as far as possible and. at tho same timexde them with the opportunity of.more effective control of their homos.   Hoveo to- nousmg management more responsive to the needs and aspirations of tenants will$hasise the demands on management skills and this is why the Government give suchhighPriority to improving professional housing management and to securing thesary staffing resources for public sector housing.   To implement their objective0 &quot;tenants greater rights, the Government propose that &quot;early action should bo takento ensure security of tenure for tenants of housing authorities (and housing associations);to develop a model tenancy agreement covering the relationships betweentenants and their landlord authorities and setting out their -respective rightsand obligations; andto encourage further tenant&apos; participation in housing management.*&apos;r&apos;Q Gr*....     ernment would look to the substantial involvement of COS LA through its Housing&quot;&quot;&apos;vi;&quot;0- in the preparation of a model agreement.&apos;0.    j   ,^ &quot;Cutland above all, widening people&apos;s choice of housing must include givingeo-0ie access to a choice of forms of tenure.     The Goverment do not take the /
&apos; that it is &quot;better&quot; for people to be tenants than owner-occupiers or vice versa,^a-te in these terns is sterile.     People&apos;s needs and preferences for housing varyatly and the form of tenure which suits ore best will not necessarily suit another:eed, as an individual progresses .from childhood to old age, the typo of housinge&amp;ure arrangement   which best suits him may change several times.    If a community is,i!2et the reasonable needs and expectations of individuals, it must have a reasonableBge of forms of housing tenure.*fc Scotland this means that efforts must be made to meet the increasing demand.-:ner-occupation,     The supply of houses for sale is limited at present, and^ re houses are required (particularly at the lower part of the price range).   It isfopnsideration whether new arrangements arc needed to help households to meet the&apos;-n initial costs of buying a house.1?-    Ina semo areas, particularly in the cities, sharp social and geographical^&quot;ions have grown up between public rented, and owner-occupied: housing.    Changes- ana should not - be made overnight, but public policies should, wherever(&apos;i seek to reduce and not ,to perpetuate or worsen existing barriers,   For*&apos; Qt it seems desirable that public authorities and housing associations should0 Plan &quot;mixed&quot; developments ic to build or to rehabilitate a group of houseshe idea of renting some and selling others.     The sale of council houses inu*table circumstances or of houses acquired by authorities for improvement can be,,-tciously to recreate a range of houses vmich offer better choi.ee.     Aa &apos;&apos;ay oi eroding the distinction between the two predominant forms of tenure is ^    &apos;   CP intermediate farms of tenure such as &quot;half and half&quot; equity-sharing*-^-onts or fairs of co-ownership.If TV^ ,        iG bousing system makes it difficult for people to.move from area to area\^ ^       dor;;u;:itics change, this hinders Scotland &apos;s economic progress.     The costis      i4tdivirbv.xl of moving always sots as some deterrent, whether he6v&apos;   i  *      or an owner-occupier.     But particular problems can ariso in areas is-,    &quot;&quot;*Cl&quot;g rapid emoloyment grovrth, where the existing stock of houses is*68i^    .n &apos;&quot;&apos; P&apos;1-? or where ready access to the local authority sector depends on^Ute n-t&quot;*al tTua-i-il&quot;modifications ions&apos;.   The problem is aggravated by the decline of the private&apos; ector which in the past was able to offer temporary accommodation toMi - S ^til longer-term housing was available.

^financial OBJECTIVES   &apos;4,     Policies for mooting housing need cannot be treated in isolation from nolieiesa ut subsidising housing,   The most ambitious programme for improving physicalhousing conditions will fail in its objective if people cannot afford to live in thetter houses provided,   Housing subsidies provided by successive governments haveSee possible the overall high standard of housing which the Scottish people enjoytoday.The Government believe that for the foreseeable future there will continue xoneed Tor housing subsidy.    This does rot, however, moan that all aspects of; a? . aire:&apos;      r all ii-n:    eerJ - Ln c!to p 11locate a3si3tar.ee more fairly and economically than at presortr     But stabilityimportart and the existing levels of support greatly influence the budgetinghits and commitments of the- great majority of Scottish households.    They may also an effect on house prices.   Any change which would significantly alter subsidymxist be introduced gradually, so as to avoid hardshio for the individual andupticn in the housing market.16-     t&apos;-n n^        16 Government conclude that the most sensible way ahead for housing finance&quot;0 16tain the essentials of the present system, but to modify and adapt it to&apos;..crc responsive to need.     Several commentators have suggested a mere&quot;&apos;-&quot;-al approach which would involve scrapping the uresent general subsidies in thePublic&quot;Getor and mortgage tar relief and substituting a new system relying onft!       eSt,ed housing assistance (on the rent rebate model) or involving a housingw&apos;-nce available for all tenures linked to a. new pricing system based on thecurrent value of housing.     Such proposals and their impxications wereerec as part of the Review and more information on them is published in theureen Paper relating to England and Wales ^Cmnd/.Allf. che proposals for radically new financial systems for housing have-^ges as well as advantages.     And the theoretical benefits are outweighedv the dig0 sruptive consequences which would result from such radical change.     The^nmont therefore believe that the housing finance system should continue to have. A0,-&apos;ing mam features:/
CONFIDF, rPTALSpecial income-related assistance for low income tenants as a supplement to - but not a replacement for - general assistance.   This kind of assistance is provided at present, by rent rebates and rent allowances;&quot; In the public rented sector, Government subsidies to supplement the contribution from rents and rate funds towards pooled historic costs,but provided in a manner which takes more account than hitherto of authorities&apos; ability to secure local contributions towards expenditure;- General assistance to owner-occupiers related to mortgage interest costs,With modifications to remove the most regressive features of present arrangements,&apos;,JELIC SECTOR FINANCE13.    Bi,0w that housing needs are more varied and complex, it is necessary as a first*o plan the level and distribution of public investment in housing (ie expenditure^        creation of new and improved housing) on the basis of better knowledge aboutIng needs.   This means essentially local assessments of need by responsible local&quot; &apos;s authorities.     Decisions on investment priorities can then be taken in theOJ- the best possible information.iQoxicy and investment plans do, however, have to be backed up by a commitment to^    re value for money in public housing investment.     It seems consistent with local-^&quot;ioilixy for assessing needs to give authorities greater responsibility for the--ieccivcr.es.- of housing programmes.   At present, direct Government control of^ojeC4.^        Costs is aimed at ensuring that now housing investment is provided to adequateonomical standards.     More effective cost control is likely to result from a^0\i - &quot;   ^^^ility for adopting a cost-effective approach to the planning ofns Programmes within fixed investment budgets.0:,8jrst * :&apos;C:; approach to investment planning is called for, involving a more flexible(j.       0   Paying Government subsidy to meet expenditure needs.

The scope forbating tenures in the same way is, however, severely limited:   renting and owninga*e not &quot;the same&quot;.     The most practical way of securing greater fairness is to***vide assistance within each sector as fairly and economically as possible.The Government regard as a major element of fairness the need to ensure the equitable distribution of subsidy among local authorities as the major providers of housing inGotland.   Proposals to this end axe described in Chapter 8.AH  OUTLINE STRATEGY25.   The Governments new housing strategy is designed to bo wide-ranging anaparent and has many inter-related components, but the major objectives of the strategy are in summary:(a)   to ensure that local policies and resources are directed towards meetingassessed housing needs;   local housing plans will enable priority to oeReused on the greatest problems of poor and inadequate housing and the special requierements of such groups in the community as the elderly;   they will encourage an integrated view of the interlocking contributions of public and private^sector housing and housing associations in meeting housing need; anathey wiU 0Aabla authorities to deeide on the most cost effective mix of housxngactivities between new building, improvement and lending;(*)/
(b) To promote the planning and provision oi housing within the full range of services and facilities which modern bc.lr.nccd communities require;(c) To secure a varied supply&apos; of housing which will afford a greater choicfor the Scottish people according to their aspirations, circumstances anaability to pay;   this would be achieved by?- liberalising management policies of public authorities;- allowing public sector tenants to have more say in managing their houses-- encouraging new forms of housing tenure;- increasing the supply of houses for sale;- helping more people to own their own homes;(d) To improve the standard of housing provision and amenity enjoyed by public sector tenants through higher standards of housing management;(c) To erode the sharp distinctions which presently characterise different types of housing and the rights and restrictions on their occupiers;(f) To maintain a sufficient level of public investment in housing, tosecure an adequate supply of good quality housing suited to the variety of local needs;(g) To continue public financial support towards the cost of providinghousing -which ensures the necessary supply of good houses at a cost whichis within the means of ordinary families (with special support for thelower-paid) and at the same time ensures an economical and fair distributiof housing assistance;on(k)   To provide extra help for first-time buyers;(i) To continue mortgage interest tarn relief as the main form of assistance0 owner-occupiers, but to restrict the relief given to those least in need.CONPIPEMTIAL
