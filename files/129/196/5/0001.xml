^cument is the property of her britannic majesty-s government cp(77) 55 COPY NO     g17 May 1977cabinetPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  POSITION AND PROSPECTSMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. Last year, through the new disciplines exercised by the Cabinet,public expenditure decisions were kept in line with the plans embodied inour White Paper.    This year too, though there is much of the year still to go and we cannot relax, I am hopeful that we will be able to maintain this performance.    In this we are helped by the time-lags in public expenditure which mean that our spending tins year is substantiallydetermined by decisions we have already taken, though some decisions are quicker acting than others.2. Correspondingly many of our decisions from now on will have majorconsequences for next year and subsequent years rather than in the current year.    So far as possible these decisions ought to be taken in the context ofthe report on the 1977 public expenditure survey, which it is planned to put to Cabinet in July and which will take account of all new developments, andof the latest cost estimates, rather than as part of our monitoring of the contingency Reserve.    However, if any of these issues have to be settledbefore July, then we must consider their effects on the Contingency reserve for the current year and on future years.3-        The Survey report will bring together a great many additional requirements for 1978-79 and later years which cannot be brought into the reckoning at this stage.    In Annex A I have taken into account only some^ajor items which have already been registered in advance of the Surveyiu inter-Ministerial correspondence.    This simplified presentationillustrates the extent to which decisions we take now will reduce the roomfQr manoeuvre within the public expenditure totals we have planned for1978-79 and subsequent years.    In particular, on this appraisal we shall notbe in a position to meet the full cost of the current proposals on youth andauult employment, an uprating of child benefit on the lines being consideredby the Secretary of State for Social Services and the proposed margin onSQcial security uprating, and stay within our provisional decisions on thelevel of public expenditure in 1978-79.    It follows that we could not meet tneAdditional cost of other proposals which will arise in the public expendituresu*vey without exceeding our plans or finding offsetting savings elsewhe;
4. It is of course likely that some approved programmes will beunderspent.    But there are also demand-determined and other lesscontrollable programmes which are liable to overrun.    We cannot thereforecount on under spendings to give us an extra margin for allocation, least ofall when we are looking ahead to 1978-79 and later years.conclusion. Clearly we must decide the social security issue now.    But this and any other decisions taken at this stage will reduce our room for manoeuvre in the Survey, and I must therefore advise my colleaguesagainst over committing ourselves in advance of the Survey.J treasury Chambersi7 May 19772
