DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 69 COPY NO     g21 July 1977CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE DECISIONSMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryINTRODUCTION1. In this year&apos;s public expenditure review we have to take firm decisions about 1978-79, provisional decisions about 1979-80 and a preliminary view of the two subsequent years.    The factual material isin the report of the interdepartmental Public Expenditure Survey Committee(the PESC Report), circulated separately.    A (digest of that report,prepared in the Treasury, is attached as Annex B.2. By the efforts of the last two years, we have succeeded in regainingcontrol of public expenditure and setting the aggregate of our plans on amore viable course.    Both in substance and presentationally this has beena major factor in our healthier economic state and prospects.    In this andfuture reviews it will be right to relate our plans to the evolvingcircumstances, but it is essential to retain control and to avoid againgetting over committed.    We all want to avoid if we possibly can thepolitical and economic damage of a new round of substantial cuts in programmes.    This I believe we can do.    But it means determinedrestraint in regard to proposals for additional expenditure.    Otherwise weshall have to go through the agony of finding cuts to offset them.1978-793. We ought to settle 1978-79 before the summer break.    Not only shallwe need decisions before the recess on child benefit, but early decisions on1978-79 are also needed as a basis for the rate support grant negotiations and to clear the way for the whole programme of work on Estimates andcash limits for 1978-79-4. We have already published, in Cmnd 6721, provisional plans for public expenditure in 1978-79.    We committed ourselves to these totals whenapplying for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan, and the safety netarrangement for the sterling balances likewise depends on our carrying outthe programme agreed with the IMF.    The aim must be to find a way of livingwithin the published plans for 1978-79.
5. The survey &quot;baseline&quot; figures for 1978-79, which provide the starting point for considering additional expenditure or reductions, leave us with&quot;headroom&quot; of  33 million within the Cmnd 6721 figures.    (The mainfigures underlying this paper are summarised in the table at Annex A).    Inother words, programmes could be raised by  33 million without exceeding the Cmnd 6721 total.    (The survey report in fact shows baseline figures inexcess of Cmnd 6721 levels;  but this is more than accounted for by anincrease in the figure for Government lending to nationalised industries, andI have asked officials to examine the figures further with a view toeliminating this increase).6. The two points of real difficulty in next year&apos;s programmes concern the proposals for additional expenditure and the contingency reserve.7. As regards proposals for additional expenditure I suggest that webegin by setting aside for the time being three big items which are in thenature of contingent requirements - the European Economic Community (e.c.)contributions and related agricultural support payments, the refinancing of export and shipbuilding credit, and extra social security payments resultingfrom new estimating e.ssumptions, particularly on the level of unemployment.In my view, these contingent requirements, which are shown in Table A ofthe annexed note by the Treasury, ought not to affect our decisions on other programmes directly:  provided we have an adequate contingency reserve,the aim should be to accommodate them, as necessary, from within the contingency reserve.8. If we deal with Government lending to nationalised industries and thethree big contingent items in this way, then containment of programmeswithin Cmnd 6721 levels will require that any additions to programmes whichwe accept must be broadly balanced by cost reductions and/or other savings.Our ability to avoid cuts will depend on the decisions we take on theproposals for additions to programmes.    If we were to accept too many ofthese, then we should inevitably be driven to seek extensive offsetting savings.9. In practice, there are several programmes where some net additional expenditure is likely to be unavoidable.    I have listed these at 2(a) of the table at Annex A.10.        We are already committed to the first items:  the employment-creating measures following the Holland report, and the related Departmentof Education and Science measures.    After taking into account relatedsavings, I hope that, if the Manpower Services Commission can find someoffsetting cost reductions as the Cabinet asked, the net cost of these measures and of the Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster General&apos;s other bids next year will be contained within a figureof  111 million, plus a further  5 million on the education programme.    Myofficials will be discussing this further with officials of the otherDepartments concerned.
11.        As regards the other items listed at 2(a) of the table, the threelargest relate to the Department of Energy, where it seems unrealistic to plan for net additional expenditure of less than  38 million;  to the HomeOffice, the Lord chancellor s Department and the correspondingdepartments in Scotland, where additional requirements for existing services seem bound to exceed practical savings by some  36 million;  andto expenditure on civil superannuation arising from an increased number ofretirements - expenditure which is a common service spanning all departments and is the main element in an extra  27 million on common services.12.        There are other programmes where cost estimates have been revised downwards and it would be reasonable to look for net reductions.I have listed these programmes at 2(b) of the table at Annex A.13.        The biggest of these reductions is in housing, where in Englandalone the lower interest rates assumed in this exercise are expected toproduce savings of some  200 million.    On the other hand, it is nowdoubtful whether it will be practicable to obtain the full rent increasespostulated in Cmnd 6721, and mortgage repayments are likely to fail short of Cmnd 6721 levels as well.    Even allowing for these items, a net reduction of not less than  100 million in the housing programme should bepossible.    The Secretary of State for the Environment has proposed that thebulk of the net savings should be devoted to meeting other increases in thehousing programme.    I recognise that when interest rates rose last autumn,the housing programme was cut to meet part of the extra subsidy bill thenforeseen.    But other programmes also made a substantial contribution onthat occasion.    I suggest that it is reasonable for a net saving of  100 million from housing in England, plus a further  20 million from Scotland andWales, to be applied towards the employment measures and other itemsmentioned in paragraphs 10-11.14.        If the proposals in paragraphs 10-13 are accepted, and all otheradditional bids are rejected or absorbed, then, allowing for the &quot;headroom&quot;mentioned earlier, the total level of programmes would be only some 55 million above the Cmnd 6721 level.    We might reasonably regard this as a charge on the contingency reserve for next year.    However next year&apos;sreserve has been reduced to a low level, by decisions we have already taken,notably the social security uprating, the earlier employment measures andthe measures on construction in inner cities.    This further charge would reduce it to only a little over  600 million.    This is not really adequate.It will be necessary to consider later whether we should raise the contingency reserve.    What is clear at this stage is that we cannot contemplatereducing it any further.    If we wish to accept proposals for additional expenditure beyond those mentioned in paragraphs 10-11, we shall have to finance these by savings elsewhere.
15.        This applies in particular to child benefit, on which a separate paper is being submitted to Cabinet.    The Department of Health and social security are proposing that the rate of benefit should be such as to restore the overall level of direct family support (including the value of the remainingchild tax allowances) for the majority of families to at least the level thatapplied in 1974-75.    The cost (net of the savings from increased taxreceipts as child tax allowances are further phased out) is put at 320 million ( 337 million if the standard rate of tax is reduced to33 per cent, thus reducing the value of the tax offset).    Whatever agreementwe may reach on any increase in child benefit, we should also agree that wemust find savings to offset it.    I should warn my colleagues, however, that,having looked through the options for reductions identified in the PESCreport, I think that the task of finding such savings will be extremelydifficult.    Following the decisions we made in December, the scope isvery limited, and in practice savings would be likely to be concentratedagain on capital programmes or on measures which increase prices.1979-80 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS16.        In addition to confirming our plans for 1978-79, we have to cakeprovisional forward decisions on 1979-80 in the course of this exercise,and also to agree on the projections to be published for the years after that.Circumstances permitting, we ought to reach these conclusions soon afterthe recess so as to publish the next White Paper in good time, and not allowour debate on these issues to continue once again through the winter months,so that the White Paper is not published until well into the New Year, with only a short breathing space before the Budget.    This creates difficulties for administration and in Parliament, and also encourages speculation aboutpolitical divisions within the Government.17.        On the other hand, we shall not be able to take a firm view on these issues until we know what progress is made on pay policy, and what theprospects are for getting inflation down, in the light of developments in the summer and early autumn.18.        I propose therefore that at this stage we confirm the 2 per cent annualgrowth rate as a provisional planning figure for the years after 1978-79.The implication of this is that we will have to apply to programmes in1979-80 and 1980-81 an approach broadly similar to that which I have suggested for 1978-79, and that we must reject or postpone all but a very limited number of priority additions to programmes during those years.CONCLUSIONS19.My proposals are therefore as follows4
1- 1978-79a. The Cmnd 6721 figure for programmes pluscontingency reserve should be confirmed as the planninglimit on Government expenditure for that year.b. In the first instance -i. net additions to programmes should belimited to the amounts listed at 2(a) of the table at annex A, where additional expenditure is already-committed or likely to be unavoidable; and ii. net reductions should be made in programmes as indicated at 2(b) of the table at Annex A, whereestimates of cost have been revised downwards.c. We should note that, even if we contain programmes as at (b) above, the contingency reserve will be reduced toa little over  600 million, and it may be necessary to raiseit to a more realistic level.d. Any measures other than those at b. above, such asimprovements in child benefit, will have to be met byswitches within or between programmes.    If colleagues wishto adopt such measures, or decide that programmes cannotbe contained in the way I have suggested, I shall have to ask them to put forward proposals for offsetting savings - a task which is likely to prove extremely difficult.2. 1979-80 AND LATER years a. We should provisionally confirm a 2 per cent growth rate in Government expenditure in 1979-80 and subsequentlyas the basis of our planning for those years.    This impliesthe rejection or deferment of most additional expendituremeasures if they entail substantial extra expenditure before1981-82.b. I should hold bilateral discussions with the ministers principally concerned and report back so that Cabinet canreach decisions in the autumn in the light of the political,economic and financial situation at that time.J treasury Chambers30 June 1977

ANNEX BPUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1977Note by the TreasuryIntroductionMinisters decided in March the basis on which the 1977 public expenditure survey report should be prepared.   The report is now available and is being circulated separately.   The purpose of this note is to highlight the main issues which will arise for decision.   The essential decisions which will be required are:-i.     to take firm decisions on programmes in 1978-79*as a basis for control in the coming year;ii.     to take provisional decisions on 1979-80;iii.     to take a more provisional forward look at theremaining two years.2.     To help Ministers in this task, the survey report provides a set of programme figures which are the benchmark for futuredecisions.   These take account of decisions already taken,before the survey report was completed.   The report then isolatesfor decision any increases or decreases which might be made to&quot;those figures.   Finance for nationalised industries is examined in a separate review, which itself examines the programmes andillustrates options: the survey report uses the same baselinefigures as in that review.^he size of the problem.     An important distinction must be made between 1978-79 andthe other years.   In the first place, 1978-79 is the year for whichfirm decisions are needed, before the Summer Recess, as a basis for control in the coming year.   Secondly, it is a year for whichthe Government have published firm plans in Cmnd 6721 which formed part of the basis for our application to the IMP.^*     For the later years, from 1979-80 onwards, there is no commitment of a comparable kind.   It is still necessary, however,*o establish plans which are within what the country can afford.
The Cabinet adopted a provisional planning assumption in Marchthat (apart from the special problem of refinancing maturingnationalised industry debt) public expenditure programmes andthe contingency reserve, should grow at 2 per cent a year.5.     On this basis, the size of the problem can bo described as follows.   The survey figures, which are provided as a bond marreflect only existing decisions and do not by themselves revoalany serious problem except in 1978-79, where the contingency reserve has been eroded, even at this stage, to a level ratherlower than it would be prudent to publish in a White Paper next winter.   To restore it to a more comfortable level of, eay, 900 million would require reductions in the survey progrnmmufigures of some  240 million.6.     In 1979-80 and later years, the survey figures ore withinthe 2 per cont plnnninp; assumption, but only by n nmnl I mnrf-hi(except in the final year, whore tho survey ground-ruleareserved for Cabinet the decisions on where the 2 per cent pirowUdiould go).

distinguished in the survey report.   As last year, it is howeveralso convenient to distinguish a number of broad categories,which are7identified in the tables attached to this note.J^a.or demand-determined programmes10.  The first category consists of estimating changes in a fewmajor programmes on which, once the policy has been fixed, thooutturn is not precisely controllable but is mostly dependonton the demand for the service and the state&apos;of the economy; and where the nature of the programme is such that offsetting ohort-term adjustment is not normally practicable elsewhere within thoprogramme.   Table A includes estimating changes in nocial security benefits, refinance of export and shipbuilding credit, and KKCcontributions.   In the cnoe of social security, tho revisionreflects the inflation and employment assumptions current;!;/ we-lfor the survey, and these will need to be looked at again foci Tornthe White Paper is published.   The additional provision shown for export credit refinance reflects a revised estimate of b*uikdononitfl. but thin could nl no rnmnrfl fnrthfvr revision and thnscheme is currently being renegotiated with the bankswith the object of reducing public expenditure.   EECcontributions st present show some reduction on Cmnd 6721, butthis is partly offset by increases in agricultural support(shown elsewhere) and it could also be more than offset by thooutcome of the negotiations on the unit of account; a very ron,,uestimate of the additional cost of this is shown in the table,but this is at present only a contingent item.kocal authority current expenditure ]*.   Table B contains all the items relating to local authoritycurrent expenditure.   This needs to be looked at as a whole, iuthe Government does not directly control the individual elemoriio,and the main financial influence which the Government can bring to bear is the overall level of the rate support grant.1$.   Supplementary analysis A in the survey report reviews tho;,prospects for local authority current expenditure, which straddleseveral, of the survey programmes.   After a small fall in 1979-79,3DW1T3T?fT1nine (
the baaeline for relevant expenditure is flat throughout the survey period.   As the Government do not directly control this expenditure, the analysis brings together two approaches to theproblem of estimating whether it would be realistic to expect localauthorities to contain their spending within the baseline levels.Separate programme by programme assessments, included withindepartmental additional bids, suggests a possible total extra expenditure of some  60 million in 1978-79, excluding some  40million of bids for new developments, and some   85 million in1979-80, excluding some  210 million of bids for new developments.But the analysis concludes that if local authority relevant expenditure is considere   as a whole, and if the proposals for new developments are set on one side, it would be realistic to expectit to be contained within the baseline total for 1978-79 and1979-80, at least in England and Wales, though some growth willprobably have to be allowed in the two succeeding years.Other main proposed additions13.   Table C brings together the main proposed additions whichwill need decision in the survey.   The principal items are asfollows:-Defence14.   The Ministry of Defence are proposing a return to theDefence Review levels of expenditure at a cost rising to  580 million in 1981-82 on the defence programme as a whole.Overseas aid15.   Additional amounts from  30 to  46 million are sought forthe aid programme in 1979-80 and later years, to provide for newinitiatives and commitments.Industry16.   The Department of Industry&apos;s proposals for additional expenditure amount to some  10 million net in 1978-79 (excluding 9 million f&amp;r the refinancing of shipbuilding credits).
This figure is the net result of a large number of^changes in costingsas well as proposals for new developments.   Proposals for extra expenditure on the not and other forms of industrial suprortraise the net total for other years to around  100 million a year.Employment17.   The report includes proposals for employment measures following the Holland Report costing some  130 million in 1978-79* rising tosome  170 million a year subsequently.   Decisions have now been taken on these, and the net cost, subject to further savings in costs, is 132 million in 1978-79 and some  200 million per year thereafter,including a transfer of  7 million from programme 10.   (these decisions were taken after the preparation of the figures inparagraphs 5-6 above.)Energy18.   Proposals for additional expenditure by the Department of energy include expenditure on British Nuclear Fuels Limited, andextra support for the nuclear reactor programme and the coalindustry.   The proposals amount to some  100 million in 1978-79*falling to  40 million by the end of the survey period.Roads and Transport19.   The Department of Transport has proposed extra expenditureof  20 million in 1978-79.   This is intended to allow the main-tenance of local public transport,subsidies at their current level,*nile mitigating to some extent the reductions on motorway and trunk^oad construction that would otherwise be required.   A similarsum is s ought in 1979-80 and 1980-81 while  50 million is sought in 1981-82 forthis purpose.   Additional provision is alsosought to allow the provision of new bus grants after 1980, as stated In the transport White Paper.^fiusing;20.The total figure of proposals for additional expenditure on housing is the net of a number of items.   Because of new (andPrecarious) assumptions on interest rates, subsidies are now
forecast to cost over  200 million a year less than assumed inthe baseline programmes.   But this cost reduction is partly offset by the assumptions of lower rents and lower receipts frommortgage repayments and the balance is more than offset^by proposal.&apos;for new&quot;developments, leaving proposals for net additional expenditureaveraging  20 million a year.   These figures assume net receipts from council house sales which the-Treasury considers improbably high-Other environmental services21.   Some proposals for additional expenditure are more than offset by substantially reduced capital requirements of regional and welsh water authorities.Law and order22.   The Home Office have put forward proposals for arlditi^nnlexpenditure of some  4-3 million in 1978-79 and IO79-8O, &quot;&quot;d rwthfi&apos;larger amounts in the two subsequent years.   These additionn reflectalmost entirely increased costs of existing services, includingpolice pensions.Education23.   The Department of Education and Science have put forward proposals for additional expenditure of  53 million in 1978-79rising to some  230 million in 1979-80, some  320 million in1980-81 and some  435 million in 1981-82.   The bulk of theseproposals relate to new developments.    5 million in 1978-79i 14 million in 1979-80 and  19 million in 1980-81 and 1981-82, isalready committed as a result of the decisions on the Hollandproposals.Health and personal social services24.   The DHSS have proposed increases rising from some  38 million in 1978-79 to over  500 million in 1981-82.   These relate partly to demographic factors and partly to proposed new developments.* - e/:Social security (policy changes)25-   The DHSS have proposed an increase in the level of childbenefit next April at a net cost of  320 million in 1978-79( 337million if the standard rate of tax is reduced to 33 per cent).The Department is also proposing an increase in the mobilityallowance.
Civil superannuation26.   Additional bids of some  25 million next year rising tosome  60 million by the end of the survey period reflect anincrease in the estimated number of retirements and hence inentitlement to civil superannuation.Northern Ireland27.   Proposals for additional expenditure by the Northern IrelandDepartment and the Northern Ireland Office are mainly thecounterpart of corresponding programmes in Great Britain.Proposals for additional expenditure of some  65 million nextyear reflect mainly increased social security costs following the recent uprating and the cost of employment schemes.Minor items28.   Table D indicates other proposals for additional expenditurenot included in Tables A-C.   A few of these are ineluctablerecostings, but the others are matters for decision, and will need to be pursued bilaterally with departments by the treasury or CSD, as appropriate.Summary29.
