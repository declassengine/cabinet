DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77)51 COPY NO      8216 May 1977CABINET 2 08 INCREASE FOR TOP SALARIES GROUPSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster GeneralTHE ISSUE1. A decision is needed on whether or not the second stage payment for those whose 1975 pay increase based on the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB)and Doctors&apos; and dentists Review Body (DDRB) recommendations werestaged should be reduced by the increase of  208 a year which they are toreceive under Phase II of the pay policy.    The question is immediatelyrelevant for pensions purposes.background. In 1974 the Government accepted the salaries recommended by theTSRB for the Higher Civil Service, the higher judiciary, senior officers ofthe Armed Forces and those of the DDRB for National Health Servicedoctors and dentists but decided that for those with salaries above  13, 000the increase would have to be paid in two stages.     The first stage was paid on 1 January 1975 (except for the doctors and dentists for whom the date was1 April); the second stage would have been payable in 1976, but wasprecluded by the  8, 500 cut off in Phase I of the pay policy.    At their meeting on 21 March the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (EY)decided that, although there was now no formal pay policy objection topaying the second stage increases, they should not be volunteered atpresent.    EY referred to the Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations and price control of the Ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy(EI(PR)) the question of whether the second stage payment should bereduced by the  208 a year increase which Ministers had agreed in correspondence should be paid under Phase II to those covered by TSRB andDDRB awards.    The deduction would only be made from salaries when thestaged payments under the TSRB and DDRB awards are in fact made.    Itwould however immediately affect the pensions of those who have retiredsince the TSRB and DDRB awards were accepted in principle since their pensions are calculated on the basis of notional salary including the second stage.1
ARGUMENT3.the  208 aa.The arguments in favour of reducing the second stage payments byThe pay policy rules require that staged payments agreed before11 July 1975 and payable after 1 August should be set against the pay limit.    Paragraph 5 of the Annex to the 1975 White Paper (Cmnd 6151)states that -&quot;when current agreements provided payments in the 12-month period, any new agreement should ensure that only the balance between the amount paid and the  6 should be applicable in theperiod up to 1 August 1976&quot;.In spelling out the effect of this guideline, the then Secretary of Statefor Employment said in the House on 23 July 1975 (Hansard 23 July1975, col 686-7) that forward commitments in the form of staggeredpayments, thresholds or indexation payable after 1 August would beset against the  6 limit.    The current White Paper (Cmnd 6507)states that in general the interpretation of the policy in particular circumstances will be the same as in the first round.b. In interpreting this rule, no account has been taken of thereasons for staging, which vary from case to case;  and, inparticular, no distinction has been drawn between pre-policyagreements which anticipated future increases in the going rate forthe job and cases of staging where the full going rate had beenpromulgated but part of it was withheld.    Although no other group isin precisely the same position as the TSRB and DDRB groups, othersaffected by staging, such as the seamen and British Airways pilots,have had their staged increases set against the pay limit.c. Those whose pensions position will be slightly worsened are welloff and benefit from inflation-proofed pensions.d. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) have been consulted by theSecretary of State for Employment, and support his view that the paypolicy rules would require the  208 supplement to be subsumed withinthe Stage II increase if it were paid in the current round, and that itcannot be added to the notional salary for pensions purposes.e.It is essential at the present stage of pay policy that the Phase IIrules should be rigorously interpreted in agreement with the TUCparticularly in the case of salaries in the public sector or underdirect Government control.2
The arguments against deducting the  208 from the Stage II paymentsi. The pay policy guidelines on staggered payments were concernedwith pre-policy agreements which anticipated future increases in thegoing rate for the job, not situations where the going rate had beenpromulgated but part of it withheld for a given period.    In the caseof the TSRB and DDRB groups, the salaries deemed appropriate werepromulgated in full and used for all relevant purposes includingpension settlement; no other group has been or is in the same position.ii. The rest of the private and public sector, including those in the top salaries group with rates in 1975 below  13, 000, will receive the 208 in addition to their proper 1975 rates of pay; it would be wrong to discriminate further against the top salaries group with salariesover  13, 000 in 1975 whose publicly accepted rate for the job hasbeen withheld.iii. If the  208 is deducted and so is not reckonable for pensions,those who retire in the present round will suffer a penalty for therest of their lives.iv. The DDRB would probably see a decision to deduct the  208 fromthe staged payments as contrary to their recommendations and wouldbe likely to treat this as a resigning issue.    The Government haspledged that it would implement DDRB recommendations &quot;unless therewere clear and compelling reasons not to do so&quot;.v. Two thousand of the 2, 500 persons affected are consultants.The doctors are already deeply suspicious over the delay in publishing the DDRB report which the Prime Minister received on18 April.    A decision to reduce the second stage of payments by the 203 would be extremely damaging to the Government&apos;s relations withthe medical profession and would be seen as in stark contrast to thePrime Minister&apos;s recent statement to them that he hoped to see animprovement in this relationship.    Industrial action could not be ruled out.vi. The higher judiciary have a legal right to the second stage TSRBpayment but have waived it.     This waiver will become spent whenthe Top Salary Groups receive the  208 increase but it is intended toask the judges to extend the waiver.    If the Stage II payment isabated by the  208 they may refuse to extend the waiver.    If the judges received their second stage it would be much more difficult tohold out against the other groups who have not received it.3
vii. A public row with the doctors and other groups will make thetask of managing a continuing pay policy more difficult.    If theGovernment were later to yield to pressure and give way lower-paid workers might think that the better off were getting away withsomething.    If it did not give way, the Government would have created an extra quarrel with the doctors and would make the paypolicy appear unduly theological and &quot;directed against differentials&quot; -ammunition for opponents of the policy.conclusion. I invite my colleagues to decide the question in the light of thepreceding arguments.    It is vital that a decision one way or another is taken before the DDRB report is published - and it must be published very soon -since questions about the treatment of the  208 are bound to be raised.S w department of Education and Science16 May 1977/4
