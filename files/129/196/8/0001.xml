DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 58COPY NO   . n23 May 1977 g gCABINETHOUSING POLICY GREEN PAPERTAX RELIEF ON MORTGAGE INTERESTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The treatment of tax relief on mortgage interest was left over whenthe Cabinet considered the draft Green Paper on 19 May.    I now attachparagraphs on this subject which have been agreed between the Secretary ofState for the Environment and myself.2. I should draw these paragraphs to the attention of my colleaguesbecause of their political as well as their other policy implications.3. Both the Party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) have argued thatmortgage interest relief should be limited to the basic rate of income tax.The Secretary of State for the Environment considers there is considerablesubstance in the common-sense view that mortgage tax relief has becomeanalogous to a subsidy with the ending of Schedule A tax in 1963 and of tax relief on most personal loans other than for housing in 1974.    In this situation it is very difficult for a Labour Government to justify the present arrangements for relief at higher tax rates which means that the better-offget more relief in proportion to the size of their loan.    The Secretary ofState therefore considers that a commitment to end tax relief at the higher rates on mortgage interest is necessary at the present time.    He believes that such a move - coupled with the possibility of giving local authorities aminimum rate of subsidy related to the basic rate of tax (paragraphs 5.32and 6.45 of Annex to CP(77) 50 refers) - will help to create a sense offairness in the treatment of both mortgagors and public sector tenants, and provide a realistic and defensible answer to criticism of the present tax relief arrangements.4. On the other hand large numbers of people would be affected bywithdrawl of higher rate relief for mortgage interest, and among them those affected most would be the younger family men buying a house with asubstantial mortgage at current prices.    Both in my recent Budget and aspart of the industrial strategy we have accepted that relief should be givento the middle and junior management group as circumstances allow.    Ageneral withdrawal of higher rate relief would appear to negate that.    In1977-78, even after the Budget reliefs, -  million taxpayers (ia. f million
households) benefit from higher rate relief on mortgage interest.    many more (especially younger men) no doubt expect to do so at some time in thefuture.    There is no longer any particular logic about the distinction in our system between a &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;higher&quot; rates of income tax, which is notnormal in other countries.    And our opponents could be relied on to make,and to go on making, as much political capital as possible out of a proposalto withdraw higher rate mortgage interest relief generally, over what wouldunavoidably be a protracted transitional period.5.        Against this background the Secretary of State and I have agreed on alimited proposal to withdraw relief in due course at rates over 50 per centonly.    This greatly reduces the numbers affected (to about 165, 000 in!977-78), though even this proposal would affect married men with mortgagesat income levels down to about  10, 000 a year.    I think it is essentialhowever to link the proposal in a broad way with further progress on tax relief and to assurances about transitional arrangements.    This will alsohelp to prevent uncertainty in the housing market, with the associated risks to employment.    Above all, it is necessary to make it clear that we do not intend to carry the process of limiting mortgage interest relief further.It will certainly be said that we do.    The paragraphs are drafted accordinglyand I recommend them on that basis.D treasury Chambers^3 May 19772
AnnexHome Ownership5.26   The Government believe that the relief for mortgage interest,which has a long history as part of the tax structure, should con-tinue as a permanent feature making a major contribution to theGovernment&apos;s policy for home ownership.    Its continuance is partof a housing strategy which is firmly based on widening access to home ownership and it is particularly valuable to young people andothers embarking on home ownership for the first time as well as tothose who may change their homes because of a growing family or anew job.5.27   The Government do not believe however that mortgage interest-relief should continue indefinitely to be available at the highestrates of tax.    Steps have already been taken to limit relief whereit is mainly relevant to the highest incomes by limiting to 25,000 the amount of a loan which can qualify and by excludingMortgages on second homes from relief.    The  25,000 ceiling will bekept under review in the light of the movement of house prices.Action to limit mortgage interest relief at the highest rates wouldbe part of the same policy of operating the relief more fairly.    Inmaking any change here however the Government must take account of commitments into which people have already entered; of the need toavoid disruption of the housing market; and of the total weight oftaxation,&apos; especially on earned incomes, at these levels.5-28   Against this background the Government take the view thatmortgage interest relief should in due course be withdrawn at ratesabove 50 per cent but that withdrawal should not extend to rates of50 per cent and below.    This means that those eligible for mortgageinterest relief at rates not exceeding 50 per cent, who representa large majority of mortgagors    benefitting at higher rates, wouldnot. be affected in any way.    There will be a period of notice of six years as in earlier limitations of interest relief.    As/weight of .
C 0 N F I D E N T I A LAnnexweight of taxation, the Government have made it clear that they regard the burden of income taxation as too heavy across thewhole spectrum of income levels.    As opportunity offers, they intend to continue the process begun in the 1977 Budget, ofprogressively reducing the income tax burden at all levels, butthis will take time.    As this process continues    (and alsointerest rates fall)    the value of mortgage interest reliefall levels, but especially at the highest rates, will declinasat
