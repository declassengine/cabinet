DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS government cp(71) 43 COPY NO6229 March 1971CABINETSELECTION OF TOPICS FOR PROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND review memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. On 5 January 1971, the Cabinet invited the Lord Privy Seal toarrange for the introduction of a programme analysis and review (PAR)system on the selective basis proposed in bis memorandum (CP(70) 124and CM(7l) 1st Conclusions, Minute 9).    My colleagues will wish to seethe list of topics now proposed for PAR review in 1971 in accordance withthat decision.THE SELECTION OF TOPICS2.        Annex A sets out the list of programmes for review agreed inbilateral discussions between the Departments concerned and the Treasury.The Director of the PAR project in the Civil Service Department and theCentral Policy Pveview Staff have been closely associated with thediscussions, and agree with the selection.3. There were several limitations on the selection of topicson which submissions will be made this autumn.    An exceptionalnumber of major special studies or reviews, which might otherwise have been suitable for PAR, are already in progress at the requestof Ministers.    Annex B lists some of the major reviews of this type.Other topics were ruled out because it was considered that it would notbe possible to carry the analysis even to the stage of an interim report before the end of the year.    Finally, there was no point in selecting thetopics suggested for seview by the Central Policy Review Staff - CP(7l) 44.4. Nevertheless I think that the 11 programmes suggested will providea useful start in this first experimental year of PAR,    The reviews should both provide Departments with worthwhile experience of developing this type of analysis and be useful to Ministers in considering the particularprogrammes.DISCLOSURE5. Departments may well be asked by the Select Committee on expenditure to say what programmes they have selected for review;indeed we may be asked to publish the complete listt    Despite the obvious
attraction of so doing, I believe it would be wrong,    In some casesdisclosure of the subject could of itself be embarrassing,,    In other cases it could arouse false expectations! the nature of many of thereviews will be such that they will not be suitable for publication? orwill not lead to the type of decision which could be announced,6.        I suggests therefore, that we take the line that PAR is part ofthe process of policy review within Government; ard that it is the normal practice neither to reveal on demand whether a subject is under review inGovernment nor, if the existence of a review is made known, to reveal the exact scope and procedure of it.    A Department can, of course, say thata subject is under review if it wishes to do so.    But it would be better that they should not say whether the review was part of the PAR process,since to do so would increase the difficulties of other Departments who could not disclose their PAR subject (eg on political grounds),conclusion.        I accordingly invite Cabineti. To note with approval the proposed list of programmes forPAR in 1971.ii. To agree that the list should neither be published norrevealed in whole or in part to the Select Committee on expenditure.M V treasury Chambers 3WI29 March 1971
ANNEX a proposed LIST OP PROGRAMMES FOR review in 1971MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND food.    Lime and Fertiliser Subsidies --  45 million the aim of these subsidies is to encourage farmers to use lime and certainfertiliser for the improvement of the fertility of the soil.   They form a selfcontained area for review, not directly dependent on the general review ofagricultural support.   The review would be useful whatever the outcome of the eec negotiations.MINISTRY OF defence.    Service Manpower *The availability of manpower seems likely to be a major factor affecting our ability to carry out our defence commitments in the rest of this decade.   Futuremanpower prospects, demographic trends, recruitment, conditions of service,utilisation of manpower and retention will accordingly be analysed in depth-3.    Reinforcement capability^The reinforcement forces, and the resources required for their movement, representa major area of defence effort.   The review will cover the future reinforcementtasks in the NATO area and elsewhere, and the resources required for different levels of reinforcement capability.DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE4.    Higher Education ( 500 million)Expenditure on this, ie all education above advanced level in GCE, is increasingrapidly, but is susceptible to a wide range of policy options.   Major decisionsconcerning the provision for Universities up to 1977 are required by autumn ofthis year it is important that they should be taken in the light of the review of policy towards higher education as a whole in the medium and longer term.DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT   -     ^ -5.    Employment Services ( 50 million)This review will cover the department&apos;s policies and services for employment,;training, the mobility of labour and the treatment of redundancy; and possiblechanges in organisation.   The review has already begun under the chairmanship ofthe Minister of State with a view to a Government statement in the early autumn.DEPARTMENT OF THE EHVIBOHMEMT.6.    Subsidies to Public Transport outside towns ( 30 mil.lion)At present the majority of the subsidies are for unremunerative rail services, butgrants to bus services are likely to grow over the next few years.   The reviewwill look at how far the. expenditure does meet social and economic needs and atthe alternatives available in the next 5 to 10 years.*These reviews cut across normal expenditure classifications, and correspondingexpenditure figures are not readily available.1
New Towns in Great Britain ( 100 million)New Towns have been established to serve a variety of objectives.   The reviewwill consider these objectives and the extent to which they are being met, the contribution of public expenditure to them and the scope for increased involve-ment by private enterprise.FOREIGN AND COMDNWEALTH OFFICE (OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION)8.    Technical Assistance ( 50 million)The aid programme includes a wide range of technical assistance to developing countries.   While there has been general agreement on giving high priority tothis form of aid, the review will consider possible changes in emphasis and inthe balance between technical and capital aid, and also the cost in managementresources.(See also 11 below)DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SECURITY9*    Health and Personal Social Services for the Elderly ( 350 million)A wide range of services is provided by various agencies for the elderly, whether in institutions or in the community.   As a result there is a possibility of over-laps or gaps between them.   The review will take account of the relevant aspectsof housing policy and the relationship between benefits in kind and cash benefits.HOME OFFICE10.   Treatment of Offenders ( 80 million)The facilities for treating convicted offenders (prisons, boratals, probationand after-care) have not been keeping pace with the increase in the number of offenders.   Expenditure is likely to increase substantially over the next decade.The review will examine the possible future requirement for, and alternativepatterns of, these facilities.DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (WITH THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE)11.   Promotion of Visible Exports ( 40 million)This review will cover the activities primarily directed towards the promotion ofvisible exports.   These include those provided directly by two departments, those provided by the COI and BBC on their behalf and the complementary activities ofother departments concerned with particular industries.SCOTTISH office/ELSH OFFICEIt is not proposed that these departments should produce specifically Scottish orWelsh reviews this year.   They will however be taking part in those revie?/s wherethey have responsibility for the policies in their countries.   The scottish office will be associated with the review of lime and fertiliser subsidies,Higher education, treatment of offenders, public transport outside towns, new towns and services for the elderly.   The Welsh Office will be associated withthe last three of these.
