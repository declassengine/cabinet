DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government if&apos;- - &apos; fi\CP(71) 36 COPY NO22 March 1971CABINETDATE OF RENT INCREASES UNDER THE REFORM of housing finance memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment, On 29 October the Cabinet approved proposals for the reform of housing finance in CP(70) 95 on the basis that the resultant rent increases in the public sector should be limited to an average of 50p a week with amaximum of 75 p a week for any one dwelling (CM(70) 34th Conclusions,Minute 9).2. The necessary Bills can hardly be enacted before June or July 1972,In view of the required statutory notice, this means that we could not compellocal authorities to put up their rents before October 1972.    This would reduce prospective public expenditure savings in England and Wales by 60 million in 1972-73,  55 million in 1973-74,  45 million in 1974-75, 35 million in 1975-76 and reducing amounts thereafter.    The localauthorities would, of course, like us to do this but it is plainly unacceptablefrom our point of view830 The local authorities are, in any case, reluctant for understandableelectoral reasons to bring in rent increases in April every year ie just before the local elections.4,        I have been seeking for a solution which would enable CentralGovernment to achieve the full savings we have in mind throughout andwhich would avoid bringing in rent increases in April for those authorities who prefer October0    In agreement with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, I now recommend the following formulas-hi so far as fair rent levels permit every authority would berequired to raise its rents by  1 in October 1972 unless it had previously raised its rents by the required amount in October 1971or April 1972,    Thus a co-operative authority which preferredOctober increases and had raised its rents by 25p in October 1971v/ould only have to bring in a further increase of 50p in October 1972cA co-operative authority which preferred April increases and had raised rents by 50p in April 1972 would need to make no further increase in October,    An unco-operative authority, however, wouldhave to raise its rents by  1 in October 1972,
5. Our enquiries suggest that most local authorities in England andWales would be likely to co^operate0    Even those who would like to embarrass us would not normally do so by imposing on their tenantslarger increases than would otherwise be necessary,,    The Secretaryof State for Scotland foresees that many Scottish authorities would for political reasons delay raising rents and would then maintain publicly that rent increases in excess of 50p a week had been forced on them bythe Government,    The new proposals would then necessitate some localauthorities raising their average rents by  1 per week (and consequentlycertain individual rents by more than this)0    This would expose theGovernment to the accusation that the new system in Scotland was beginning with unreasonably large rent increases; and it could have serious cost ofliving implications for 1972-73 in Scotland,,6. The matter has been discussed by the Home Affairs Committee but,in view of the Secretary of State for Scotland!s dissenting opinion, and thefact that my proposal involves a change in the decision taken by theCabinet last October, I have been asked to bring the matter back to cabinet.7.        I invite the Cabinet to agree that rent increases under the reform of housing finance should be governed by the formula summarised inparagraph 4 of this memorandum.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury,agrees with this recommendation,P w department of the Environment 3W122 March 19712
