PART I.   GENERALChanges in the system of support . This year&apos;s Annual Review has been held on the threshold of significantchanges in the system of agricultural support and at a time when the industry has experienced unprecedented cost increases. Developments over the past two decades have made the time ripe for modifications in our support system and each move forward will mean changes in the Annual Review system aswe know it to-day. The Government^ declared aim is to adapt the presentsystem of agricultural support to one relying increasingly on import levyarrangements, under which the farmer will get his return increasingly fromthe market. Accession to the European Economic Community would, ofcourse, lead to our adoption of the Community&apos;s agricultural policy and methods of support.2. On 27th October 1970, the Government announced their intention tointroduce as soon as possible interim levy schemes in respect of beef and veal,of mutton and lamb and of milk products other than butter and cheese and tomodify the existing scheme for cereals. Consultations on the details of these schemes have now reached an advanced stage and a full announcement on them will be made as soon as possible.3. The cost changes which have taken place in the past year have arisenpartly from increases in domestic farm costs and partly from an exceptionalrise in the price of imported cereals. Market prices of other commodities havealso risen but not so steeply. These higher prices have reduced the cost of deficiency payments to the Exchequer. The interim levy schemes on livestock products and cereals are aimed at maintaining prices at around recent levels and so providing a continuing limitation on Exchequer cost. The levy schemefor milk products will increase the returns from the sale of milk for manufacture.In addition, the existing minimum import price scheme for eggs will help tomaintain a reasonable level of market prices for egg producers.Condition of the industry. Production in 1970/71 is higher than in 1969/70. Aggregate net incomecontinues to show a rising trend in money terms though some decline in real terms. When account is taken of the continuing fall in the total number of farms, however, there does not appear to have been a corresponding declinein real net income per farm, taking the industry as a whole. Net costs have risen since the last Review by  217 million for all products and for produce to which the guaranteed prices apply and therefore coming within the provisionsof the Agriculture Act, 1957 by  141 million. These are by far the largestcost increases that have been recorded for the purposes of an Annual Review.They include the cost increases in respect of milk and eggs produced within thestandard quantities, but not in respect of those commodities outside the standard quantities.
Aim of the Government5. In this exceptional situation, it is important to maintain a rising trend infarm efficiency and to avoid a setback to the confidence of the industry. Arising trend in production is also of particular importance in connection with possible entry into the e.c..6. The Government&apos;s intentions were indicated in the special measures takenlast October to increase the guarantees. It is now necessary to make sure thatagriculture can prepare with confidence for the future when individual farmerswill have greater scope to make their own decisions and when the market willincreasingly provide their return. The Government have decided that theright course is to make determinations which will, generally speaking, maintainthe existing balance of agricultural production and will, taking into account the october adjustments, meet the increased costs on most of the major guaranteedcommodities fully. With costs covered in this way, gains secured from greater productivity will all be available to the industry.7. The Governments policy on eggs is to continue to move to a free market.In line with this policy the deficiency payments are to be phased out and therestrictions on exports, introduced in 1957, have already been removed. Itwould be inconsistent with the policy to recoup the increased costs of eggproduction through the guaranteed price, but the minimum import price scheme will continue as a help to the maintenance of a reasonable level of market prices.The Government intend to raise the level of minimum import prices significantlyand expect shortly to conclude discussions with overseas suppliers on thismatter.8. Production of sheep, alone of the major commodities, has continued to decline. Falling flock numbers are reducing the potential to produce mutton and lamb in the United Kingdom in the future. The Government have decidedthat sheep production merits special attention on this occasion.9. Over a period of years the agricultural industry has offset a large part ofits cost increases out of its rising productivity. But the exceptional cost increases taken into account in this Review, arising partly from higher importcosts, are such that they cannot be met without either an increase in consumerprices or an increased Exchequer liability for direct support. The determinationsnow made involve a combination of the two. The interim levy schemes should help to contain the Exchequer liability, but they cannot eliminate it in the nearfuture.The measures proposed10. The determinations set out below give in each case the changes since the1970 Annual Review, so that the changes shown include the adjustments madein October 1970.11. On crops the determinations are as follows:Wheat the guaranteed price, including the October adjustment, will be 1-63 per cwt., an increase of about 12p;
Barley the guaranteed price, including the October adjustment, will be 145 per cwt., an increase of lOp;Oats the guaranteed price will be  1-44 per cwt., an increase of about 5p;Rye the guaranteed price will be unchanged at  1-08 per cwt.;Potatoes the guaranteed price will be  16-55 per ton, an increase of 67 p;Sugar beet the guaranteed price, including the October adjustment, willbe  7-60 per ton, an increase of 77 p.12. These determinations will provide for rather more than full recoupmentin the arable sector generally and for wheat and barley specifically. Theincreased costs on sugar beet will be fully recouped. Potatoes are currently in heavy surplus and demand can be fully met from a reducing acreage giventhe trend of increasing yield; full cost recoupment is therefore inappropriate.13. The determinations for the livestock sector are as follows:Fat cattle the guaranteed price, including the October adjustment, willbe  12-35 per cwt., an increase of  1-22-1;Fat sheep the guaranteed price, including the October adjustment, willbe 22-3p per lb., an increase of about 2-8p;Wool the guaranteed price will be 22-7p per lb., an increase of about -5p;Hill sheep subsidy exclusive of winter keep supplement which will be15p, the higher rate will be  1-50 per eligible ewe, an increase of 45p,and the lower rate 95p, an increase of 42-J-p; this slightly more thanmaintains the October adjustment;Fat pigs the guaranteed price will be  2-93 per score, an increase ofabout 7p in addition to the automatic adjustment on account of feedcost increases; the middle band of the flexible guarantee (i.e. the number of pigsto which the automatic adjustment is geared) will be 13-35-14-75 millioncertifications, an increase of 450,000; this maintains the higher levelestablished by the October adjustment;Milk the guaranteed price, including the October adjustment, will be22-lp per gallon, an increase of about 2-5p; the standard quantity will be 2,122-6 million gallons, a reduction of53 million gallons;Hen eggs the guaranteed price will be 16-5p per dozen, an effectivereduction of about 0-5p;Duck eggs the guaranteed price will be 15-5p per dozen; the effect willbe to eliminate deficiency payments.14. The determination on fat cattle represents more than cost recoupmentand the higher brucellosis incentives mentioned in paragraph 18 below will beof benefit to the cattle sector generally. The determinations also representsubstantially more than recoupment in the sheep sector (i.e. sheep and wooltaken together). This should encourage the adoption of modem methods oflowland sheep production in competitive and well-balanced farming systems
and provide an expanding outlet for store and breeding sheep from the hillsand uplands. The increase in the end-price for pigs provides virtual costrecoupment and in addition the October increase in the level of the middle bandhas been maintained. No further change has been made in the middle band,but the Government will review this decision later in the year if circumstancesmake this appropriate. Bacon stabilisation arrangements will continue toprovide support for the bacon curing industry and thus indirectly for pigproducers.15. When the interim levy schemes for beef and veal and for mutton and lamb are introduced, the present guarantee arrangements for fat cattle and fatsheep will be altered for the remainder of 1971/72 in the manner described inparagraphs 47 and 49 below. The Government will keep a careful watch onthe effect of these interim schemes on the market during the coming year.Discussions on the operation of the schemes with the Farmers&apos; Unions willcontinue.16. Although the cost increases for produce to which the guaranteed pricesapply only cover the production of milk within the standard quantity, increases have also occurred in respect of production outside the standard quantity and,in making the determination, the Government have taken account of this.The return to milk producers comprises two main elements, the guaranteed price for the standard quantity which is financed by the consumer of liquid milk and the price received for milk sold for manufacture outside the standard quantity. Experience in past years has shown that the benefit to the industryexpected from an increase in the guaranteed price may be eroded by the lowreturn from the manufacturing market. Firm markets for butter and cheeseand the introduction of interim levy arrangements for milk products otherthan butter and cheese are expected to maintain and strengthen the price tobe expected for manufacturing milk and so help to establish a better pricerelationship between milk for liquid consumption and milk sold for use inother forms. The consumption of liquid milk is expected to fall, however,partly because of the withdrawal of subsidies for welfare and school milk,and the standard quantity, to which the guaranteed price applies, has to be adjusted in consequence. The increase in the &quot;pool&quot; price from a strongermarket for milk for manufacture is expected to outweigh the effect of thereduction in the standard quantity. The raising of the guaranteed price by-5p more than covers the cost increases relating to production of the standard quantity, and having regard to the effects of the other considerations on the pool price, the increased costs on total milk production will be substantiallyrecouped. It is proposed that the method of supporting milk production,including the standard quantity system, should be reconsidered in the nearfuture as part of the changeover to levy arrangements.17. Further details of the changes in the guarantees are given in Part III.It should be noted that the autumn price adjustments effectively increased theprices to producers of milk, fat cattle and fat sheep by approximately double therates of increase in the guaranteed price. Thus the seasonal price scales for1971/72 reflecting the current increases in guaranteed prices will show increasesover the last half of 1970/71 but not to the full extent of the increases now madein the guaranteed prices.
18. In addition to the changes in the commodity guarantees, further steps are to be taken towards the eradication of brucellosis. The new incentivesscheme, introduced eight months ago, has already attracted over 15,000applications and over 80 per cent of accredited herd owners have opted for theincentives in preference to compensation terms. This clear-cut response willassure the industry of sufficient accredited replacements by the autumn to makearea eradication possible on a worth-while scale. The Government now propose to offer substantially higher &quot;clean animal&quot; incentives of 0-8p per gallon for milk and  5 for each qualifying beef animal, so that the voluntaryscheme can accommodate not only the clean and relatively clean herds but alsoothers that are not heavily infected. Incentives at these higher rates, but forshorter periods, will also be a prominent feature of the arrangements for areaeradication, details of which are being announced separately.19. After the 1970 Annual Review, the last Government raised the rates of subsidy on fertilisers and lime for one year from 19th March 1970. It wasthen described as a one-year increase designed as a special measure to replenishthe industry&apos;s resources. The period of the increase has now come to an end and the subsidies will revert to their previous levels.20. The cost of the guarantees for milk and sugar beet is borne by theconsumer. It is proposed that the maximum retail prices of milk should go up by ip per pint at the beginning of luly. The higher guarantees for all theother commodities fall to be met from public funds. They involve an increasedExchequer commitment for 1971/72 of nearly  47 million in addition to theprovision in the Estimates which already allows for the continuation of thehigher guarantee levels announced in October 1970.PART II. ECONOMIC CONDITION AND PROSPECTS OF THEAGRICULTURAL INDUSTRYOutput (Table 13)21. Gross output at constant prices is expected to increase by about 3 percent in 1970/71 compared with 1969/70. The index of net product (formerlythe index of net output) is forecast at 110 for 1970/71, compared with 106 for1969/70 (average of 1964/65-1966/67 = 100). Greater output of wheat,potatoes, beef, pigmeat and horticultural products is expected to exceed areduction in the output of barley and increased purchases of feedingstuffs and fertilisers.Labour productivity (Tables 13 and 14)22. The number of regular whole-time workers is estimated to have been falling by about 5 per cent a year since 1967 compared with a rate of 6-7 percent from 1964 to 1966. The latest estimates indicate an average increase in labour productivity of 6 per cent a year over the period 1964/65 to 1970/71.Costs (Table 17)23. The net increase in costs since the last Review is estimated at some 217 million on total production and about  141 million on guaranteedproduction. About a third of the total is accounted for by higher feedingstuffsprices. Machinery, labour and fertilisers and lime also show large increases.
Income (Tables 12, 13 and 16)24. The industry&apos;s aggregate net income, which includes the increase invaluations of crops and livestock, recovered in 1969/70 after a fall in the previous year. At  574 million it shows an increase over 1968/69 of  79 million. For1970/71 aggregate net income, which was sustained by the increases in the guarantees announced in October 1970, is forecast to be  589 million, anincrease of  15 million. This would have been greater but for the bad weather in the spring of 1970 which delayed sowings of the 1970 cereal crop. Whenadjusted on the assumption that weather had been normal, income shows anincrease of  34 million, from  566 million in 1969/70 to  600 million in 1970/71.There has however been some decline in aggregate net income in real terms.25. Farm accounts data for the year ended about mid-February 1970 (whichare thus less up to date than the aggregate data) show moderate increases in incomes on dairy farms and a sharp rise in incomes on cropping farms, whichrecovered nearly all of their fall in 1968/69. The increase in incomes oncropping farms benefited mainly central, southern and eastern England, whereincomes rose substantially. In Wales, and also in northern England, therewere small falls in income, due to the poor results on livestock farms. Insouth-western England, Scotland and Northern Ireland there were small increases in average income overall. In Scotland the variation between different types of farm was broadly similar to England and Wales, but the fall in averageincomes on hill and upland farms was substantial.Investment (Table 15)26. Total gross capital formation in agriculture is estimated at about  338million in 1970. This comprises new buildings and works, plant, machinery and vehicles, and stocks (mainly growing crops and cultivations and livestock).Investment in buildings and works at  106 million was higher than in 1969 and investment in plant, machinery and vehicles at  116 million was at about thesame level. Investment in stocks increased by some  116 million, almost all of which represented the higher cost of maintaining existing levels of physicalinvestment in crops and livestock.Cost of agricultural support (Tables 18 and 19)27. The cost to public funds of agricultural support in 1970/71 is now expected to be some  269 million. This is about  8 million less than theoutturn for 1969/70 and substantially less than the estimate for 1970/71 asadjusted to take account of the determinations made after the 1970 Review.The saving is mainly the result of higher market prices, particularly for cereals,partly offset by the higher guaranteed prices introduced in October 1970.The estimate for 1971/72 made before this Review and therefore taking no account of the determinations announced in this White Paper shows an increase to  297 million, the main increases being for pigs and cereals. The cost of the bacon stabilisation arrangements is not included in these figures, but it isestimated at  22 million for 1970/71 and  151 million for 1971/72.Commodity trends (Tables 1, 2, 5-11)28. Cereals. Because of unfavourable spring-sowing conditions the cerealsacreage harvested in 1970 was only marginally higher than the low level of
1969. Although wheat yields were above average, barley yields were seriously affected by adverse sowing conditions and foliar disease and were low. total production of cereals was less than in 1969/70 by about   million tons. A muchbigger acreage had however already been sown to winter wheat by December1970 than at the same time the previous year and the total cereals acreage forthe 1971 harvest is expected to be restored to about the 1967 level.29. Potatoes. The United Kingdom target acreage was fixed at 650,000acres for 1969 and 1970. In 1969 the area planted was 36,000 acres belowthe target, and there was a marginal shortage which resulted in high prices in the early part of 1970. The 1970 plantings, at 669,000 acres, were above the target and yields were very high, with the result that the crop was much greaterthan the requirement for human consumption. Prices have consequently beenweak and market support operations had to be introduced in October 1970.The target for 1971 has been set at 640,000 acres. Given yields closer to thelong-term trend, this should meet home demand for main crop potatoes withoutproducing an excessive surplus.30. Sugar beet. Consumption of sugar is static and committed suppliesunder the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and from home production meetvirtually the whole of domestic sugar consumption.31. Beef. Between June 1969 and June 1970 the beef herd expanded morethan in any previous year. A further increase is expected by June 1971. the dairy herd, which continues to provide about two-thirds of the calves for beef,has declined marginally. Taken as a whole the total cattle breeding herd has again increased. Home-fed supplies of beef and veal in 1970/71 are expectedto be a little higher than in 1969/70, but imports are likely to be much lowerand total supplies are expected to be slightly less. The increases in the beefbreeding herd and in the level of calf retentions should sustain further expansion in home-fed supplies.32. Sheep. In the year to December 1970 the sheep breeding flock againfell but by less than in the preceding year. Once again the decline has mainlybeen in the lowlands; there have been small increases in a few predominantlyhill counties. The lambing season in 1970 was considerably better than in1969 due to good weather. Despite the continuing decline in the breedingflock, home-fed supplies of mutton and lamb in 1970/71 are expected to be higher than in 1969/70, but because of a drop in imports total supplies areexpected to decline.33. Pigs. After being relatively stable between December 1968 and March1970 the breeding herd has since expanded substantially. In the year toDecember 1970 it increased by 7 per cent, which implies a consequential increasein the output of pigmeat in the coming fatstock year. The upward trend inthe breeding herd is expected to continue. Bacon production is expected tobe about 256,000 tons in 1970/71, 10 per cent above the level for 1969/70. Thelevel of production provided for the home industry under the Bacon MarketSharing Understanding in 1971/72 is 265,000 tons. Supplies of pigmeat forpork and manufacture in 1970/71 are expected to be about the same as in theprevious year.34. Milk. Culling in the dairy herd was relatively high in 1969/70 and dairycow numbers showed a marginal fall in the year to June 1970.  No significant
change in numbers is expected by June 1971. The small fall in numbers hasbeen more than offset by an increase in yields and total sales of milk off farmsin 1970/71 are forecast to be higher than in 1969/70.35. Eggs. Output in 1970/71 is expected to be about the same as last year.PART III.   THE DETERMINATIONS FOR 1971/7236.

These figures and thosein column (4) have been rounded as necessary.38. The increases in the 1970/71 guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep and milk announced in October 1970 had to be concentrated into the second half of the guarantee year. The effective increases to producers for this periodhave therefore been approximately double the increases shown for these com-modities in column (3) of the table above as compared with column (2).  The
increases on wheat, barley and sugar beet applied to the whole of the 1970crops and that on the hill sheep subsidy to all animals qualifying in the 1970Scheme year.39. In accordance with the provisions of the Agriculture Act, 1957 thedeterminations for 1971/72 have been related to the determinations for 1970/71made after the 1970 Annual Review, ignoring any later variation. The changesshown in column (4) are therefore the difference between columns (2) and (5).40. For 1971/72 the basis of the commodity guarantees and the rates andconditions of payment for the relevant production grants will be the same as for 1970/71, except where indicated in the table above or in the following paragraphs.Cereals41. The target indicator prices for wheat and barley are being retained andwill be determined for the 1971 crop at a later stage, in the light of decisions onthe future levels of minimum import prices.42. From 1971/72 on deficiency payments on wheat and rye (at present paid on a tonnage basis) will be paid on the basis of acreage harvested or availablefor harvesting.43. No storage incentive arrangement for wheat and barley will be operated by the Agricultural Departments in 1971/72.Sugar beet44. The maximum acreage to which the guarantee will apply will be 443,000acres for both the 1971 crop and the 1972 crop.Fatstock general45. Guarantee payments for fatstock are made weekly by reference tostandard prices. For cattle and sheep these arrangements should normallymean that, on average, producers receive exactly the guaranteed price for theyear though for pigs the calculation of deficiency payments involves someestimation so that producers&apos; average returns may differ slightly from the guaranteed price. In each case, however, producers&apos; average returns includingdeficiency payments from sales of eligible stock may exceed the guaranteed price for the year, if market prices go higher than the standard prices in some weeks and in others deficiency payments are made. For cattle and sheep this may also happen when marketings and prices differ from those forecast whenthe scales of standard prices and of abatements and supplements are prepared.Fat cattle46. The graduated deficiency payments scheme will continue to operate inits present form until new levy arrangements (paragraph 47) are introduced.With effect from 29th March 1971, a new scale of weekly standard prices willas usual be introduced and the scale of abatements and supplements will be adjusted to take account of the expected market situation for the year. Thenew scales are being published separately.
47. It is proposed to modify the present guarantee arrangements in thefollowing ways when Orders are made to provide for minimum import prices and supporting levies on beef and veal:(a) The present graduated deficiency payments scheme will be ended.Any deficiency in producers&apos; average returns compared with theweighted average of the weekly standard prices up to that time willbe paid on stock certified before the introduction of the new arrange-ments.(b) The scale of weekly standard prices will be retained in the new scheme.Target indicator prices linked to the level of minimum import prices will also be introduced and a scale of weekly target indicator prices will be determined at a fixed amount below the standard prices.If the average market price realised should fall short of the targetindicator price for a week, the deficiency payment would then besubject to a corresponding reduction.(c) Any end-of-year payment will be subject to reduction by reference toany amount by which the average market price realised for the yearfalls short of the annual average of the target indicator prices, asweighted by weekly certifications. For 1971/72 the calculation willrelate only to that part of the guarantee year for which the new arrangements are operative.Further details of the new arrangements will be published later.Fat sheep48. The graduated deficiency payments scheme will continue to operate inits present form until new levy arrangements (paragraph 49) are introduced.With effect from 29th March 1971, a new scale of weekly standard prices willas usual be introduced and the scale of abatements and supplements will be adjusted to take account of the expected market situation for the year. Thenew scales are being published separately.49. It is proposed to modify the present guarantee arrangements in thefollowing ways when an Order is made providing for customs duties on importsof mutton and lamb:(a) The present graduated deficiency payments scheme will be ended.Any deficiency in producers&apos; average returns compared with theweighted average of the weekly standard prices up to that time willbe paid on stock certified before the introduction of the new arrange-ments.(b) The scale of weekly standard prices will be retained in the new schemeand a scale of weekly estimated prices established at a fixed amountbelow the standard prices, reflecting the seasonal pattern of market prices. If the average market price realised should fall short of theestimated price established for a week by more than ljp per lb.estimated dressed carcase weight, the deficiency payment would thenbe subject to a corresponding reduction, up to a maximum reductionof l p per lb. edcw.
(c) Any end-of-year payment will be subject to reduction by reference toany amount by which the average market price realised for the yearfalls short of the annual average of the estimated prices, as weightedby weekly certifications. For 1971/72 the calculation will relate tothat part of the guarantee year for which the new arrangements areoperative.Further details of the new arrangements will be published later.50. The special provision for reductions in abatements on light lambs and(for weeks 15-40) light sheep will continue, with the maximum reductions inthe abatements being 0-8p, 0-6p, 0-4p and 0-2p per lb. edcw for animals of38 lb. and under, 39 lb., 40 lb. and 41 lb. edcw respectively. It is proposed that under the new arrangements described in paragraph 49 above, any reductionin the weekly deficiency payment should be 0-8p, 0-6p, 0-4p and 0-2p per lb. edcwless for animals of 38 lb. and under, 39 lb., 40 lb. and 41 lb. edcw respectively;or, if the reduction in the deficiency payment should be smaller than any oneor more of these amounts, there should be no reduction for animals in theappropriate categories.Fat pigs51. The middle band under the flexible guarantee was determined after the1970 Annual Review at 12-9-14-3 million certifications and raised to 13-35-14-75 million certifications in October 1970. With effect from 29th March 1971the flexible guarantee scale will be as follows:Forecast level Adjustment to theof certifications basic guaranteed price12-45 million or more but less than 12-75 million +14P12-75    ,,         ,,     ,,       ,, 13-05 ,,                  +9P13-05                ,,     ,, 13-35 ,,                   +4P13-35     ,,          ,,     ,,       ,, 14-75 ,,       Basic guaranteed price14-75    ,,         ,,             ,, 15-05 -4p15-05 15-35 -9p15-35    ,,         ,,     ,,       ,, 15-65 -14pThere will be a further adjustment of 5p for each complete 0-3 million or part thereof by which the forecast level of certifications falls below 12-45 million orexceeds 15-65 million.52. The feed price of  2-20 per cwt. to which the new guaranteed price is related is deemed to be equivalent to 1,000 points on an index representing theprice of a feed ration. For every movement of 6-1 points from 1,000 points(equivalent to about l-33p per cwt.), the guaranteed price will be adjusted bylp per score.Milk53. The final figures for the standard quantities for each area in 1970/71 are set out in the table below. The standard quantities for 1971/72 are also shown(separate provisional and final standard quantitites will not be calculated for1971/72).

New guarantee arrangements are being introduced for 1971/72 as theBritish Egg Marketing Board will cease trading at the end of March 1971.It is accordingly proposed that the guaranteed prices should be guaranteedproducer prices instead of prices guaranteed to the Board, and that theindicator prices should be replaced by estimated producer prices which forhen eggs would be at the level of the previous indicator price. This is 15-5p(3s. l-2d.) per dozen and the same figure would be the estimated producer price for duck eggs. The basic rates of subsidy would then be the differences betweenthe guaranteed prices and the estimated producer prices. In order to put the1970/71 guaranteed prices on to the new basis exactly, the basic rates of subsidy applying for 1970/71 have to be added to these estimated producer prices:thus the guaranteed price for hen eggs in 1970/71 would be 3s. 4-84d. (17-0p)per dozen on the new basis and the guaranteed price for duck eggs 3s. l-96d.(15-8p) per dozen.55. It is proposed that for 1971/72 there should again be a standard quantity for hen eggs with an upper limit of 651 million dozen, but that the lower limitintroduced last year to stabilise the Board&apos;s trading position should be discontinued.56. The Agriculture Act, 1970 provides for a levy to be raised by the EggsAuthority and deducted from the subsidy payments. The rate of levy will be specified by Order. It will be deducted at a flat rate before payment of thesubsidy to producers.57. It is proposed that payments to producers should be made through the agency of registered egg packing stations.Production grants58. The guarantee levels shown in columns (2) and (3) of the table inparagraph 36 relate to the 1970 Scheme years and those in column (5) to the1971 Scheme years for the hill sheep subsidy and the supplement for beefherds under the brucellosis incentives scheme.59. Brucellosis incentives scheme. It is proposed that the increases in the premium on milk from accredited dairy herds and in the supplements to the hill cow and beef cow subsidies for accredited beef herds should take effect
from 1st April 1971 and in addition, that the present minimum 5 year guaranteeperiod under the voluntary accreditation scheme should be modified so as to run for 5 years from the date of accreditation or until 31st March 1976, which-ever is later.60. It is proposed that herds subject to compulsory eradication should be eligible for incentives at the same rates as those qualifying under the voluntaryscheme, but that the incentives should be payable only from the commencementof testing to one year after accreditation. In Northern Ireland, where eradica-tion is virtually complete, the incentives would be payable until 31st March1973, or for two years from accreditation, whichever is later.61. The cost of the incentives forms part of the value of the guarantees, but other financial arrangements for compulsory eradication do not. Details ofthe arrangements for compulsory eradication are being published separately.62. Beef cow subsidy. It is proposed that, with effect from the 1971 Schemeyear, payment of subsidy in England and Wales and Northern Ireland should no longer be limited to a stocking rate of one eligible cow to two acres of grassand forage crops.63. Fertiliser and lime subsidies. The special one-year increase in the ratesof subsidy on fertilisers and lime announced after the 1970 Annual Review will cease on 19th March 1971 and the rates will revert to their previous levels fordeliveries on or after that date.64. Other production grants. As already announced the Market Develop-ment Scheme will not be renewed when the present extension period runs outon 31st March 1971. Grants on working capital under the Agricultural and horticultural Co-operation Scheme will be terminated as from 1st April 1971.Grants to Rabbit Clearance Societies will cease at the end of the current season.The Farm Business Recording Scheme will not be extended when it expiresand no further applications for entry into the Scheme will be accepted after14th May 1972.

(a) Up to 1969 the figures for Great Britain relate to agricultural holdings exceeding one acre in extent, but inJune 1968 about 47,000 holdings were excluded from the census in England and Wales on the grounds thatthey were not statistically significant. Their exclusion did not affect the cropping and stocking figures for theUnited Kingdom for that year by more than 0-4 per cent in the case of any single item shown in this table.In Scotland 16,000 holdings (accounting for less than 0-1 per cent of United Kingdom agricultural output)have been excluded on the same grounds with effect from June 1970.With effect from June 1970 the definition of agricultural holdings has been widened in Great Britain to include some 2,300 statistically significant holdings on one acre or less of agricultural land. The figures now relateto all known holdings with 26 standard man-days or more (a standard man-day represents 8 hours productivework by an adult male worker under average conditions); holdings with less than 26 standard man-days areincluded only if they have 10 acres or more of crops and grass or at least one regular whole-time worker.The cropping and stocking figures returned by holdings on one acre or less account for significant differences between the census results for June 1970 and those for previous years only in the case of pigs and fowls. Thefigures in square brackets in the table show the number of pigs and fowls excluding those on holdings in GreatBritain with one acre or less.Figures for Northern Ireland relate to holdings of one acre or more, except for numbers of livestock which arecollected from all owners, irrespective of the size of the holding, and also from landless stockholders.(6) Includes acreages of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.(c) Includes lucerne.(d) Includes common rough grazings.(e) &quot; Other land &quot; in Great Britain means woodland and areas under roads, yards, buildings, etc., the use of whichis ancillary to the farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it includes land within agricultural holdings whichis under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not used for agriculture. Returns of&quot; other land &quot;were collected for the first time in England and Wales in June 1969 and the area returned then (208,000 acres)is understated. It is estimated that that figure includes some 53,000 acres and the 1970 figure (376,000 acres)includes some 96,000 acres previously returned as crops and grass or rough grazing.(/) Figures for years earlier than 1964 are for fowls six months old and over in Great Britain and five months oldand over in Northern Ireland.(g) Includes ducks, geese, turkeys and fowls for breeding.Table 2Estimated Average Yields of Crops and Livestock ProductsJune/May years	Unit	Average of 1960/61-1962/63	1966/67	1967/68	1968/69	1969/70	1970/71 (forecast)Crops							Wheat Barley...      .;.

In this table the figures for the average acreage or average size of herd or flockrefer only to the acreage of that particular crop or the number of that particular kind of animal.The average size of enterprise shown for 1968 is not affected to any significant extent by the elimination ofthe 47,000 holdings referred to in note (a) of Table 1 except in the case of poultry.Between June 1969 and June 1970 some 10,000 holdings in England and Wales were &quot; statistically amalgated &quot;(i.e., holdings farmed with other holdings as part of a larger single farm unit are now normally returned aspart of the larger unit instead of being returned separately in the census). These amalgamations are inaddition to those which normally occur. The general effect has been to reduce the total number of holdings and thereby increase the average size of enterprise. This effect, however, may to some extent have beenoffset in the case of pig and poultry enterprises by the extension of the census in June 1970 (see footnote (a)to Table 1).(6) Excludes Northern Ireland. Sugar beet is not produced in Northern Ireland and wheat only to a negligibleextent.(c) Scottish figures relate to breeding ewes.Number of Holdings Producing Certain Farm Products and Average size of Enterprise(a)At June of each year

The occupier&apos;s investmentincludes all tenant-type physical assets in livestock, crops, machinery, etc. but excludes any financial assets and all landlord-type assets such as land and buildings.Aggregate figures for net income relate to the production from all agricultural holdings as defined in theAgricultural Census (see note (a) of Table 1). In June 1970 the scope of the census was widened to coverholdings producing commercially significant quantities of agricultural produce on one acre or less of agricultural land, which had previously been excluded in Great Britain. In the table above the series on the old basisshow net income on the old definition of agricultural holdings and those on the new basis use the widerdefinition.The estimates of aggregate net income include a notional profit of about  5 million in recent years on theproduction of food for consumption in the farm household. In other industries the corresponding sums arenot treated as profit and are relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).Net product (net output) measures the value-added at constant prices by farmers, landowners and farmworkersto all the goods and services purchased from outside the agricultural sector. Details of the method of calculation of the index based on 1964/65-1966/67 = 100 were given in the December 1969 issue (No. 194) of&quot; Economic Trends &quot; published by H.M.S.O. The relationship between net income and net product at current prices is shown in Table 12.Net product has in the past included the estimated production from holdings under one acre, including the self-supply of gardens, allotments and backyards. This element of self-supply has been removed so that the coverage coincides with that of the net income calculation. Figures for net product at constant 1964/67prices on the new basis have been calculated back to 1964/65.Labour productivity is here defined as gross product per person engaged in agriculture. Gross product isgross output less all inputs other than depreciation, labour, net rent and interest.

In practice, however,there are many variations in the division between the two responsibilities. Investment in plant and machinery is normally tenant type. Investment in buildings and works is normally landlord type. The figures in the table represent gross expenditure. Annual charges in the form of depreciation are made for these items in calculating aggregate farming net income.At June each year

(rt) These figures are collected by Universities and Agricultural Colleges in Great Britain and the Ministry ofAgriculture in Northern Ireland. They are weighted averages based on census distribution of agricultural holdings by type of farming and size of business. More detailed figures for England and Wales are published in &quot; Farm Incomes in England and Wales 1969/70 &quot; (H.M..S.O.). Corresponding information for scotland will appear in &quot;Scottish Agricultural Economics 1971 &quot;: for Northern Ireland in &quot;The Northern IrelandFarm Management Survey 1969/70&quot;; and for Wales in the &quot; Supplement to the Annual Digest of Welsh-    Statistics 1969/70&quot;.Net income is defined as for the Departmental Net Income Calculation (Tables 12 and 13), except that herenet income is calculated before deduction of interest on any commercial debt. AH farms are treated as rentedand an imputed rental value is charged as an expense in the accounts of owner-occupiers.The accounts relate in the main to calendar or financial years, the average year-ending date being aboutmid-February.(b) Includes &quot; mixed &quot; farm type.(c) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings and, as rents cannotbe imputed with reference to tenanted farms, the rents entered in the accounts are estimated so as to coverdepreciation and repairs on fixed equipment, net &quot; conacre &quot; rents and nominal net annual values of landowned (Poor Law Valuations). Also, the normal practices of valuing livestock differ from those in GreatBritain and the charge for labour, which is mainly family labour, relies heavily upon judgment. For these reasons whilst the figures for Northern Ireland indicate changes in net incomes, the average net incomes perfarm are not on the same basis as those for Great Britain.(c/) Includes &quot; cattle, sheep and pigs &quot;-, &quot; pigs and poultry &quot; and &quot; cropping &quot; farm types.Table 17Aggregate Cost Changes taken into Account at the Annual Review(fl)  million	Net cost change relating to		all products	guaranteed production^))Feedingstuffs(c)        ............      ......	+ 80-9	+4-5-9Seeds   ........................	-1-3-8	+2^7Livestock (imported and inter-farm expenses)     ......	-1-1-1	+ 1-1Fertilisers and lime   ..................	+20-0	+ 16-0Machinery (including depreciation)         .........	+ 3S-9	+19-maintenance (including depreciation on equipment)	-f-5-5	+ 3^2Miscellaneous.........      ......	+ 11-6	+ 6^6Labour........................	+40-0	+26^7 &apos;Gross rent j r ....     ......  ...     ...     ... ......      ..;	+7-1	+ 5-interest...............     ...     .....!	-2-9	-2-transport and marketing    ...............	+ 10-7	+5-total        .........     ............	+216-7	+ 141-3(a) These estimates are made on the assumption that any increase (or decrease) in the cost of an item of expenditure will continue for a full year and that there will be no change from the current usage of that item.No allowance has been made for a possible increase in the cost to farmers of advice and services followingrecently announced changes in the work of the agricultural departments.(b) Commodities of the descriptions and quantities for which guaranteed prices are provided.(c) Excludes changes in feedingstuffs costs which are dealt with automatically by the feed formula which relatesthe guarantee for pigs to the cost of a basic feed ration.

The figures for 1971/72 are those in the correspondingCivil Estimates for that year (Class V, Votes 3, 4, 5, 6 and parts of Votes 2 and 7). The table excludes grants specifl-cally for horticulture. The estimated cost of these, togetherwith horticultural co-operation and credit, is  8-3 million in 1970/71 and  10-5 million in 1971/72.(b) Expenditure on the relevant production grants and on thespecial assistance grant to Northern Ireland is taken intoaccount together with the value of the price guarantees in calculating the total value of the guarantees.(c) Includes grants in respect of grassland renovation, rabbitclearance societies, producers in the Scottish Islands,agricultural marketing development, agricultural co-operation (excluding fixed equipment), agricultural credit and silos.(d) Includes grants in respect of livestock improvement, brackeneradication, and fixed equipment for agricultural co-operatives.(e) Payments in respect of cereals, potatoes and wool relatepartly to the crops or clip of the year indicated and partly to the crops or clips in the preceding year or years.(/) Part of the payment due in 1967/68 was brought forward to 1966/67 prior to the introduction of a change in thepayment arrangements in 1967/68.(g) These figures differ from the effect of the determinations onthe value of the guarantees for several reasons. TheEstimates for 1971/72 were prepared on the assumptionthat the higher levels of the guarantees for 1970/71 announced in October 1970, rather than the levels originally announcedafter the 1970 Annual Review, would continue to apply for 1971/72. In addition, the price guarantee arrangementsfor some commodities do not involve Exchequer payments and the payment periods for some items do not correspond with the financial year.

(a) The figures for unit subsidy cover expenditure on implementing the price guarantees only.   They do not include agricultural production grants or administrative expenses.(4) The guaranteed price relates to a standard quantity only for wheat (1964/65-1967/68), for barley (1964/65-1968/69), for milk (throughout this period) and for eggs (1969/70-1970/71).(c) The figures for cereals are in respect of grain taken into account in the Cereals Deficiency Payments Scheme.id) The unit subsidy is taken to be the cost of support buying related to the quantity of eligible potatoes sold for human consumption.  It is not additional to producers&apos; returns from the market.(e) The figures for fatstock relate to animals certified under the Fatstock Guarantee Scheme. The unit subsidy for fat cattle and sheep includes any payments made under the graduated deficiency payments arrangementsafter the end of the fatstock year. The average standard price and the unit subsidy for fat pigs include,where appropriate, quality premiums and adjustments under the flexible guarantee and feed price arrangements.(/) The net ex-farm price after deduction of transport charges paid to wholesale producers by the Milk marketing boards (the &quot; pool price &quot;). It covers both the standard quantity and milk outside the standard quantitysold for manufacture at a lower price.te) The average producer price paid by the British Egg Marketing Board on first quality hen eggs.
