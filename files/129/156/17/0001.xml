DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Yl\S government cp(71) 42 COPY NO29 March 1971CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment1, Last November we announced our intention to unify the administrationof the National Health Service under health authorities outside localgovernment at the same time as the reorganisation of local government.,The Social Services Committee (SL) have considered proposals for thisreorganisation on the basis of the annexed draft document designed for consultation with the organisations In England, prior to the issue later of a white Pa per s and also to be made known generally.2, The Labour Government proposed area health authorities (in directrelationship with the central Government), corresponding with the thenproposed unitary local authorities^ with district committees exercising localsupervision and regional health councils undertaking tasks calling for administration over a wide area.    The emphasis was on communityparticipation with one-third of members of the authorities appointed by thelocal authorities^ one-third by the professions and one-third, with thechairman, appointed by the Secretary of State, and the district committeesconsisting of equal numbers of area authority members and of people living and working in the district.3. By contrast, the current proposals emphasise accountable managementwith a strong regional tier responsible for co-ordinating, supervising andallocating resources to the area authorities, which would undertake the localmanagement.    The intention would be to choose members of authorities(which would be kept as small as possible) for their managerial ability.The members of the regional authorities would be appointed by the Secretaryof State and would themselves appoint the members of the area authorities?they would include members of the local authorities and the health professions but not on a representational footing.    Community healthcouncils without management functions would be appointed to reflect theviews of the local public in the districts,4. In Scotland and Wales for reasons of scale there would be a singletier structure.    In Scotland this would be combined with a central planning council and a common services agency; a similar agency (and possibly some
All-Wales advisory ma chime ry) is contemplated for Wales.    The Secretaryof State for Scotland has ;.t in mind to set out his proposals in a discussionpaper,    The Secretary of State for Wales wishess however, to take informal soundings in Wales before making proposals public,5,        The legislation would provide for the establishment of HealthCommissioners to investigate complaints in respect of all health services(except those provided by family practitioners under contract).6.        SL agreed with the structural proposals and the proposal for the health Commissioners.    A few subsidiary points (the numbers andboundaries of the regionsv, the school health service, and the possiblepayment of chairmen of authorities) have to be settled in consultation between the Ministers concerned.    The main issue, however, related tothe membership of the ar.thorS.tiesj  on this the Committee were not able toreach agreement,7,        Some members were anxious lest the mode of appointment proposedmight compare unfavourably with the representational basis of the lastGovernments proposals and accord ill with cur emphasis upon more power for local government in our proposals for local government reorganisationto the possible prejudice of the local authorities1 reaction to these.Moreover, it would be in marked contrast with the line taken by the thenOpposition spokesman (Official Report 31 October 1969a Column 530;23 March 1970a Column 1017) when commenting on the last governments proposals; this had favoured public representation and had even contemplated the exclusion of Ministerial nominees.    There would be no guarantee that local government people selected by Ministers would be superior to thoseappointed by the local authorities themselves., and it was hoped that localgovernment reorganisation would strengthen the quality of local councillorsgenerally.    Other members of the Committie emphasised the need for a greatly improved management structure.    The finance for the services(some  2? 000 million a year in Great Britain) would be entirely a centralGovernment responsibility and it was right therefore to go for a direct andunambiguous chain of accountability;, and the strongest possible managerialcompetence.    Both objectives would be seriously at risk if local authorities were given the right to appoint delegates to the boards ^ all the more sosince, if this wore concededj it would have to extend to doctors also.8. If the Cabinet approves the structural proposals, the issue for decision is whether the boards which are to run the National Health service are to be wholly appointed or largely representational bodies.    E theformer is accepted, then the proposals put forward will in their essentialsstands if the latter, then it will be necessary for revised proposals to beconsidered by SL.R m home Office SW129 March 19712
ANNEXNHS REORGANISATION; CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENTFOREWORD BY THE SECRETAIL OF STATE FOR SOCIAL services the legislation which brought the National Health Serviceinto being is now a quarter of a century old.   The structuralframework within which health care is provided remains as itwas more than a generation ago.   Traditionally separate anddistinct elements - hospitals, family practitioner services,community care - were then enlisted in the common cause of promoting (in the words of the Act) &quot;a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvement in the physical andmental health, of the people&quot;.That improvement has undoubtedly come about and willcontinue.   But it is clear that the creaking structure withinwhich the governing bodies, the doctors, the nurses, theadministrators and all the other health service staff must worksimply does not match up to modern needs for the delivery of comprehensive health care.   What the public needs and what the health Service itself has increasingly come to demand, is a service organised so that its separate parts are planned and operated, not in fragments but as a whole.The debate about means of achieving this has been going onnow for a decade.   Two Green Papers on the structure of theNational Health Service have been published.   We are perhaps in danger of a surfeit of plans and prospectuses:    there must beearly decisions, so that enthusiasm for reform does not witheraway.The first need is for a brief statement of the Government1proposals for a new health service structure, and that is thepurpose of this consultative document.   When comments on our proposals have been received and considered, I shall publish a white Paper containing the Government1s decisions and astatement of the principles on which legislation for an integrated NHS will be based.1 /.&apos;
The document suggests how the administration of the personal health services might be unified.   These services, whetherprovided in hospital or in the community, will be brought together under new all-purpose health authorities.Their balanced development depends not only on administrative unification but also on the provision of socialcare in the community and of residential accommodation for groupssuch as the physically or mentally handicapped, and the elderly.These personal social services have already been brought togetherunder the new social services committees of the local authoritiesand, under the Governments proposals for reorganised localgovernment in England, will remain with the new county and metropolitan district authorities.   Neither the Government, northeir predecessors, have proposed full administrative unification of the health and related personal social services.   But ascomprehensive care of the citizen depends on both sets of services, strong and binding links between them will be of fundamental importance.   The Government have already decided upon matching boundaries between the new health authorities andthe local authorities providing personal social services.   Thiswill provide a structural framework within which the separateauthorities can jointly plan and develop their complementaryservices, but it will be one of the key tasks in the period upto April 197k - when the reorganised health service and localgovernment take effect - to devise ways in which they can be linked for effective policy-making.Much of what is proposed in the consultative documentaccords with the proposals in the previous Administration&apos;s 1970Green Paper.   The important differences are listed and explained.The Governments proposals are designed to meet the basicobjective of the service:    the provision of comprehensivehealth care, so organised as to provide in every area acontinuingly effective balance between care in and outsidehospitals, and between the needs of the various groups of patients.This objective will of course depend heavily on thoseprofessions working in the Health Service, including the3.
professional administrators.   The medical profession has played a large part in the planning and management of the existing service and will continue to do 30 in the future.   But the other professions will also have a part to play in guiding the new service.   The nursing profession provides an indispensableservice in the hospital and in the home, and in the preventiveas well a3 the curative aspects of illness;    the size and complexity of this service demand good management if efficiency and economy are to he secured, and in recent years nurses have become increasingly well prepared to take their part in themanagement of the National Health Service at all levels.   the professional staff now in local authority employment who willmove to the new health authorities - the medical officers ofhealth and other doctors, the dentists, health visitors, homenurses, and midwives - will also bring particularly valuableexperience to the planning of integrated care.The success of these proposals will, in a more general sense, depend on the quality of management.   The Health service is one of the country&apos;s largest enterprises, in terms of moneyspent, staff employed and facilities required.   It cannotprosper without the same calibre of managerial skill which we expect in the best organised of our great industrial concerns.The work of the existing health service boards and committeeshas had to be done within the cramping confines of an unsatisfactory and increasingly outmoded structure.   advances in management efficiency cannot realistically be looked for in a continuation of that structure.Each of the new managing bodies will employ staffs in a wide range of professional and other disciplines and numbered inthousands, and will administer annual budgets running intomillions (in some cases many millions) of pounds.   Much will depend on the vision and skill of the health and social servicesleaders.   We shall take steps to create a mutual awareness ofeach other tasks and methods.   It will be our aim to improve the training arrangements for senior staff so that we may develop managers trained to consider and, in collaboration with local authorities and voluntary organisations, to serve the3..
total needs of their areas.I am confident that members and staff of the health service authorities will welcome the opportunity to improve the framework within which they do their work.   It will be ourjoint aim to construct a service with a new vigour and a greatercapacity for achievement.CONSULTATIVE document.     On the 5 November 1970 the Secretary of State for social services stated in reply to a Question in the House of commons by Dr Gerard Vaughan -&quot;        The Government intend to unify the administration ofthe National Health Service-   Legislation will bring thechange into effect at the same time as alterations aremade in the structure of local government.The National Health Service will be administered byhealth authorities outside local government workingclosely with the local authorities responsible for the personal social services and the public health services.The Government are not satisfied however that the detailedadministrative proposals in the Green Paper of February1970 would create an efficient structure of a unified service.   They are studying the comments made on theproposals, and, before reaching final decisions of theirown, will consult with the organisations concerned.&quot;2,     The Government has announced its decisions on the futurestructure of local government in England in Cmnd k5&amp;k*   Thisstates that the local authority personal health services willbe transferred to the new health authorities, and that the aimis to bring the reorganisation of local government and of theNational Health Service into operation on 1st April 1974.3.     Work is now starting on the preparation of the legislationneeded to unify the administration of the National health service.   The unified structure will incorporate the personal health functions which, since the 1946 Act set up the Service,have been exercised by local authorities, including theprovision of health centres, the health care of mothers and young children, midwifery, health visiting, home nursing,ambulance services and the prevention of illness.   It will not
however incorporate the functions which (although they derive from the original National Health Service Act) are nowdischarged through the new local authority social servicecommittees, set up following the Local Authority Social ServicesAct, 1970, namely home help, certain other social care servicesand certain residential services.   These personal social services will continue to be the responsibility of the localauthorities.4.     For the purpose of this legislation early decisions are needed on certain important matters.   The Secretary of Statenow invites views on the tentative conclusions he has reached on these after studying the Green Paper of February 1970 and the comments made on the proposals it contained.   There are many other matters on which decisions will have to be taken, inconsultation with those concerned, before the reorganisedservice comes into operation.   Arrangements wilL be made for consultation about them at a later stage.   The provisional conclusions on which comments are now invited are set out inthe following paragraphs.5.     The administrative arrangements will fully preserve theclinical freedom of those who provide services to patients;they will help to ensure that the services are provided quickly and effectively;    and they will secure a close co-ordination ofaims and of day-to-day action both within the unified national health Service and with related services, especially those run by local authorities.   Collaboration with voluntary organisations, too, will continue to be developed.6.     It is proposed that throughout the new administrative structure there should be a clear definiton and allocation of responsibilities;   that there should be maximum delegationdownwards, matched by accountability upwards;    and that a soundmanagement structure should be created at all levels.   The lineof delegation downwards (with corresponding accountabilityupwards) will be from the Central Department to regional health authorities, and from the regional health authorities to area health authorities.   The aim will be to set clear objectives and standards, and measure performance against them.   The5.
creation of a strong regional tier is one of the maindifferences between the present proposals and the 1970 green paper.    In the Governments view, direct supervision of some80 to 90 area authorities by the Central Department, asproposed by the previous Government, would not make managerialsense.Area Health Authorities7.     The area health authorities will be the operationalNational Health Service authorities, with responsibility for planning, organising and administering comprehensive health services to meet the needs of their areas.   Each area authority will also be responsible for the management of theintegrated health services in the various parts of its area(&quot;districts&quot;) served by separate district general hospitals and the community health services associated with them.   the detailed management arrangements, at both member and officerlevel, in the area headquarters, in the districts, and in theindividual hospitals and other institutions, are matters onwhich it is the Secretary of State&apos;s intention to set on footan expert study in consultation with those concerned.   This willtake account of the present arrangements for the administrationof the individual parts of the National Health Service,including the role of the professional hospital administrator;of current developments in the organisation of medical and nursing work in accordance with the Cogwheel and Salmon Reports;and of the views of the Hunter working party on medicaladministrators.   The study will be started at an early date, as its results need to be available in time for incorporation inthe management structures set up by the new authorities.8,     The boundaries of the area health authorities will be thesame as those of the counties (other than the metropolitancounties) and the metropolitan districts proposed for localgovernment in Cmnd h58h.   On this footing there will be about70 of them in England, outside London.   As the Green Paper ofFebruary 1970 recognised, there must be firm links andarrangements for close collaboration with the matching localauthorities.   But the Green Paper did not make comprehensive6-CONFIDENTIAL
Rl Cl l&quot;\E IrVB &quot;1TB A Iproposals for achieving this.   An effective mechanism isessential for the mutually agreed planning of, and investment in, the health and related local authority services.   Therewill be provision for working together in day-to-day operations and for sharing supply and other ancillary services.   Thearrangements should cover, too, the provision of advice and services to the health authority by the local authority   through its social services department and its staff, and to the localauthority by the health authority&apos;s community physicians andother medical staff, dentists and nurses including thosetransferred from local authority to health authority employment.The Secretary of State proposes the early establishment of a working party, representative of the interests concerned, to study these matters in detail.   Its recommendations, like theresults of the study referred to in paragraph 7, will need tobe available well before the new authorities take over their responsibilities.Regional Health Authorities9.     The regional health authorities will be responsible for thegeneral planning of the National Health Service (including thespecialties and, in consultation with the Universities, theservice facilities to be provided in support of medical teaching and research) in each region;   for allocating resources to thearea health authorities;    and for co-ordinating their activities and monitoring their performance (including the effectiveness of their links with the matching local authorities) to ensurethat national and regional objectives are achieved and that the desired standard of service is provided.   This will place on the regional authorities a real management responsibility withinthe chain of command and will give them a very different functionfrom that of the regional health councils proposed in the 1970Green Paper.   In addition the regional authorities will themselves provide some services and will be the buildingauthorities for all major projects.10.   The areas of the regional health authorities will be basedon the Ik planning regions hitherto adopted for the hospital7 .
service, except that, subject to consultations with those concerned locally, it is proposed to divide the presentSheffield hospital region into two health regions based onthe medical teaching centres at Nottingham and Sheffieldrespectively.11.     The detailed management arrangements at the regional level will be included in the study to which reference is madein paragraph 7*Central Department12.     In discharge of the Secretary of State&apos;s responsibility to Parliament for the National Health Service as a whole, theCentral Department will determine national objectives,priorities and standards and allocate resources to the regional authorities.   These responsibilities will - as at a lower levelwith the regional health authorities in respect of the area health authorities - not involve detailed control but will inevitably carry with them an ultimate responsibility for thequality and effectiveness of management and for the monitoringof performance.   The existing Hospital Advisory Service hasdemonstrated the value of expert visiting advisory teams inpsychiatric and geriatric hospitals, which contain over half thehospital beds in the National Health Service.   Ways of gatheringinformation, and disseminating advice, on successfularrangements for linking together the planning and operation ofhealth authority and related local authority services will alsobe studied.13.     The organisation of the Department of Health, and social security is being reviewed, with the help of management consultants, to ensure that it will be fully equipped to carryout its functions.   The staff who are concerned with the central administration of the National Health Service need to includepeople with direct experience in the fieldj    and the Departmentmust also be properly advised on professional and technicalprogress, so that it can try to foresee and provide fordevelopments based on new technical advances.8 .
Membership of Authoritieslk.     The new health authorities will have important and complexmanagement functions to perform, demanding of their membersskill and experience of a sort that will enable them to giveguidance and direction on regional or area objectives to their staff.    The authorities will be kept small and management abilitywill be the main criterion for the selection of members.15.     It would therefore be inappropriate that the authoritiesshould be composed on the representational basis proposed inthe 1970 Green Paper.    Instead, the members of the area authority will be appointed by the regional authority exceptthat the chairman will be appointed by the Secretary of State.The chairman and members of the regional authority will beappointed by the Secretary of State.   There will be power toremunerate on a part-time basis the chairmen of both area and regional authorities.16.     Before making their appointments, the Secretary of Stateand the regional authorities will consult the interestedorganisations including the Universities, the local authoritiesand the main health professions.   The membership will include members of local authorities and of the health professions, but these members will not be chosen on a representational footing.It is intended that strong professional advisory machinery should be established by area and regional authorities.Community Health Councils17.     The previous Government sought to secure increased localparticipation in the administration of the health services notonly by giving the area authorities a representational character,but also through the establishment of district committeescomposed, as to half their membership, of people living or working in the district.   In the present Governments view,these proposals would have led to a dangerous confusion between management on the one hand and the community&apos;s reaction to management on the other.   Instead, the area health authority will be required to set up a community health council for eachof its constituent districts.   This will ensure that in making
plans and operating services area authorities take full accountof the views of the public they serve.   The council will beappointed after consultation with a wide range of interestedlocal organisations.   It will be consulted on the development and operation of the health services in the district, and its members will have the right to visit hospitals and other institutions.   It will produce an annual report.Family Practitioner Services18.     The family practitioner services occupy a central position,and the area health authority will be closely concerned withplans for their development - for example, at health centres and by attachment schemes, in which nurses and health visitorswork together with practitioners - in close collaboration withother parts of the unified National Health Service and with the personal social services.19.     To administer the contracts of the family practitioners -doctors, dentists, pharmacists and opticians - the area authority will be required to set up a committee, with acomposition like that of the present Executive Councils.   Onthis matter the committee will deal direct with the central department and will be separately financed.Teaching Districts20.     There will be special arrangements for districts wherethere are substantial facilities for medical and dental clinicalteaching.   These special arrangements, which are set out inAppendix 1, are designed to enable the teaching hospitals toplay a fully integrated role in the reorganised health services **to the benefit of all the health services in the districts inwhich they are situated - while retaining their individualidentity and historic traditions and maintaining the specialservices they provide.Endowments21.     The public will be encouraged to continue to supportendowment funds;    and provision will be made in the legislation to protect their local character and control, on the lines set1Q.
out in Appendix 2.London22.     The arrangements in Greater London will be based on thegeneral regional and area structure set out above but will need to be specially shaped to meet conditions there, includingthe already established pattern of local government services,the distribution of hospitals (including teaching hospitals),the presence of separate postgraduate teaching hospitals, andthe wide coverage of the existing Executive Councils.   Therewill be separate consultations on these problems with the organisations concerned.General23.     Paragraphs 6-21 and the two appendices set out theGovernments tentative proposals on which early comments are needed to enable final decisions to be reached and work on thepreparation of legislation to proceed.   There will be separateopportunities for views to be expressed on other matters,including arrangements for the transitional period.2k.     Organisations are requested to send their comments to theDepartment of Health and Social Security not later thanthe end of May.
Appendix special ARRANGEMENTS FOR TEACHING DISTRICTSThese districts will be administered as part of the regions andareas in which they are situated.   But, to help in achieving the objects set out in paragraph 20 i.e. to secure that theinclusion of the teaching hospitals will benefit all the health services in the districts in which they are situated, to retainhospitals&apos; individual identity and historic traditions, and tomaintain the special services they provide, there will be thefollowing arrangements::-(a) the regional health authority will appoint a specialregional committee to deal with planning matters relating to teaching and research;(b) expenditure for the services in a teaching districtwill be separately Identified in the regional health authority&apos;s approval of expenditure for the area;(c) the area health authority will be required to appoint a district committee to manage the services in eachteaching district (which will normally carry the teaching hospital&apos;s name).   This committee will consistpartly of members of the area authority itself andpartly of others;    in the early years of the reorganised service, the Secretary of State will appoint the chairman and some members;    It will doubtless usually hold its meetings at the teachinghospital;(d) when a consultant is being chosen to serve in ateaching district, the advisory appointments committeewill always include in its membership one or more members nominated by the district committee;   and(e) arrangements will be made for one or two members ofexisting Boards of Governors and University hospital management Committees to be appointed to each of thearea authorities concerned and to each teaching ,district committee.12..
Appendix 2ENDOWMENTS1.   Endowments other than those belonging to Boards of governors and University HMC&apos;s will he vested in the area health authority and applied and administered by itaccording to the categories in which they fall:(a) those held for &quot;special purposes&quot; will continueto be applied only for purposes within the scopeof the trust;(b) those held for the &quot;general purposes&quot; of aparticular hospital will continue to be applied only for the purposes of that hospital;(c) those held for the &quot;general purposes&quot; of a hospital Management Committee will become available for application within the area of the successor area health authority, and will beavailable not only for hospital purposes (towhich they are at present limited) but for any purpose relating to the health services providedfor the people of the area, including research and capital works.2,   Endowments vested in Boards of Governors and UniversityHMC&apos;s will be vested in the teaching district committee.   Itwill be made possible for the district committee to applyfunds in category (c) for any purpose related to the health services provided for the district, not only for hospitalpurposes.16 March 197113....
