THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S government cp(71) 38 COPY NO6222 March 1971CABINETSTRUCTURE OF THE STEEL, industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Tradeand industry. At Cabinet on 18 March (CM(71) 15th Conclusions, Minute 10) reported that the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy had agreed in principle that the basic iron and steelmaking capacity of the British steel corporation (BSC) should not be splits and that I wished to make an early announcement accordingly,,2.        This latter is essential to maintain morale in the industry now that my fundamental review of BSC finance and development has been announced.The text at Annex A is consistent with our political commitments (Annex B)and allows considerable flexibility in the future to secure a progressive reduction of the BSC*s involvement while carrying no Implication as to the eventual size of the industry,3. My recommendation that the BSC should not be split follows a very careful study of the issues involved and extensive consultation with theprivate sector which has strongly argued for stability.4. On the one hand5 the case for a split stems from the view thatnationalisation arbitrarily created a monopoly unresponsive to consumers3wishes., difficult to manage efficiently and now making excessive demands on public investment funds.5, On the other hand steel companies throughout the world are rapidly growing bigger and already United States Steel and Nippon Steel makelarger tonnages than BSC whilst several companies have similar moneyturnover.    The slow growth of demand in Great Britain means that only with one company can we derive the greatest technological advantage of scale whilst planning closures of old and inefficient plant with due regardto regional and employment considerations.    Competition from Europe and japan is increasing and will intensify if we join the Community.1
6.        All of the possible ways in which fche BSC might be split (eg byProduct Division or geographically Norths-South) have serious piacticaldifficulties in handling both development and closures? and would inevitably dislocate financial and cost control at a time when everythingmust be done to improve it.    More generally, they would accentuateuncertainty., generate political controversy and risk threats of reversal bythe Opposition.    In my view no spl?t which does not involve serious andoverriding practical difficulties would induce a greater degree of competition into the industry.conclusion. I seek my colleagues agreement to an early statement on the linesof Annex A.    This will encourage morale and stability in the industry duringmy current review of BSC finance and development and will not compromiseour other objectives on which I will report further as necessary in due course.8. BSC themselves have proposed that our aims might be achieved by establishing them intact as a company under the Companies&apos; Act.    Withoutruling this out for the longer term I am satisfied that with their financial difficulties it will not make sense for some years.J d department of Trade and Industry SW122 March 19712
Annex ADRAFT STATEMENT ON STEEL policy as the House is aware, I have been carrying out a full review ofthe existing and future structure of the Corporation in parallel with the review of nationalised industry activities more generally which is still continuing.    I make no apology for taking time to examine all the issues properly instead ofrushing into premature decision.After a most careful examination with the Corporation theprivate sector of the industry and others concerned we havedecided against splitting the Corporation^ hulk iron and steelactivities, though the question of the future size of theindustry is for consideration within my current review of theCorporation^ financial and development position.   Within this area we shall continue to explore with the Corporation the scope for continuing progress towards greater efficiency and competit-ive discipline.   This of course must he subject to the constraints of fair competition with the private sector and theneed for a rapid improvement in the Corporation^ financialposition; it is also subject to the Government&apos;s overall policy for the economy.The nationalisation of the industry created a number of anomalieson the boundary between the public and private sector and we intend to pursue with the Corporation and with the private sectorinterests concerned the extent to which these can be remedied.There are clear areas here where sensible rationalisation ispossible and we shall encourage the BSC and the private sectorinterests to seek appropriate solutions.The Corporation a].so has interests in a wide range of diversified,and ancillary activities; now that we have taken the main decisionon bulk steel making our close examination of these other activities can proceed apace.I might add that we would welcome any new private sector steelworksdevelopments and I should like to make clear that I would not normally expect to use my statutory powers (S.15 of the 1967 Act:approval needed for carbon steelmaking over 100,000 tons; and alloysteelmaking over 20,000 tons) of approval of such steelmakingdevelopment in any restrictive way.I shall of course report further to the House when my considerations of policy and the necessary consultations have been completed.
ANNEX BSTATEMENTS OF CONSERVATIVE POLICY ON THE FUTURE STRUCTURE OFTHE STEEL INDUSTRY rPre-ElectionThe Campaign Guide 1970 stated that&quot;The Conservative attitude to steel nationalisationwas set out by Mr. Anthony Barber during the SecondReading Debate on the Iron &amp; Steel Bill in 1966 whenhe described four principles which would guideConservative action: freedom from centralised controlwhether by the Iron &amp; Steel Board or the BSC;competitive pricing policies; rationalisation in somesectors; and a solution that facilitates our entry into europe.&quot;   Mr. Barber added:&quot;We shall denationalise the industry to whatever extentis necessary and practicable to conform with (these)principles and to provide the disciplines of competitiveenterprise.&quot;    (Hansard 25th July 1966).Confirming this policy in a letter to Mr. John Osborn, MP, on21st June 1967 Mr. Barber went on to say that he had several timesmade it clear that&quot;denationalisation does not mean a return to the sameindustry structure which existed before nationalisation.What is required is a rationalised industry operating under the disciplines of competitive enterprise and thisis quite impossible with 90 per cent of the industry inthe hands of the State.&quot;    (Financial Times 23 June 1967).These pledges were repeated by Sir Keith Joseph in the SecondReading Debate on the 1969 Iron and Steel Bill.&quot;We dislike monopoly centralisation and the principle of having a single investment-decision-maker in any industry ...we want the industry to be competitive, responsive to themarket and enterprising ... but that does not mean ...that we think the right answer is to go back to the preciseposition before rationalisation ...     We want a flexiblecompetitive steel industry and that is why we shall make any changes necessary and practicable to provide thedisciplines of competitive enterprise for steel.   We shallrestore a competitive framework for steel.&quot;(Hansaa?d, 8 May 1969, Cols. 696, 703)./Sir John Eden
Sir John Eden when opposition spokesman on Power explained that thedetails of any scheme must &quot;be kept open during the currentreorganisation of the steel industry.   But he made it clear thatConservatives&quot;are determined wherever it may then be thought necessary and practicable, to restore to industry generally both themanagement advantages of competition and the discipline ofprivate equity participation        it has never been our viewthat to achieve the desired measure of co-operation it isnecessary for Government to take over industry or to usurpthe functions of management.    Latterly the business of theGovernment has been too expansionist.    It is time to redressthe balance&quot;.    (Manchester, 28 October 1969).2.     In addition, during the Supply Debate on Steel on 16th February1970 Sir Keith Joseph said:&quot;For our part we shall not go back to the old companies.We want a flexible responsive enterprising steel industryand that is why we shall make any changes necessary and practicable to provide the discipline of competition for steel.&quot;Post Election3.      In October 1970, at the Blackpool Conference, Mr. John Davies,then Minister of Technology, indicated that the Government&apos;s watch- -word for nationalised industries was &quot;disengagement&quot;, in 3 senses:(1)   the industries needed to shed peripheral activities that were in- no sense in the mainstream of their work.    Theydistracted scarce management talent and financial resources;(2)    as circumstances permitted,  &quot;private capital must bebrought back to play its questioning role in the develop-ment and management of these businesses.    I am bound tosay that at present the financial state of most of them is really not such that private capital would find, it easy totake a hand in them.&quot;(3)    &quot;to the extent possible, Government must withdraw from itsperpetual scrutiny and commentary upon the managementsconcerned; a process which undermines authority,constitutes a permanent alibi for inadequate performance,and represents a serious inhibition to recruitment andthe development of efficient management from within&quot;.4.     In his statement on steel prices on 15th October 1970, he also indicated that the Government saw a need to streamline the british steel Corporation involving some hiving-off of activities.- 2 -CONFIDENTIAL
5.     Sir John Eden, Minister for Industry said in Cardiff on 2nd November 1970 that nationalised industries must be required to compete on equal terms with private enterprise for a share of available financial resources.    State enterprises must be treatedless as instruments of government and more as major industrialenterprises whose efficiency has a marked effect on the economy asa whole;  &quot;a way which makes industrial sense must be devised to spare the industries irksome interference ^^?hile retaining the essentials of accountability, both to Parliament and Government&quot;.6. He has also indicated on various occasions that it is not theintention to make the industry a political shuttlecock; and it hasbeen stated in Parliament that Ministers are engaged in discussionwith the BSC on its future structure.- 3 -
