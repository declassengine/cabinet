DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT62CP(71) 33 COPY NO22 March 1971CABINETUNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT FOR OCCUPATIONALPENSIONERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. When I announced that I was withdrawing the draft regulations laidby our predecessors I explamed (with the agreement of my colleagues) thatthe Government intended to deal with this serious misuse of unemploymentbenefit,2,        We have pledged ourselves to take action against all forms of abuseand misuse of benefits.    If we now decide to do nothing to curb theacknowledged misuse of unemployment benefit by some occupational pensioners our critics will undoubtedly claim that anti-abuse measures are confined to the poor.3. My proposals in CP(71) 27, which would apply only to the better offoccupational pensioners, would also end the contribution liability for non-employed men over 60.    As requested by cabinet  I have sounded out someof our backbench colleagues.    I will report their views orally to the Cabinet.In general I do not foresee intractable difficulty.    For my own part I wouldstress that if the package outlined in CP(71) 27 (paragraph 10) is not approved for inclusion in the Uprating Bill, and no action is taken, we shall have to forgo an estimated saving starting at  2 million a year and rising, reject the findings of the National Insurance Advisory Committee and faceaccusations of condoning a misuse of unemployment benefit by one sectionof the community.conclusions. I seek my colleagues agreement to the proposals In this paper.K department of Health and Social Security SE122 March 1971
