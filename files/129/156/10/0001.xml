annex draft WHITE PAPERAN ALTERNATIVE SERVICE OF RADIO BROADCASTINGINTRODUCTION1.It  is  now some  16 years  since  the Television Act  1954established  the   Independent Television Authority as  a public corporation  to provide   television services  and so ended  the monopoly of  broadcasting which  the BBC had hitherto held.Despite   the  controversy aroused at   the   time  by  the 1954 Act,there are  few who would now wish  to see  the monopoly restored in  television.    The competing services of   television -   the  onepublicly  financed,   the other from the  sale of  advertising  time  -maintain a general   level of quality which certainly bearscomparison with  that achieved elsewhere.     The widespreadownership of   television sets  in  the United Kingdom,   and  the intensive use made of   them are  evidence of  the success of  thesystem in meeting   the demands of viewers.     It  is now generally accepted as  desirable,  moreover,   that  there  should be more   thanone source of  programmes,   particularly  in news  and currentaffairs.    For  those who work in television  there are seen  to bemajor  advantages  in  the existence of more  than one source ofemployment.     The case which  is now largely accepted forcompetition  in television, is no less  strong   in radio.2,      These proposals  for establishing an  alternative  radios ervice    have been arrived at  after extensive  consultations with broadcasting and newspaper interests,trade  associations concerned with advertising,   representativesof  local  authorities,   with  trade unions and other bodies concerned with programme production and with many other groups and individuals  interested  in   the  subject of  radio  from a technical,   commercial or  social point of view.    There has  beengreat  divergence   in  the  opinions  expressed,   but of   the widespreadinterest   in  the  subject   there  can be no doubt,  nor  of  theconsensus  of  opinion, with which  the Government warmlyassociates  itself,   that  radio  financed from advertisements mustoffer a  truly public  service.     There would be no place  for asystem of broadcasting which  did   little more   than offer a vehiclefor  carrying  advertisements.-  1  -
3.       In extending  to  the  listener  the  advantages of  choice between different   sources  of  radio  broadcasting,   the Governmentis anxious  both  to safeguard  the generally high quality of   the bbc&apos;s present  radio output,   and   to ensure  that  the new servicealso maintains high standards not least  in   the provision of news   and news  commentary programmes,   which   are necessarily  alarger   ingredient  in radio  even   than  in   television.THE  INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING AUTHORITY4.      The Government has considered whether  the  independent television Authority  should  assume  responsibility  for  the newradio service or whether  it would be preferable  to  establish aseparate  authority  for   this   purpose.     The  functions  required of a radio authority  will   be broadly   the same  as   those nowdischarged by  the  ITA for  television -   to undertake  the transmission of  programmes,   to appoint   the companies providing the programmes,   to  supervise programme  standards  and  to control the  amount,   incidence  and nature of  the advertising.     In detailthere may be differences between radio and  television  in  the ways  in which  these  functions  are discharged.    For  example,the  greater  immediacy and  flexibility of radio may not  always be compatible with  the  prior control  of  programmes  by  theauthority:     the  recording of programmes  on   tape  for  subsequentexamination  in cases of difficulty may be a more  appropriate method of  enabling   the  authority  to  exercise as careful a check on programme  standards  as   the medium requires.    These howeverare  differences of  degree.     The  factors  of  cost and of speed  in getting  the new service  started also  argue  in favour of givingthe   task  to  the  ITA.     Its  regional organisation,   appropriatelyadapted,  would  appear well  suited  to   the requirements of independent radio.     In general,   too,   it  is  desirable  to avoidadding unnecessarily  to  the number of  public  authorities.5.      For all   these  reasons  the Government proposes   to entrust the new service  to  the  ITA,  which will  be  renamed  the  &quot;IndependentBroadcasting Authority&quot;   (IBA).    The  IBA v/ill  be required  to involve  local  authorities  and other  local  organisations  in asystem of  advisorv committees  for  local  radio.    The duty  to share masts and sites  already  imposed on  the BBC and  the  ITA
will  be applied on a reciprocal  basis   to  the  radio  transmittersof both  the BBC and  the  IBA.BBC LOCAL RADIO6.       The Government has  considered whether,   given  the  decision,to authorise a  service  of  local commercial  radio,   the BBCs  local stations  should continue.     It has  been  argued that   there aredisadvantages  in  financing  from a national   licence  fee BBClocal  services  which are not  available  to all,   and that  local stations  should be  locally owned and controlled.    On  the otherhand  there  is much  to be  said,   particularly  in  the   larger  townsand cities,   for  the view  that  there should be competition between  local  stations   in  the  provision of   local news  and information.     It  has  been urged moreover on  behalf of  BBC local stations   that   they provide  services  to relatively  smallminorities,   such  as   the blind,   which  commercial   stations  couldnot necessarily  finance.    The BBC have  said  that  they regardlocal  radio as   the principal  growth point  in radio broadcasting,that  they have advocated  it  for many years,   and  that   they wouldnot wish  to be excluded from it.    They have  also confirmed thatthey can finance  out  of   licence  revenue  the  20  stations forwhich   the Government gave provisional  authority  last August.The Government has  concluded  that  the BBC stations shouldcontinue.     In  reaching   this  conclusion the Government  envisagesthat   the Corporation&apos;s  stations will  attach  first   importanceto serving a wide variety of minority  audiences,   including  local,schools and colleges,   and  that  such broadcasting will not be excluded from peak  listening hours.     It  should be clear  that   thesuccess of  the BBC stations   in achieving   these  objectives  isnot  to be measured by any  simple  comparison of   their audiencefigures with  those  of   the  IBA stations.     The 20 stations areLeicester,  Sheffield,   Liverpool,  Nottingham,   Brighton,   Stoke-on-Trent,   Leeds,   Durham,   Bristol,  Manchester,  London,   Oxford,Birmingham,  Medway,   Tees-side,   Solent,  Newcastle,   Humberside,Blackburn and Derby.     They will  have  a population coverage  inEngland on vhf  of approximately 75 per cent by day and night,and  it  is proposed also  to provide  them with mf back-up.
This might  eventually achieve a coverage  in England approaching 60 per  cent  by day.     InScotland,  Wales and Northern Ireland,   the national  versions  of radio 4 will  continue.THE IBA RADIO STATIONS7.     .A network of  up  to  60  stations   throughout  the UnitedKingdom is envisaged for  the  IBA.    These  can  be  accommodated onvhf with a population coverage of  65 per cent   in  the UnitedKingdom by day and night  and on mf with a coverage approaching70 per  cent  by day and 25 per  cent by night.     It will  be essential  for  the  IBA stations, if   they are  to be  available   toas many people as  possible within a reasonable period, that   theyshould start both on mf  and vhf.     In order  to provide mfsupport  for both  the  IBA and  the BBC  local   stations   it will  benecessary to supplement   the frequencies  already  assigned  to  thiscountry,   by proposing under Article  8 of  the CopenhagenConvention and Article  9 of  the  International TelecommunicationUnion Radio Regulations     the use of  further mf  channels.Within a  few years   there  is  the possibility   therefore  of upto  60  IBA stations with a coverage approaching  70 per cent  ofthe population of  the United Kingdom and 20 BBC stations with acoverage of up  to  75 per  cent of England,   both being  transmittedon vhf  and mf.     It  should.be noted  that   the allocation of mediumfrequencies  in  the European Broadcasting Area  is   to be reviewed and  that   the broadcasting organisations  cannot necessarilycount on  the use  of as many medium frequency channels  after1976.    There may,   however,   be room ultimately  for more  stations in  the vhf band.    A more detailed discussion of   frequency plansis  contained  in Appendix A.    The  technical  standards  adoptedare described  in Appendix B.8.       The precise number and disposition of  their  local stationswill  be a matter  for   the authority.     It will   inevitably   take some years   to establish  the full network.     The  stations should,so  far as possible,   serve  recognisable communities.    There will thus be great variations  in  the.size  of  population covered.Stations   to serve  the big conurbations will  be among   the first to be provided;   but   the  IBA will be encouraged  to  experiment   inthe  early stages with  the establishment of  relatively smallstations  in order  to determine   the minimum size  of  community4 -
capable of  sustaining  a worthwhile  local  radio  station.    Thereare various possibilities  for  linking  small  stations   in a  jointoperation which merit  investigation.,   The   IBA stations must be firmly rooted  in  their  locality,   and this  should be reflected in  the choice  of  station operators  and subsequently  in  theoutput.    The  stations will  be  linked by a network  in order  to exchange news,  music  and other  programmes.    Most of  the materialthus  received would however be  recorded and used at   the discretion of  the  local  station and with  local  linking.     It  isnot  envisaged  that   the  local  stations would  switch over  to asustaining  service  for any  significant periods.    A majoringredient  of   the  output  of   the stations will  be   local  news and  information.     In  the  longer  term,   if  more  frequencies  become available,   it may  be possible  in  the conurbations  to provide radio stations  specialising  in particular  types  of  programmes.     for london,   and perhaps  a  few other  conurbations,   medium frequencychannels  for more   than one  independent  station can be  found earlier,9.      The  task before  the  IBA stations will  present  them with a formidable  challenge.    They must  bring   in new  listeners.     Theymust compete with Radio  1  and Radio 2  to which  the majority ofthe present radio audiences now  listen.    Their programmes will need,   therefore,   to maintain a wide appeal.    They will not within  the  channel   space available   to  them be  able  to providefor as broad a range of different audiences  as  can  the BBC v/i thits  four national  services and its   local  network.    They will  beexpected however  to combine popular programming with fosteringa greater public awareness of   local  affairs  and  involvement  inthe community.IBA RADIO NEWS-10.    A central news  company  is  envisaged  to  supply a service ofnational  and  international news.    This would not necessarilyprovide  complete programmes   to  the  local   companies as  doesIndependent Television News;   it may be  thought  advisable  because ofthe different  characteristics  of radio  to allow greater  flexibility in  the use of  its material.     It  should however be a  source ofnational  and  international news.which will   in  time stand  comparisorwith  the bbc s  and  set a  standard  for   the   local  companies  intheir   treatment of   local news.     There are a number of  ways  in
which  this  central news company could be organised.     one possibility  is   that  Independent Television News might  extend its operations.    Another is a separate  Independent Radio News,organised on similar  lines   to   ITN and closely collaborating with it.    A  third possibility would be   to provide  two competingindependent  stations   in London from  the outset,   onespecialising  in music  and  the  other  in news.    This  latterstation could   then also act as  the supplier  of national  andinternat ional news   to  the  local  stations.    The  firstpossibility would make   for  economy,   and would provide   the  new-service with a ready-made   fund of  experience  on which  to draw.The  second would avoid any  possible major conflict  of   interestbetween  the  television companies   (which own  ITN)  and the local radio companies  which will  compete with  them.    The   third wouldexploit more  intensively  the service of a specialist Londonstation.     The Government will  consider  these possibilitiesfurther  in   the  light  of public reaction,THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT FOR IBA STATIONS11.     The  income  for  the new radio stations  will be  derived fromspot  advertising.    No other kinds of  advertising  such assponsored programmes v/ill  be permitted.12.     The  speed with which   the new service  is able   to develop will depend in great measure on  its ability  to attract  listeners.Estimates  of potential  revenue  are certain  to vary widely.Nevertheless,   in   the   larger conurbations  local  stations maywell  attract very  substantial   incomes.    Excessive profits mustnot  be allowed  to result  from  the exploitation of  radiofrequencies which are a scarce national asset.    Equally,   thefinancial  arrangements must be such as  to attract broadcastersof  ability,   to  support programmes of quality and  to ensure  thatthey  are available  as widely and as quickly  as possible.    Theterms of   the  contracts between  the authority and  the programme contractors will   take   these  factors &quot;into account.PROGRAMME CONTRACTS13.     Each  local  radio company will be given  the right and duty to provide  the   local  programmes  and  to sell  advertising time   inits  local   service.     Each will be appointed  for an  initial   term
of   th ree years.    Like   the BBC 1s,   the  ITA&apos;s  franchise   to broadcast will  end  in  1976 and   the  same  limitation will  be put to  the  franchise granted  to  the IBA.     Subject  to renewal  of   thealso have   the right  to grant,   at   the  end of  the  first  and eachand the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications will also havethe same rights of suspension or termination of contract rights as now exist  in  relation  to  television programme  contractors.14. The Government believes that this system of &quot;rolling&quot; threeyear contract periods is best suited to the needs of the radiocontracts. It will afford the IBA the opportunity to make a continuous assessment of the worth of the contrac tors in this new and untried field. The IBA&apos;s power to offer or withholdextension of the contracts will provide a warning system forthe  contractors.     It will help  them to keep  their own performanceiunder continual  surveillance:   it will  also assure  them of a year&quot;grace  after a  first occasion of non-renewal  in which  to bring their  standards up  to   the requirements of   the Authority.    TheGovernment believes   that programme  standards will  be bestmaintained by  such a combination of  strong powers  of  controlvested in  the  IBA with prospects  of greater  security of  tenurefor   the programme  contractors   than  can be obtained with fixed-term contracts.15.     The  same  company will not necessarily be precluded fromproviding service  at more  than one place.    Equally,   there willbe no  bar on  the minority participation by an  investor  in anumber of   local  companies;  but no  individual or  company will  beallowed an  excessive  aggregate  interest.    The Authority will beexpected  to aim at a wide diversity of ownership.IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER MEDIA16.     The Government has  considered with  care a variety of representations  from  those who believe  that  independent  radiomay be  injurious  tc   their existing businesses.     In particular,attention has  been paid  to  its possible effect on  the press.Even at   its most  successful,   radio will,   however,   be  a relatively small  contender  for advertising.    The Governmentfranchise,   the   intention  is,   however,   that  the Authority willsubsequent year,   extensions  for  a  further year.The Authority
believes   that future developments  in  independent   television could have  a  larger effect on the press,   and  that  in  their   timing  this effect must  be borne  in mind.     Such evidence  as   there  is doesnot  suggest  either   that  the  impact of   independent radio will necessarily be  damaging  to local newspapers.    Nonetheless,     theGovernment  accepts   the case  for giving  special  consideration  tothe   local  and provincial  press.     It believes moreover  that provided safeguards  can be  secured  against   the risks   inherent in  an undue  concentration of   the ownership of means of communication, theexisting media -   and  in particular,   the  local  press  and  the television company  -  can make  a valuable contribution  to  theoperation of  an  independent  radio service.    Accordingly,   theGovernment proposes  that:- local newspapers with a circulation which  is  significantin relation  to  the population of a  local  station&apos;stransmission area,   should have  the  right   to  acquire an interest  in  it,   whether or not   they form part  of   the companyawarded  the contract;- where a  local newspaper has  a monopoly  in an area  it willnot be  allowed  to acquire  a controlling  interest;- a  television company will not be a1 Lowed a controlling interest  in  the  area of  its   television franchise.CONCLUSION17.     It has  sometimes   seemed  that   television would almost completely supersede radio.     It   is now clear  that radio has anunmatched  flexibility  and immediacy which will guarantee  it a continuing place as  an important medium of  communication.    Public idemands on radio may have  changed.    People probably now listen to radio  for shorter periods at  a  time,   and more  often whiledoing  something  else;   but  there  is  evidence  from a number of countries  of a renewed growth in radio  listening.    The newindependent  local radio  stations will  provide an  element  oftcompetition with the BBC radio  services.    Each  service will  actupon and react   to  the other  to meet changing  tastes  and interests   to the general  benefit of   the listening public.    now that radio presents  current affairs  in greater depth and oftenin a more  controversial  style,   it  is  all  the more  important   to
offer   the  listener   the  choice of  an alternative  source ofnational  and  international   radio news.     Local  advertising onradio will   provide  a new and useful   service   to  the consumer,particularly   the housewife.     At   the   local   level,   the   independentstations will  have   the opportunity   to combine wide appeal with  a first  class  service of  local news  and  local  information.    TheGovernment  believes  that   the new stations will  add to  thevitality of broadcasting.     The  arrangements proposed  in  this white Paper will  enable   them  to make a worthwhile  contribution,particularly  in  exploring  the po tent ialitie s   of   local radio,   andwill  encourage   the BBC to add further  to its notable  record of achievement  in   sound broadcasting.Revised 22 March 1971
APPENDIX AFREQUENCY PLANS FOR INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING1.      Only  the Authority responsible  for planning the  system will  be  ableto decide where  it wants   the stations   and how many  it will need-    until these requirements  are known frequency planning mus t,   to  a large  extent,be hypothetical.2.      Any plan  for  expanding radio services  is   limited by  the  radiofrequencies   that  can be made  available and  these are  always  in  short supply.    Three  frequency bands  are used for domestic  sound broadcastingin  the European Broadcasting Area*:     the   low frequency  (If)  band  (alsoknown as   the  long-wave  band)   the medium-frequency  (mf) band  (also knownas   the medium-wave  band)   and   the very-high-frequency   (vhf)   band   (alsoknown as  Broadcasting Band II).    The use  of  frequency channels   in  theIf  and mf  bands  is  regulated by  the European Broadcasting  Convention(Copenhagen,   1948)  and  the Copenhagen Pl,an annexed  to  it;   the use ofthe vhf  band is regulated  in accordance with a Regional Agreement  forthe European Broadcasting Area  (Stockholm,   1961).    Notes  on frequencyplanning  standards  appear at Appendix B.3 .       Low-frequency  bandThe  If  band contains  only 15  separate  frequency channels,   one of whichis  assigned  to  the United Kingdom and  is  used by  the BBC for Radio 2transmissions   from Droitwich.     In  this band signals  are  reliablytransmitted  for  relatively   long distances by day and night and  the  bandis  therefore well  suited  to   the  transmission of nation-wide  services.It would not  be possible   to use any of  the other  14  If channels   for  anational  commercial   service  in  the United Kingdom without causingharmful  interference  to  the  country authorised  to use  it;   it would alsobe wasteful   to use an  If  channel  for   local  services.4.      Medium-frequency bandThe mf  band contains  121   separate  frequency channels,   all  of  which are used intensively  in  the European Broadcasting Area  for domesticbroadcasting  and  to a lesser  extent for  external broadcasting,   ie,   the broadcasting of  programmes  intended  to be received  in countries  otherthan  those  in which  they originate._* Europe,   together with  those African and Asian countries  bordering   theMediterranean,   plus  Jordan and  Iraq.......u
5.      The medium frequency channels assigned for United Kingdom use by  the  Copenhagen Convention, 1948, are employed by   the  BBC for   three  oftheir  four national  services,   and  in  1966  the Government  of   the  daystated  in a White  Paper   (cmd  3169,   December  1966)   that:&quot;No general  service of   local  sound broadcasting which would beavailable  during   the  hours  of  darkness  as well  as   in daylightcan be  provided only on medium wavelengths  allotted  to   theUnited Kingdom&quot;.This  statement  was  based on  the  assumption  that   the main mf   services would be maintained  in   their   then existing  form.     On   this  basis   it   isstill   true   today,   but  it  is nevertheless possible   (subject  in somecases   to negotiations  with  other  administrations   in   the  EuropeanBroadcasting Area)   to  re-deploy certain of the medium frequencychannels  the BBC use and  to make   some  available  for other purposes.Thus,   as  the BBC  themselves  envisaged -   though  as  part of   their plans for  a general  service of  BBC local  rad,io with medium frequency back-upit  is proposed  to close down  the  alternative versions of Radio 4that are provided  in various parts  of England,   and provide  a commonRadio 4 service  for  the whole of   the country  (services   to Wales,Scotland and Northern  Ireland would not  be  affected)..    The combinedEnglish programme will   then be accommodated with some  improvement ofcoverage,   on  three  frequency  channels   instead of   the  six at  present used.    Thus   three  channels will  become  available  for other uses.    a fourth,   can be  found by  confining  the Radio  3 mf  service  to a singlechannel at negligible  cost  in Radio  3 coverage.6.      One of  the channels   thus  freed will be used  to augment  our external  broadcasting  services.     The  three  remaining channels will contribute   towards  the  provision of  mf  back-up for  local  radio.However,   even with  the addition of. the   International  CommonFrequencies which  the UK is  entitled  to use  it would not be possibleto provide  a general  service of  day  and night   time  back-up  for   thetwo  local  services   (BBC and  IBA)   envisaged.7.      To provide medium  frequencies  for  further  local  stations,  afterthe  fullest use has  been made of   those  already available  to  theUnited Kingdom,   the Government  intends   to make proposals,  by means  ofthe  procedure provided  in Article 8 of   the Copenhagen Convention,   and article 9  of   the Radio Regulations   (edition of   1968)  of   theinternational Telecommunication Union,   for  the use of   the  frequencies
assigned  to  other  countries   in   the European Broadcasting Area   incases where   it  seems   likely   that medium frequency  channels   for additional   local   radio  stations  could be provided  in   the UnitedKingdom,   without  causing harmful  interference  to  those  countries  atpresent  authorised  to use  them.    Decisions   to  establish  stations  atparticular  places,   or using  particular   frequencies under  theseprocedures,   cannot be made   firm until   the  procedures  have  beenc omp1e t e d.8.       Local  stations   operating  on  frequencies   assigned  to othercountries  will   generally have  a  smaller useful   service  area at nightbecause  of   interference  from the stations  overseas and might,   in somecases,   have  to be operated on  lower power  at night   to avoid harmfulinterference   to the  service   in  other countries.    Nevertheless,   theaddition of   a  substantial  number of   local   radio   stations  operating  on.other countries&apos;   frequencies  should  first  permit  of   the   establishmentof  an independent  local network of up  to  60  stations  covering  up  to  70per cent of   the population of   the United   Kingdom by day and  25 percent  by  night.     It would also  provide   scope   for mf  back-up  for  BBClocal  radio  extending  eventually   to  perhaps   50% of   the  populationof  England by day.     It  will   bepossible   in London and perhaps   in a  few other places  to provide  asecond   independent   station on mf.     The  coverage of ,the  local  stationswill  depend very much upon  the   sites chosen  for  them and  thepopulation coverage  figures  quoted above are   therefore necessarilyvery approximate.9.       The  International  Telecommunication Union proposes   to hold aninternational  conference  to review and revise   the  CopenhagenConvention and Plan  for  the use of   low and medium frequencies   in  theEuropean Broadcasting Area.    The present proposal  by  theAdministrative Council  of   the  ITU  is  that   the  first phase  of   such aconference  should  take place  in 1974.    The working  assumption  is,therefore,   that  a new Convention and Plan will  come  into  force,   byabout  1976.     Changes  - which might  be extensive  -   to our nationaldeployment of medium frequency  channels might   then be needed.f10.     Very high frequenciesThe BBC  is providing  20  local  stations  in England  in a part of   the vhfband,   recently made available  for broadcasting,   lying between 95 and97.5 MHz.     By making a modest  reduction  in  the   total  coverage of  thepresent  20 BBC local  stations  and rearranging  some of   the  frequenciesit  appears possible   to accommodate   them and,   in addition,   up  to  60.
independent  stations.     These would mainly use  lower power  than  the bbc  stations  and be   intended   to  serve   individual   towns  or  cities  andtheir   immediate  environs.     In  spite  of   the greater  number  of   stations in  the  IBA network,   its  total  coverage would be  only about   the  sameas   that  of   the BBC network  ie   about  65  per  cent   of  UK by  day  and night,11.    To  achieve  greater coverage  for both BBC and  independent  local radio  stations   in vhf,   or   to provide   two   independent   stations   inmore  areas,   will   require   additional   frequency channels.     TheGovernment will   therefore be  considering whether additional  space in  the very high frequency band between 9&apos;7.6  and 100 MHz,   at  present used  for mobile  radio   services,   could  be  freed  for  broadcasting.This may,   even  in   the   longer   term,   be difficult  but  if   all   or  part ofthis  additional   space  were   to become  available   for  broadcasting  andwas not  required for other purposes   (eg   the Open University),   itcould be used  to improve  and extend  the   local  broadcasting  services.
APPENDIX B.  FREQUENCY PLANNING STANDARDS1,      This  appendix outlines   the   reception   standards  which have  been used  in formulating   the   frequency plans  described  in  the  main paper and  in   the  preceding  appendix.Medium Frequency Band2,      During daytime  a mf  signal   is  propagated by  a stable  &quot;ground wave&quot;which  travels  over  the surface of   the  earth and has  a range which  is determined by various   factors  such as ifrequejncy   (signals  on  lowerfrequencies  reach,  farther   than   those  on frequencies   at   the upper  end  ofthe band),   ground conductivity   (signals   travel  better over  ground witha good  conductivity  or  over  sea water),   and  the power of   the   transmitter.3.      Beginning  about  one  hour  before  sunset,   changes   in   the   ionospherestart   to  affect   the propagation  of mf   signals  and  in  addition   to   theground wave,   sky wave  propagation  takes place.    That   is   to say,   signalsleaving   the   transmitter  in a skyward direction are reflected backtowards   the  ear th again  and  strong but variable  signals may  appear onthe ground,   at places  up  to many hundreds of kilometres  from thetransmitter.     The  effect  reaches   a maximum at   about  midnight  and   thengradually dies   away,   becoming  almost  negligible  by  about  one  hour  aftersunrise.     The  sky wave from a  transmitter can have  two effects:     first,it can  interfere with  the ground wave  from  the same   transmitter,   causing the signals  towards   the   limits  of   the  service  area  to fade  at night;service range  of  a broadcasting  transmitter is  the distance  from thetransmitter at which   the  strength of   the  signal  has  fallen   to  the lowest  level   that gives  sound of  a satisfactory quality  from thelistener&apos;s  receiver.     However,   such  is   the  intensive use of   the mfchannels  in Europe,   some  1440  stations,   including 450 of  10 kW power or above, being operated op   the  121  channels available,   that   theservice  range of  almost  every   transmitter  at night  is   limited byinterference  from other  transmitters using   the same  channel.    The  servicerange  is   then  the distance  from  the   transmitter  at which  the  strengthof  the wanted signal   is   sufficiently  in excess of   the   strength of   theinterfering  signal   to give  a quality of  sound satisfactory  to  thelistener.    Even  in daytime,   if   transmitters using  the   same  frequencychannel  are closely spaced on  the ground,   the  service  range of  each ofthem may be  limited by  interference  from  the other.and secondly,   it  can  cause   interference,   at great distances,   to  the reception of  other  signals  in  the  same  frequency channel.4.      In  the  absence of  interference  from other transmissions,   the
5, The quality of service provided by a mf broadcasting station toan individual listener depends upon many factors, the most importantbeing :(i)    Effective power of wanted-signal  transmitter,(ii)    Frequency of wanted-signa1   transmitter,(iii)    Distance between  receiving site and transmitter,(iv)    Nature  of   the   intervening   terrain.(v)    Propagation characteristics  by day and night,(vi)    The  nature   (ie  factors  i   to v above)  of  any othertransmissions  on  the  same   frequency  channel,(vii)     The  nature  of   any   transmissions  on  adjacent   frequencychannels   (which may  also  cause   interference   in  certain circumstances,particularly with receivers having poor selectivity).6.      Given all   this   data  it   is   possible   to  estimate   for  any givenreceiving  site   the  ratio of   the   strength of   the wanted  signal   from a defined   transmitter   to   that of   any   interfering   signal  on  the  same,   oran adjacent  frequency channel.    However,   the  quality of  receptionjudged by  the   listener   is   still   subject   to   two variable  factors:(viii)     The  quality of   the   1istener&apos;s   receiving   installation.(ix)    The   subjective  judgment  of  each individual   listener  taking into account his personal   tastes  and  the character of  the programmematerial   to which he   is  listening.7.      When planning new stations   it   is  clearly necessary  to adoptcertain  standards which,   in  relation  to   items viii  and  ix,  must  bearbitrary.    The Copenhagen Convention and Plan gives no guidance onthis point but   in recent years  following a great deal  of work and discussion  the  International Consultative Committee on Radiocommuni cat ions(CCIR)   technical  consultative  committee  of  the  InternationalTel ecommunication    Union -  has made recommendations  for mf  broadcastingwhich may be  summarised as  follows:(i)    Minimum, signal   strength giving satisfactory service  in  theabsence  of   interference  -  1 mi Hi volt per metre   (mV/m).(ii)    The radio-frequency protection ratio   (ratio of wan t eel-s i gna 1strength  to  interfering  signal  strength)  for  a non-fading  signalon   the same  frequency  -  100:1(iii)    Radio  frequency protection  ratio  for  a  fading  signal  on   thesame frequency  (midnight median value)   -  100:1.(iv)    Radio  frequency protection  ratio  for non-fading  signal  on anadjacent  channel  -  4:1.
8.       In  the  area surrounding  a  transmitter,   the  field strength,   in -mV/m    decreases   as   the  distance   from  the   transmitter   increases.Without   interference,   the   service  area  of   a   transmitter   is  considered to  be   the  area over which a  signal   strength of  at   least   lmV/rn  is available.     If  a co-channel  interfering  signal   is  present  of  strength0.1 mV/m,   then   the  service  area of   the   transmitter would be  reducedto  that  over which   the   signal   strength was  at   least   10 mV/m   (100 .x 0,1)with   an  interfering  signal   field  strength of   1  mV/rn   (which  could be experienced by day  if  co-channel   transmitters were  too  closely  spaced,or  at night   from very powerful  distant   transmitters)   then   the  servicearea would  be   that  over which  the  signal   strength   is   at   least  100 mV/m(100 x 1 ) .9.      These  figures  relate   to a good  standard of  service  in which  theinterfering programme would be   just   audible  during  quiet   intervals   inthe wanted  signal.    Many people  will  argue   that  this  is  a betterstandard  than   is  really necessary,   and   indeed  at   international   &apos;frequency planning  conferences   it  is not uncommon  to  accept  a protection ratio of  about  50:1.     A value of  about  30:1   is considered to be  the   lowest value   that could be accepted  in places where  theneed  for new  services   is  pressing,   and   this   is   the value   of   protectionupon which  the coverage  estimates  for medium frequency   local radio are based  in  the body of   this paper.    Many more people,   living outside   theservice area calculated on  this  basis will   receive  signals  from localmf  stations well   above  the usable  limit of   1 mV/m,   but. with a protectioratio of  less   than 30:1.    Within  the service  area as  so  defined peoplereceiving  stronger signals will   get a better quality of  service withprotection  ratios  greater   than 30:1.1 0.     Very-high-frequency bandSignals   from  a vhf   transmitter are  stable  up   to  and  somewhat beyondhorizon distance  from the   transmitting  aerial.    At greater distances,signals  become weaker  and vary  in strength  (fade).    The  signals  do notvary  appreciably between day  and night  so   that  the coverage  of a vhfstation remains  constant  throughout   the 24 &quot;hours.    Apart  from this,   theproblems which  arise  in planning a vhf  service  are  similar  to  those for an mf  service but,   since  the vhf  signal   is  frequency-modulated,   the recommended service  standards are different.     Those recommended bythe CCIR are:-
(i)     Minimum signal   strengths  giving  satisfactory   service   in  theabsence of  interference  from other  transmissions:in  rural  areas:       0.25 mV/min urban areas:       1 mV/min  large  cities:     3 mV/m(These  standards  allow  for   the varying  incidence of  interferencefrom motor  cars,   electrical machinery  etc,   in different   types  ofenvi ronment).(ii)     Protection  ratio  for  interference  from a stable  signal  on  thesame   frequency:     60:1.(iii)     Protection ratio  against  fading   interference  (exceeded for99% of   the   time):     25:1.(iv)    Protection ratio  against  interfering  signals  on:the  adjacent  channels: 4:1the next-but-one channels: 2:1^the next-but-two channels: 1:2the next-but-three channels:     1:10il.    The plan  for  the existing BBC  local  stations  is  based on a signalstrength   limit  of  0.25 mV/m but   in   the  revised plan  for  a   total  ofabout  80  stations  a  number of   these would have  a  poorergrade of  service.   The  requirements  at  iv above place  severelimitations  on   the  frequency  channels   that may be used  to serveadjaeent or overlapping areas.     However,  where   these conditions  are metsome  interference may be experienced  from neighbouring channels   ifreceivers  are used having  a  lower  selectivity  than  that upon which  theCCIR recommendation  above was  based.12.    Furthermore,   receivers using  transistors  are subject  to overloadingin  the presence of a strong  local  signal,   which  then  interferes withwanted signals   that  are well  spaced  from it  in frequency.    This  effectmust be minimised by carefully  siting  the   transmitter  so  thatrelatively  few  listeners  are within  its  strong  signal  range.
