DRAFT WHITE paper the 1971 INCREASES AND OTHER CHANGES IN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITSPART I - introduction.    The Government are today introducing a Bill to give effect to the increases in national insurance and industrial injuries benefits; parallel improvements inwar pensions and supplementary benefits will also be provided under appropriateinstruments.2j    In addition to a general increase in benefit and pension rates from the week beginning 20 September 1971 the Government&apos;s proposals include a number of selectiveimprovements and changes following on those already made in the National InsuranceAct 1970, which provided pensions for those very elderly non-pensioners left out of insurance in 19^8 (from November 1970), pensions for women widowed between the ages of 40 and 50 (from April 1971) and the attendance allowance for the very severelydisabled (due to start in December 1971).   The improvements now proposed will benefit in particular chronic sick and disabled people incapable of work - &quot;invaliditypensioners&quot; - and their dependants.   For the very elderly there will be retirement pensions for all non-pensioners over the age of 80, and a small age addition to the pension for all retirement pensioners over 80.   To assist those who are just overpensionable age the earnings rule will be eased and increments for deferredretirement will be increased.   The contribution increases required to finance thehigher benefits will be concentrated on the graduated contributions and the flat rate contributions of employees and employers will remain unchanged (apart from minor adjustments to industrial injuries contributions), to avoid imposing a disproportionateburden on the lower paid; there will be consequential modifications to the earnings-related provision for sickness, unemployment and widowhood.   Flat rate contributions for the self employed and the non-employed will be increased.3.    The selective changes described in the preceding paragraph are to be extendedwhere appropriate to those whose benefits are under the war pensions and theindustrial injuries schemes instead of the national insurance scheme.
*4.     In the supplementary benefits scheme there are to be relatively largerIncreases in the scale rates for adolescents within a general increase in the scalerates, and the long-term addition is to be enhanced for households in whichbeneficiaries over 80 are living.PART II - NATIONAL INSURANCE BENEFITSMAIN INCREASES5.     The standard weekly rates of flat-rate retirement and widows&apos; pensions, and offlat-rate unemployment and sickness benefit will be increased from  5 to  6 for asingle person and from  8.10 to  9.70 for a married couple.   Dependency increases for children vary according to the type of benefit and the amount of family allowances, if any, payable.   The normal rate is at present  1.55 for the eldestchild with lower rates for other children so as to bring the total for each child,including family allowances, up to that amount.   This rate will go up to  1.85.   Thechildren of widows attract a specially high rate, at present  2.^5 (including family allowances where these are payable).   This will go up to  2.95 and will be extendedalso to the children of other long-term beneficiaries, that is invalidity andretirement pensioners (see para 22).   The weekly rate of guardian&apos;s allowance and child&apos;s special allowance will be raised from  2.^5 to  2.95.6.    The weekly rate of old person&apos;s pension payable under the provisions of the1970 National Insurance Act will be increased from  5 to  3.60.   The weekly ratefor a married woman, at present  1.85, will be increased to  2.20.   These will alsobe the rates for the extension of the old person&apos;s pension described in paragraph 23.7. The Bill also increases the weekly rate of attendance allowance provided for inthe 1970 Act and payable from December 1971 from Sh to  ^.80.8. The weekly rates of widow&apos;s basic pension and contributory old age pension payable to certain widows under the former Contributory Pensions Acts are to beincreased from  1.50 to  1.80.2
9.    The increments which a man, or a woman insured in her own right, can earn bydeferring retirement and continuing to work for up to 5 years beyond the minimumpension age (65 for men, 60 for women) will be increased from 5p to 6p a week forevery 9 flat-rate national insurance contributions paid during deferred retirement.Corresponding improvements are to be made in the increments to wives&apos; and widows&apos;pensions.10.   The Bill also proposes a further relaxation in the earnings rule which affect6the retirement pensions of men between 65 and 70 and women between 60 and 65 by raising the weekly earnings free of the rule from  7.50 to  9.50.   For higherearnings the present tapering arrangements will continue unchanged.EARNINGS-RELATED SUPPLEMENT11.   The Bill proposes changing the basis of this supplement which is paid withflat rate benefit during the first 6 months of unemployment, sickness or widowhood.123   The supplement is at present paid on weekly earnings between  9 and  30.   TheGovernment now propose to increase the lower limit to  10 to take some account of theincrease in earnings levels since the supplement was introduced in 1966.   At the sametime the upper limit will be extended to  42 in line with the new upper limit forgraduated contributions (see paragraph 42).13.   The weekly rates of earnings-related supplement will be one-third (as at present)of the amount of average weekly earnings (calculated as one-fiftieth of earnings from employment in the relevant income tax year) lying between  10 and  30, and 15 percent of any earnings lying between  30 and  42.14.   The new rates will start after the end of the 1972/73 income tax year, by which time contributions will have been paid for a full year up to the new earnings levelof  42.   The new rates will apply only to new claimants after the operative date,when earnings in the 1972/73 income tax year will be used for calculating benefit.
restrictedThe supplement of beneficiaries whose entitlement is established by reference to earnings in earlier income tax years will continue unchanged.15.   The supplement will still be limited, where appropriate, to the amount necessaryto raise the total weekly benefit (including any dependency increases) to 85 per cent of average weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year.   The Bill also providesthat this limit should apply where earnings-related supplement is paid in addition toinjury benefit in the Industrial Injuries scheme.^EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT FOR OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONERS16.   The Government accept the view expressed by the National Insurance AdvisoryCommittee in 1968 (Cmnd 35^5) that the payment of unemployment benefit and the granting of contribution credits to occupational pensioners who are not effectively in the field of employment constitutes a misuse of the National Insurance Fund.   They have at thesame time noted the strong feelings among some occupational pensioners about theirliability to pay a weekly Class 3 (non-employed person&apos;s) contribution until age 65 forany period when they are not working and are not entitled to receive a contributioncredit on grounds of unemployment or sickness.17.   Accordingly while the Bill provides for restrictions of the kind recommended bythe National Insurance Advisory Committee on the payment of unemployment benefit andthe award of credits to certain occupational pensioners over 60, it also makes thepayment of contributions as a non-employed person voluntary after the age of 60.   the cessation of this liability will apply not just to occupational pensioners but toeverybody between 60 and 65 who is a non-employed person.   As women qualify for retirement pension at age 60, the effect of this change will in practice be confined tomen.18.   There will be two additional conditions for benefit and contribution credits foroccupational pensioners over the age of 60.   Those with pensions of  30 a week or morewill not be eligible for either unemployment benefit or contribution credits unless they have first demonstrated their continued attachment to the employment field by working a minimum of 21 hours a week for an employer in a new occupation for at least
6 months since their retirement and in the year before the date of their claim.Those with occupational pensions of more than  18 a week (including those with  jJOor more who have satisfied the condition of further work described above) will have their unemployment benefit reduced by the excess of their occupational pension over 18 a week.   Some minor changes will also be made to reinforce existing case lawand these new provisions.MEASURES FOR THE CHRONIC SICKInvalidity pension and invalidity allowance19.   At present anyone who has paid 156 contributions as an employed or self-employedperson may, if he thereafter qualifies for sickness benefit, draw this benefit foran indefinite period - if necessary until it is replaced by a retirement pension.Under the Bill it is proposed that a person with such indefinite title to benefit will, after six months&apos; entitlement to sickness benefit receive an &quot;invalidity pension&quot;.   This pension will be payable to all who are eligible for it - includingmarried women - at the full standard rates for national insurance benefits -  6single and  3.70 for a wife - proposed under the Bill.   In addition to it, people who fall sick acre than five years before pensionable age will qualify for a newbenefit which is to be called &quot;invalidity allowance&quot;.   The Bill provides forthe maximum rate of this new allowance -  1 a week - to be paid to people whoseincapacity for work begins before age 35; an allowance of 60p a week will be payable where the onset of the incapacity falls between the ages of 35 and ^5;and an allowance of 30p where the onset occurs between h3 and 60 (55 for women).These allowances will be paid to those of the existing chronic sick who are under pension age at the rate appropriate to the age at which illness began;where illness has been oontinuous since 5 July 19^8, the  1 rate will apply.Anyone who has qualified for invalidity allowance and is still receiving it atpension age will have an amount equal to the allowance added to his or herretirement pension entitlement as a life-long benefit.
20.     Parallel arrangements will be introduced for people in receipt ofurtemployability supplement under the war pensions and industrial injuries schemes.Help for the working wives of the chronic sick21.     The Government also propose to modify the present rule under which theincrease of benefit for a dependent wife is totally withdrawn as soon as herearnings exceed whatever the amount laid down for that increase may be from timeto time.   Instead the dependent wife of an invalidity or retirement pensionerwho is residing with him will become subject to the same tapered earnings ruleas will apply to retirement pensioners themselves, which will not begin to operate until earnings exceed  9.50.Higher benefits for the children of the chronic sick22.     Finally, as mentioned in paragraph 5, the Government propose that the increases of benefit paid for the dependent children of invalidity and retirement pensioners should be raised to the higher rates hitherto paid only for thechildren of widows.   This represents a further measure of help for the family man who has become chronically sick, since the increase of benefit which he receivesfor each child (at present  1.55 a week including family allowances) will underthe Eill nearly double to a new figure of  2.95 a week (also including family allowances).6f^ESTOSGTEO
7MEASURES FOR THE VERY ELDERLYPensions for persons aged 80 and over23.   A retirement pension of  3.60 a week ( 2.20 for a married woman) will beprovided for elderly people when they reach age 80 if they are not already getting anational insurance pension or if they are getting a national insurance pension at lessthan these rates.   The pension will be a personal benefit and will be subject to aresidence test.   Married women who reach age 80 whether before or after their husbands will qualify at that age for the rate appropriate to married women and will get the  3.60 rate of pension on widowhood.   Entitlement will arise from theappropriate pay day in the week commencing 20 September 1Q71 for those who havereached age 80, and at age 80 for those who reach it subsequently.24.   Age addition is proposed that anyone entitled to national insurance retirement pension,including the pension for the over 80s, should receive an age addition of 25p a week to their retirement pension from the age of 80 or from the week beginning20 September 1971 if hy then they have already attained that age.   War andindustrial injuries pensioners aged 80 and over will also receive the age additioneven if their retirement pension is extinguished by the overlapping benefit rules,TABLE   OP RATES25.   A list of the proposed new rates of retirement pension and other national insurance benefits (with the existing rates shown in italics) is given in Appendix I.Corresponding improvements will be made in pensions and benefits payable at less thanthe standard rates.PART III - INDUSTRIAL INJURIES26.   The current weekly rates of injury benefit will be increased from  7.75 to  8,75for a single person and from  10.85 to  12.45 for a married couple.   The pension
I RESTRICTEDfor an assessment of 100 per cent disablement will be increased from  8.40 to  10,with proportionate increases in the rates for lower assessments.   The maximumgratuity (for assessments below 20 per cent) will be raised from  550 to  660.The rates of all the allowances paid with disablement benefit will also be increased.The pension for widows, which is at present  5*55 is to be raised to  6.55*   further details are given in Appendix II.27.   The selective improvements for the chronic sick described in paragraphs 19 to 22are to be extended to disablement pensioners receiving unemployability supplement.Provision is also being made so that, regardless of the actual cause of death,industrial death benefit for widows and other dependants can be paid for the death ofan industrial disablement pensioner receiving constant attendance allowance at thenormal maximum or a higher rate.28.   The allowances payable out of the Industrial Injuries Fund for certain persons suffering from industrial injuries or diseases due to employment before 5 July 1948,when workmen^ compensation was operative, are also to be raised, and the improvementsfor unemployability supplement will also apply.   The provision for these persons, whoare generally referred to as &quot;old cases&quot;, is intended to bring them broadly into line with their counterparts under the Industrial Injuries Scheme.29*   It is proposed to bring the Industrial Injuries Scheme into line with the mainNational Insurance scheme as regards the adjustment of benefit to those receivingfree hospital in-patient treatment for prolonged periods.   Benefits under the mainscheme have long been subject to reduction or suspension by virtue of regulations made under the National Insurance Act.   The Bill will give the Secretary of Statepower to make similar regulations under the Industrial Injuries Acts.PART IV - WAR PENSIONS30.   The principal benefits under the war pensions scheme will be increased bybroadly the same percentage as national insurance benefits.   In addition there will
RESTRICTEDbe substantial improvements in most of the preferential allowances which are peculiar to the war pensions scheme.   In this way the Government are implementing theirpledge to maintain the value of the war pensions preference.   In common with thecommunity at large, war pensioners will of course be entitled also to any improvements in other social security benefits which they may be receiving.DISABLEMENT PENSIONERS31.   The 100$rate of disablement pension, now  8.40 a week excluding rank additions,will be increased to  10 with proportionate increases for lower assessments.   Officers&apos;rates will be similarly increased.   Those supplementary allowances which were lastincreased in 1967, age, comforts, and clothing allowances will all go up as willexceptionally severe disablement allowance which is to be increased for the first time since it was introduced in 1966, and severe disablement occupational allowancewhich has not previously been increased since it first came into payment in 1961.32.   The war pensioner receiving unemployability supplement will get the same improvedbenefits as the national insurance invalidity pensioner.   These are the invalidityallowance   relating to the age of onset of the incapacity, the higher children&apos;sdependency allowances and, where he has a working wife, the relaxation of the earnings rule and higher short-term benefits for sickness and unemployment will also apply in appropriate circumstances.   Disability pensioners aged 80 and over will receive the age addition to retirement pension as well as any war pension age allowancewhich may be in payment.WAR WIDOWS33.   The standard rate of war pension for the widow of a private soldier at present 6.50 a week will be increased to  7.80 a week.   Pensions for widows of non-commissioned, warrant and commissioned officers will be similarly increased.34.   A new provision will be introduced to enable war widow&apos;s pension and allowances to be paid irrespective of the cause of death to a widow whose war disabled husband9
was receiving constant attendance allowance at the normal maximum or a higher rate.Other dependants of war disablement pensioners who die in these circumstances may also qualify for the appropriate death benefit.35*   War widows over 80 will receive the age addition to any retirement pension theyare getting or would be getting but for their war widows1 pensions.   This will be on top of the war widow&apos;s age allowance (at present 75P a week, to be increased to  1)which they already receive from age 70.   There is also to be a new allowance of 50pa week for war widows between 65 and 70.36.   Details of old and new rates of the main war pensions and allowances are givenin Appendix III.PART V   SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFITS37*   The Government also propose to raise supplementary benefits.   The changes will be made by regulations, a draft of which will be laid before both Houses ofParliament for approval.   For the two main categories, the single house-holder andthe married couple, the level of requirements will be increased by 60p and 95p to 5.80 and  9.45 respectively.   When this increase is taken together with theincrease they received in November 1970, they will then have had Increases of  1and  1.60 respectively since November 1969 - the same increases as are now proposedin the standard rates of national insurance benefits, which have remained unchangedsince that date.38.   The effect will be that the single pensioner householder, for example, willhave his total income made up to at least  6.30 (including the long term additionof 50p) plus rent.   When supplementary benefits were increased in November 1970*retirement pensions did not go up, but he then got his extra income by way of anincrease of 40p in the amount of supplementary benefit paid to him.   From September 1971his income, in the ordinary case, will include a  1 increase in retirement pension,
which means that he will need 40p less in supplementary benefit than now to give him the further 60p increase in his total income.   In other words, unlike the generality of retirement pensioners, he will have been getting at least 40p more since november 1970, and will be getting a further 60p as a result of the proposed increases.39*   The Government also propose two selective improvements in the supplementary- benefits scheme.   The first is a selective increase of 25p in the long-term additionof 50Ps to be paid where either the claimant or a dependant whose requirements and resources fall to be aggregated with his is aged 80 or. over.   The object of this isto provide some additional benefit for those among the oldest supplementary pensioners(the great majority of whom are widows and single women) who are not already havingexceptional needs met by special additions to their weekly benefit.40.   The second selective improvement is a proportionately higher rate of increase for adolescents.   Both those who are over 16 and claimants in their own right and thosewho are the dependants of claimants (mainly children aged 13-15 but also those over16 and under 21 who are still in full-time education) will benefit.   The object ofthis is to narrow the existing gaps between the adolescent and adult rates and toprovide additional help, especially for parents in receipt of supplementary benefitwho have older children.41.   Details of the supplementary benefit increases, including those for the blind,are given in Appendix IV.PART VI CONTRTBTJTION CHANGES42.   The Government has decided that the fairest way to meet the cost of the improvements in the national insurance benefits payable out of the National insurance fund is to increase the percentage rate of graduated contributions for earnings of 18 and upwards and at the same time extend the range of earnings on which graduated contributions are payable.   An increase will be required in the flat-rate contributions of self-employed and non-employed persons, who do not pay graduated contributions, in
RESTRICTEDorder to ensure that they pay their fair share of the cost of improved benefits.In general the flat-rate contributions of employed persons will not be increased.The graduated contributions paid by employees and employers on earnings between 18 and  30 a week will be increased from 3.25 per cent to 4*35 per cent, and contributions of 4&quot;35 per cent will also become payable on earnings between  30 and 42 a week.  The additional graduated contributions will earn corresponding graduated pension rights.   There will be no increase in the graduated contributions now payable on earnings below  18 a week.   The increased emphasis on graduated contributions isa move towards the Governmenfs long-term objective of fully graduated contributions for employed persons.43.   At present flat-rate Class 1 (employed person&apos;s) contributions become payablewhen earnings ordinarily exceed  4 per week, or otherwise in any week when actualearnings exceed  4.   This threshold is to be raised to  5 from September 1971, soreducing the number of workers whose employment prospects are affect by a flat-rate contribution which is high in proportion to the value of the work done.   At presentself-employed or tiorsr-employed persons whose income is  312 a year or less can obtainexception from the liability to pay contributions.   This limit is being raised to 468 a year.44.   The cost of industrial injuries benefits is met by flat-rate industrial injuriescontributions which are usually payable as part of the combined national insurance contribution.   In order to secure that there should be no increase in the total flat-rate contribution to pay for the higher industrial injuries benefits, the cost willlargely be met by adjusting the industrial injuries and national insurance componentsof the combined contribution.  The resulting fall in the income of the national insurance Fund will be met from the proposed higher graduated contributions.    Underthese proposals employees liable for an industrial injuries contribution only (egmarried women who have chosen not to pay flat-rate national insurance contributions)will pay an additional 1p a week on their industrial injuries contribution.12RESTRICTED

Appendix V, Table A provides further examples of the effect of the increases in contributions for employed men and women (class 1) including the contracted out.Appendix V Table B gives the details of the new and existing weekly flat-rate contributions for the self-employed (Class 2) and non-employed (Class 3), as well as for the main rates for employed persons and their employers.46.   The additional graduated contributions will earn graduated pension rights for those participating in the graduated pension scheme and for those who are contracted out.   Graduated contributions do not automatically attract an Exchequer supplementin the same way as flat-rate contributions (see Appendix V) but the special payments from the Consolidated Fund provided for in the National Insurance Act 1969 will beincreased so as to bring the total supplement to about 18% of the contribution income.PART VII COSTS47-   The extra cost to the Exchequer in the first full year   by way of the increasein the Exchequer supplement resulting from the changes in flat-rate contributions will be above  7 million.   The special Exchequer payments of  45 million a yearprovided for in the National Insurance Act 1969 (because graduated contributions donot automatically attract an Exchequer supplement) will be increased to  135 million for 1971/72 and 1972/73 and  185 million a year thereafter.   These payments will maintain the total Exchequer support to the scheme at about 18$ of the contribution income.14
48.   The additional cost of the extra benefits being paid out of the national insurance Fund and the Industrial Injuries Fund will be  539 million (including 24 million for improvements for the chronic side) and  20 million respectively inthe first full year.   Against this, the proposal to restrict the payment ofunemployment benefit to occupational pensioners will save about  2 million in thefirst full year and there will be savings of about  0.35 million a year from theproposals to adjust industrial injuries benefits in the same way as national insurance benefits when the beneficiary is in hospital, and to apply the 85 per cent limit to the earnings related supplement paid in addition to injury benefit.   A detailedexplanation of the financial effects of the benefit and contribution changes on thenational insurance schemes is contained in a Report on the Financial Provisions of theBill by the Government Actuary /Command       J,49*   The cost of the other benefit changes dealt with in the White Paper will bemet from the Consolidated Fund.   The cost of extending old persons&apos; pensions to non-pensloners over 80 is  7 million in the first full year, and the cost ofincreasing all old persons&apos; pensions to the new rates is  6 million.   The cost ofincreasing the rate of attendance allowance is  2 million.   The improvements in warpensions will cost an extra  22 million in the first full year.50.
