THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF TIER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(71) 45V    1 COPY NO   6230 March 3.971CABINETCIVIL SERVICE N ON-INDUSTRIAL manpower memorandum by the Lord Privy seal,        On 22 December 1970 the Cabinet endorsed proposals toreduce the number of non-industrial civil servants below 500,000 by1 April 1971, to frame staff estimates within an upper limit of 510,000for 1 April 1972, and to seek during 1971-72 to reduce numberstowards 500, 000 by progressively eliminating functions(CM(70) 48th Conclusions, Minute 5),    We are- as a result of theco-operation shown by my colleague sff achieving the first two of the objectives.    I have, however. come to the firm conclusion that we canonly achieve the third by a further decision now,2.        Summing up the discussion on 22 December 1970 the PrimeMinister said that reduction to 500,000 by I April 1972 would requireradical action to reduce functioned    Experience since shows that, even with the economies to be achieved by greater managerial efficiency,such action will not by itself produce results in time.    Without some new measures the numbers will rise rapidly aft sr 1 April 1971 - to about505,000 on 1 July and to some 508,000 on 1 October.    It will be all wecan do to keep under 510,000 by the end of the year,.3,        In my judgment this is politically unacceptable.    We have tomake an announcement very soon about the size of the Civil Service for1971-72, because this has been promised in answers to Questions andthe publication of the Estimates makes it clear that decisions on manpower have been made.    An unqualified statement that we plan afurther increase of 10,000 will provoke severe criticism and thatcriticism will be renewed every month through the summer and autumnas the in post figure rises.    I have become increasingly concerned, as has my Parliamentary Secretary, about the political damage which thiswill do as.    The Party is already very restive about the increase since junly last year of some 4,1)00$ a further 10,000 may be the l&amp;ml straw.1
4.        I consider that we must now take action to ensure that the numberof non-industrial staff rises as little as possible above 500s000 throughoutthe year and is below that figure by 1 April 1972,    To achieve this weshall have to impose a 2 per cent cut on the staff ceiling agreed for each department.    I make this proposal with great reluctance because I appreciate the difficulties caused to Departmental Ministers by such a departure from the systematic approach which we have been adopting.We have stated that we will not resoit to arbitrary measures? they willImpair efficiency and our relations with the Staff Side? and they maymake it more difficult to implement our longer term plans.    On theother hand they will add impetus to the search for ways of reducing workand improving efficiency, and will make it plain that we do not intend toallow the Civil Service to go on growing,5,       All this underlines the need for us to accelerate the shedding of functions and the transfer of v/crk outs&amp;de the Civil Service,    Only bythese means shall we achieve our objective of reducing staff numberswhile SasepSag room for manoeuvre and avoiding further arbitrary cuts,6. I advise the CabinetL    to impose a 2 per cent cut on the non-industrial staffceilings of all Departments^ii.    to instruct me to issue new staff targets immediately to achieve a 1 per cent cut in the Estimate figures forecast for I October 1971 a building up to the full 2 per cent cut inthe present forecast for 1 April 1972 (Annex A shows the approximate breakdown)!iii.    to approve an immediate announcement that we plan to contain the number of non-industrial civil servantswithin a ceiling of 5 CO, 000 by 1 April 1972,J civil  Service Department, SWl29 March 19712
