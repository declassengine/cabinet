HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(71) 28 COPY NO622 March 1971CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT IN TRADE DISPUTESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. As a result of the cabinet previous discussions(CM(70) 40th Conclusions, Minute 4) a Social Security Bill is ready whichwill among other things modify the supplementary benefit provision for the dependants of persons disqualified under Section 10 of the Ministry of social security Act (trade disputes) so that;a, up to  3.35 more than formerly of the personal income(largely tax refunds and strike pay) of the disqualified person will betaken into account in calculating the benefit for dependants;b, benefit paid after the return to work to tide the formerdisqualified person over until he receives his first wages would berepayable through the employer.Meanwhile the postal dispute has already led to supplementary benefitpayments of over  2 million^    This is far more than was paid out during alldisputes last year.    I should point out however that the weekly supplementary benefit bill is around one-eighth of the weekly total of wages forgone byeverybody involved in the dispute and that the average weekly payment perfamily Is  7.31.    (This is the aye rage payment; some people will get muchmore.    For example, one East End postman is receiving  16.65 even thoughhis rent is not being met in full).2, The proposals to which I have referred woulds however, have little or no effect on payments in the current postal dispute.    There Is no strikepay, nor are tax refuse*ids in general available as the men who would pay the mare also on strike.    Since postal workers are paid In the week they do thework the post-strike proposal would not bite either (unless the men returnedto work towards the end of a pay v/eek when wages due might not be sufficient for maintenance).3. I accept that it is necessary to consider further steps that might betaken.    I rule out the possibility of stopping all payments of supplementary benefit; this v/ould mean very great hardship for wives and children and neither I nor the Secretary of State for Employment believe that the bitter-ness such a step would involve would be outweighed by any gain in the field of industrial relations.
4. Since to stop PAYE refunds being made during disputes wotild apartfrom difficulties both of principle and of practice only increase both  henumber of claims for supplementary benefit made as well as the amount paid out on individual claims the only practicable alternative is to extend to supplementary benefit payments made during disputes the repaymentarrangements already devised for post^dispute payments.    The arguments for and against this were discussed by the Social Services Committee last november,    It was then decided that it would not be right to adopt itbecause, inter aliaj of the risk of bitterness over the long repayment period and the impact of the proposal on low wage earners.    If however mycolleaguess and in particular the Secretary of State for Employment^, concur in the view that this would be a desirable course at the present time, I amready to carry it out.    But I must stress the difficulties as I see them.5.        These difficulties are as follows?a. It is a considerable change to use social security as an anti-strike weapon and particularly difficult to do so when the peopleaffected by the trade dispute disqualification include, as well asstrikers in the ordinary sense of the word, people who are locked out,and,, since we have decided not to implement the Donovan Commissionrecommendation on removing the &quot;grade or class&quot; part of the trade dispute disqualification, people whose say in a dispute could not be other than minimal.    Moreover^, such a change will be represented as only the first step on the way to discriminating in social securityon grounds of the desirability of the customer instead of his needs.bo Extra staff will be required and, though the annual equivalentwill probably be less than 50^ they will actually be deployed byhundreds in particular strike centres during disputes, with consequent additional dislocation to ordinary work.    The more wetry to safeguard the low earner, or the man with a large family, the longer the recovery period and the greater the number never calledupon to repay the debt (see Annex).c. 90 per cent of strikes do not lead to supplementary benefitpayments and in those 10 per cent that do less than 20 per cent ofthose on strike claim supplementary benefit.    Any measure is unlikely, therefore, to have much direct effect in reducing strikes.In any case, working to rules repeated short stoppages, and other action may be encouraged and in some cases may be more harmful.What is likely is that the bitterness of a strike will continue into theperiod during which substantial numbers of workers are having to repay debts to the Department.d. Middle of the road opinion, at present solidly behind theIndustrial Relations Bill, may be alienated when it is realised thatwe shall be putting some people in debt to the tune of  50 or more.K department of Health and Social Security SE12 March 19712
annex.    This note examines the pattern which recovery of supplementary benefit paid during a trade dispute would impose,  starting from two points:(a) An average post office worker involved in thecurrent dispute.   He has a wife, two childrenaged between 5 and 10 and pays the average rentof  3-    It is assumed that after the dispute hegets the present average post office earningsincreased by 8 per cent to give him gross pay of 27.20 a week.(b) The provisions in the Social Security bill relating to recovery were devised for the repayment of post-strike benefit.   These provide that an employer must deduct one-eighth, may deductup to one-quarter, and may with the employee&apos;spermission deduct a larger proportion of theamount owed initially during each week of the recovery period providing that an employee&apos;snet earnings are not thereby reduced to lessthan his ordinary supplementary benefit rateplus  2 (the protected earnings rate).   Anyone notice to an employer remains in force for13 weeks and if a debt still remains outstandingat the end of this time the Secretary of state has discretion not to renew it.2.   The postal worker discussed in paragraph 1(a) receives 9.75 supplementary benefit per week.   Over six weeks he hasreceived a total of  59.10.   His net earnings on return towork will be  21.73.   The table below shows the time taken forrecovery of benefit if amounts of  2- 7 were to be added to hissupplementary benefit rate so as to increase his protectedearnings by corresponding amounts.1NOTE ON REPAYMENT OF SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT

It would clearly not be tolerable that a man with large net earnings - say  40 - who owed  80 in supple-mentary benefit should have this recovered at between  10and  20 a week over 8 to 4 weeks.   The reduction from his normalincome would be much too harsh.4.     If it is decided to proceed with recovery of benefitpaid during a dispute,    the existing provisions for recoverywill clearly have to be modified to take account of these problems.2- ; ::ret
