THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(71) 46 COPY NO      2930 March 1971CABINETTHE CIVIL LISTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Civil List is in deficit and is currently being supplemented fromthe Privy Purse,,    It Is essential for new statutory provision to be madein time to deal with the calendar account year 1972 at the latest.    It will be recalled that the former Prime Minister made a statement in the House ofCommons on 11 November 1969 on this subject giving his opinion that a newSelect Committee on the Civil List ought to be appointed at the beginning ofthe new Parliament.2. The Prime Minister and I have been considering this matter sincetaking up office and have reached the conclusion that, a review cf the civil list ought to be conducted in the traditional manner through the appointmentof a Select Committee on whose report a Civil List Bill will be based.    TheChancellor of the Exchequer Is Chairman of such a Select Committee, andthe proposals which he submits to It are the proposals of the Government,3.        I am therefore circulating for the consideration of the Cabinet therecommendations set out, with supporting Information, In the annex to thismemorandum.    These recommendations have been discussed with the palace advisers and would be likely to be acceptable to Her Majesty,4.        After approval by the Cabinet I propose to consult in confidence theLeaders of the other Parties with a view to securing a measure ofco-operation in the proceedings of the Select Committee.    If all goes wellit ought to be possible to appoint the Committee and start its sittings soon after the Easter Recess.A treasury Chambers SW130 March 1971
ANNEX2.     From the supplementary provision, up to  25,000 is available for making contributions towards the expenses of performance of royal dutiesby members of the Royal Family not otherwise provided for by Parliament;the balance is available for making good deficiencies between expenditure and grant In Classes II and III, or for putting to reserve to meet suchdeficiencies in future.     This was a deliberate &quot;contingency margin&quot;inserted in 1952 to make some allowance for future increases in costs in salaries and wages included in Class II of the Civil List and for futureincreases of costs affecting the expenditure covered by Class III of theCivil List0     From 1952 until 1961, although the Civil List showed asteadily diminishing surplus, a reserve fund continued to be built up.Since 1962 the Civil List has been in steadily increasing deficit eachyear, and the reserve built up in the early years has been drawn downfaster than was originally expected, partly because of unforeseen commit-ments, such as Selective Employment Tax and increased National insurance contributions.    The reserve would have been exhausted before now, if ithad not been for economies effected - the number of staff employed in theRoyal Household is now nearly 10 per cent less than at the beginning ofthe reign - and the transfer to votes of certain items of expenditure, forexample, expenditure on royal travel overseas and the cost of rail travel in the United Kingdom by members of the Royal Family on official duties.The reserve was finally exhausted last year.Present position.     The Civil List Act 1952 authorises annual payments of  475,000 outof the Consolidated Fund for the Queen1s Civil List, sub-divided a3follows - oSliClass I       Contribution.to Privy Purse 60,000Class II      Salaries of Household 185,000Class III    Expenses of Household 121,800Class IV      Royal bounty, alms and speaial services 13,200Class V       Supplementary provision 95,000 475,000
3.     The Civil List Acts also authorise the payment out of the consolidate fund of pensions to former members, officials and staff of the RoyalHousehold;   of Civil List Pensions;   and of annuities to other members ofthe Royal Family as follows -and in respect of the Queen&apos;s children (other than the Prince of Wales) -ie     for sons,  10,000 from the age of 18 until marriage and 25,000 after marriage;ii.   for daughters,  6,000 from the age of 18 until marriage and 15,000 after marriage.In accordance with these arrangements an annuity of  6,000 is now being paid to HRH The Princess Anne;   HRH The Prince Andrew becomes eligible to draw an annuity in 1978, and HRH The Prince Edward in 1982,     The Actalso authorises an annuity of  30,000 from the Consolidated Fund for a widow of the Prince of Wales, but not for widows of the Queen&apos;s youngerchildren or for widows of other annuitants.4.     There is no Parliamentary provision for the Prince of Wales, who is entitled as Duke of Cornwall to the net revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall.These revenues amounted to about  210,000 in 1970.     They are not taxable.Following a precedent first set by a voluntary surrender of a proportionof the Duchy of Cornwall revenues by Edward Prince of Wales from 1920onwards, the Prince of Vifales agreed in 1969 (when he came of age) to make50 per cent of the Duchy of Cornwall revenues over to the Consolidated Fund;this arrangement is entirely voluntary.     The proportion is subject to review on his marriage or in the event of some other unforeseen change of circumstances.5.    The main source of income to the Queen&apos;s Privy Purse, other than theCivil List contribution of  60,000, is the net revenues of the Duchy of lancaster,     These revenues have for centuries been the personal propertyof the Sovereign.     They have increased from  110,000 in 1952 to about 300,000 in 1969.     They are not subject to tax.HRH The Duke of EdinburghHM The Queen Mother40,00070,00035,00015,000HRH The Duke of GloucesterHRH The Princess Margaret
6.    Apart from the Consolidated Fund grants to the Civil List and annuitiesto other members of the Royal Family, the following expenditures are alsomet out of monies provided by Parliament (figures are approximate estimates for 1971-72) -Travel by rail in the United Kingdom by members of the Royal Familyon official duties ( 36,000).Travel overseas by members of the Royal Family on official duties(inoluding the Royal Yacht) ( 963,000).The Queen&apos;s Flight ( 1,510,000).Maintenance of royal palaces and residences occupied by members of theRoyal Family and Household officials ( 973,981).Stationery and office equipment for the Royal Household, the PrivyPurse and the Queen Mother ( 39,500).Ceremonial and equerry attendance ( 53,177).The total amount of expenditure for these items in Estimates for 1971-72 is 3,576,458.     In addition, charges of  51,800 for Post Office services forthe Queen&apos;s Household and for the Queen Mother are at present being carried by the Post Office Corporation (having been met from Post Office revenueswhile the Post Office was a Government Department);   the Post OfficeCorporation are now seeking to be paid for these services.7.     Traditionally the Civil List has been settled by Act of Parliament forthe whole of a reign on the accession of a new monarch.     parliamentary control has therefore been virtually limited to the occasion when thelegislation fixing the amounts of the payments is passed.     Payments aremade out of the Consolidated Fund without further Parliamentary authority,and the Civil List is not subject to Parliamentary audit or accountability,although it is subject to audit by the Permanent Secretary to the treasury as Auditor of the Civil List,Objectives for New Civil List Provision8.    The need to reconsider the Civil List and associated expenditures as an exceptional measure during the reign has arisen solely as a consequence ofthe unforeseen pace of inflation over the last 20 years.     Inflation hashalved the real value of the money amounts which were fixed in 1952 andexhausted the limited contingency margin whieh was then provided.    In thesame period the Exchequer has benefited from the growth of the hereditaryrevenues which are surrendered at the beginning of each reign;   for examplenet receipts from the Crown Estate have more than trebled.
9,    One objective of new arrangements must &quot;be to provide some betterflexibility than in 1952 for adjustment in the light of inflation.A second objective is to do this in a satisfactory form which willlast for the rest of the reign so that there is no recurring need for major review and new legislation.    Thirdly it is necessary to devisearrangements which take account of the views of the Palace advisers and also of current attitudes in Parliament towards providing information about public expenditure.The New Procedure10,   It is proposed that the opportunity to adjust in future to anyinflation shall be created by combining the features of fixed statutoryexpenditures with an annual Vote procedure.     Thus expenditure on theRoyal Household (Classes II and III referred to in paragraph 1 above)and annuities to other members of the Royal Family would be covered byprescribing minimum amounts in a new Civil List Act as a direct charge on the Consolidated Fund.     The new Act would at the same time create the opportunity for additional payments to be authorised from time totime by Parliament on Votes.     Such supplements would be incorporated in 2 block grants in aid for the Royal Household and the annuitiesrespectively.    The arrangements would be made in such a form as to combine reasonable information and control on the part of parliament with statutory safeguards for minimum payments of Household expenses and individual annuities.11.   Arrangements on these broad lines would meet the understandablewish of the Palace advisers to have some irreducible provision madein the traditional form of a Civil List for the duration of the reignand perpetual annuities for certain other members of the Royal Family.The new arrangements would, however, clearly place decisions on the adjustment to inflation with Parliament, at the instigation of theGovernment after having considered the views of the Palace advisers.
12,   As part of this new approach it is proposed that there need he no separate contribution to the Privy Puree, comparable to Class I inparagraph 1 above.     Minor changes will also bo made to Class IV,     Theopportunity will also be taken to transfer back to the Royal Householdcertain payments now met from Departmental Votes, though major items likethe Royal Yacht, the Queen1s Plight, travel on royal duties, andthe maintonace of palaces and residences tjouM have to remain on otherVotes.The New Amounts13.   The total of actual expenditure on salaries and expenses of the RoyalHousehold is now somehwat more than double what it was in 1952,     Overthe same period income from employment has risen nearly 200 per cent,the consumer price index by 75 per cent, and the retail price index by86 per cent.     Close comparisons are precluded as a result of transfersto Departmental Votes during these years and economies effected in the household,     Nevertheless it is reasonable to accept the latest estimates of actual expenditure, and to add back certain itons now on other Votes, as the basis of the new minimum statutory provision.     It istherefore proposed that the initial provision for former Classes II and together should be of the order of  900,000, subject to the checkingof latest estimates.14.   The annuities to other members of the Royal Family have to cover toa large extent the same kind of expenses as are met for the RoyalHousehold under Classes II and III of the Civil List.     Revised amountsare shown below which start from applying a similar kind of cost adjustment to the 1952 figures as has been applied to Classes II and III,     Inaddition account has to be taken of changes in the performance of royalduties, the possible difficulties of authorising very large individualamounts, and the views of the Palace advisers on the necessities of thecase.     It is proposed therefore to provide minimum annuities as follows -
	1952 or earlier	1971	- 	 HRH The Duke of Edinburgh	40.000	65*000&quot;   The Queen Mother	70.000	95,000&quot;   The Duke of Gloucester	35*000	45.000&quot;   The Princess Margaret	15,000	35,000&quot;   The Princess Anne	6,000	15,000Younger sons before marriage	10,000,	20,000&quot;        &quot;    after         &quot;	25,000	50,000Daughters before marriage &quot;         after          &quot;	6,000 15,000	15,000Widow of the Prince of Wales	30,000	60,000Widows of younger sons	nil	20,000Annual Vote arrangements would be designed so that thoos minimum statutorypayments were not called in question, but supplements:^ provision could beauthorised by Parliament from tine to time and incorporated in a block grant-in-aid to the Royal Trustees   (the Keeper of the Privy Purse, thePrime Minister, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer) for allocation attheir discretion.15*   In connection with these annuities it is also relevant to note thatthey are in principle liable to tax.     There is, however, a power of theTreasury to determine the proportion of these annuities (as of otherParliamentary annuities) which nay be regarded as deductible for expenses.At present virtually all these annuities are exempt from tax on thegrounds that all are applied to expenses of the office andotherexpenditure is net privately.     The degree of tax exemption will need tobe reconsidered when revised annuities become payable.16.   Insofar as expenditiu-e on royal duties has boon incurred by othermembers of the Royal Family there was in the 1952 Act the Unitedprovision available of up to  25,000 in the former Class V of the civil list.     The Palace advisers attach great importance to having some-continuing provision of this kind, for an amount not less than  50,000in 1972 (a doubling similar to what is proposed for some annuities).It is proposed therefore that provision&apos;be included in the new legislation for this purpose, and that.the grants-in-aid to the Royal Trustees for1972-73 should include  50,000 under this head.
Recommendations17.   It is recommended that the Government&apos;s proposals to be submittedto a Select Committee on the Civil List should be based on the procedure for review outlined in paragraphs 10-12 above, and that the revisedminimum amounts of payments to-be incorporated in the new arrangements should be of the order of  900,000 in respect of the former Classes and III of the Civil List:   individual annuities as listed inparagraph 14s   and payments in respect of royal duties performed byother members of the Royal Family as in paragraph 16.7
