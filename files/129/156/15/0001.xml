\ -THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY*S GOVERNMENT62CP(71) 40 COPY NO26 March 1971CABINETRB 211Memorandum by the Secretary of State for defence. Following the meetings which the Attorney^General and I held in washington on 25 March 1971 with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation andthe United States Secretary of the Treasury, the latest position on the majorelements of the RB 211 problem is as follows2a. Launching Cost! we have agreed to bear the full cost ofdevelopment to the 42e GOO lb thrust specified in the originalcontracts this is estimated to be some  100 million.b. Production Costs we have offered a price for 646 enginesof  80 million above the original contract price,    Lockheeds regard this as uncempetitlve and have made a counter-offer which amounts onthe same basis to  50- 60 million (the difference depending on whether the price of orders for engines which are not yet committedhas to be abated to keep them in line with the price of the rivalGE engine as Lockheeds propose).    The Attorney-General and Ibelieve that this represents Lockheeds-&apos; final offer and this view isshared by the members of the United States Administration with whom we discussed the matter.c. Financial Warranty? there appears to be no way of obtaining the sort of guarantee which v/e had originally thought desirable to indemnify us for the money we have spent in case of failure byLockheeds before the programme is completed.    But there is afair prospect of obtaining assurances that Lockheeds will in facthave sufficient funds to see the project through.    Some $500 million would probably be provided by the banks and $250&quot;-$300 million bythe United States Government, subject to Congressional approval.Before agreeing to lend this morey the United States Governmentwould satisfy itself of Lockheeds11 viability.Secret
2.        There remain outstanding a number of additional proposals putforward by Lockheeds on such things as a British European Airways (BEA)order, the price of spares5 the validity cf engine deposits already paid andthe re-afflrmation of Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD)financial commitments.    Although these are subsidiary to the main elements above some of them are not unimportant and on several (includingthe BEA order) the Lockheed proposals are quite unacceptable to us.These issues are still being discussed by Sir William Nield in Washington;but I believe that if we can reach agreement on the main elementsLockheeds will not stand out on these subsidiary points.3.        Subject to satisfactory settlement of the subsidiary points I believethat we could agree to the Lockheed proposal for a production price whichwould give us  50- 60 million extra, the agreement being subject to our being satisfied by the financial arrangements which would then be made byLockheeds.    These arrangements would consist of securing the continuedsupport of the airlines at the agreed price and then drawing up a financialplan in consultation with the banks, who would have to be satisfied of the &apos;viability of the project before undertaking further commitments.     TheUnited States Government would then have to satisfy itself that theprogramme was viable before seeking Congressional approval to provideits share of the capital required.    E the United States Government was not satisfied it would not agree to contribute and the project would collapse,as it would if Congressional approval were not forthcoming, as may wellbe the case,4.        If we want to continue the RB 211 project I believe that this is theonly practicable way of doing it, and that it would give us a reasonableassurance that Lockheeds would in fact be able to complete their part of the bargain.    if in the event the project collapsest either because theUnited States Government judges that it is not viable or becauseCongress refuses to agree to a loan,, we cannot be blamed.    It might takesomething like 10 days before Lockheeds could prepare their plan and theUnited States Government come to a decision and perhaps a further 5 weeks before legislation could be got through Congress.    We should have to keepthe project going during this period at a cost of about  2 million a week.I believe that in the circumstances this would be a price worth paying.5,        I recommend that my colleagues should agree to instructions being sent to Sir William Nield forthwith that, provided the subsidiary points havebeen satisfactorily resolved, he should agree to Lockheeds1 latest proposal on the production price., subject to our being satisfied by the financial arrangements which will then be worked out with the airlines, the banks andthe United States Government.6.        A note by officials on the figure is being circulated separately.c ministry of Defence SW126 March 19712
