HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S government cp(71) 31 COPY NO       g g15 March 1971CABINETCONCORDEMemorandum by the Minister of Aviation Supply1. I arn meeting M. Chamants the French Minister of Transport on29 March to review Concorde,    I now seek the guidance of my colleagues on the line I should take,2. The attached paper reviews the present state of the Concordeprogramme.    There are a number of points which I would like to emphasise,,3, Technically, the programme has gone better than might have been reasonably expected for such an advanced aircraft.    Although they do notat present appear promising, sales prospects cannot be predicted with any certainty.    The French have consistently taken a much more optimisticview than we have,4. The economic assessment remains poor but not significantly different from what it was last September, There remains no case for proceeding with Concorde on economic grounds. But there are much wider political,technical and industrial implications to be considered,5, Cancellation would be a serious blow to the aircraft industry.    Wewould have no major new civil aircraft under development.    The british aircraft Corporation (BAG) would almost certainly have to close down theirFilton factory and possibly also, with the 3-11 not going ahead, either theirWeybridge or Hum factories, making it doubtful whether BAG, which has produced our most successful civil aircraft, could preserve a viable civil aircraft capability.    Cancellation of Concorde&apos;s engine would reduce theRoils-Royce Bristol Engine Division in size, importance and technicalability.    The morale of Rolls-Royce would be bound to suffer with the cancellation coming so soon after the RB 211 troubles and, if the RB 211did not go ahead either, doubt would certainly be cast on our will and determination to make a success of Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd,    The prestige of the whole industry would be damaged with a resulting lack of confidence in our ability ever again to produce a major project.    This could affect theindustry^ export earning potential.    Cancellation of our most advanced
technological project and one in. which we are four to five years ahead ofthe Americans wouldA coming on top of the Rolls-Royce collapse,, have serious repercussions on industry generally.    Our standing as an advancedtechnological country would, I believe, be gravely damaged.6. There would be an immediate redundancy of some 23,000 people ^12, 000 at Bristol - aggravating the already acute unemployment situation.It would probably take up to two years before local employment regainedits present level.7. There are no signs of any weakening on the part of the French intheir commitment to the project.    Unilateral withdrawal by us would leadto bitter recriminations between ourselves and the French who would argue that we were breaking a treaty just when the aircraft had virtually proveditself technically and airline reactions would shortly be available.    this could have a most damaging effect on our Common Market negotiations.Unilateral withdrawal would also be likely to be taken by other european governments as a sign of bad faith and our reliability as a partner couldbe seriously called into question.    This might have a serious effect on other collaborative projects eg the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft and couldimpair our efforts to build a European Aircraft Industry.8.        Not all the information necessary for the fundamental review we had intended is yet available.    Unless therefore, as seems most unlikely, theFrench are prepared to abandon the project we have the options of a.withdrawing unilaterally or b* continuing for a further period.    TheLaw Officers1 advice (see paragraphs 14-18 of the attached paper) isthat, although postponing the fundamental review might protect our legal position to some extent, our position in the event of a subsequent unilateralwithdrawal would be much less strong than if we withdrew now.    Never the -less, my own view is that, having regard to all the circumstances, b. is theonly practicable course at this stage.9.        If my colleagues agree, I would propose to examine in detail withM. Chamant all aspects of the project drawing attention to those areas wherethe lack of information prevents our carrying out the fundamental review weoriginally intended.    I shall then add that even so we have very seriousmisgivings about Concorde&apos;s noise, costs and commercial prospects and invite M, Chamant to give the French Government&apos;s view.    If the Frenchclearly still wish to proceed with the project, I will say that we are preparedto do so provided that there will be a further review when the necessary information is available.    I will indicate that this points to a review aboutthe turn of the year but we shall discuss the precise timing with them in theautumn when we would have a clearer idea of the progress in the relevantfields.10,       I also propose to discuss the question of selling price and tore-emphasise our view that the firms should not be allowed to quotebelow $33 million without the approval of the Governments.    If M. Chamantcannot accept this, I shall reserve our position.F c ministry of Aviation Supply SW115 March 1971
CONCORDEThe Cabinet decided on 17 September 1970 that we should seek the agreementof the French Government to a fundamental review of the Concorde projectby March 1971 in the light of the tests programme and the latest assessment of commercial prospects.     M. Chamant, the French Minister of Transport,is coming to London on 29 March for this purpose.Performance2.     The Mach 2 tests have broadly conformed with previous expectations.We can now be reasonably confident that the target payload of 20,000 lbat entry into service (now expected to be end-1974) can be carried betweenParis and New York.     It will be another 2-3 months before we can forecast the prospects for achieving the target of 25,000 lb two years after entry into service.Noise3.     Concorde&apos;s design aim that it should be no ncisxar than existingsubsonic jets has not yet been achieved.     It is estimated that with thepresent degree of silencing, the noise levels on some hot days in summerwould exceed the permitted limits at Heathrow and Kennedy, as well as the night limits at Heathrow.     The manufacturers hope they may be able to getthe noise down broadly to the level of the Boeing 707 which should enable it to operate under existing rules.     Firm advice will not however beavailable until the end of the year on the possible degree of improvement and its cost.4.     There is a continuing risk that the rules at Kennedy Airport will bemade stricter.     The situation will be influenced by whether developmentof a United States supersonic aircraft continues, and by the policy adopted by the United States Federal authorities on the question of modifying existing subsonic jets.     But the risk will always be there thatKennedy might impose noise standards that Concorde could not meet.1
Sales Prospects5.     The position is not appreciably clearer.     The last detailed estimateby United Kingdom officials indicated a possible range of sales of 50-150,with the likelihood that sales would be in the range 50-100,     Subsequentdevelopments have not increased the likely number of sales and may well have reduced it.     The French, however, are moi-e optimistic and considerthat 175 sales are probable.     In the view of the British Overseas airways corporation (BOAC), a mixed fleet of 4-5 Concordes and Boeing 747s would substantially reduce their profitability as compared with an all subsonicfleet.     The actual outcome is difficult to predict but they are unlikely to modify their views.     Air France also take a pessimistic view.     Otherairlines will not order Concorde until BOAC and Air France have done so,BOAC are prepared to operate Concorde provided arrangements are made toensure that their overall financial position is not iireakened.     Beforeplacing orders they would expect the Government to provide a subsidy orother acceptable financial termsa     BOAC would also be likely to make their order conditional on Coneorde&apos;s noise levels proving acceptable atairports.6.     The Anglo-French official assessment of the price that would cover all costs of production of 100 aircraft is now $33 million (including some$2 million in respect of R and D levy) at January 1971 prices.     TheFrench, however, consider that the selling policy must be left to the firms who are proposing a selling price of $27 million.     It is likely to bedifficult to persuade the airlines to pay significantly more.     production is to be about equally shared between Britain and France,     The Governmentwill have to provide the bulk of the money required to finance production by the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Rolls-Royce, and this islikely to exceed the present limit of  125 million in the industrial expansion Act,     Under the only financing arrangements likely to benegotiable with BAC and Rolls-Royce, the Government will have to bear all their losses on production.     The discounted cost of this could be some 50 million and might well be substantially more,French Position7*     There have been no signs of any French weakening in their commitment to the project.     There is no reason to suppose that French Ministers havealtered their view that continuation is justified on the basis of theirpresent assessment of technical and commercial prospects.     The Frenchappear quite genuine in their much more optimistic view of sales prospects.If therefore we xfished to withdraw from the project it would be against thewishes of the French and a unilateral act on our part,2
80     This would sour our relations with the French Government at a timewhen these are of particular importance for our entry to the european economic Community (e.c.).     The Treasury doubt whether our withdrawal nowfrom Concorde will have any significant effect on the outcome of the EECnegotiations;   the Foreign and Commonwealth Office disagree, particularlyin view of the interest which President Pompidou has taken in the concorde project.     It is arguable that it might be somewhat easier to   withdrawduring the phase of ratification by the French Parliament in the course of1972.     But only if our negotiations for e.c. entry were to fail would thisconstraint on our freedom of action be removed in the next year or two.Industrial Considerations9.     The cancellation of Concorde would be a serious blow to the aircraft industry.     BAC would almost certainly have to close down their Filtonfactory and possibly also their 1&apos;feybridge or Hum factories.     It wouldbe doubtful whether BAC, which has produced our most successful civil aircraft, could preserve a viable civil aircraft capability.     The Rolls-Royce Bristol engine division would also bo affected.     It is estimated thatthe consequent redundancies would affect some 23,000 people.     Coming on top of the Rolls-Royce collapse, the Ministry of Aviation Supply considerthat our credibility as a collaborative partner in the aerospace field and advanced technology generally would be severely damaged.Economic Assessment10.   The total estimate for research and development has now risen to 884 million, an increase of  46 million in real terms.     Our share is now put at  440 million at December 1970 prices.     It is likely to be higherstill before it is completed.     United Kingdom expenditure is currentlyrunning at about  1 million a week.     Appendix A sets out the latestassessment of the future expenditure and receipts, and discounted losses,on various assumptions.     If our present estimates of development and manufacturing costs are correct, the discounted loss if we go on islikely to fall somewhere within the range  125-250 million.     This is on top of the  300 million we have spent or committed already, and takes no account of the cost of any capital or operating subsidy we might need togive to BOAC, or of the liabilities we might incur as a result of guarantees given to airlines on noise, which could involve having theaircraft and spares on our hands and having to refund the money receivedfrom the airlines.3
11.   The provision for expenditure on Concorde developnant and productionin the Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 4578) is now insufficient.Appendix B sets out the.present provision in the White Paper and the latest estimate of expenditure, which exceeds the provision by  14 million in1973-74 and  39 million in 1974-75.    Any further escalation of cost will increase these deficiencies.12.   If we withdraw now, we would face cancellation charges of  30 million,mostly falling in 1971-72.     The loss to public funds through increasedsocial benefits and decreased contributions and taxation might be around 15 million (additional to any there might be if EB-211 were cancelled).The advice of the Lav; Officers (paragraph 14 below) is that if we were taken to the International Court now our chances of winning would be6O/4O, and that if we lost we would be liable for French cancellationcosts ( 20-30 million) and possibly a similar sum for &quot;loss of prestige&quot;.The possibility of being held liable for all past French expenditure(about  250 million) cannot be excluded but is considered most unlikely.13.   The case  for continuing the aircraft is therefore not economic butcan only rest on the non-economic factors, principally the effect on the eec negotiations and the industrial implications, which would beheightened if the RB-211 had also been cancelled.Legal Position14.   The Lav? Officers advise that if Britain decided to withdrawunilaterally now, she would do so in the circums nances best enabling her to defend this decision at the International Court.     They assess theprospects as 6O/4O in Britain&apos;s favour.15.   Any decision to continue beyond the March meeting will result in asubstantial erosion of Britain&apos;s present legal position in the event of a future unilateral withdrawal.     The precise position will depend on how the matter is left after the meeting.16.   An unqualified decision to continue, in the circumstances nowprevailing, would mean that Britain could no longer rely on those circumstances as justifyjxig a later withdrawal.     There would have to be a fundamental change of circumstancess   for example, clear evidence thatthere would only be a handful of orders so that the project would have nocommercial prospects,,
17.   Alternatively, we night argue that the information on.which we had hoped to make a fundamental review was not available, and that it would bebetter to postpone it until more definite knowledge on payload, noise and commercial prospects is available.     Provided that the alternative datesuggested for that review was plausible, in that information on these points would by then be substantially clearer than now, a postponement onthe ground that the time for a fundamental review had not yet arrivedwould at least enable the arguments now available to Britain to be used at that time, although they will have been substantially weakened by thefurther passage of time.18,   A short postponement on the other hand would do little to retain thelegal position, since postponement for a few months would find the project in substantially the same uncertainty as how,     /my postponement should therefore be until such time as firm advice can be expected to enable a fundamental review to take place.Possible Courses of Action19.   In these circumstances, we consider that at the meeting or 29 march the British delegation should begin by expressing regret that firminformation is not yet available on some of the key issues relevant to a review of the prospects for the project, but adding that there areevidently some disturbing features even in what we already know.20.   M. Chamant might then be asked how the French Government see the project now.     If he were to give any indication that they might be willing to contemplate stopping, then the British delegation should follow that up.     If, as we expect, he does not, there appear to be two possible courses -a. to tell the French on 29 March that we wish to withdraw, andface the risk of being taken to the International Courtcb. To tell the French that as not all the relevant information is available we wish to postpone the review until firm advice is available on the payload and the noise level, and we have a clearer picture ofthe commercial prospects.     This would point to a date around the turnof the year, but we would exchange views with then in the autumn to try to fix a definite date.     We should also tell the French that inour view the firms should not quote a selling price below $33 millionwithout reference to Governments.5
21.   The financial and economic arguments are strongly in favour ofcourse a,, and the effect on our legal position if we let the presentopportunity pass (set out in paragraphs 14 to 18 above) also points that way.     Against course a. there are the industrial implications,particularly if the KB-211 is also cancelled, and the effects on ourrelations with the French and our negotiations to enter the SEC.     if ministers feel the latter arguments are overriding, then course b.could preserve at least a part of our legal position, and is therefore thecourse we would recommend.6
