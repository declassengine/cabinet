DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT  9CP(71) 34 COPY NO     622 March 1971CABINETTHE THIRD LONDON AIRPORTNote by the Secretary of State forj^Home-attack  attach a paper which sets out the main conclusions reached by the ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the Environment (RE) on theRoskill Commission^ recommendations concerning the timing and site ofthe Third London Airport (TLA),    I invite my colleagues to decide;i. Whether we should aim to bring the TLA into operation by 1980. This date could be subsequently adjusted if the studyproposed by the Treasury suggested that this would be desirable.ii. Whether the TLA should be sited at Foulness.In any event decisions should not be announced before RE have resolvedthe problem of where to move the Shoeburyness Range.R m home Office SW122 March 1971
CONFIDELUrmLTHE THIRD LONDON AIRPORTTIMINGSubject to a Treasury reservation - see next paragraph -the Committee endorse Roskiil&apos;s unanimous recommendation thatplanning should proceed forthwith to&quot;bring the TLA Intooperation in 1980.   Air traff.16.&quot;in the. South East is continuing to increase very rapidly and given that planning and building a major new airport will take 7 or 8 years there is little time to spare if we are to prevent expansion of Gatwick and maximum useof Heathrow and other airports, with all the public oppositionthat would provoke because of the resulting increase in noisenuisance.   It is also clear that technological developments(VTOL, STOL etc) will,come too late (and their impact is stilltoo uncertain) to affect the need for.a third airport.2.     The Treasury accept that the TLA is needed and that we shouldmake an early announcement of our choice of site.   But theyconsider that insufficient attention has been paid to the implications of the very rapid rate of air traffic growthforecast for the next two decades, which could well constitute an explosive change with potentially grave consequences for thequality of life.    They point out that there is strong fiscaldiscrimination in favour of air travel, which is substantiallyfree of tax whereas the average rate of tax on consumer goods and services amounts to 18-20 per cent.    In view of the environmentalproblems created by the growth of the industry, this seemsunjustifiable to the Treasury who believe that a. study should beput In hand of the possibilities and probable consequences of seeking to slow down the growth of air traffic by fiscal means.If it should be found to be both feasible, and desirable tofollow such a policy, the advantages would be some reduction -inthe required pace of development of the third airport or,alternatively, an increased ability to divert traffic to it fromother airports near London, or both.   On the other hand, they recognise that the proposal has aspects, e.g. in relation to the tourist balance of payments and to international relations inthe air traffic field, which need to be examined.   The Treasurysuggest that the proposal should be reported upon by officials.THE SITE3.     The RE Committee are agreed that we must decide now betweenRoskill&apos;s short-listed sites.-  Since the Roskill report was published and opposition to the. inland sites has grown, thosewho oppose the choice of Foulness (e.g. the British airports authority) have suggested that a further search should be made,which should include sites rejected by Roskill because theycould not take as many as four runways.    However, although STOLand other technological developments may eventually make it unnecessary to build more than two or three runways at the TLA,it would be an unwarranted gamble at this stage to choose a sitewhich could not take four runways if the need arose.   And it is1
unrealistic to suppose that a new search would produce a four-runway site significantly better than those on Roskill&apos;s short-list.   Moreover, such a search would involve a considerable delayduring which Roskill&apos;s inland sites could not in practice bekept under suspended sentence.   If we tried to keep Foulnessalone in reserve during the search opposition would undoubtedlyconcentrate there.4.     The RE Committee consider that we should reject the Roskillmajority recommendation in favour of Cublington.   The majority ofthe Committee further consider that we should, for environmentalreasons, reject all inland sites including Thurleigfi.   Moreover,the recent debates in both Houses of Parliament have shown thatwe have no chance of obtaining the necessary parliamentary approval for the building of the TLA if Cublington were chosen asthe site, and there is little doubt that opposition on a similarscale would soon build up if we attempted to choose Thurleighinstead.   For these reasons, the majority of the Committeeconclude that Foulness should be selected as the TLA site despiteits economic disadvantages which arise from its position on theedge of the area to be served,5.     The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry considers thatThurleigh would not be so objectionable from the environmentalpoint of view as Cublington, and would be sufficiently attractive to the airlines to ensure transfer of services from Heathrow andLuton without Government intervention, so relieving, the growingburden of noise at those airports.     If Foulness were chosen,however, he believes that airlines would not move of their own accord until they were compelled to do so by congestion, by which time the noise burden around existing London airports would have grown very considerably.     To secure any earlier relief, theGovernment would need (in addition to imposing discriminatorylanding charges) to divert services to Foulness by imposing limits on movements at Heathrow and other existing airports (and perhapsvirtually closing Luton).     These limits would affect foreign aswell as British operators.     Experience shows that foreign government react to restrictions of this kind by imposingrestrictions on British operators, so damaging our overseasaviation earnings (which at present are substantially in our favour) .6,     The Cabinet should be aware that if the TLA is to be broughtinto operation at Foulness in 1980, an early decision will be needed on the relocation of the Shoeburyness Gunnery Range.     TheMinistry of Defence&apos;s proposals to relocate the range at Pembreyin Carmarthenshire have provoked strong public opposition and theSecretary of State for Wales considers that they must be rejected.The Ministry of Defence are urgently preparing alternative proposals and the RE Committee will be considering further how this problem should be handled before any announcement is madeof the Government&apos;s decisions on the TLA.22 March 1971
