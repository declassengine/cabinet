;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 26 COPY NO    g g1 March 1971CABINETRECONSTRUCTION OF NATIONAL INSURANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department10 The Social Services Committee have considered the points made in discussion of the proposed reconstruction of national insurance at Cabineton 9 February (CM(7l) 9th Conclu sionSj Minute 4)aEMPLOYERS1 CONTRIBUTION24 At present the contribution is divided equally between employer and employee.    For the new basis scheme a total contribution of about12j per cent may be needed (although it is possible that by 1975 the requirement will be reduced to 12 per cent) and fear was expressedin Cabinet that to set the employers1 contribution at 7^ per cent andthe employees  at 5^ per cents as proposed, would endanger the profita-bility of industry and therefore investment and growth.    The extracontribution from employers will not be without effect on profits,particularly in the short term, but it is probable that in the longer term the burden will be passed on in price increases, leading to a cost of living increase between f and 1 per cent (or less if the jointcontribution requirement were reduced).    But the Exchequer can make no higher contribution if we are to redeem our commitments on tax reform, and the proposed increase in the employees&apos; contributionalready goes to the limit - in particular, further to increase theemployees1 contribution might inflate wage claims.    The employers1share of the total contribution to the Reserve Scheme could not be reduced if it is to compare reasonably with occupational scleme practice,    Yfeconcluded that the contribution pattern was acceptable,THE RESERVE SCHEME3. To reduce the risk that the Reserve Fund might be misused in thefuture, it is proposed to lay on its independent management board stringentlimitations on the voting shares in a company that it may hold, and a duty to maximise the benefits payable; and in addition to require the board to conduct its investment through about five agencies of recognised standing.We agreed that these safeguards would minimise the dangers of an undueconcentration of investment power as well as presenting a sufficientlyformidable obstacle to futare misuse^
40 The funding of the Reserve Scheme may lead to pressure for thefunding of public service schemes, although many of those affected might find the protection afforded by a Government guarantee and pensions increase more valuable than funding,    The funding of public serviceschemes would present formidable difficulties^ great cost., the erection of large-scale funds beside the Reserve Fund and the possibility of a conflict of interest in the management of the funds,,    The committee did not  however., consider that the funding of the Reserve Scheme would entail the funding of public service schemes,,MANPOWER5,        By 1980 the schemes will save about la 000 staff net in all departments, but, because they must be prepared while the existing scheme still runs, more staff will be needed in the short term at a peakin 1976 of a little over 3, 000 net additional staff,,    (The figures would be larger if earnings^rdieted contributions t^-are collected from the self-employed - a point for later coxisideration)0    The Committee judge an interim increase of this order&quot; to be inevitable whatever the characterof the new schemes, but every effort will be made to contain it0CONCLUSION60 The Committee concluded that the schemes proposed were acceptable and recommend that they should be the basis of earlyconfidential discussions with the main organisations concerned withoccupational pension schemes, and with the Confederation of BritishIndustry? and, in the Light of their relations, with a wider circle,possibly including the Trades Union Congress,,    Following these consultations, the Secretary of State for Social Services would bring a draft Wh3.te Paper before the Cabinet,,R m home Office SW11 March 19712
