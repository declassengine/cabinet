DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(71) 47 COPY NO30 March, 1971CABINETREMUNERATION OF MEMBERS OF parliament memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilL Following discussion in Cabinet on 3 December 1970 I announced in the House that the Government would refer &quot;the whole question of theemolumentSj, allowances, expenses and pensions of Ministers and Membersof the House of Commons&quot; to one of the three Review Bodies to beestablished in accordance with the announcement made by the Secretaryof State for Employment on 2 November 1970o2, Lord Boyle has row accepted the chairmanship of the appropriateReview Body aad I understand that an announcement to this effect is likelyto be made before Easter,3. In my statement of 4 December I said that8 although the terms ofreference must in the last resort be a matter for Government decision^we would be prepared to discuss them through the usual channels andwith Members in any part of the House,    As a basis for these consultations I propose the following draft terms of reference -&quot;To review, and to recommend what changes are desirable in, the emoluments, allowances, and expesses of Ministers of the Csownand Members of the House of Commons, including Mr, speaker and other holders of remunerated offices in both Houses ofParliament and the relevant pension arrangements&quot;.4, These terms of reference have deliberately been drawn widely.I would draw attention to the following points -i. The peers allowance is not included.    As it is areimbursement of expenses and not a form of remuneration,it seems best dealt with administratively as a separate issue,ii. The phrase &quot;other holders of remunerated offices in bothHouses of Parliament&quot; is intended to cover the Chairman and deputy Chairman of Ways and Means, the Lord Chairman of committees and the Leaders of the Opposition and the OppositionChief Whips in both Houses of Parliament,    The lawrence committee in 1963 declined to advise in respect of these officesbecause no mention was made of them and some specific referenceseems desirable.
iii. The terms cf reference would permit the Review Body toconsider the extension of pension arrangements to Ministerial andother offices covered by the reference which are not at presentpensionable.iv. I think that the Review Body should be able to considerthe suggestion that Members defeated at General Elections shouldcontinue to receive their Parliamentary salary for a limited period after the dissolution of Parliament.50        The Lawrence Committee took the view that increased pay was tobe preferred to free or subsidised facilities or special allowances for particular purposes.    I think, however, that the Review Body shouldbe able to consider free facilities as an alternative to increases in payor expenses.6, I seek the authority of my colleagues to my consulting with theChairman of the Review Body and through the usual channels on the lines which I have indicated.W w privy Council Office SW130 March 1971
