DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY,S government cp(71) 37 COPY NO 6222 March 1971CABINETBRITISH STEEL, CORPORATION prices memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. The British Steel Corporation (BSC) wishes to raise prices by 165 million (14 per cent).    Otherwise it faces a loss of  124 million in 1971-72 as a result of severe and continuing cost increases, continuingoperating difficulties, and a down-turn in the market,,    (By comparisonwith the position foreseen a year ago cost increases already experiencedwill amount to  125 million in 1971-72; and a further  65 million of cost increases (annual rate) is known to be on the way, iv addition to whatever may have to be conceded on wages.    Of this only  46 million was takeninto account in last October13 price increase),,    Its expected accumulatedloss of about  50 million at the end of 1970-71 means that it is no positionto absorb further losses.2.        I have discussed this with my colleagues in the ministerial committee on Economic Policy who agreed that steel prices wouldhave to be increased substantially; but they asked me to consider further whether we should accept the full 14 per cent or some lov/erfigure such as the 10 per cent I proposed.38 There is much to be said for accepting 14 per cents-a. it is the bsc&apos;s responsibility to pay its way and we risksharing responsibility for any failure; indeed BSC argue thatthey would have earned  200 million more in the past two years had they charged strictly commercially at European prices;b. their commercial judgment is that despite the down-turn the domestic market will stand the increase proposed in particularproducts (Annex A); and though there are doubts (as the private sector has pointed out to me) the BSC must take responsibilityfor this; moreoverc. without the full increase the BSC demands on the NationalLoan Fund will be very heavy over the coming year whateverdecisions we take later about the investment programme.
Of these a. and b0 are particularly important for my relations with the bsc during the fundamental review of its finances and development whichI have in hand? while the Chancellor of the Exchequer has a specialconcern with c.4. On the other hand I am acutely concerned about the implications of the increase for steel users, and, later on, as the increases work their way through, for our policy of reducing wage demands.    It would mean that following an earlier period of stability, our steel prices would have risen by about two-fifths since 1967 and would new be equal to the highestCommon Market domestic prices (Annex B) though in the BSC view someof these may rise further in parallel with ours.    Inevitably our competitive position would be damaged, while the alternative of relying more on imports would harm the balance of payments.5.        Accordingly, I believe that acceptance of the full increase would notbe right, coming as it does on top of successive 10 per cent and 5 per centincreases last year.    It would be premature to accept such a big increasewhile so much is unsettled on the BSCss forward development.conclusion,        In view of the bsc&apos;s unprofitability we need an urgent decision onthese proposals.    For the reasons in paragraphs 4 and 5 I recommend anaverage of 10 per cent, but the majority of EPC would prefer the full 14 percent.    In either case I will;-1.       invite the Iron and Steel Consumers&apos; Council (ISCC) (who arealready examining the proposals on their own initiative) to considerthe distribution of the increases between products ex post factoj  and2. emphasise that our acceptance of the total amount carries noendorsement of particular product prices which are for the BSC tosettle in the light of commercial pressure and the views of the ISCC.7. My colleagues should be aware that an increase of 14 per cent (or indeed one of 10 per cent) without reference to the ISCC on the size (and notjust the distribution) of that increase runs the risk of the resignation of someand possibly all the members of the Council.    Nevertheless, I do not believethat in present circumstances, where we ourselves are conducting a majorfinancial review, a reference of the substance to them would be sensible.8.        In considering my lower proposal of 10 per cent my colleagues should be aware that the need to make further cost-savings may cause the BSC to shed labour faster and speed up their rationalisation of oldplant.    To the extent that such measures do not offset the shortfall, theremay be some increase in borrowing, within a total of about  20 million in1971-72.JDDepartment of Trade and Industry SW122 March 1971
