5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY?S government cp(7I) 48 COPY no. 5 April 1971CABINETCIVIL SERVICE NON-INDUSTRIAL manpower memorandum by the Lord chancellor. I think I should point out to my colleagues the serious effects whichthe Lord Privy SeaPs proposals (CP(7l) 45) for a 2 per cent cut in staff numbers will have on the administration of justice.    This will mean areduction of 185 on 1 April 1972 in the number of staff accepted, after careful scrutiny, as being the minimum required for the operation ofthe court? for which I am responsible but over the volume of the businessof which I have no control,2. This will have a crippling effect on the fundamental reorganisation of the courts system, which is due to take effect on 1 January 1972, and will inevitably add to delays which are already serious,,    I cannot believe thatour supporters in the country will construe our pledge to reduce thenumber of civil servants as implying a deliberate reduction in the standards of the administration of justice as accepted by previous Governments,Even if I were wrong about this, I do not believe that we should be true to our own responsibilities if we implemented our pledge at this cost,3.        So far as the Land Registry is concerned, I have already agreed with the Lord Privy Seal that we should urgently consider the possibilityof hiving-off so that the staff should no longer court as civil servants.An arbitrary cut in staff numbers in the meantime will mean that theRegistry will not only be unable to press on with the long-delayed schemefor the extension of registration of title - which is essential if the cost of house purchase is to be reduced - but v/ill find grave difficulty in copingwith the heavy increase in its current work.4. For these reasons I urge the Cabinet to agree that the staff of thecourts and of the Land Registry should be excepted from the proposed cut.H of St MHouse of Lords SW15 April 1971
