THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS government cp(71) 298 March 1971COMMERCIAL RADIOMemorandum by the Minister of Posts andTelecommunications1.      At its meeting on 5 Marc.ha the Committee on Broadcastinginvited me to submit to the Cabinet my draft White Paper on commercialradio, drawing attention to its main proposals,THE NATIONAL COMMERCIAL service.      The draft White Paper proposes that there should be a nationalcommercial programme as well as up to 60 local commercial stations.The BBC would be required to relinquish the medium frequency (mf)channel on which it is now broadcasting Radio 1.    The majority of the broadcasting Committee favoured this proposal, but support for it was notunanimous.    The arguments for it ares-i.     Competition between the BBC and commercial radio will bebetter balanced at four channels to two (three national and onelocal for the BBCf one national and one local for IB A) rather than five channels to one0ii.     The national service can be established more quickly.Without it there is some danger that there might be littlecommercial radio on the air at the end of this Parliament.ill.    An early and satisfactory agreement with the Musicians8Union on needle-time is more likely, since the profits of thenational channel can be used to provide live employment formusicians.iv.    Commercial radio will be able more quickly and morecertainly to afford a good central news service.3.      There may be opposition to this proposal for a national channelfrom the following sourcess-L     The BBC will protest strongly, arguing that the removal of radio 1 will involve a damaging reorganisation of all their radioservices, and that, with a reduced coverage a national commercialchannel could be accommodated on medium frequencies alongsideRadio 1.    On the other hand, the BBC had only three channelsbefore the pirates, to which is now added the artwork of local stations, and the White Paper proposes to extend these to mediumwave i Radio 1 and 2 are already amalgamated for 9 to 10 hoursCOPY NO62CABINET
outside peak listening time, and for all but 6 to 8 hours each day the local stations also relay mostly Radio 1 and 2.    I do notbelieve either that it is necessarily desirable for the BBC toprovide out of the licence fee a channel for non-stop EPop8, theextent of which must make it hard for the IBA to insist on a publicservice content in commercial radio.ii,.    The Newspaper Publishers Association contend that a nationalchannel would draw off advertising revenue from the already hard-hit national Press,    On the other hand, the total revenue ofcommercial radio, national and local, is expected to build up to only  10 million to  15 million per annum over a 3-year period after 1973J total Press advertising is about  225 million and national Press advertising  110 million j national newspapers willhave the opportunity to invest in local stations, and to bid forcontracts to sell advertising time for the national channel.iiL    Some of those hoping to own local commercial stations willargue that a national service will siphon off too much advertisingrevenue.    On the other hand, an income approaching  15 million should suffice to support bothf local companies will, moreover,,be programme suppliers to the national station,iv0    Some of our supporters might criticise the IBA control of thenational channel as being public authority rather than privateenterprise broadcasting.    On the other hand, private enterprisewill be involved in supplying programmes and selling advertisingfor the national channel, and the local companies will be privateenterprise on the ITV model,THE AUTHORITY4.       The majority of the Committee considered that, if there was to be anational service, $here should be an Authority other than the ITA; althoughothers considered that it would still be unnecessary,    I believe that theITA would treat radio as a matter of secondary concern, and that a secondAuthority is essential, with or without a national channel, if commercialradio is to be vigorously developedc    There was also some doubt whetherthe new Authority should be financed initially by advances from theNational Loans Fund, to be repaid as soon as the system became profitable.In my view, we cannot be sufficiently certain that the IBA would be able toraise the money on the market without a Treasury guarantee,BBC LOCAL STATIONS5.      The Broadcasting Committee agreed that the BBC should beallowed to continue with its 20 local stations,CROSS-SUBSIDISATION6.      A view was expressed in the Broadcasting Committee that thereshould be no cross -subsidisation.    I believe that some element of crosssubsidisation will be necessary in commercial radio as it has been in commercial TV, if a local service of a good standard is to be extendedoutside the conurbations, and so richer franchises should contribute morethan their share to common expenses,C J c ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, SE18   arch 1971
annex draft WHITE PAPERAN  INDEPENDENT SERVICE OF RADIO BROADCASTINGINTRODUCTION1.       It  is  now some   16 years  since  the Television Act  1954established  the  Independent Television Authority as  a public corporation  to provide  television services  and so ended  the monopoly of broadcasting which   the  BBC had hitherto held.    Despite   the controversy aroused at   the  time  by  the  1954 Act,   there  are  few whowould now wish  to see   the monopoly restored  in television.    the competing  services of   television -   the one  publicly financed,   theother  from  the  sale of  advertising  time  - maintain a general   level of quality which  certainly bears  comparison with  that  achieved elsewhere.The widespread ownership of   television sets   in  the United Kingdom,   andthe  intensive use made of   them are evidence of  the success of  thesystem  in meeting  the demands of viewers.     It  is now generally accepted  as desirable,   moreover,   that   there  should be more  than onesource  of  programmes,   particularly in news  and current affairs  since this  is  such an  influential medium.    For  those who work in television thereare seen  to be major  advantages   in  the  existence of more   than onesource  of  employment.    The case which  is now  largely accepted forcompetition  in  television  is no  less  strong  in radio.2.      ^he proposals which follow,   have been arrived at  after  extensiveconsultations with  the broadcasting authorities, with newspaper interests, trade associations  concerned with advertising,   representatives  of   localauthorities,   with  trade unions,   with guilds  concerned with programmeproduction and with many other bodies  and  individuals   interested  inthe  subject of  radio  from  the   technical,   commercial  or  social  pointof view.     There  has been great divergence  in  the  opinions  expressed,but  of   the widespread  interest   in  the  subject  there  can be no doubt,nor  in  the  consensus of  opinion with which  the government warmlyassociates  itself,   that  radio  financed from advertisements must  offer a  truly public  service.    There would be no place  for  a system of broadcasting which did  little more  than offer a vehicle  for  carryingadver t i semen ts.
(CONFIDENTIAL)3.In  extending   to  the  listener  the  advantages  of  choice between different  sources of  radio broadcasting,   the Government  is anxiousboth  to  safeguard  the high quality of much of   the BBCs present  radiooutput,   and  to ensure  that   the new service  also maintains  high standards not  least   in  the provision of news and news  commentaryprogrammes,   which are necessarily a  larger  ingredient   in  radio  eventhan  in  television.THE  INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING AUTHORITY4.       The Government  proposes  to   establish an Independent  broadcasting authority  (IBA)   to provide  and answer  for  the new radio  service.It will  supervise programme  standards,   and control   the amount,incidence,   and nature  of  the advertising.    Although  there  areattractions  at  first  sight   in  entrusting  this  task to  the  ITA.The Government has  concluded  that a  separate body  is  desirable.Independent  radio will  to some  extent  compete with  independent television  for  advertising,   and  the   ITA would  thus  be  faced withconflicting duties.     In   this   situation and  given  the dominant positionof   television,   radio might  come   to be regarded as merely  incidentaland  secondary.     If   the new  service   is   to  be developed vigorously andthe  variety of  opportunities  in  local  radio are   to be  fully explored,a new Authority  is   therefore desirable.    The  IBA will,   like   the BBCand   the  ITA,   be  independent  of Government   in  the  conduct  of  itsday-to-day affairs,   including  all matters  of  programme content.Similarly,   the Minister    of Posts  and Telecommunications will  layits Annual Report before Parliament.5.      As   in  the  case of   the  ITA,   the Members of   the  IBA will  beappointed by  the Minister of Posts  and Telecommunications;  and will comprise  a Chairman,  Members  for Scotland,   Wales and Northern  Ireland,and at  least  four other Members.     The Government envisages   that  theIBA will need  to appoint  advisory  committees   to  advise  it  on particular aspects  of  its programming,   and generally,   on  theprogramming policies of   the  stations.    The  IBA will  be required  to involve  local  authorities  and other  local  organisations   in  thissystem of  advisory committees.    The   IBA will  also have a duty,similar  to  that  imposed on  the  BBC and  ITA to  share masts  and sites,and the BBC and  the  ITA will  be put  under a  reciprocal duty.
6.       In deciding upon  the  division of  frequencies  and  the allocation of  responsibilities between  the BBC and  the  IBA the Government has considered a wide range of proposal-s.    From  the outset   the Governmenthas  taken  the view  that,   despite  the  shortage  of  frequencies,   the bbc should be  enabled  to continue   to broadcast Radio 3 and Radio 4on mf  and vhf.    Radio  3 broadcasts mainly  serious music with somedrama,   poetry and  further  education;  Radio 4  is principally a  speechnetwork providing news,   current  affairs,   drama,   and  talks.     Bothprovide   to minority audiences  services  of  a very high quality.     Ithas,   however,   been accepted   that   the English  regional  variations onRadio 4 would cease with  the coming  of BBC local  radio,   thusreleasing  a number of medium frequencies.7.      The Government  accepts  the BBC1s  view that  it  ought   to becomprehensive  in its programming,   appealing  at  somepoint   to a wide range of  tastes rather   than existing  in a &quot;culturalghetto&quot;.    One of   the  justifications of  a broadcasting  servicefinanced by  licence  fee must be  its  ability  to provide high qualityprogrammes  for  small minorities,   but   this   is not   to  say   that  itshould be  confined  to such material.     It  is  argued by some   that   theintroduction by  the  BBC of  streamed programmes   in radio broadcastingreduces   the force of   the  argument  for  comprehensiveness,   since  thereis  then  less opportunity  of  leading  the  listener on from light   to more  demanding programmes.    Nonetheless  it   seems  right  that  the BBCshould be  enabled  to maintain contact with all   tastes  and  that,   asin television,   there  should be no  sharp differentiation between  thefunctions of   the  two services  in   terms of  highbrow and  lowbrow.Although a higher proportion of   the  BBC1s programmes  should bedirected  towards minorities,   both  the  IBA and  the BBC should compete with a balanced output  of programmes.8.      There  are differences of view as  to whether  this competitionshould be  indirect between national  stations  on  the one hand andlocal on  the  other,   or whether  the BBC and  IBA should competedirectly both at   local  and national   level.    those  favouring   theformer view point  to   the  disadvantages of  financing from a nationallicence  fee BBC local  services which are not  available   to all,   tothe  desirability of   local  stations  being   locally owned and  controlled,and   to   the real  competition which must   inevitably exist betweensuccessful  local  and national   stations,   since  the  latter  still  retainall  but a small  fraction of   those at present  listening   to radio.(confidential)
9.       The Government has,   however,   concluded  that  it would be wrong to  confine   the BBC  to national  broadcasting  and  the  IBA  to  local.     Itis  desirable particularly  in  the   larger   towns  and cities  that  thereshould be competition  between  local   stations   in   the provision oflocal news  and information.     It  is  argued moreover on behalf of   the bbc  local  stations  that   they provide services  to  relatively smallminorities  in  the  communities   they serve of  a kind which a commercialstation could not  finance.     The BBC also regard  local  radio as   theprincipal  growth point  in radio broadcasting and would not wish  tobe  excluded  from  it.    The Government has decided therefore  to confirm the  provisional  authority granted  to  the BBC in August   to providelocal  radio  services  from 20 stations  already  in being,   or  in courseof  provision and  shortly  to come  into service.     They are:    Leicester,Sheffield,   Liverpool,  Nottingham,   Brighton,   Stoke-on-Trent,   Leeds,Durham,   Bristol,  Manchester,  London,  Oxford,   Birmingham,  Medway,Tees-side,   Solent,  Newcastle,   Humberside,   Blackburn and Derby.    The20 BBC stations will  have  a coverage on vhf  of  approximately 65 percent  by day and night,   and  it  is  proposed also  to provide   them withmf  back up.    This would be provided initially  in  the mainconurbations.     It might  eventually achieve   a coverage  approaching50 per  cent by day.     It would be   the   intention  in   the   longer  term  toenable   the BBC,   if   they  then wished,   to extend  their  local  radioservices.     In  the  absence of BBC  local   stations  in Scotland,  wales and Northern  Ireland,   the national  versions  of Radio 4 will  continue in  these countries.10.    A network of up  to  60  stations  is  proposed for  the  IBA.    these can  be accommodated on vhf  with a coverage of  65 per  cent by day and night and on mf  with a coverage  approaching  70 per  cent by day butonly 25 per cent by night.     It will  be  essential  for  the IBA stationsif   they are  to be available  to as many people  as possible within areasonable  period  that   they  should start both on mf  and vhf.     Inorder   to provide  this mf  support  for both   the  IBA and  the  BBC local stations   it will be necessary   to  supplement   the  frequencies  alreadyassigned  to  this  country,   by proposing   under Article  8 of  theCopenhagen Convention  and Article  9 of  the  InternationalTelecommunication Union Radio Regulations the use of  further mfchannels.    Within a few years   there  is   the possibility  therefore  of up  to 60  IBA stations with a coverage  approaching  70 per  cent of   thepopulation  and  20 BBC stations with a  coverage  of up  to  65 per cent,
both being  transmitted on vhf  and mf.     It  should be noted,   however,that   the  allocation of medium frequencies  in  the European BroadcastingArea  is   to be reviewed and  that  local  stations  cannot  necessarilycount  on   the use of  as many medium frequency channels   after  1976.There may however be room ultimately for more  stations  in  the vhfband.11.    As   in  local  broadcasting,   the Government  is  similarly persuadedof   the  case  for an element of  competition  in  the provision ofnational  services.     It  is  proposed,   therefore,   that   the   IBA shouldtransmit  a national   service on  the mf  channel   (1214 kHz  247m)  nowused by Radio  1.     The coverage  of   this  service will be extendedalong   the  lines  already planned by  the BBC so  as  to reach some 95 percent  of   the  population by  day  and 40 per cent  by night.     It  hasbeen suggested by  the BBC  that  sufficient medium frequencies might  beavailable  to accommodate a  further national  service  in addition  tothe  frequencies    needed       for  the BBC and  IBA  local   stations.Technically  such  a possibility  can be   said   to exist,   if   it   is assumed  that agreement    will  be  secured from foreign governments  tovirtually all   the   proposals,   which  it  is  intended  to makeunder  the Copenhagen Convention and  the   ITU Radio Regulations,   andif  it  is  further  assumed  that   the same opportunities  for broadcastingat high power on  the medium wave will  remain after   the  review towhich reference has  been made  in para 10.     Both of   these areinevitably uncertain assumptions.    An even more  serious  disadvantage of  such an  attempt  to find room for  a further national mf  service  isthat  even if possible,   it would  involve a reduction in  the  coverageeither of   the   IBA national  service  or  of   its   local  service.     By day the  coverage  of  the  former would be  reduced  to  about  85 per cent.By night   the  figure would be  as  low as  32 per cent.    Alternativelythe  effect would be   to  reduce  by an even  larger margin   the mf coverageattainable  by  the  IBA local     service both by day and by night.     Suchan arrangement would therefore mean  that a substantial  proportion ofthe population would only be  able  to receive   three out  of   the sevenradio  services,  which would  then be provided by  the  broadcasting organisations.     In  the Governments view  it  would be wrong   to add  inthis way  to   the  services  available   in areas .of  dense  population atthe  expense of  other areas.
12.     The  coverage of   the   two IBA services,   even without   the  reductionsrejected  in  the  previous paragraph,  will  compare unfavourablyparticularly  after dark with  that of   the BBC&apos;s   three national  services.additional medium frequencies  in order   to  extend  the after darkcoverage of   the  two new services.13.     There will  of course  be no question of   the BBC having   toabandon  its comprehensive  role.     In addition  to   the  three nationalnetworks,   which constituted  its  entire  radio output  before   the advent of   the pirates,   it will  have  its  local  stations.     These  stations,which originate  their  own material  for 6  to 8   hours,   carry Radio  1and 2  for most of  the rest  of   the day.    Radio  1  which  is  the vehiclefor pop and Radio 2,   which  specialises   in  sweet music,   are  alreadyamalgamated for 9 or  10 hours of   the day.     There  is   thus  considerablescope  for  a more  intensive use  of   the  frequencies employed and  there&quot;/ill  continue  to be  adequate opportunity  for   the BBC to broadcastpop and sweet music.     By  the amalgamation of Radio  1  and 2throughout   the  day,   the BBC will   save   1.3m  a year.If   this   takes place   towards   the  end of  next  year,   the   income  fromthe  recently  increased  licence fee should  balance with estimated expenditure until March 1975,14.     For  the  IBA  the  advantages  of  possessing a national programme are  considerable.     It will  enable   the new Authority   to  establishits   service quickly  and  to become  at  an  early  stage a well-foundedcompetitor for   the BBC.     It  is  envisaged  that  this national  service would be under  the direct  control  of   the  IBA.     It might  commissionmuch of  its material  from  local  stations  and from programme  suppliers.The  sale of advertising might be undertaken on  its behalf  by one ormore private  companies,   selected on  a competitive basis.     It  is envisaged  that   the profits of   the channel would be  devoted  to providing  a  central   service of  national   and   international  news,    to meeting   the necessary  costs of   the Authority,   and  to underpinningthe  quality of   the  commercial  service  as  a whole.    The  profits ofthe national  channel would also be devoted by   the  IBA  to providingopportunities  for  live music;   the Government  recognises   that radio,which depends  to a  large  extent   today on recorded music,  must help to  enlarge  the  opportunities  for  the  employment  of musicians.     some anxiety has been expressed  lest  such  a national  service  should provetoo  strong a commercial  competitor  for  the  IBA  local stations.     ToFurther attempts will   therefore be made   to  find
some  extent,   however,    the   two  should draw on  different  kinds  of advertising,   and  the  IBA would ultimately have  it   in  its power  toregulate  the relative  attractiveness   to advertisers of   the   two services.    Alternatively,   it may be  that  local  radio will   in due course prove,   as  it has  done   in  some other  countries,   far morepopular  than national  radio programmes.    At  the  outset,   however,.thenational  programme   should help  to provide  a reasonable  balance betweenthe  radio services  of   the  IBA and  the BBC.     BBC radio will  have   threenational  programmes  and  a  local network,   and  the   IBA one national programme and a  local network with a  somewhat  larger coverage.15.     The precise number and disposition of   their  local   stations willbe a matter for   the new Authority.    The  stations  should,   however,serve  recognisable communities.    There will   thus be great variations in  the  size of population covered.    Stations   to serve   the bigconurbations will be  among   the  first   to be provided;  but   the  IBA willbe encouraged  to experiment  in  the early  stages with  theestablishment of  relatively small  stations   in order  to  determine   theminimum size of  community capable of  sustaining  a worthwhile  local radio  station. - There  are various  possibilities   for  linking   smallstations   in a  joint operation which may merit  investigation.    TheIBA stations must be  firmly rooted  in   their   loccility,   and  this  shouldbe  reflected  in   the  choice  of   station operators   and  subsequently   inthe  output.    The  stations will  be  linked by a network  in order  to exchange news,   music  and other programmes.    Most of   the material   thusreceived would however be  recorded and used at   the  discretion ofthe   local  station and with  local   linking.     It  is not  envisaged  thatthe   local stations would switch over  to a  sustaining  service  for  any significant periods.    A major  ingredient of   the  output  of   the stations will  be  local  news  and  information.     In  the   longer   term,   if more  frequencies become  available,   it may be possible   in  the conurbations   to provide  specialist  radio  stations  of   the kind foundin  the United States.     But with  the possible  exception of London,frequencies  cannot  in  the near  future be  found  for more  than oneindependent  station  in each  locality.16.     A central news  company,,   which should probably be  owned by  theAuthority,   is envisaged  to  supply both  the national  and  local  services.This would not necessarily provide  complete programmes   to   the  localcompanies  as does   Independent  Television News;   it may be  thoughtadvisable  in   the different  circumstances  of  radio   to allow greater
flexibility  in  the use of   its material.     It  should however be  a source of national  and  international news which will  set a standardfor  the  local companies  in  their  treatment of  local news.    There   iscompany,   to which  the Government will  give  further  consideration.There would be  attractions  in providing  two  competing   independentstations  in London from the  outset,   one  specialising  in music,   andthe other  in news  and  talk programmes.     This   latter  station could then also act  as   the  central news  company.    There  are,   however,considerable  doubts  as   to whether a suitable  frequency  can be  found for  a second London  service.THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT FOR  IBA STATIONS17.    The  income  for  the new radio stations will  be derived from spotadvertising between  the programmes or during natural  breaks withinprogrammes.    No other kinds  of  advertising  such as  sponsoredprogrammes will  be permitted.18.     The  speed with which  the new service  is  able   to  develop will depend upon  its  ability  to  attract  listeners.     Estimates  of  potentialrevenue are  certain  to vary widely.    To be worthwhile,   the servicecannot  be provided on  the cheap.     But   the Government  believes  thatindependent  radio will   attract  sufficient revenue   to provide analternative  service  of  high quality.     In   the   largest   conurbations   thelocal  stations may attract  a very  substantial   income.     In  such casesthe  form of  contract  should ensure   that after approved programmecosts have been met,   revenue  is   thereafter divided in prescribedproportions  between  the  company and  the Authority.    Cross-subsidisationhas  proved necessary  in  independent   television and  the Governmentforesees  a  similar need  in commercial  radio.    There will  be noquestion of  allowing  large  and easy profits  although  the  terms  of   the contracts must  be  such as   to  attract broadcasters  of  ability.the  excess revenue  from  the potentially more profitable  franchisesis  used  for  the  good of   the system as  a whole.19.     Each  local  radio company will  be given   the  right  and  duty  toprovide   the  local programmes  and to  sell  advertising   time   in  itslocal  service.     Each will   also  be  appointed for  an  initial   term ofthree  years;   and,   the  Authority will   be  entitled   to  grant  at   the  endof   the first  and each subsequent year,   extensions  for a further year.one other possiblarrangement  inr e 1 a t action to  theThe  contracts with  the  IBA should ensure  that
The  same  company will not necessarily be precluded from providingservice at more   than one  place.     Equally,   there will be no  bar onthe minority participation by an   investor  in a number of   localcompanies;   but  he will not be allowed an  excessive  aggregate  interesThe Authority will  be  expected  to  aim at a wide diversity ofown e r s h i p.20.    The Government  has considered with  care  a variety of representations   from those who believe  that  independent  radio maybe  injurious  to  their existing  businesses.     In particular  attention has been paid  to its possible effect on  the press.    Even at  its most successful,   radio wi11, however,   be  a relatively small  contender  foradvertising.     The Government believes   that  future developments  inindependent  television could have  a  larger effect  on  the press,   andthat  in   their   timing   this  effect must  be borne  in mind.     such evidence  as   there  is  does not  suggest either   that   the   impact of independent radio will necessarily be  damaging  to  local newspapers.None   the   less   the Government accepts   the case  for  giving  special consideration   to  the   local  and provincial  press.     It  believesmoreover   that provided safeguards  can be  secured against   the risksinherent   in an undue  concentration of   the means of  communication,the  existing media  -  and   in particular,    the   local  press  and   the television company  -  can make  a valuable  contribution   to   theoperation of  an  independent  radio service.    Accordingly,   theGovernment  proposes   that:- local newspapers with  a significant  circulation  in  the transmission  area of  a given  local  station should have  theright   to acquire an  interest  in  it,  whether or not   they formed part  of   the  company awarded  the  contract;- where a local newspaper has a monopoly in an area it will notbe  allowed  to  acquire  a controlling  interest;- television companies will  be  allowed shareholdings but notcontrolling  interests,21.    At   times  since   the coming of   television  it  has  seemed  thatradio would be  almost completely superseded.     It  is now clear  thatradio has  an unmatched flexibility  and  immediacy,   which willguarantee   it  a  continuing place  as  an   important medium ofcommunication.     Public demands on radio may have changed.    People
probably now  listen  to  radio  for  shorter periods at  a  time,   and more often while  doing  something else,   but   there  is evidence  from a numberof  countries  of  a renewed growth in radio  listening.     The government believes   that   this new element of  competition will  add  to   thevitality of our broadcasting  services.    The  arrangements proposed  inthis White Paper will  enable  the new  service  to make  a worthwhilecontribution,   particularly   in exploring   the  possibilities  of   local radio,   and will  encourage   the BBC  to add  further  to  its  formidablerecord of  achievement   in radio.Revised draft  5 March 1971
G1FIDENTIAIANNEX/APPENDIX AFREQUENCY PLANS FOB.  INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING1.      Only  the Authority responsible   for  planning  the  system will be ableto decide where  it wants  the stations  and how many  it will need.    until these requirements  are known  frequency planning must,   to a  large extent,be hypothetical.2.      Any plan for  expanding  radio  services  is   limited by the  radiofrequencies   that  can  be made  available  and  these are always  in  short supply.    Three  frequency bands  are used for domestic sound broadcastingin  the European Broadcasting Area*:     the  low frequency   (If)  band  (alsoknown as   the  long-wave band)   the medium-frequency   (mf)  band  (also knownas  the medium-wave band)   and   the very-high-frequency  (vhf)  band  (alsoknown  as Broadcasting Band  II).    The use of  frequency channels   in  theIf and mf  bands   is  regulated by  the European Broadcasting Convention(Copenhagen,   1948)  and  the Copenhagen Plan annexed  to  it;   the use ofthe vhf  band  is  regulated  in accordance with a Regional Agreement  forthe European Broadcasting Area  (Stockholm,   1961).    Notes  on  frequencyplanning  standards  appear.at Appendix B.3 .      Low-frequency bandThe  If  band contains  only 15  separate  frequency channels,   one  of whichis assigned to  the United Kingdom and  is used by  the BBC for Radio 2transmissions  from Droitwich.     In   this  band signals  are reliablytransmitted  for  relatively  long distances  by day and night  and  the  bandis therefore well  suited  to  the  transmission of nation-wide  services.It would not  be possible   to use any of   the other  14 If  channels  for  anational  commercial  service   in  the United Kingdom without causingharmful   interference  to  the  country  authorised  to use  it;   it would alsobe wasteful   to use an  If  channel  for   local  services.4 .      Medixim-frequency bandThe mf  band contains  121   separate  frequency  channels,   all  of which are used  intensively  in   the European Broadcasting Area for domesticbroadcasting  and  to a  lesser extent  for external  broadcasting,   ie,   the broadcasting of  programmes  intended  to be received in countries otherthan  those  in which  they originate.__* Europe,    together with   those  African and Asian  countries  bordering   theMediterranean,   plus  Jordan and  Iraq.
(confidential)-5.      The medium frequency channels assigned  for United Kingdom use bythe Copenhagen Convention,   1948,   are   intensively used by   the  BBC forthree of  their  four national  services,   and  in 1966  the Government ofthe day  stated  in a White Paper  (cmd 3169,   December  1966)   that:&quot;No general  service of   local  sound broadcasting which would beavailable during   the hours of darkness as well  as  in daylight  canbe provided only on medium wavelengths  allotted  to  the UnitedKi ngdom&quot;.This  statement was based on  the assumption  that   the main mf  services would be maintained  in their then existing form.     On  this  basis   it   is  stilltrue   today,   but   it  is  nevertheless possible   (subject  in some cases  to negotiation with other administrations  in  the European Broadcasting Area)to re-deploy certain of   the medium frequency channels   the BBC use andto make  some available for other  purposes.    Thus,   as   the  BBC  themselvesenvisaged -   though as part of   their plans  for a general  service ofBBC  local  radio with medium  frequency back-up -   it   is proposed  to  closedown  the alternative versions of Radio 4  that are provided  in various parts  of  England,   and provide  a  common Radio 4  service   for   the whole  ofthe  country   (services   to Wales,   Scotland and Northern  Ireland would notbe affected).    The  combined English programme will   then be-accommodated with some   improvement of  coverage,   on  three  frequency channelsins Lead of   the  six at present used.    Thus   three  channels  will  become available   for other uses.    A fourth,   can be  found by confining   the Radio3 mf   service   to a single  channel  at negligible  cost   in Radio  3  coverage.6.      One  of   the channels   thus  freed will be used  to  augment our external  broadcasting  services.    Another will  be used  to  improve   the coverage of   the  IBA national  service  based on  the  frequency at present used  for  the BBC&apos;s Radio  1   (see para 11  of   the White Paper).     The  tworemaining  channels  will   contribute   towards   the  provision of  mf   back-upfor  local  radio.    However,   even with  the addition of  the   InternationalCommon Frequencies which   the UK  is  entitled  to use  it  would not bepossible  to provide  a general  service of  day and night  time back-up  forthe  two  local  services   (BBC and  IBA)  envisaged.7.      To provide medium frequencies  for  further  local  stations,  afterthe  fullest use has  been made of   those  already available   to   theUnited Kingdom,   the Government   intends    to make  proposals,   by meansof   the. procedure provided  in Article  8 of   the Copenhagen Convention,and Article  9 of   the Radio Regulations   (edition of   1968)   of   the(confidential)
(confidential)International  Telecommunication Union,   for  the use of   the  frequenciesassigned  to other countries  in  the European Broadcasting Area in caseswhere  it  seems  likely  that medium  frequency channels   for additionallocal  radio  stations could be provided  in  the.United Kingdom,   without causing  harmful  interference  to  those countries at present  authorisedto use   them.    Decisions   to establish  stations  at particular places,   orusing particular  frequencies under  these  procedures,   cannot be madefirm until   the procedures  have  been  completed.8.      Local  stations  operating  on  frequencies  assigned  to  other countries will  generally have a smaller useful  service  area at night because  of interference  from  the  stations  overseas  and might,   in  some cases,   haveto be  operated on  lower power  at  night   to  avoid harmful   interference   tothe  services   in other countries.    Nevertheless,   the addition of  asubstantial number of   local radio stations  operating  on other  countries&apos;frequencies  should permit  of   the   technical  realisation of an  independentlocal station network of  up  to  60 stations covering up  to  70 per cent of   tiie population by day and 25 per  cent  by night,   and  also providescope for mf back-up for BBC local  radio extending  eventually  to perhaps50% of   the population by day.     The  coverage of   the   local  stations will depend very much upon  the  sites chosen  for  them and   the populationcoverage  figures  quoted above  are  therefore necessarily very approximate.9.      The  International  Telecommunication Union proposes   to hold aninternational  conference   to  review and revise   the Copenhagen convention and Plan for  the use  of   low and medium frequencies  in  the EuropeanBroadcasting Area.    The present proposal  by  the Administrative Councilof  the   ITU  is   that  the  first phase of  such a conference  should  takeplace  in  1974.    The working  assumption  is,   therefore,   that a new convention and Plan will  come   into  force,   by about   1976.     Changes  -which might  be extensive  -  to  our national  deployment  of  mediumfrequency channels might   then be needed.10,     Very high  frequenciesThe BBC is  providing 20  local stations  in England  in a part of   thevhf band,   recently made available  for broadcasting,   lying between95 and 97.5 MHz.     By making  a modest reduction in   the   total  coverageof   the  present  20 BBC  local  stations and  rearranging some of   the frequencies   it  appears  possible   to  accommodate   them and,   in addition,some 60  independent  stations.     These would mainly use   lower powerthan  the BBC stations and be   intended  to
3      S     5 J*) IP&quot; $2    V tea nil^ 1IAserve  individual  towns  or cities  and  their  immediate  environs.     Inspite  of   the greater number of  stations  in  the  IBA network,   its   totalcoverage would  be  only about   the   same   as   that  of   the  BBC network  ie11.    To achieve greater coverage  for  both BBC and  independent   local radio stations   in vhf will  require  additional   frequency channels.The Government will   therefore be considering whether  additional  space in  the very high  frequency band between 97.6 and  100 MHz,   at  present used for mobile  radio  services,   could be  freed for broadcasting.    this may,   even  in  the  longer  term,   be difficult  but  if  all  or part ofthis  additional   space were  to  become  available  for  broadcasting andwas not  required for other purposes   (eg   the Open Lin i vers i ty) ,   itcould be used  to  improve  and extend  the  local  broadcasting  services.about  65 per cent  of UK by day and night.
confidential annex/APPENDIX BFREQUENCY PLANNING STANDARDSused  in1.This appendix outlines the reception standards which have beenin  formulating  the  frequency plans  described  in  the main paper and in  the  preceding  appendix.Medium Frequency Band2.       During  daytime   a mf   signal   is  propagated by  a  stable  &quot;ground wave&quot;which travels  over   the surface of   the earth and has  a range which  is determined by various  factors  such as  frequency   (signals  on  lowerfrequencies reach  farther  than  those  on frequenci es  at  the upper end ofthe band),   ground conductivity  (signals   travel  better over ground witha good conductivity or  over   sea water),   and  the power of   the   transmitter.3.      Beginning about  one  hour before sunset,   changes   in  the  ionospherestart   to  affect   the propagation of mf  signals  and  in addition to  theground wave,   sky wave  propagation  takes place.     That  is   to  say,   signalsleaving   the   transmitter   in  a  skyward direction  are  reflected  backtowards   the  earth again and   strong but variable  signals may appear onthe ground,   at places up  tc many hundreds  of kilometres  from  thetransmitter.     The  effect  reaches  a maximum at   about  midnight   and  thengradually dies   away,   becoming  almost  negligible  by  about one   hour aftersunrise.     The  sky wave   from  a   transmitter can have   two effects:     first,it can   interfere with  the ground wave  from  the  same   transmitter,   causing the   signals   towards   the   limits  of   the  service   area   to  fade  at night;and secondly,   it can cause   interference,   at great distances,   to  the reception of  other  signals  in  the  same  frequency channel.4.       In  the  absence of   interference  from other  transmissions,   theservice  range of  a broadcasting  transmitter  is   the distance  from thetransmitter  at  which   the   strength of   the   signal  has   fallen   to  the lowest   level   that  gives  sound of  a satisfactory- quality  from thelistener&apos;s  receiver.    However,   such  is   the  intensive use of   the mfchannels   in Europe,   some   1440  stations,   including  450 of  10 kW power or above, being operated on   the  121  channels  available,   that   theservice  range of  almost  every   transmitter  at night   is   limited byinterference  from other  transmitters using  the  same  channel.    The  servicerange  is   then  the distance  from  the   transmitter  at which  the strengthof  the wanted signal   is  sufficiently  in  excess  of   the   strength of   theinterfering  signal   to give  a quality of  sound  satisfactory  to  thelistener.     Even   in  daytime,   if   transmitters using   the   same   frequencychannel  are  closely spaced on  the ground,   the   service range  of   each  ofthem may be   limited by  interference  from  the other.
r5, The quality of service provided by a mf broadcasting station toan individual listener depends upon many factors, the most importantbeing :(ii)    Frequency of wanted-signa1   transmitter,(iii)    Distance between  receiving  site and  transmitter,(iv)    Nature of   the  intervening   terrain.(v)    Propagation characteristics  by day and night,(vi)    The nature   (ie  factors  i   to v above)  of  any othertransmissions  on  the same  frequency channel,(vii)     The nature of  any  transmissions  on  adjacent  frequencychannels (which may also cause interference in certain circumstances,particularly  with receivers having poor  selectivity).6.      Given all   this  data  it   is  possible   to estimate  for any givenreceiving  site   the  ratio of   the  strength of  the wanted signal  from a defined  transmitter  to   that of  any  interfering  signal  on  the  same,   oran adjacent  frequency channel.    However,   the  quality of  receptionjudged by  the  listener  is  still  subject   to  two variable  factors:(viii)     The  q\iality of   the   listener&apos;s   receiving   installation.(ix)    The  subjective  judgment of  each  individual   listener  taking into account  his personal   tastes  and  the  character  of   the programmematerial   to which he  is   listening.7.      When planning new stations   it   is clearly necessary  to adoptcertain  standards which,   in  relation   to   items  viii  and   ix,   must  bearbitrary.    The Copenhagen Convention and Plan gives no guidance onthis point but  in recent  years  following a great deal  of work and discussion  the  International  Consultative Committee  on Radiocommunications(CCIR)   technical  consultative  committee of  the   InternationalTelecommunication    Union -  has made recommendations   for mf  broadcastingv/hich may be  summarised as  follows:(i)    Minimum signal   strength giving  satisfactory  service  in  theabsence of  interference  -  1 milli  volt per metre   (mV/m).(ii)    The radio-frequency protection  ratio  (ratio of wanted-signa1strength  to   interfering  signal  strength)   for a non-fading  signalon   the  same  frequency -  100:1(iii)    Radio  frequency protection  ratio for a  fading  signal  on  thesame  frequency  (midnight median value)   -   100:1.(iv)    Radio  frequency protection  ratio for non-fading  signal  on anadjacent  channel  -  4:1.(i)Effective power of  wanted-signa1   transmitter.
8In  the  area  surrounding  a  transmitter,   the  field  strength,   inmV/m    decreases  as   the distance  from  the   transmitter  increases.Without   interference.,   the   service  area  of   a   transmitter   is   considered to be   the  area over which a  signa.1   strength of  at   least   lmV/m  is available.     If  a co-channel  interfering  signal   is present  of  strength0.1 mV/m,   then   the  service  area of   the   transmitter would be  reducedto that  over which  the  signal  strength was at  least  10 mV/m  (100 x 0.1);with  an   interfering  signal   field  strength of   1  mV/m  (which  could be experienced by day  if  co-channel   transmitters were  too closely spaced,or at night&apos; from very powerful  distant   transmitters)   then  the servicearea would be that over which the signal strength is at least 100 mV/m(100 x 1 ) .interfering  programme would be   just  audible  during  quiet   intervals   inthe wanted  signal.    Many people will  argue  that  this   is  a betterstandard  than  is  really necessary,   and  indeed at   internationalfrequency planning conferences   it  is not uncommon  to  accept  a protection ratio of  about  50:1.     A value of  about  30:1   is  considered to be   the   lowest value   that could be  accepted  in places where  theneed  for new services  is  pressing,   and  this   is   the value  of  protectionupon which  the coverage  estimates  for medium frequency  local radio are based  in   the  body of   this  paper.     Many more  people,   living  outside   theservice  area calculated on   this  basis  will   receive  signals  from localmf stations well   above  the usable  limit of   1 mV/m,   but with a protectionratio of   less   than 30:1.    Within  the  service  area as  so  defined peoplereceiving  stronger signals will  get a better quality of  service withprotection  ratios greater  than  30:1.1 0.     Very-high-frequency  bandSignals   from  a vhf   transmitter are stable  up   to  and  somewhat  beyondhorizon distance  from the   transmitting  aerial.    At greater distances,signals  become weaker  and vary  in strength  (fade).    The  signals do notvary  appreciably  between  day   and night   so   that   the  coverage  of  a vhfstation remains  constant   throughout   the 24  hours.    Apart  from this,   theproblems which  arise  in planning  a vhf  service  are  similar  to  those for  an mf   service  but,   since   the vhf   signal   is   frequency-modulated,   the recommended service  standards  are different.     Those recommended bythe CCIR are:-9.These  figures  relate   to a good standard of  service  in which  the
confidently(i)    Minimum signal   strengths giving  satisfactory  service  in  theabsence of   interference  from other   transmissions:in  rural areas:      0.25 mV/min  urban  areas :       1  mV/min  large  cities:     3 mV/m(These  standards  allow for  the varying  incidence of  interferencefrom motor  cars,   electrical machinery  etc,   in different   types  ofenvironmen t).(ii)    Protection ratio for  interference  from a stable  signal  on  thesame  frequency:     60:1.(iii)    Protection ratio  against  fading  interference   (exceeded for99% of   the   t ime):     25:1.(iv)    Protection ratio  against   interfering  signals on:the  adjacent channels: 4:1the next-but-one channels: 2:1the next-but-two  channels: 1:2the next-but-three channels:     1:1011.    The plan  for  the  existing BBC  local  stations   is  based on  a  signalstrength  limit of 0.25 mV/m out   in  the  revised plan  for  a  total  ofabout  80  stations  a number of   these would have a  poorergrade of  service.   The  requirements  at  iv above place  severelimitations  on   the  frequency  channels   that may be used  to serveadjacent or overlapping  areas.    However,   where   these conditions  are metsome  interference may be experienced from neighbouring channels   ifreceivers  are used having  a  lower  selectivity   than  that upon which  theCCIR recommendation above was  based.12.    Furthermore,   receivers using  transistors  are  subject  to overloadingin  the presence of a  strong   local   signal,  which  then  interferes withwanted  signals   that are well  spaced  from it   in frequency.    This  effectmust be minimised by carefully siting  the   transmitter  so  thatrelatively  few  listeners  are within  its  strong  signal  range.
