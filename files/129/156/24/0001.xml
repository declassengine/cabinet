CONFIDENTIAL-FINAL REVISE[to be published as Command 4641 by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery office price 35p net]Government organisation for Defence Procurement and civil Aerospace
GOVERNMENT ORGANISATION FOR defence procurement AND CIVIL AEROSPACEIntroductionIn the White Paper on &quot;The Reorganisation of Central Government&quot;(Cmnd. 4506) of October 1970, the Government announced their intention to rationalise the whole function of defence procurement, and the overlappingaerospace responsibilities, on a lasting basis. As a temporary measure, theMinistry of Aviation Supply was set up to take over, for the time being, all theaerospace functions of the former Ministry of Technology; at the same time a project team was set up, under the leadership of Mr. Derek Rayner, with thefollowing terms of reference: &quot;To make recommendations, in time for new arrangements to be imple-mented by 1st April 1972, on:(a) How best to organise the integration of all defence research and develop-ment and procurement activities, under the responsibility of theSecretary of State for Defence: among the possibilities to be consideredshould be the establishment of an agency within Government.(b) How best to handle, in the light of (a), the Government^ relations withthe industries concerned, including its responsibilities in support ofcivil aircraft projects and other civil aerospace activities.The project team should pay particular regard to the need to meet essentialdefence and civil requirements in the most economical and efficient way.&quot;The main features2. The project team has now made a report: this is published as part of this white Paper. This makes recommendations for a new allocation of Ministerialand Departmental responsibilities and outlines the main structure of a new defence procurement organisation. The Government accept these recom-mendations. The main features are:(i) There will be a single procurement organisation headed by a chief executive responsible to the Secretary of State for Defence. It will be known as the Procurement Executive and will combine the existingresponsibilities of the Ministries of Defence and of Aviation supply for the procurement of defence equipment.(ii) Directly under the Chief Executive, there will be:(a) three Controllers for Sea, Land and Air Systems who will also be members of the Admiralty, Army and Air Force Boards respec-tively;(b) a Controller for Guided Weapon and Electronic Systems;(c) a Controller for Research and Development Establishments and research.The Chief Executive and the four Systems Controllers will be Account-ing Officers for their respective Votes. Reporting to the Chief Executive3514624 A*
through a Secretary will be four Controllers responsible respectivelyfor Policy, Finance, Personnel and Sales.(iii) Responsibility for policy towards the aerospace industry and towardscivil aerospace research and development, and projects, will betransferred to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who willcall on the resources of the Procurement Executive for advice and forthe execution of the civil programmed(iv) The users will be responsible for determining in the light of all available information their requirements within their overall priorities and theresources available. The procurement organisation should have itsown Votes for its procurement activities and should not be requiredto recover the costs of either research and development or production from its defence customers; but procurement on behalf of the Depart-ment of Trade and Industry and other departments will be paid foron their Votes.(v) There will be a Ministerial Aerospace Board consisting of the Secretaryof State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industryto oversee the collaboration between the two departments and to bethe authority for instructions and policy guidance to the ProcurementExecutive on civil aerospace matters.(vi) The Ministerial Aerospace Board will also be responsible for the co-ordination of space procurement policy; for this purpose the Secretaryof State for Education and Science and the Minister of Posts and telecommunications will also be members of it.Implementation3. It will take time to bring the new organisation into being and it will notbe fully operational, with its new Vote and accounting arrangements, until 1st April 1972. The sequence of events envisaged by the Government is set outin the following paragraphs.4. A draft Order in Council will be laid before Parliament for its approvalas soon as possible.5. On 1st May 1971, therefore:(i) The Ministry of Aviation Supply will be dissolved.(ii) Ministerial responsibility for all the defence activities of the Ministryof Aviation Supply, together with the great majority of the staff andall the establishments, will pass to the Secretary of State for Defence.(iii) Ministerial responsibility for the aerospace industry and for civilaerospace policy, together with the necessary supporting staff, willpass to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.6. New Ministerial posts will be created, in the Ministry of Defence andthe Department of Trade and Industry respectively, to provide the two Secre-taries of State with Ministerial assistance in the discharge of their new responsi-bilities.* There will be special arrangements for Concorde (see paragraph 8).4
Rolls-Royce7. The staff to be transferred to the Secretary of State for Trade and industry will include those dealing with the future of Rolls-Royce.Concorde8. Because of its special nature the Concorde project team was set up to combine policy and project management responsibilities in a way which makes the clear separation between them, which is to apply generally, difficult tofollow in this case. So rather than break up the team at this advanced stage ofthe project, the Government have decided to transfer the whole of the staff ofthe Concorde management team to the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry. The specialist supporting staffs, who are not part of the concorde project organisation, will remain as.part of the Procurement Executive underthe Secretary of State for Defence.Space9. The Governments policy responsibilities for space questions involve anumber of Ministers and Departments; these will continue to be co-ordinatedthrough the normal Cabinet machinery. The particular responsibilities of theMinistry of Aviation Supply will be redistributed. Technical and managerialresponsibility for research, development and procurement will be transferred tothe new Procurement Executive. Its non-defence policy and financial responsi-bilities, including those for European space programmes and the UnitedKingdom Space Technology Programme, will go to the Department of Tradeand Industry. The Ministerial Aerospace Board (see paragraph 2 above) will beavailable to co-ordinate space procurement activities between user departments and the new Procurement Executive.Subsequent timetable10. The Chief Executive and the other principal officers of the new Procure-ment Executive, together with the project team, will be responsible for the detailed planning of the new organisation. They will take up their appointmentsfull-time not later than 1st October 1971 so that the new Accounting Officerarrangements described in paragraph 2 can come into operation on 1st April1972. Meanwhile the staff of the Ministry of Defence, together with the stafftransferred to it from the Ministry of Aviation Supply, will carry out their responsibilities broadly on the existing basis.Atomic Weapons Research Establishment11. The recommendation that responsibility for the Atomic WeaponsResearch Establishment should be transferred from the United kingdom atomic Energy Authority to the Secretary of State for Defence, will be examined further in consultation with the Authority, with a view to seeing how best its functions can be rationalised with those of the other Defence Research andDevelopment establishments. This examination will be completed in time toallow any necessary changes to be made by 1st April 1972 when the newprocurement organisation becomes fully operational: the planned review of research and development effort in this whole field will in any case extend tothe Atomic Weapons Research Establishment.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE BY MR. D. G. RAYNER1. This report proposes a basis for a new organisation for the procurementof war-like stores for the Armed Services and for dealing with Governmentcivil aerospace interests. It suggests what the departmental responsibilities inthis area should be and, in broad outline, the organisational structures needed in the Departments concerned to carry these out effectively and economically.Decisions are required on the broad acceptibility of these proposals as a basis for the large volume of work that will be necessary, in depth, to translate them into a fully operative scheme and to explore a number of very importantassociated problems referred to in the report.2. 1 would like to emphasise at the outset that, in building up the case fora new procurement organisation, I have thought it appropriate to probe deeplyfor weaknesses inherent in the existing organisations, but, at the same time, I wish to emphasise that, in the course of this examination, I have been impressed by the many outstandingly good features in the present procurement systems,which must not be inadvertently overlooked in making new arrangements.For example:(a) The high quality of Service officers, particularly in understanding linemanagement and the value of good human relations.(b) Service loyalties which, although they can lead to duplication of effort and parochialism, properly channelled are capable of making a very valuable contribution to a new organisation.(c) The enthusiasm of those employed at the research and development establishments and the actual and potential management qualities ofsome of the scientists and engineers.(d) The Services&apos; and scientists&apos; search for quality and their contempt ofthe second best; provided that they can be persuaded not to allow&quot; the best to stand in the way of the good &quot;, their standards are aworth-while input to prevent complacency in a procurement organisa-tion.(e) The unique experience of civil servants in coping with political changes of emphasis and in working to give satisfaction to Parliament andpoliticians; skilled procurement experience is not enough in Govern-ment.3. In essence, the proposals in this report for a new organisation seek tocreate accountable units of management to handle procurement, to develop and reward the specialist skills which are needed, and to create an atmospherein which those involved will be motivated to do their utmost to give satisfaction to the user. The criticisms in the report are based on the view that procurementis a specialised function which can only be carried out efficiently by people withspecialised skills. The existing procurement organisations have taken someaccount of this, and increasingly so in recent years, with the deliberate build-up
of such devices as project management systems and training in management.However, the process has been uneven and not sufficiently conscious and deliberate, because the organisational pattern as it stands is not well suited tothe task, and does not have all the right skills in the right balance. This is nota situation which can be put right overnight, nor indeed is there an idealsolution. Any reshaping of the procurement organisation must take care of theneed to balance continuity with change. What I think can be done is to set anew organisational pattern which will offer a prospect of developing over theyears a more efficient procurement operation, better fitted to meet the wishes of its customers and to work within the resoxirces available to them.4. I am deeply indebted for the help that has willingly been given to me by the Service officers, scientists and other civil servants operating the presentprocurement arrangements. My task has been simplified by the atmosphere ofco-operation and frankness which I have met throughout the enquiries. Ingeneral, I am left with the impression of a uniquely strong combination ofability, loyalty and dedication which, if freed from some of the shackles whichhamper initiative and dynamism, can provide the necessary leadership to bringabout the changes required. Indeed, I have found no signs of reluctance to make changes for the better, but only a healthy scepticism of change for change&apos;s sakeand fear of change for the worse.5. It is also appropriate to acknowledge the help I have been given by someof the excellent reports that have been produced notably Gibb/Zuckerman,Downey, Fulton, Raby, Elstub, the report of the Select Committee on science and Technology on Defence Research, some private papers lent to me and various publications dealing with American experience.6. My thanks are due as well to those from a variety of outside bodies and individuals, in industry and elsewhere, who have provided me with a great dealof evidence on the workings of the present system from their point of view. 1am grateful to them for their constructive suggestions for improvements andthese have been taken into account in the recommendations of the Project Team.7. There is one final point. Taken as a whole the proposals in this report will, over the years, involve a fairly radical change in the way in which this area of procurement is dealt with. Nevertheless most of the individual proposals in it are based on developments already taking place in one or other part ofthe existing organisations as a result of experience on the job. The aim is to givea new, and in some cases sharp, impetus to these developments and to fit them into a pattern which will enable further evolution to take place more readilybut without interrupting the work actually in progress on the existing defence and civil programmes.Signed:  D. G. Rayner.31st March 1971.
SUMMARY OF recommendations the Project Team recommends:Organisation(1) the existing weapons system procurement activities of the Ministries ofDefence and Aviation Supply should be combined in a single procurementorganisation under the executive authority of the Secretary of State for Defence(Paragraph 35);(2) the procurement organisation should be an integral part of the Ministryof Defence and not set up as a separate agency (Paragraphs 35 and 111);(3) the new procurement organisation should be headed by a Chief Execu-tive, appointed for at least a three year term, with a Secretary as his principaladviser; the Chief Executive should be an &quot;additional&apos; member of the defence council (Paragraphs 38, 48, 51 and 53);(4) the other principal officers in the organisation should be a controller of Research and Development Establishments and Research, a Controller of sea Systems, a Controller of Land Systems, a Controller of Air Systems, aController of Guided Weapon and Electronics Systems, a Controller of Policy,a Controller of Finance, a Controller of Personnel, and a Controller of DefenceSales, the first five of these reporting direct to the Chief Executive and theremainder through the Secretary (Paragraph 38);(5) in the longer term the Controllerate of Guided Weapon and ElectronicSystems should be absorbed into the Controllerates dealing with Sea, Land andAir Systems (Paragraph 68);(6) in order to create fully accountable units of management, authority and responsibility should be concentrated at the Controller level for all activities in a particular area such as the development and production of land, sea or air systems and this process of concentration should be continued down eachcontrollerate to at least the level of Deputy Chief Scientific Officer (or otherprofessional equivalent), Assistant Secretary or Service Officer of one star rank(Paragraphs 42 and 70);(7) a project manager should have full executive responsibility; the neces-sary specialists, including contracts and finance, who support him at appropriatetimes during the life of a project should be under his direct control although theywould also have a functional line of responsibility within their own specialisations-tions (Paragraphs 70 and 78);Vote and Accounting Officer Arrangements(8) the procurement organisation should charge its civil customers for allwork it carries out on their behalf (Paragraph 40);(9) the procurement organisation should have its own votes for its procure-ment activities and should not be required to recover the costs of either research and development or production from its defence customers (Paragraph 41);(10) the procurement organisation should have five votes, four covering the four systems controllerates and the fifth covering headquarters administra-tion, research and development establishments and research (Paragraph 43);
(11) the four Systems Controllers should be accounting officers for theirown votes and the Chief Executive the accounting officer for the vote coveringheadquarters administration, research and development establishments and research (Paragraphs 38, 43, 46 and 71);Service User Rights(12) the users should have direct and easy access to those who are working to meet their requirements in the project management organisation(Paragraph 72);(13) each Systems Controller should be a member of the appropriateService Board with the role in this appointment of informing and advising theBoard on procurement matters of concern to it; he should have a similar role in relation to the other Service Boards on projects which he is carrying outon their behalf; a similar relationship should exist between the ControllersAir Systems and Guided Weapon and Electronic Systems and the Departmentof Trade and Industry (Paragraphs 76 and 77);Research and Development Establishments(14) the procurement organisation should be responsible for the manage-ment of all defence research and development establishments, including the atomic Weapons Research Establishment; an early decision should be takento bring the latter establishment within the Ministry of Defence (Paragraphs 79and 86);(15) the Controller of Research and Development Establishments and research should be among those appointed as soon as decisions have beentaken on the report and he should prepare a plan for rationalising the research and development establishments with a view to its earliest possible implement a-tion (Paragraph 85);(16) the Directors of research and development establishments should begiven the maximum possible delegated authority in managing their establish-ments with matching accountability (Paragraph 88);(17) there should be much greater selectivity of objectives to make the most effective use of those resources devoted to applied research and exploratorydevelopment (Paragraph 89);Personnel Management(18) procurement should be treated as a specialised function; the procure-ment organisation should deliberately set out to provide its own top and middle managers, and senior posts should be open to officers of all specialisations-tions who develop the necessary capabilities; but regard will have to be paidto wider considerations of Service and other careers (Paragraph 60);(19) the procurement organisation should be largely autonomous in staffmanagement matters (Paragraphs 62 and 63);
Civil Aerospace(20) Subject to the reference to Concorde in paragraph 119, the Governmentresources both for the execution of civil and military aerospace work and forthe management of such work in industry should continue to be handled by asingle organisation (Paragraph 115);(21) the procurement organisation should be responsible for the executionand management of government programmes of civil aerospace research,development and production as well as for defence procurement but policyresponsibilities for the aerospace industry and for civil aerospace research anddevelopment and projects should pass to the Department of Trade andIndustry (Paragraphs 35, 115 and 118; see also paragraph 117 for the interestsof the Defence Secretary in this area);(22) in accordance with arrangements to be agreed, the Department ofTrade and Industry should keep the procurement organisation informed oftheir policy towards the aerospace industry; pass their requirements, includingfinancial authorisations, for civil aerospace research and development andprojects to the organisation; and institute appropriate procedures for monitoringprogress and for handling any modifications (Paragraph 124);(23) a Ministerial Aerospace Board consisting of the Secretaries of Statefor Defence and for Trade and Industry, or their representatives, should beset up to oversee the collaboration between the two Departments and to be theauthority for any instructions and policy guidance on aerospace matters thatrequire to be given by the Board to the procurement organisation through theSecretary of State for Defence (Paragraph 124);(24) responsibility for co-ordinating space procurement policy should lie with the Ministerial Aerospace Board reinforced for this purpose by theSecretary of State for Education and Science and the Minister of Posts and Tele-communications (Paragraph 120);(25) operational responsibilities for space activities should remain withcustomer departments; policy and financial responsibility for the UnitedKingdom Space Technology Programme should pass to the Department ofTrade and Industry as part of its general responsibilities for the aerospaceindustry; technical and managerial responsibility for the existing spaceactivities of the Ministry of Aviation Supply should pass to the procurementorganisation, costs being recovered from the customer departments outsidethe Ministry of Defence (Paragraph 120);(26) for the remaining aerospace activities the technical and executive responsibilities at present with the Ministry of Aviation Supply should pass to the procurement organisation, with policy and operational requirements fedin from the Department of Trade and Industry or the proposed Civil aviation authority as the case may be (Paragraph 121);(27) the Department of Trade and Industry should not attempt to duplicatethe considerable resources and expertise that will be available to them fromthe procurement organisation in the Ministry of Defence but should establish a high quality technical and administrative unit with the principal tasks of advising the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and, as necessary, the15
Aerospace Board on Government policy for the aerospace industry and of ensuring that the future needs of the civil air transport industry and of other civil customers are assessed and met within the limits of the technical andfinancial resources available (Paragraph 123);(28) there should be full access, as of right, by staff of the Department ofTrade and Industry dealing with civil aerospace to the relevant research anddevelopment establishments and headquarters staffs of the defence procurementorganisation and firm and formal arrangements should be made for this (Para-graph 124);(29) special arrangements should be made, under the aegis of the CivilService Department, for staff, particularly technical staff, dealing with civilaerospace in the Department of Trade and Industry to be dealt with for careerdevelopment purposes by the defence procurement organisation in consultationwith the Chief Scientist, Department of Trade and Industry (Paragraphs 62and 125);
SECTION A-THE EXISTING PROCUREMENT ORGANISATIONSIntroduction1. The task of the Project Team is to make recommendations in time for new arrangements to be implemented by 1st April 1972 on:(a) How best to organise the integration of all defence research anddevelopment and procurement activities under the responsibility of theSecretary of State for Defence; among the possibilities to be consideredshould be the establishment of an agency within Government.(b) How best to handle, in the light of (a) the Governments relations withthe industries concerned, including its responsibilities in support ofcivil aircraft projects and other civil aerospace activities.The Project Team were asked to pay particular regard to the need to meetessential defence and civil requirements in the most economical and efficientway.2. In addition to Mr. Rayner himself, the members of the Project Team are:Mr. H. L. Lawrence-Wilson   ..   Under Secretary, Civil Service Depart-ment.Mr. J. B. Visser ..      ..      ..   Assistant Secretary, Ministry of aviation-tion Supply.Captain P. G. Wigney, RN    ..   Ministry of Defence.Mr. W. H. Hill ..      ..      ..   Deputy Chief Scientific Officer, Minis-try of Defence.Mr. J. McClelland       ..      ..   Principal, Ministry of Defence.Mr. J. D. Henes ..      ..      ..   Principal, Ministry of Aviation Supply.3. This report is the outcome of our collective activities as a team and theproposals are backed by all its members. In it we use the term &quot;procurement&quot;to embrace research, development and production.4. In order to ensure that bur proposals should be realistic, it has been neces-sary for us to become familiar with the procurement activities carried out atpresent by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Aviation Supply. to achieve this, we thought it necessary to have informal meetings with a widecross-section of senior personnel and to learn from them how they see theirpresent tasks and what organisation they would like to see emerge in the future.We have received papers from, and have met representatives of, the institution of Professional Civil Servants and of the Staff Side of the Ministry of AviationSupply. We have received evidence from the principal trade associations and research councils and from 27 firms engaged in defence procurement, most ofwhom we have visited. A full list is at Appendix A. We have also thought it essential to visit in their environment each of the Armed Services, to take account of American experience and to visit the French departments connectedwith defence and civil aviation.5. Defence procurement is by any standards of judgment a very large under-taking, as the statistics in Appendix B show. It involves an expenditure of over one thousand million pounds annually and the full-time employment of some
52,000 people and it is and will continue to be concerned with problems ofgreat difficulty and complexity.6. There are currently three separate procurement organisations. Centralco-ordination and control is mainly confined to the research and developmentphases and is exercised through a number of Ministry of Defence committees.Two of the organisations, which procure respectively the bulk of naval and armyequipment, are integral parts of the Services which they supply, whilst the third,the Ministry of Aviation Supply, is divorced from its customers. These organisa-tions are the product of separate and complex histories, with the result that theydiffer in many ways large and small. The three organisations all have theiradvocates, but it is not clear, in terms of weapons and equipment produced forcustomers to specification, at estimated costs and on time, that any one of thethree is markedly superior to the others. What is clear from their performanceis that none of them provides an ideal model against which to develop an integrated procurement system. There are, however, many features in them which are proving successful and should clearly be retained and developedwithin a new system.7. In examining these existing organisations, we have sought to identify theproblems which they are failing to solve and to distinguish:(a) Those which are, for one reason or another, largely or wholly insoluble.(b) Those which arise from the way in which the procurement system is organised or operated and from the constraints imposed upon it by government.We deal separately with these two types of problem below.Problems which are for one reason or another largely or wholly insoluble8. A defence procurement organisation inevitably has to live with problems which prevent it from operating on fully commercial principles. It is not itsown master and must not become so since it only exists to meet user needs.Nothing that it can do will eliminate the risks inherent in developing and producing the advanced systems which the Services wish to have, nor can itescape from changes in Government policy affecting the Armed Forces andtheir tasks within the long development/production cycle of individual weaponssystems or from changes in strategic thinking and planning. Collaborativeprojects with other countries, which are increasingly characteristic of thedefence equipment programme, call for complex administrative machinery and involve delays and frustrations which would be quite unacceptable in pursuit of normal commercial procurement.9. The existing procurement organisations have suffered severely from these problems and from the fact that the roles of the British Services have called for advanced equipment across a range wider than it has been possible toprovide efficiently within the resources available. No successor system is likelyto be wholly free of these difficulties. What should be possible though, withan integrated system responsible for the whole procurement process, is to focusmore sharply for the decision-makers outside the procurement system the issues which they have to face and the likely consequences of the policies whichthey wish to pursue.
Problems which arise from the way in which the procurement system is organisedor operated and from the constraints imposed upon it by Government10. The present defence procurement organisation has retained its basiccharacteristics for many years now, in spite of the successive transfers ofresponsibility from one department to another since 1945 and of the manyattempts at reorganisation which all departments have made within the frame-work they inherited. Upheavals of this kind have been going on for a numberof years without achieving all the progress that was desired and expected. Thefollowing quotation, though vintage, is not inappropriate:&quot;We trained hard but it seemed that every time we were beginning toform up into teams, we would be reorganised. I was to learn later in lifethat we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising, and a wonderfulmethod it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producingconfusion, inefficiency and demoralisation.&quot;From Petronii Arbitri Satyricon, AD 66,attributed to Gaius Petronius.These changes in organisation have contributed little to improvements in the procurement system. What is needed is a more fundamental approach to possible solutions.11. There is an absence of responsible management at appropriate workinglevels. This state of affairs was highlighted by Fulton, who went on to say:&quot;To function efficiently large organisations need a structure in which units and individual members have authority that is clearly defined and respon-sibilities for which they can be held accountable.&quot;We are well aware of the important changes that have been and will be madein response to the Fulton Report. However, we have looked in vain in theexisting organisations for managers who have clearcut responsibilities for awhole task and who have the necessary authority to influence events acrossthe range of functions necessary for this. In business, the common-placemethod of operation is to delegate authority and responsibility in a givenarea to a man possessing the appropriate skills and ability, who is encouraged to use his initiative in seeking to achieve the objectives of his company withinpolicy guide-lines, whereas in Government it is only on some projects of vitalimportance or great complexity, e.g., Polaris, Concorde, that the leader hasbeen freed from some of the layers of management and the more complicatedrules and procedures.12. In our judgment, there is insufficient conscious selection of peoplepossessing procurement aptitudes in order that they may be trained for aprocurement career; similarly there is not enough conscious selection of &quot;highflyers&quot; in the procurement area so that they may be developed for future topmanagement jobs within procurement. Appointments to senior managementposts within procurement are not confined to men with relevant experience.Deputies are not deliberately selected as potential successors to their superiors,but rather fill these positions as part of a generalised career development.Conversely in the specialised fields, where career progression is confined to specific areas of expertise, insufficient action is taken to train specialists forbroader management jobs.
13. There is a severe shortage of skilled professionalaccountants who canreport on the financial strength of contractors and on the adequacy of their cost estimating and accounting systems and devise effective yardsticks by which to judge management performance. Finance branches ensure that the correct pro-procedures are followed, but they do not always examine whether these proceduresare cost-effective nor are they able to ensure that over-costly and ineffectiveprojects are weeded out. Despite the increasing importance attached in recentyears to getting value for money, finance in Government too often concentrateson the containment of expenditure against an annual budget or a long termforecast whereas in business this is only one of the roles of a company financedirector.14. It is necessary to be clear about the role that Service officers need to play in procurement. Some officers must have an intimate involvement in develop-ment so that they can prepare the ground for acceptance and use in service ofnew equipment. However, procurement, as already stated, is a specialisedfunction and not to be undertaken lightly as part of a career development in atotally different profession. An officer who has procurement aptitudes shouldbe able to make his career in procurement without severing his connections with the Services. In that case he ought to spend the greater part of his careerwithin the procurement organisation, returning periodically to his Service sothat he retains his identity with it. Additionally, the civilians involved in defence procurement must be more closely involved with the user, understanding hisenvironment and conscious of his needs. This can only be achieved by those inprocurement identifying the ultimate objective of their function as givingsatisfaction to the user, and ensuring for themselves, by frequent visits where the equipment is in use, that they have achieved their goal.15. There is a lack of awareness of the actual cost within Government ofdefence procurement activities, and insufficient energy is devoted to bringingthese down and to improving productivity. It is one of the functions of everymanager to consider whether his work could be carried out more efficiently andby fewer staff. It is a confession of failure to resort to arbitrary cuts since theorganisation should be capable of reviewing and reducing itself. Yet it is clearthat staff numbers have not decreased to any great extent in spite of thereduction in the number of projects and a reduction in real terms of the amountof research, development and production that defence procurement generates.In a well managed business, purchasing and other overhead costs are keptcontinually under close surveillance since worth-while rises in productivity canonly be achieved and sustained by ruthless determination to root out com-placency and by repeated examination of procedures and methods to ensurethat they remain relevant.16. Users are often dazzled by the range of possibilities of technology andrealism is sometimes subordinated to desire. This is no new problem. It hasaggravated the difficulties of defence planning and programming in the UnitedStates as well as in this country for many years and it is interesting to note inthe memoirs of Albert Speer, who was Armaments Minister to Hitler, that hehad the same problems in dealing with the German General Staff. The urgeto lead in defence weapons has encouraged excessive optimism by the Services
who have been aided and abetted by scientists, naturally interested in probingnew frontiers of knowledge, and by Government contractors who respond tothis optimism in the hope of securing technological advantages at Governmentexpense. Optimism has led to inadequate preparation for full development inorder to hasten and ensure authorisation of the complete project. This in turnhas resulted in the now familiar pattern of changes in requirements or in design, difficulties and delays in development and production, increases in cost and unsatisfactory operational performance in service. The allocation ofadditional funds to salvage programmes already in progress reduces the funds available for research for the next generation of weapons and thereby the cycleis perpetuated with the inevitable consequences. The situation has been madeworse by the decisions of successive Governments to impose arbitrary cuts on research and exploratory development funds. As a result projects have beengiven the full go-ahead before key areas of knowledge have been properlyestablished.17. Over a long period the defence procurement programme has beencharacterised by a mismatch between the Service requirements that it was expected to meet and the resources available to carry the various projectswithin it to completion, and to bring the resulting equipment into service. this situation has frequently been made worse by reductions in the expected alloca-tion of resources to defence. The result has been successive waves of cancelledprojects, reductions in planned purchases of finished equipment and delays indecisions to proceed with development programmes, all bringing about an atmosphere of sluggishness and frustration across the programme with all the waste of resources, human and material, which this has involved.18. A great deal has been said to us about the duplication of effort throughmore than one establishment carrying out research and development in similarareas, and we hope a unification of control of these resources will result, inthe course of time, in the rationalisation which is needed. We are clear however that the defence and aerospace establishments must continue to be an integral part of the procurement organisation. Any organisation spending large sumson procurement must take the blindness out of its activity by having strongteams of scientists and other professionals who can understand the problems which confront it and can help at the various stages of procurement. All ofthese establishments are to some extent, and many of them are very largelyand intimately, involved all the time in projects and project management; inthis they are quite unlike the ex-DSIR establishments. Our main concern inthis area is to build up the concept of partnership between the establishments and industry and to reverse the tendency of some of the establishments toundertake design work intra-murally. Much of this would be better done by outside suppliers, who generally have greater access to civil technology andmore experience in matching design to production practicalities. Unfortunately,we have in some areas brought about a situation in which industry has lost, or has never even achieved, the capability to do design for itself. We believe thatthis is a situation which is unacceptable and that, in the national as well as thedefence interest, a deliberate and sustained effort must be made to change it.19. There has been no consistent policy in the method followed in thedevelopment of new weapon systems. One has been for the Government to
select a single contractor upon whom to place responsibility for planning andimplementing a total system. All too often, however, the Government has notbeen willing to relax its day-to-day control and has intervened between thiscontractor and his sub-contractors. Alternatively, the Government has at the outset taken upon itself detailed weapons system planning and the management and awarding of a number of direct contracts to various suppliers for carryingout specific parts of the total programme. This has meant undertaking systemsdesign responsibility in-house, which has often resulted in unrealistic specifica-tions, leading to unmanageable changes in design and cost growth. It wouldbe facile to claim that any new arrangements will solve all the problems arisingfrom the interfaces between equipments making up one system. nevertheless it is essential, whilst taking care to preserve the interests of specialist firms, tostrengthen the position of main contractors and in parallel to increase theauthority of project managers in Government over their specialist technicalcolleagues.20. The problems referred to in paragraphs 16 to 19 have contributedlargely to inaccurate cost estimates of new weapons systems which in turnhave led to a demand for estimating skills which are not available. Moreover,in the opinion of many to whom we have spoken, costs cannot be forecastwith reasonable accuracy until some part of the development has been under-taken. Estimates of how much this part amounts to vary, but it seems generally accepted that development must be taken to the first prototype or model stage(which can cost as much as 15% or 25% of the ultimate total), before a usefuldegree of accuracy in costing and time forecasting can be achieved.21. Although there has been considerable progress, following theGibb/Zuckerman (1961) and Downey (1966) Reports, in increasing the propor-tion of exploratory development expenditure incurred on a project before adecision is taken to go to full development, this still falls well short in most cases of the recommended proportion. Evidence here, and in the United States,points to this as a major defect of current practice in both countries. we recognise that it is in the nature of the development of advanced equipmentthat, whatever is done in the early stages, unanticipated problems will stillarise, sometimes late in development, which require further research or applied research and that delays and cost increases will result from this. But we believethat until it has become a general rule, to which exceptions are only madeconsciously and deliberately, that 15% of forecast development expenditure is incurred before the decision is taken to go to full development, the procurementprogramme as a whole will retain the characteristics described in paragraphs 16and 17 above. Awkward though such a scale of expenditure may be, particularly on large projects, it is part of the price that must be paid to take major stepsforward on new equipments with reasonable confidence.22. Although senior people have a balanced view of the requirements ofthe Public Accounts Committee, at more junior levels fear of criticism fromthis Committee clearly causes the priority in work to be avoidance of mistakes.It is important that staff at all levels should realise that efficiency comprisesmuch more than the mere avoidance of mistakes and that it is for their totalefficiency that they are answerable. It is an error to suppose that small mis-demeanours or minor mistakes are likely to attract criticism from the Public
Accounts Committee, for in practice the Committee do not concern themselves with such matters and seldom hear about them. Small misdemeanours andmistakes are inevitable in any human activity and undue effort should not be expended in following them up in detail. The concept also of a single accountingofficer who can be held responsible for a wide range of activities, even thoughit is impossible for him to have proper knowledge of or ability to influencethem, is an absurd illusion, which does little to promote efficiency, but leads to more rules, procedures and monitoring activities, thus fostering the tendencywithin Government to issue new general instructions because of errors inparticular cases even though the total effect may be to raise costs rather thanreduce them.23. Those engaged in defence procurement are often monopoly buyers andhave to deal with monopoly suppliers. There is insufficient forward thinkingabout the responsibilities which are incumbent upon a procurement organisationoperating in such an environment. Unless there is a conscious and continuingreview of forward industrial needs and strengths and a continual watch on theefficiency and financial stability of its main suppliers, defence procurement can find itself compelled to support inefficient national industries or to purchaseabroad when forward thinking would have prepared energetic companies athome to be responsive to new needs. Most important of all, defence procure-ment must accept, and exercise, a responsibility for the health of those partsof industry whose survival is paramount in the defence interests of the nation.24. Competition is an essential ingredient of good purchasing but the design, development and manufacture of defence weapon systems is quite different from normal commercial operations. Yet in many areas Governmentpurchasing is conducted against a background of trying to exploit the economicforces of the market place. There are, naturally, areas where these forces canoperate effectively and achieve value for money, but they are relatively fewand must be carefully chosen. Moreover open competition can have the dis-advantage of inhibiting the buyer from exercising his supposed skills andjudgment in selecting the right supplier for a particular piece of government work. Contractual policies which expect a supplier to devote his scarce scientificresources in the development phase without any assurance that he will securemore than the first production contract stand effectively between the develop-ment of a partnership between buyer and seller which is essential for long-term planning and the minimisation of manufacturing costs.25. There are still too many examples of piecemeal ordering, particularly of spares, when by any sensible judgment there can be long term forecasts ofproduction needs. It is recognised that nothing can be firm and final in the environment in which defence procurement operates, but it should not beimpossible to make contracts with adequate break clauses which would be acceptable to manufacturers and would allow sufficient flexibility in dealingwith changing defence needs.26. Quality assurance costs are disproportionate to the amounts spent onprocurement and the numbers employed are excessive. Greater urgency mustbe given to the full implementation of the recommendations of the RabyReport. More weight must be given to individual assessment of contractors andthe length of the contracts awarded. Only in this way will there be reasonable
continuity of work for Government suppliers. This will enable suppliers toacquire the skills and maintain the trained personnel necessary for effectiveprocess quality control.27. A procurement organisation will always, in the final analysis, be as goodor as bad as its suppliers. But it is vain to attempt to remedy suppliers&apos; defectsby carrying out tasks which properly belong to them such as quality assuranceand detailed design supervision. One must also be wary of falling into the trapof treating second-rate suppliers as cost-effective simply because they quotelower prices. Lack of profit is in no sense a yardstick for judging whether thepurchase price represents value. In commercial life, suppliers who do not makea profit are rightly considered less effective in giving value for money than those with good profit records, except in short term once-for-all transactions. Thetotal price is what matters and low costs and high profits are a better nationalbargain than the reverse.28. The complexity and rigidity of some of the existing contractual pro-procedures, particularly as they have been operated following the &quot;Bloodhound&quot;and &quot;Bristol Siddeley Engine&quot; cases, are also matters for concern. They aretime-consuming and costly in terms of staff for both Government and industryand result in long delays in price and cash settlements. We would hope that,in agreement with industry and, as appropriate, the new Review Board forGovernment Contracts, considerable simplification of procedures will be pos-sible for the future.29. More active steps must be taken to educate defence suppliers with an understanding of the users, their future needs and the environment in whichthey live. The recent presentation by the Army which gave defence suppliersan opportunity of learning about the long-term requirements of the Army hasbeen widely commented on, and entirely favourably. This kind of presentationshould be given regularly by the Operational Requirement Staffs of all three services in co-operation with the Systems Controllers proposed later in thisreport.30. Because of its sheer size, defence procurement is subjected to politicalinfluences to achieve distribution of defence contracts to support development areas and fair shares for all in Government business. Such constraints areincompatible with the normal procurement concept of purchasing value for money. For a variety of reasons, defence procurement has become involved in international collaborative projects, which can lead to long delays with resultantincreases in costs and the passing abroad of industrial know-how to the ultimatedisadvantage of the nation, particularly in export markets. These points havebeen made strongly to us during our discussions with industry. Even the bestreasons given for collaboration (the sharing of development costs and thereduction of unit production costs) are suspect if prolonged discussions and modifications cause inordinate delays.31. Export potential is still not given sufficient weight when requirements are being formulated. If properly considered, it can make home defence needsless expensive and can assist in strengthening the health of British defenceindustries which, long term, will be to the advantage of British defence.
32. We have hesitated to enumerate all these points as we are very conscious that&apos;in many areas active steps are being taken to improve the situation. How-ever, we believe that progress is not sufficiently even, nor are all those involvedin procurement sufficiently aware and concerned at the reality of these problems and the extent to which they are a major impediment to good procurementpractice.33. There are other detailed criticisms that can be made of how procurementis organised but, because of lack of uniformity, such criticisms are always onlytrue in part and for every criticism an example can be quoted where things are organised another way. However, there are a number of points which must bemade although we are aware that they are not true in every area. There are,for example, still cases of:technical responsibility separated from financial responsibility and bothseparated from contractual responsibility;production separated from quality assurance;design separated from development/production sources;the user isolated from the supplier;suppliers selected without adequate up-to-date knowledge of competence,excellence and value.34. Further investigations are needed to enable us to propose sensible and adequate solutions to these problems, which will not be resolved easily. Wemust certainly beware of piecemeal solutions which would create new pro-procedures for working round the difficulties, but which would leave the funda-mental problems unchanged and the system still further complicated. The first step must be to create a new organisation for defence procurement to focus theproblems more sharply and to provide the mechanisms to allow some ofthe necessary changes to be made. Our proposals for this organisation follow inthe next section.
SECTION B-A DEFENCE PROCUREMENT ORGANISATIONIntroduction35. We turn now to the organisation we propose to overcome or ease theproblems which derive from the present arrangements. This organisation wouldbe under the executive authority of the Secretary of State for Defence and would carry technical and managerial responsibility for the defence procurementprogramme and for the Government programme in support of civil aerospace.For reasons set out in Sections C and D below it would not be an agency nor would it be responsible for Government policy towards the aerospace industry or for policy on civil aerospace research and projects. Under our proposalsthese would pass to the Department of Trade and Industry.36. We must, however, emphasise at the outset that there is a limit to what can be achieved by changes in organisational structure. It is people, not systems,who ultimately remedy defects. All management decisions call for judgment andno amount of organisation charts, rules and regulations can make up forinexperienced and inefficient management. Improved procedures can make a contribution, but greater progress is likely to come from ensuring that theorganisation provides its own top managers through a conscious process ofcareer planning which enables them to develop their natural talents over a wide range of functions within the procurement task. Unless there is experience andcontinuity in management, it will be difficult to avoid repeating past mistakes.37. In developing the new organisation, we have tried to observe the follow-iing simple statement of principles:(a) the organisation must be fully and obviously user oriented, but chargedwith the task of assisting its customers in their decisions and in building up the strength of its contractors;(b) it must be organised and staffed on a basis that recognises the specialisednature of defence procurement;(c) it must offer a full career in defence procurement and ensure that those engaged have a sense of involvement and participation in the ultimate objective of providing the Services with the best equipment that theresources of the nation will permit;(d) it must avoid giving conflicting responsibilities to its divisions, and to individuals except at the highest level;(e) it must distinguish more sharply in its structure than the presentprocurement organisations between responsibility for the management of approved programmes and the supporting staff functions;(/) it must be able to take advantage of the opportunity that the creationof a unified procurement organisation will bring to rationalise thedefence research and development establishments in the general defenceinterest;(g) it must achieve a physical co-location of staff who need to work closely together;-(h) it must balance continuity with change and provide a framework whichwill allow further evolution to take place within it to take account ofthe lessons of experience or of changed situations.
The Top Level Organisation38. The organisation which we recommend would be headed by a chief executive with a Secretary as his principal adviser. There would be nineControllers dealing with specific areas of activity. Four of these would beSystems Controllers, wholly project oriented, covering Sea, Land, Air, andGuided Weapon and Electronic Systems respectively, each having his ownVote and being accountable for this. (But see paragraph 68 on the future ofthe guided weapons and electronics areas). There would also be a Controllerfor Research and Development Establishments and Research. These fiveControllers would answer directly to the Chief Executive. There would also beControllers for Policy, Finance, Personnel and Sales who would report throughthe Secretary. The Chief Executive would be accountable for the Vote coveringresearch and development establishments, research and headquarters admini-stration, the total expenditure of the organisation thus being divided into fiveVotes. (Figure 1 sets out the proposed organisational pattern.)Proposed Vote and Accounting Officer arrangements39. The organisation that we propose requires a vote structure and account-ing officer responsibilities to match the principles on which it is based. In thefollowing paragraphs we discuss what these should be.40. The present broad position is that defence research and development is a final charge to the Department carrying it out whereas production is afinal charge to the customer. The main argument for charging customers forwork done on their behalf is that this imposes a financial discipline on their demands and we recommend that this procedure should be followed for allwork carried out by the procurement organisation for civil customers. Theresult of this would be that civil expenditure would rest finally on the Vote(s)of the Department responsible for the requirement which gave rise to theexpenditure, an arrangement which we regard as in the best traditions offinancial management and accountability.41. We do not consider, however, that this arrangement should applywithin the area controlled by the Secretary of State for Defence and we propose to rely instead on the financial discipline imposed by the long-termdefence costings and the machinery for the allocation of the defence budgetbetween the various competing demands. The procurement organisation wouldhave its own Votes for its procurement activities and would not be requiredto recover the costs of either research and development or production fromits defence customers. This should mean some saving of existing finance staffin the Navy, Army and Air Force Departments and would have the additionalmerit of allowing the Purchasing (Repayment) Services Votes to be abolished.42. The organisation structure we propose in this report is aimed atstrengthening line management and at getting away from the existence ofparallel hierarchies within defence procurement. The objective is to concentrateauthority and responsibility at the Controller level for all activities in a par-ticular area such as the development and production of land, sea or air systems and then to continue this concentration of responsibility down through theorganisation at least as far as the third tier, i.e., Deputy Chief Scientific Officer

(or other professional equivalent), Assistant Secretary or Service Officer ofone star rank. This would result in the creation of accountable units of manage-ment with all their attendant advantages, one being that there would be asharper focus of responsibility than is possible under the present system.43. Since the procurement organisation would be spending over  1,000million a year it would not be sensible, in so complex and difficult an area,to make one man accountable for the whole of so large a sum. We therefore recommend that there should be five Votes, four of which would be co-terminouswith the four main accountable management units. Each Vote would have itsown separate Accounting Officer as follows:VoteReference ScopeA     Headquarters administration, research anddevelopment establishments and researchDevelopment and production of sea systemsBCDEDevelopment and  production   of  landsystemsDevelopment and production of air systemsDevelopment and production of guided weapons and electronicsAccountingOfficerThe Chief ExecutiveThe Controller,Sea SystemsThe Controller,Land SystemsThe Controller,Air SystemsThe Controller,Guided Weaponand ElectronicSystems44. An approximate breakdown of the expenditure involved in these votes(based on 1970/71 figures) is: M(&quot;Headquarters (including about  24M for inspection/quality&quot;!A -i    assurance) yL Research and development establishments and research  .. JB Sea systems     ..      ......C Land systems........D Air systems (including  66M for Concorde)E Guided Weapon and Electronic systems    ..1502301403402301,09045. The Chief Executive would be responsible for the issue through theSecretary of financial and other procedural instructions for the whole organisa-tion but each Accounting Officer would have his own financial staff and the accouting Officers for Votes B, C, D and E would be fully responsible for expenditure incurred on these votes.46. We appreciate that these recommendations will give rise to certain difficulties such as the existence within one Department of a number of independent Accounting Officers and the need to appoint senior Service officers
as Accounting Officers. But we believe that these problems can be overcomeand indeed must be if strong and accountable line management is to be madea reality. It is understood that it would be consistent with current practice foreach Systems Controller, while retaining clear overall responsibility for hisarea, to be supported in discharging his accounting officer responsibilities byhis Assistant Controller Administration and Finance and his Deputy Controllersor Directors Projects as appropriate in respect of the details of individual projects (see Figure 2).The tasks of the top managers47. In the following paragraphs we outline the tasks of the top managersin the proposed organisation, their relationships with each other and where appropriate with Ministers and with the Service Boards and other parts ofthe Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry.Chief Executive48. It will be of crucial importance, during the early years of the organisation,that it is firmly managed and developed along the lines indicated in this report and that, for this purpose, there is continuity of management at the top. It is this view that leads us to recommend that the organisation should be headed by a Chief Executive appointed for at least a three-year term. We have con-sidered as an alternative to a Chief Executive the possibility of a Ministerof State to head the organisation. However, such an appointment would not we believe be satisfactory; it would not guarantee the continuity that isessential, nor necessarily provide the kind of expertise that is required.49. The Chief Executive would be responsible for broad strategy withinthe organisation itself and in its relation to users and industry. He would not,however, involve himself in the management activities of the System Controllers,who will be Accounting Officers in their own right, except where there is a need for a decision on a matter affecting more than one of them. He wouldprovide the Secretary of State or such other Ministers as may be appointedor nominated with a focal point for advice on the execution of all major pro-procurement matters and particularly on the wider industrial, international and technological problems that may need resolution. This would not, of course,preclude direct access by the Controllers to Ministers.50. The Chief Executive would have the responsibility for giving leadershipon changes in organisational methods and procedures to bring down leadtimes, and for eliminating a great many of the complex procedures and com-mittees needed at present for the procurement of equipment. He would havethe responsibility of ensuring that Government business is only placed withsatisfactory firms, that procedures ensure that the swift agreement of prices and hence settlement of accounts become normal, that the quality standardsagreed are sensible and met, that maintenance objectives are sensible, andthat development and production objectives take into account the equationof costs of maintenance in service and costs of reliability in production.51. We think that, in order to reflect the spirit of our second recommen-dation, the Chief Executive should participate in the discussions of the defence council just as the Systems Controllers should participate in the Service Boards(see Paragraph 76 below). Given the Chief Executive^ responsibilities to the
Department of Trade and Industry we consider he should be an &quot;additional&apos;member of the Defence Council, but this appointment would in no way impair the responsibilities of the Systems Controllers for taking on particular opera-tional requirements provided that these would not upset the technical balanceof the programme of the organisation as a whole, and that resources and finance were available for their development and production within the long-term budget forecast. He would also have a general responsibility for ensuring that the organisation held a balance between military and civil work acceptable to the Aerospace Board proposed later in this report. In those cases whereproposals for new operational requirements raise major issues of military capability, technical feasibility and budget resources we would see the chief executive participating in their consideration in a wider forum under theSecretary of State together with the Chiefs of Staff and the Permanent UnderSecretary of State.52. As stated in paragraph 38 above, the Chief Executive would be the accouting Officer for the main assets of the organisation, having Voteresponsibility for research and development establishments and research andfor the headquarters organisation.The Secretary53. We have thought it appropriate to propose a Secretary as effectively the deputy head of the procurement organisation. We think it essential that thereshould be available to the Chief Executive the rounded advice of a senior civil servant with experience of working in Government. The relationship we seebetween them is one of partnership, the Chief Executive concentrating primarily on the activities aimed at supplying the customers of the organisation withhardware in accordance with the most efficient procurement policies, while theSecretary advised and assisted in the reconciliation of these with the broaderrequirements of government policy and public accountability. The secretary would, for example, take the lead on parliamentary business and in preparing the various documents and reports that would be required at Cabinet, Mini-sterial and senior Whitehall levels; he would handle the problems that would arise in pursuing the procurement personnel policy aimed at developing the procurement specialist; he would advise on the balance between efficiency andpublic accountability; he would provide experienced leadership for the fourControllers who would report to him; but above all, we are anxious that inGovernment top people should not have to work in such isolation and lonelinessas they often have to do at the moment. Instead they should have on hand thebenefit of objective counsel which is commonplace in business.54. Under the Secretary there would be four Controllers for Policy, Finance,Personnel, and Sales. We outline our ideas on their main tasks in paragraphs55-67 but further study will be needed particularly of their interface with theother parts of the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade andIndustry.Controller Policy55. This Controller would have two main areas of activity designed toassist the line managers in the Systems Controllerates but without inhibitingtheir responsibilities.
56. First he would be responsible, on behalf of the organisation as a whole,for watching that Service requirements (staff targets and staff requirements)accepted by the procurement organisation broadly balanced in volume and difficulty the resources likely to be available. In this he would work closely withthe Controller Finance in advising the Controller with whom ultimate responsi-bility for accepting particular tasks would rest. We regard this as a mostimportant activity.57. The Policy Controllers second task would be to relieve the SystemsControllers of the detailed work in thinking through procurement policies,procedures and methods where changes become necessary. These problems would cover such areas as the desirable future industrial base needed in theinterest of defence; the initiatives required to promote industrial collaboration,nationally and internationally; procedures and safeguards in internationalcollaborative projects; contracts policies and procedures, including the approach to estimating and pricing; guidelines on foreign purchasing and its implications;quality assurance and standardisation; the division of work between intra-muraland extra-mural resources.58. The Policy Controller would be assisted in his task by four deputycontrollers, dealing with the broad balance of the programme as indicated inparagraph 56, production and quality assurance, contracts, and internationalmatters. (This last subject, on which he should keep in close touch with theDepartment of Trade and Industry, is one that we believe has not been givensufficient consideration in all its implications in the past.) These deputy con-troilers would be the senior advisers for the specialist Assistant Controllers ineach of the Systems Controllerates in consultation with whom common policieswould, so far as possible, be developed (see Figure 2).Controller Finance59. This Controller would have three Divisions. One would co-ordinate, onbehalf of the Accounting Officers, the procurement organisation^ financialbusiness in relation both to the system of annual Supply Estimates and Votesand to the long term defence costings and the public expenditure survey.The second would be responsible for the formulation and issue of generalprocedural instructions for the financial administration of the whole organisa-tion and for the provision of central accounting services such as the maintenanceof central accounts, the circulation of periodic reports of expenditure, thepayment and rendering of bills and the standardisation of equipment and storeaccounting. It would also be responsible for audit. The third would be placed under the Controller Finance to equalise the load between him and the Con-troller Personnel. It would undertake staff inspection and complementing andwould advise other branches and contractors on such matters as problems of organisation, methods and procedure; automatic data processing and criticalpath scheduling; operational research and work study; standard costing andbudgetary control; and other management techniques. It would also beresponsible for training and education in the procurement field.Controller Personnel60. As we have stressed earlier in this report, we attach great importanceto procurement being treated as a specialised function and to there being
continuity of service in it. A procurement organisation must contain all the specialist skills that are needed and must offer a full and attractive career for those who enter as specialists and whose contribution will be best made bystaying broadly within their specialisations. But it is essential also that theorganisation should deliberately set out to provide its own middle and topmanagers who, although they may have entered as specialists, are given the broader experience within the organisation, and in some cases in industry and elsewhere in the Ministry of Defence, necessary for this. Regard will have to bepaid however to wider considerations of Service and other careers. Senior postsmust be open to officers of all specialisations who develop the necessary capa-bilities. The planning and implementation of these policies would be a majortask for the Controller Personnel.61. The Controller Personnel^ main responsibility would thus be the personnel management of all industrial and non-industrial staff within the procurement organisation. This would match the Ministry of Defence&apos;s currentobjective of decentralising detailed staff management to the greatest extent. Hewould concentrate particularly on career planning and postings. Special arrange-ments will be needed for the transfer into and out of the procurement organisa-tion of staff expected to rise rapidly within their disciplines, or to become members of the Senior Policy and Management Group of the Civil Service.This is essential so that managers in the procurement organisation gain the outside experience essential to their tasks and so that a sufficient knowledge ofprocurement problems is available for potential top managers among the users.Experience in the operational requirements branches would be of particular value to potential top managers in the procurement organisation. We recognisethat it will be necessary for some Navy Department specialists to move to andfrom the Chief of Fleet Supports Departments from time to time during theircareers. We also advocate exchange postings of staff between the procurementorganisation and industry. The average civilian should, however, expect to makea career within the procurement organisation itself, although this would not preclude occasional appointments outside. Similarly special arrangements willbe necessary for individuals who are misfits in their current employment.62. Although the broad policy responsibility for civilian staff must rest,under the aegis of the Civil Service Department, with the Ministry of Defencecentral civilian management organisation, the procurement organisation shouldbe largely autonomous, making its own appointments. It should be responsiblefor providing staff for certain posts outside itself, for example, the centraldefence scientific staff and the aerospace technical staff in the Departmentof Trade and Industry.  (See paragraphs 123 and 125.)63. The procurement organisation would be responsible for its own pro-motions up to at least the level of Principal Scientific Officer, Principal andequivalent; the general civil service objective of equal opportunities for peopleof equal talent would be met by promotion pooling schemes with the rest of theMinistry of Defence. Above this level the organisation should be as independentas possible, but some central monitoring of promotion across the Ministry ofDefence as a whole would be acceptable so long as the need to treat procurementas a specialised function was recognised and fostered.
64. There is a point on the arrangements in reporting on staff to which we attach considerable importance. The qualities required for success in projectmanagement and in a specialisation are not necessarily the same and a reportingsystem on staff which did not recognise this would be unfair, and inefficient also as an aid to career planning. For this reason we propose that, for staff working on projects, the reporting system should be such that reports are made on boththe project and specialist chains. For scientific and engineering staff working onprojects in establishments, the Director of the establishment would be respon-sible for specialist reports.Controller Defence Sales65. The Defence Sales Organisation at present serves both the Ministryof Defence and the Ministry of Aviation Supply. The Head of Defence Salesis responsible to both Ministers with approximately two thirds of his staff inthe Ministry of Defence and one third in the Ministry of Aviation Supply.This division of responsibility has naturally detracted from efficiency. Thecreation of a single procurement organisation would present an opportunity,which the present Head of Defence Sales would welcome, to unify these organisations.66. The Ministry of Defence sales divisions have already been reorganisedon a geographical basis so that overseas Governments can deal with a singleauthority covering all their requirements. There should be no difficulty in bringing military aerospace sales into this framework once the procurementorganisation has come into existence.67. As far as Defence Sales are concerned, therefore, our proposals should result in increased efficiency. They can also be expected to produce staff savingswhen the integrated sales organisation has had time to settle down, althoughthe numbers involved will be largely determined by the extent to which the sales organisation can be brought together under one roof instead of beingscattered as at present in five separate locations.The Systems Controllers68. These Controllers would be the top line managers for the approveddevelopment and production programmes of the organisation. At the outsetwe envisage that there would be four of them responsible respectively for Sea,Land, Air, and Guided Weapon and Electronic Systems, the last also havingthe current Ministry of Aviation Supply responsibility in the nuclear weaponsarea. We would prefer to see the fourth controllerate absorbed into thosedealing with Sea, Land, and Air Systems, so that the development and pro-duction programmes of each Service were broadly dealt with by a singleController and we believe that this should be the aim for the longer term. Inthat event we consider that the procurement organisation^ responsibility for nuclear weapons might perhaps pass to the Controller Sea Systems thus concen-trating nuclear weapons and nuclear propulsion responsibilities in one place.69. We recognise that a move to three Systems Controllerates would giverise to difficulties of three main kinds. First it could put existing projects at risk; second it could, taken by itself, destroy, or at best diffuse, the importantfocus of expertise in the guided weapon and electronic fields in the present
Controllerate of Guided Weapons and Electronics; and third there might be difficulties of loading for the remaining three Controllers. We believe thatthese problems, aside from that of loading which requires further study, aresoluble. The existing project programme in the area could, as necessary, beallowed to go through to completion under present arrangements particularlywhen projects are already well advanced. New projects would then be under-taken by the Sea, Land and Air Controllerates. The technological focus to serveall the Systems Controllers could be established elsewhere; indeed our suggestedorganisation under the Controller Research and Development establishments and Research provides for just such a focus.70. The Systems Controllers would be required to work towards re-shaping their organisations into project orientated groups under deputy con-trollers. The project management organisations, working closely with theappropriate Service maintenance organisation, should carry a responsibilityfor every item of equipment throughout its life. Under the direction of eachProject Manager there would be a number of specialists development, pro-duction, quality assurance, contracts, finance, trials, and in-service. Thestrength and composition of the teams would change as appropriate duringthe life and be related to the size of the project. In addition, each specialistshould have a functional line of responsibility within his own specialisation.This proposal means generalising and extending greatly the best practicealready being followed in various parts of the existing procurement organisa-tions. We recognise that the changes we propose can only be evolutionary andtherefore the proposals we make for the re-organisation of the SystemsControllers will have to be implemented progressively, as their strengths andthe development of skills permit. Nevertheless swift and substantial progress could and should be made.71. These Controllers would be autonomous as regards the execution oftheir procurement tasks. To ensure the maintenance of such authority, eachmust be accountable for the funds voted to carry out these tasks.Relationship to users72. Users should have direct and easy access to those who work to meet their requirements in the project management organisation. This access shouldbe close and continuous, running through development and production toin-service support. At the same time it should not detract from the responsibilityof procurement staff to meet agreed specifications, time scales and costs. Theneed for a close working relationship is obvious as the user would need toagree changes in specification affecting performance so that sensible trade-offdecisions could be made in the light of up to date and accurate information.Similarly, users would need to be kept fully informed about production changesso that the operational implications could be assessed and adjustments made,as necessary. These matters would have to be handled so that user/producerresponsibilities were not blurred.Relationship to Service Boards73. We have considered against this background the position of theSystems Controllers primarily responsible for procuring the weapons andequipment for the three Services in relation to their Service Boards. We
recognise the importance of creating the closest possible links between supplierand customer. On the other hand the Systems Controllers will be parts of a unified procurement organisation with responsibilities to all three Services andfor certain civil matters. With limited research, development and productionresources there will inevitably be conflicts between the demands of the three separate Services on these. The procurement organisation must, in our view,be a single entity and research, development and production resources mustlikewise be treated as a unity within the Ministry of Defence and in relationto the Treasury and the Civil Service Department. In these circumstances,individual Controllers must not, in our view, be liable to such direction from individual Service Boards as to conflict with their task in the procurementorganisation or override their responsibilities to the Chief Executive.74. The above arguments apply to the environmental Controllers generally.In the case of the Controller Air Systems, they are reinforced by the fact thatthe work for which he would be responsible, and the professional advice whichhe and his staff would give, would cover the interests of the Department ofTrade and Industry as well as those of the Ministry of Defence, and would on occasion be in conflict. It would put this Controller in an untenable position if he were a fully committed member of the Air Force Board in such circumstances.75. Nevertheless it is essential to the successful operation of the procure-ment organisation that the Services should have full confidence in it; it must therefore be seen to be close to the user and responsive to his needs.76. In the light of these considerations our conclusion is as follows.Though our preference was and is to make the special position of the Sea,Land and Air Systems Controllers clear by making them &quot;additional&apos; membersof the Navy, Army and Air Force Boards respectively, with the role in theseappointments of informing and advising the Boards on procurement mattersof concern to them, we are prepared, in the light of representations that havebeen made to us, to agree that they should become members of their respectiveBoards, provided that the considerations to which we have referred in para-graphs 73 and 74 are clearly written into their terms of reference. In particular they should be responsible for keeping the Boards fully informed on theprogress of specific projects and the Boards would have the right to call on them to make progress reports whenever they judged this to be necessary.They would normally inform and advise the Boards on elements of completeweapon systems which were the responsibility of the Controller GuidedWeapon and Electronic Systems although the latter could also attend if required.77. Although the three environmental Systems Controllers will be largelyorientated to an individual Service they will not be wholly so, even if a Con-troller Guided Weapon and Electronic Systems is retained, and each should therefore have a clear responsibility for informing and advising the other service Boards on projects which he is carrying out on their behalf. This applies particularly to the Controller Air Systems; and he and the Controller GuidedWeapon and Electronic Systems should also have a similar relationship withthe Department of Trade and Industry. In addition the Department of Tradeand Industry should have a right to independent representation at any meetings
of the Air Force Board at which procurement matters affecting the Departmentsinterests are to be discussed; and any conflict of interests between the AirForce Board and the Department of Trade and Industry which cannot be resolved should be referred if necessary in the first instance to the permanent secretary level machinery supporting the Ministerial Aerospace Board proposedlater in this report.Systems Controllers&apos; organisation78. We have not had an opportunity of discussing the proposed organisation with the departments concerned, and we are aware that our proposals may require adjustment in detail to meet particular circumstances. However thechart at Figure 2 shows the principles on which we propose the Systems Con-trollers should operate. Fundamental to our proposals is the Project Manager,with the fullest possible executive responsibility, supported at appropriatetimes during the life of a project by the necessary specialists, each in a directline management relationship to him. Controllers and Deputy Controllerswould be supported by specialist Assistants who would act on their behalf inspecialist matters and would look to the Controller Policy or, in the case ofservice officer assistants, to their respective Services for guidance and assistancein solving their problems.Controller Research and Development Establishments and Research79. In Appendix C to this report we have set out in some detail the rolethat we see for this Controller. We share the view, which we have found to beheld generally, that it is of great importance that advantage should be taken,and taken quickly, of the opportunity to bring the defence research and develop-ment establishments, including the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment,under a single strong management and to give that management the task ofrationalising them.80. We see the need to safeguard the interests of the Systems Controllers inthe project and project monitoring work of the establishments. This work would be controlled by the project managers under the Systems Controllers andthe Controller Research and Development Establishments and Research wouldnot himself be in the executive chain of project management. But we believethat all research, apart from nuclear research, for which special arrangements will be needed, must be controlled by the management team responsible for the establishments themselves if there is to be a coherent rationalisation programme.81. Decisions as to how research objectives are met and whether work is done intra-murally or extra-murally must be made by this Controller inaccordance with general policies for the organisation worked out in consultationwith the Controller Policy. But the research objectives themselves will, of course,be generated outside the Controllers area of responsibility, that is by theSystems Controllers, by the Services through the Deputy Chief of the DefenceStaff (Operational Requirements) representing the Chiefs of Staff, by the replacement which we propose later in this report for the Defence research committee of the Ministry of Defence, by the Department of Trade andIndustry and by any other customers there may be.

82. From the evidence we have received it is clear that the users must begiven greater freedom of access to potential suppliers during the research andexploratory development phases of a project. Industry would welcome a closerrelationship at this stage so that they can make a practical contribution to the evolution of the final staff requirement. Unless users have a relationship withsuppliers at the earliest possible stage, a major source of help and guidance isprevented from making its proper contribution. There will of course be dangersand difficulties in implementing this but, with sensible liaison with the procure-ment organisation, these can be minimised.83. The total load of the proposed functions of the Controller Research andDevelopment Establishments and Research would be heavy and we envisage thathe would need to be assisted by five Deputy Controllers. One would be responsi-ble for administrative and financial matters; one would be responsible for thesupport given by establishments to project teams; the other three would beresponsible for sectors of the research programmes and for co-ordination of the associated areas of expertise. It has not been possible to study the division ofresponsibility between these three Deputy Controllers in detail. They wouldeach be responsible for a related set of scientific and technological fields,probably based on the categorisation currently used by the Defence research committee, but we see a clear advantage if such an arrangement could besensibly combined with giving each Deputy Controller a special interest in oneof the Services. This would facilitate the improvement in communication between operational requirement and research staffs to which we attach somuch importance. We foresee that the Controller would also be the professionalhead of the scientific staff of the procurement organisation and, as such, would need to be assisted by a small staff.Management of the research and development establishments and the researchprogrammes84. We have not as a team been able to examine this area in great depthbut there are certain comments and suggestions that we wish to make.85. First, we recommend that the appointment to this Controller postshould be among those made as soon as decisions have been taken in the lightof our proposals, and that he should prepare a plan for rationalising the research and development establishments with a view to the earliest possible implement-ation.86. Second, we believe that an essential pre-requisite to an economicalrationalisation is that the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment should bebrought into the rationalisation programme and that its transfer into the CivilService is urgently necessary; this will require legislation.87. Third, we record a general view in industry that both in research andproject work too much is being done intra-murally and too little in industry itself. Although the situation across the establishments as a whole is uneven, we regard this as an important issue which should be examined in the rationalisationstudy which we have proposed. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer, whether in private industry or in a Royal Ordnance Factory, will be less likely to be an efficient producer if he has a weak research and development base for theproduction on which he is engaged. And if he is spoon fed with intra-mural
effort he has little incentive to provide that research and development for him-self. The bias in changing the existing situation should, therefore, be firmlytowards reducing the totality of intra-mural research and development effort and increasing that in manufacturers.88. Fourth, we strongly favour delegation of administrative responsibility to units of activity of reasonable size. Most of the research and development establishments are fully suitable for this purpose and their Directors should begiven the maximum possible delegated authority in managing their establish-ments, with matching accountability. This would lighten the load of the Con-troller. In this context we do not, in principle at any rate, favour arrangementsfor an establishment under which a Director doubles up on responsibility forproject management and for the establishment as a whole. This is at presenttrue of certain naval establishments and is appropriate under the current navalprocurement organisation. It will cease to be so if the general proposals thatwe are making are accepted and the two tasks should, in our view, then be separated.89. Fifth, we have comments on the relationship between gleams in the eyeand staff targets and staff requirements, and the size and nature of the researchprogrammes both intra-mural and extra-mural. Projects are heavily dependentfor their success, not merely on the amount of work that is undertaken on them during the project definition phase leading to full development, but also on the depth and breadth of the work that has been carried out in the two or threeyears preceding this phase. We have the impression that at present researcheffort is spread too thinly over a wider range of possible future requirementsthan is sensible, given the likely allocation of resources not merely for research and development but for production also. It would not, of course, be right to limit investigation of possible weapons systems at the early stages to those whichit is certain can be financed through to production. But, equally, over-insurance in the contrary direction will either inflate the size of the research programmeunnecessarily or prevent sufficient effort being devoted to the narrower range of options that can be taken up fully. In addition, an over-optimistic expectation of what is likely to be achieved with available resources could mislead those concerned with longer range strategic and tactical planning about the range ofweapon systems likely to be available in the following decade. We suggest,therefore, that there should henceforward be much greater selectivity of objectives to make the most effective use of those resources devoted to applied research and exploratory developments.Relationship to the Chief Scientific Adviser Ministry of Defence90. In considering how best to handle the research and development programmes, and in particular the role of this Controller, we have had to makeassumptions about the remit of the new Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministryof Defence. We have assumed that his remit will differ substantially from that given to Sir William Cook as Chief Adviser (Projects and Research); indeed thiswill be inevitable if our proposed procurement organisation is accepted. Wehave taken it that his role will embrace studies and operational researchfunctions, and advice to the Secretary of State and the Chiefs of Staff on the scientific aspects of defence, policy. We have assumed also that the ChiefScientific Adviser will be concerned, with the Service Chief Scientists, in
formulating the broad objectives which have to be met in the research pro-gramme of the procurement organisation and that he will, through his studiesand operational research activities, have an important input to make to the deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Operational Requirements) towards the formulation of requirements for equipment. But we have assumed that he willnot have a direct role in the framing or administration of the research andproject programmes of the procurement organisation. His terms of reference might on this basis be:&quot;To advise the Secretary of State and Chiefs of Staff on (a) the scientific aspects of defence policy, operations, logistics andforce structure, and(b) the potential impact of scientific and technological advances on future weapons and equipment.&quot;In order to discharge these functions he would require, for the purposes ofinformation-gathering, access to the procurement organisation at controllerlevel and above.Commentary91. In putting forward our proposals there are certain points bearing on them that we wish to take.The relationship between the procurement organisation and Defence Ministers92. Our proposals do not provide for a Minister within the procurementorganisation itself, the Chief Executive being responsible to the defence secretary for it. We envisage, however, that the Defence Secretary might wishto delegate some ministerial responsibilities in this area to a Minister of Stateand, if so, this Minister could, with advantage, have similar responsibilities forthe work of the Chief Scientific Adviser, Ministry of Defence and for opera-tional requirements. This would enable him to advise the Defence secretary on any gaps which may exist between equipment, which the Chiefs of Staffconsider necessary in order to carry out their defence roles, and the funds available for such purchases. Thus the defence role of the nation in terms ofhardware can be kept continuously under review and adjusted as necessary inaccordance with political judgment.Response to Service needs93. The organisation we propose is aimed at providing the defence secretary and Chiefs of Staff with a clear picture of what their funds willprovide, short and long term, and of enabling them to achieve optimum value for money within the resources available. The organisation would also, in ouropinion, become more conscious of the problems brought about by the presentexcessive lead times (the gap between need and response) which apply tosimple as well as to complex equipment. The present administrative lead times of four to twelve months would be unacceptable to any successful business. in defence, where the survival of the nation may depend on quick and effectiveresponse to emergencies, they have no place. At present, the Services can quoteexamples of expensive equipment being out of service for want of simple items.
Clearly, the ability to achieve a quick response to requirements is a majorconsideration in assessing value for money and cost effectiveness; penny-pinching economies must not be tolerated where they bring about a sluggishresponse to approved service needs.The balance of the procurement programme94. Under the arrangements we propose, Service staffs under the Chiefsof Staff would, of course, retain full responsibility for stating their requirements for equipment in terms of performance characteristics, acceptable costs, time scales and quantities. Requirements would continue to be scrutinised by central Ministry of Defence staffs in terms of the overall defence policy andbudget and these processes are much wider than the responsibilities of the procurement organisation. The aim must be a better match between approvedprogrammes and anticipated resources for research, development and produc-tion. There are, of course, major difficulties in this. It is not possible to foreseeaccurately all the problems that will arise in the development of advancedequipment nor to allow for them. Nor, whatever the organisation, will it bepossible to obtain accurate forecasts of production costs as early as is desirable for stable planning. But, and this we believe to be the important point, neither of these problems would be as serious as they have been if the project pro-gramme as a whole was constructed and maintained as a judicious and deliberate mix of relatively straightforward and cheap projects and more riskyventures. The staffs must accept that over a substantial area of their require-ments relatively small improvements in equipment between one generation andthe next are all that can be financed. The alternative is for the operationalforces to have,to make do over much of their capability with equipment beyondits proper life and to put up with continuing disappointment with progress andwith the cancellations that are characteristic of the present system.In-service support95. It has been abundantly clear to us that the present arrangements forin-service support of equipment do not in all respects meet the users&apos; require-ments in any of the Services. The proposals in this report do not deal fully with those responsibilities of the procurement organisation which cover the efficient and reliable operating capability of weapons and equipment once theyare in operational use. As we have already stated the new organisation wouldhave to accept from the outset a responsibility for every item of equipment,whatever its origins, from its conception until it is finally phased out of service.Its minimum role must be to deal with problems arising in service requiringheadquarters or establishment expertise for their solution, and arrangements must be such that support is available as rapidly and directly as possible. Theusers should be encouraged to discuss with suppliers their in-service problemsso that the suppliers are fully informed of defects and shortcomings by thosewho are in the best position to do so. To look beyond this at the differing ways in which in-service support, the supply of spares, etc., are and might be carriedout would require a further major study. But we do not believe that our pro-posals close any options in this area.96. There is one point that we wish to take at this stage however. A large part of the actual cost of an equipment over its life is taken up by running costs including spares. We therefore agree with the importance that is increas-
ingly being attached to the concept of life cycle costing as an aid to decisionmaking on defence equipment and the importance of this to long-term planning.We believe that our proposals, particularly the concentration of development and production costs for equipment on a current expenditure basis on Votesaccounted for by the Systems Controllers, should facilitate forward planningon these lines in the Ministry of Defence.Detail of the proposed procurement organisation97. In order to formulate our proposals, we have necessarily looked at the implications which they would have down to the middle management level.We recognise, however, that the detail of the organisation will require much further study. There is room for manoeuvre within the broad organisationalprinciples which we have described in this report and which are illustrated inFigure 2. Moreover, we do not believe that rigid uniformity in detailedorganisation, regardless of existing situations and particular circumstances,would be a sensible objective, provided always that variations are containedwithin the general pattern of organisation that we have proposed.Committees98. Since the whole emphasis in our report is on line management and greater responsibility for individuals, we believe that the need for committees should be much less under it than under the present organisation. We havenot, therefore, examined existing committee structures in any detail norsuggested what committees will be needed if our proposals are accepted. Butwe feel that comment is required on three committees in the existing organisa-tion the Weapons Development Committee, the Defence Research Com-mittee and the Operational Requirements Committee.99. We see no need for the continuance of the Weapons development committee, at least in its present form. Most of the responsibilities which ithas would pass to the procurement organisation and in particular to the fourSystems Controllers or to the management board or committee which the procurement organisation would itself need. As regards a successor to theDefence Research Committee, we believe that this should be a committeeconcerned with broad research objectives and not with the authorisation of the research programme or with its management which would be for the ControllerResearch and Development Establishments and Research. We see this central committee being chaired by the Chief Scientific Adviser Ministry of defence with the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Operational Requirements)representing the Chiefs of Staff, the Service Chief Scientists, a Departmentof Trade and Industry representative, the Controller Research and development establishments and Research, and perhaps also the Controller Policy as mem-bers. The Operational Requirements Committee will clearly need to continue and would have a very important role under our proposals. We believe that itwill need to become a more powerful body than it has hitherto been.Relations with the Treasury100. Under present arrangements, attendance at meetings of the WeaponsDevelopment Committee provides an important means by which the Treasury
are kept informed of projects and are enabled to comment on them before the stage at which they are formally submitted for Treasury approval. This greatlyassists the smooth and effective conduct of business.101. The Weapons Development Committee will cease to exist if our proposals are accepted. It will therefore be essential in our view to makealternative arrangements to keep the Treasury as fully informed on equipmentmatters as they are at present. The Treasury would also continue to attend meetings of the Defence Research Committee.102. It will also be important to ensure good channels of communications between the Treasury and the new procurement organisation itself includingwhatever top policy-forming group may be set up within the organisation.Scope for economies103. We have not, in this report, addressed ourselves to specific economies in resources in the defence procurement area. Our approach has been to look for an organisational pattern aimed at providing better value in terms of equipment and service for the Armed Forces from whatever funds are providedfor defence procurement. Nevertheless, we do believe that economies will result.104. First, we would expect some to follow from the review of the research and development establishments (including the Atomic Weapons research establishment) that we have proposed. Second, as projects would be more closely defined and measured to resources before they reached the full develop-ment stage, there would be less need for cancellations and the strain that suchcancellations bring on the resources available for defence procurement. Third,line management would eliminate the need for many of the meetings and committees that operate at the moment with the strain that these impose on thetime available for carrying out executive tasks. This should release a great dealof middle management time, which could then be more profitably employed in achieving the purposes for which the organisation exists i.e., the acquisitionof military hardware. This, in turn, should free some of the more junior people,who, at the moment, are needed to keep the management level briefed in manyaspects of their task. We are doubtful, however, if there will be any savings insenior and middle management grades in fact it is possible that the numbersat these levels will have to be strengthened.105. Fourth, a unified organisation must bring about a simplification ofprocedures and paper work. Under the existing organisation these can vary from one controllerate to another and, as a result, produce a complexity of regulations and forms. Simplification should, in our opinion, bring about a very substantial reduction in the number of people needed to produce, amend andcheck the paper work at present necessary. We recognise that there will be alarge task here but it is one that must be tackled.106. Fifth, the new organisation would more effectively place responsibilitywhere it belongs in many areas, e.g., on the operational requirements organisa-tion, and, more important for Government, on the suppliers. Those supplierswho could not carry out the tasks involved in the various stages of development and production of weapon systems for Government would not be allowed to
participate in Government supply. The acknowledgement of this fact wouldfree very many people who, at the moment, are employed in monitoring thatothers carry out their contractual obligations. The new organisation would bemore powerful in bringing about real economies at suppliers which, in ouropinion, would be more cost effective than the supposed economies that result from the open tender procedures. It should be so geared that, instead of being charged for the use of suppliers&apos; capital, it receives cash discounts for rapidsettlement of bills.Premature retirement107. There will inevitably be, from time to time, individuals in the procure-ment organisation who cease to be suitable for continued employment in it andwho cannot be found such employment elsewhere in the Civil Service. It willbe essential to the health and efficiency of the organisation that there should beprocedures for discharging such staff on terms substantially better than thoseof the current abolition of office arrangements.
SECTION C-AN AGENCY WITHIN GOVERNMENT108. Our terms of reference require us to consider the possibility of estab-lishing an agency within Government to undertake the procurement activitieswith which we are concerned. We have, therefore, looked at some of the organisations of this general kind within Government to see whether they havea pattern of common characteristics and whether the nature and scope of theactivities of any of them are sufficiently similar to those with which we areconcerned to provide us with a useful guide.109. We have found no such pattern nor any useful analogy. The mostnoticeable feature of these organisations is that each has been designed to dealspecifically with particular circumstances and problems. If there are commonfeatures, these are that such organisations have tended to be in an arm&apos;s-lengthrelationship with the Minister or Ministers and Departments responsible for major policy in the areas in which they are operating, that, to a greater or lesser extent, it has been possible, as well as desirable, in the activities for which theyare responsible, to separate policy from its execution and also to insulate them at least to some extent from political involvement.110. None of these features would, in our view, be appropriate to a procure-ment organisation in the area with which we are concerned. The nature of the procurement process in this area demands a close and continuous interweavingof policy formulation, modification and execution at all levels throughout the lives of the projects, military and civil, with which it is concerned. Unless thistakes place, and is seen to do so, the confidence essential to economy and effectiveness will not exist in the customers and the organisation will acquire a self-generated life of its own which it should not have. An arm&apos;s-length relation-ship between customer and supplier will, in fact, be disastrous. On thepolitical point, we see little prospect that some at least of the activities withwhich the procurement organisation is concerned can be insulated from politics,particularly given the trend to collaborative projects. But we do not regard this last point as critical in the present context.111. We have concluded, therefore, that precedents in the agency field donot provide a useful guide for dealing with the particular problems with whichwe are concerned and that a unique organisation is required. Although in someways this should have agency-like characteristics, for example, in that it wouldbe responsible for the efficient and economical satisfaction of policy require-ments laid down from outside by two different Ministers and in having a very marked degree of freedom in staff control and career planning appropriate tothe special nature of the procurement function, it should in most respects be clearly unlike an agency.
SECTION D-CIVIL AEROSPACE AND THEAEROSPACE INDUSTRYIntroduction112. Section (b) of our terms of reference requires us to make recom-mendations on how best to handle the Governments relations with the industrieswith which we are concerned, including its responsibilities in support of civil aircraft projects and other civil aerospace activities.113. A major change in responsibilities in this area has already been decided upon in that the proposed Civil Aviation Authority is to take over from theDepartment of Trade and Industry responsibility for air traffic navigation andcontrol, aerodromes (with some exceptions), air safety, and regulation ofUnited Kingdom civil air transport. Subject to these changes, departmental responsibilities are:Department of Trade and Industry:(a) sponsorship and control of United Kingdom civil air transport;(b) United Kingdom civil air traffic navigation and control (the NationalAir Traffic Control Services provide a service to civil and military air traffic);(c) certain United Kingdom aerodromes (either as a direct responsibilityor as responsibility for the British Airports Authority);(d) sponsorship of the United Kingdom electronics industry;(e) aircraft noise policy;Ministry of Aviation Supply:(/) sponsorship of the United Kingdom aerospace industry;(g) the Governments responsibilities for Rolls-Royce, Short Bros, andHarland, and Beagle Aircraft;(h) Concorde and launching aid for civil aircraft and aero-engines;(/) research relevant to future aircraft development, including that specificto civil application;(j) development and production of Linesman and of the flight plan proces-sing system element of Mediator within the combined Linesman/Mediator air traffic control systems;(/c) a small amount of purchasing work for the Department of Trade andIndustry outside Linesman/Mediator;(/) a wide range of research and development activities in support of someof the Department of Trade and Industry&apos;s civil aviation activities,including air traffic control, all-weather operations at airports, aircraftnavigation, aircraft telecommunications, aircraft noise and air pol-lution, and aircraft safety and airworthiness;(m) the development of space technology; provision of expert advice toother Departments on technical possibilities relating to the use of space;satellite procurement for customer Departments; leading the UnitedKingdom delegation to the European Space Conference; and provisionof United Kingdom representation in the European Launcher Devel-opment Organisation.
.114. We deal with the allocation of these responsibilities in two parts:technical and managerial responsibilities in Government; policy responsibilities in Government.Technical and managerial responsibilities in Government115. The evidence that we have had shows clearly the indivisibility ofaerospace technology between civil and military applications. This indivisibilitycovers a broad field; it applies, for example, to aerodynamic and aero-engineresearch; to ground and airborne avionics development and deployment; toaerospace development teams and production units in industry; and to muchof the technical activity and expertise of the present Ministry of AviationSupply. The Royal Aircraft Establishment, the National Gas Turbine Establish-ment or the Royal Radar Establishment, for example, could not be administeredseparately in respect of military and civil activities. At the research anddevelopment establishments and at headquarters there is a substantial bodyof staff engaged on work that is simultaneously of significance to civil andmilitary interests, and a further substantial section which moves from defence to civil work and back again in accordance with the fluctuating demands ofthe total Government programme. It would therefore be impracticable tosegregate Government staff into two distinct elements, and uneconomic and otherwise undesirable to provide two independent and self-sufficient staffs. Toset up branches capable of dealing with all aspects of the Governmenfs civilaerospace procurement needs, including technical management and all aspectsof contracts work on aircraft, engine and avionics programmes, separate fromthe branches that deal with military needs would at best be an inefficientduplication of capabilities in the main defence organisation. The civil unitwould be very small by comparison but its existence would require the creationof a new network of committees to co-ordinate the activities of the two groups.We have therefore rejected the suggestion that there should be a self-containedcapability for the management of all approved civil projects or programmes. Werecommend that the Governmenfs resources both for the execution of civil andmilitary aerospace work and for the management of such work in industry should continue to be handled by a single organisation. Under our terms ofreference this organisation can only be under the Secretary of State for Defence.(But see paragraph 119 as regards Concorde.)Policy responsibilities in Government116. At the policy level the civil and military objectives which this Govern-ment has in relation to the aerospace industries are not completely inseparablealthough there are close links between them. For example, the nature of military aircraft projects and, particularly when these are carried out collaboratively,the division of work on the airframe, engine and electronics for them can beof great importance to the health of the aerospace industries as a whole andtherefore to the sponsorship function of Government. It is these close linkswhich have hitherto led to the responsibility for the whole Government interest for aerospace being concentrated under a single Minister, and they remain astrong ground for maintaining this situation. Indeed if the point was consideredparamount all Government aerospace responsibilities would have to go to theDefence Secretary.
117. There are other considerations, however. Among these are threewhich seem to us of major importance. First, the prime responsibility of theDefence Secretary is to provide the most effective defence capability possilbe within the defence budget. If he is to do this he must be able to advocate pro-posals such as that a particular equipment be purchased from abroad, or that aparticular kind of defence capability be no longer retained in this country, evenif such policies are contrary to the interests of the aerospace industries. he cannot, of course, dissociate himself from the health of these industries whenvital defence interests are at stake, but he cannot properly carry out his majorresponsibilities if he has a general responsibility for their sponsorship in the broader industrial context and for policy on civil aerospace projects. Thesetasks bring in considerations extraneous to, and sometimes in conflict with,the defence interest. They should have their separate advocates at all levelsup to the Cabinet, where major cases are likely to continue to be decided.Second, it is, in our view, very important that Government policy towardsthe aerospace industries should be, and be seen to be, an ir .egral part ofGovernment policy towards industry generally. This policy needs to coverparticularly the structure of the industries, including the possibility of widerinternational groupings, and the criteria to be adopted in considering any proposals for financial assistance to the industries. For these and other purposes the aerospace industries should be looked at alongside other industries.This can best be done by the Minister who has the main responsibility for industry and trade. Third, it is essential that where the defence interest requires that a particular degree or kind of capability should be maintained in thisindustrial complex or indeed in any other complex, whether or not this conflictswith wider industrial policy, this should be clearly identifiable. This will onlyhappen naturally, and the costs be borne on the defence budget where theybelong, if the responsibility for sponsoring the aerospace industries lies outsidethe Ministry of Defence.118. In sum, what from the industrial and technological points of view isa single programme, is in terms of Government policy a manifestation of interests that are distinct and which need to be distinguished. Hitherto,organisation within Government has tended to lay the main emphasis on theunitary nature of the aerospace programme. We believe that it is now desirableto focus more sharply the differing interests which are brought together in itso as to strike the right balance in terms of overall policy. We therefore recom-mend that responsibility for policy towards the aerospace industry and for civil aerospace programmes involving Government support should pass to theDepartment of Trade and Industry.Concorde and other civil aircraft and aero-engine projects119. We have considered how the division of responsibilities set out above should be applied to civil aerospace projects. Policy responsibilities for these would pass to the Department of Trade and Industry, leaving the detailedprogrammes to be managed by the procurement organisation, with a projectmanager for each. Formal machinery would be needed for the acceptance bythe procurement organisation of any new demands on resources arising fromthe project programmes and for the allocation of limited resources between these and competing military demands (we return to this in paragraphs 123
and 124 below). Special arrangements would have to be made to enable the project directors and their staffs to work closely with their opposite numbers in the Department of Trade and Industry on day-to-day matters. The difficultieswhich will arise from such special requirements seem to us to be manageable.It has been suggested to us, however, that special arrangements may have tobe made for Concorde, given the stage that it has reached and its wide politicaland indeed international implications.Space120. The responsibility for space activities would follow a similar pattern.Work on space by the Ministry of Aviation Supply at the moment is the sumof a number of different requirements. For the sorts of reasons given above,we consider that the technical and managerial responsibilities for this, work should remain with the rest of the procurement organisation. As for the policyresponsibilities, these would remain in most cases with the customer department,e.g., the Ministry of Defence for Skynet replacement, the Science research council for research satellites. Responsibility for co-ordinating space procure-ment policy should lie with the Ministerial Aerospace Board (see paragraph 124)reinforced for this purpose by the Secretary of State for Education and science and the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, and the inter-departmentalmachinery dealing with space policy should be reviewed to take account ofthis. The areas of difficulty would be policy responsibility in relation to european space programmes and for the United Kingdom Space Technologyprogramme. As we see it, this work is in essence similar to research and develop-ment work on civil aircraft, and for the same sorts of reasons we recommendthis policy responsibility and with it financial responsibility should go to theDepartment of Trade and Industry.Remaining aerospace activities121. Dealing with the remaining activities, those set out in (j), (k) and (/)in paragraph 113, we similarly recommend that the technical and executive responsibilities at present with the Ministry of Aviation Supply should pass tothe unified procurement organisation, with policy and operational requirementsfed in from the Department of Trade and Industry or the proposed CivilAviation Authority as the case may be. We make these observations: that thepresent movement towards formal statements of such requirements shouldswiftly become universal; that the role for letting costs lie where they fall wouldnot be appropriate, and that costs should be recovered from the Departmentof Trade and Industry votes or Civil Aviation Authority funds; and that itwould be appropriate to add a management charge to the actual costs of extra-mural work or intra-mural work at establishments. We recognise, how-ever, that special arrangements might have to be made to enable the Departmentof Trade and Industry to carry its share of expenditure in those areas wherethe costs of combined civil and military programmes are at present divided between the defence and civil budgets in accordance with conventions agreed in advance.
Organisation within the Department of Trade and Industry122. If these recommendations are accepted it will be important to ensurethat the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has sufficient resources athis disposal to enable him to discharge fully his responsibilities towards theaerospace industry and also that there are adequate safeguards against the progressive erosion of the Government civil aerospace interests. The followingappear to us to be the main safeguards needed.123. First, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry must have within his Department advice of sufficient quality and standing and there must be a firm assurance that this quality and standing will continue to exist as necessary.We envisage that about a hundred further staff would be required by theDepartment of Trade and Industry, most of whom would be existing Ministryof Aviation Supply staff. The size of the future civil programme is not yet clear,and we should expect the staff numbers to vary to some extent as this expandsor contracts. Our concern is rather to establish the concept that the aim shouldbe to give the Department of Trade and Industry a small but high qualityorganisation of mixed administrative and technical skills, and that no attempt should be made to duplicate the considerable resources and expertise that willbe available to them from the procurement organisation within the Ministryof Defence. It might be thought that if the Department of Trade and industry had only the small number of technical staff we propose, they would not beable to deal on equal terms with the very much larger and more powerfulprocurement organisation. We think this misconceives their role which, so faras procurement is concerned, would be akin to that of the operational require-ments staffs of the Ministry of Defence. The main tasks of the Department ofTrade and Industry&apos;s staff as we see them would be to advise the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry and, as necessary, the Aerospace Board on government policy for the aerospace industry and to assess the likely futureneeds of the civil air transport industry and of other civil customers of theaerospace industry in order to arrive, in consultation with the procurementorganisation, at a programme of support which would provide the best balance between these needs, the technical possibilities open for meeting them, and thefinance and resources available for the purpose. The Department of Trade andIndustry staff would not supervise the execution of the programme and theywould not themselves be users of any of the equipment that may finally result.As individuals they would be seconded from the procurement organisation andshould therefore have developed many contacts within it. If they should feelin any given case that their Minister was not getting the information or assist-ance to which he was entitled, they would be able to advise him to take thematter to the Joint Ministerial Board proposed in paragraph 124 below. Thisleads us to believe that the Department of Trade and Industry Minister andhis staff would be in a stronger rather than a weaker position vis-a-vis the procurement organisation than the Ministry of Defence has often felt itselfto have been in the past with the Ministry of Aviation Supply and its predecessors-successors.124. The second main safeguard would derive from the nature of the relationship between the Department of Trade and Industry and the procure-ment organisation. Civil aerospace demands on the organisation would be identified and determined by the Department of Trade and Industry and thefinancial authorisation would stem from the Department of Trade and Industry&apos;s
vote. The detailed financial responsibilities of the Department and theorganisation respectively would need to be agreed but in general the Depart-ment of Trade and Industry would be responsible for authorising the expenditurejudged to be appropriate to a project, and the organisation would be answer-able for the efficiency and economy with which the project was executed withinthe authorisation from the Department of Trade and Industry. Effective and efficient programming and monitoring are particularly crucial if a relationship of this kind is to work properly. Arrangements should therefore be agreed tocover such matters as forward programming, statements of requirements, and reporting and monitoring procedures. Third, there would have to be full accessas of right by the Department of Trade and Industry staff dealing with civilaerospace to the relevant research and development establishments and head-quarter staffs of the procurement organisation, and firm and formal arrange-ments would have to be made for this. Fourth, there should be created jointmachinery at Ministerial level enabling the Secretary of State for Defence andthe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to consider and, subject to theCabinet, agree the policy guidance and instructions that would be given to the procurement organisation on aerospace matters of common and substantialinterest. We do not consider that a system under which policy guidance wasgiven separately by the two Ministers would be satisfactory; we therefore recommend that there should be a Joint Ministerial Board for the purpose of agreeing the guidance to be given. This Board would be an important instrumentin ensuring full equality of information on matters of common concern to thetwo departments. In Appendix D we suggest what the terms of reference of sucha Board might be. The Board would not, of course, be concerned with the non-aerospace activities of the procurement organisation which would solely be the concern of the Defence Secretary.125. Finally, we recognise that, however satisfactory the arrangements forstaffing the Department of Trade and Industry to deal with civil aerospacemight be at the outset, there would be a risk that, over time, this staff wouldgrow away from the main body of expertise in the procurement organisationand become difficult to maintain at a quality enabling it to hold its own. Partof the answer to this would appear to lie in special arrangements being made,under the aegis of the Civil Service Department, for staff, and particularly for technical staff, dealing with civil aerospace in the Department of Trade andIndustry to be dealt with for career development purposes by the procurementorganisation, in consultation with the Chief Scientist of the Department ofTrade and Industry, thus giving these staff wider career opportunities. But we also consider it important that this general subject should be kept to the fore by making it a specific area of concern for the proposed Ministerial Board.Views of industry126. Our consultations with those trade associations, research councils and contractors concerned with aerospace have shown that the great weightof relevant outside opinion supports our two main conclusions in this area,namely that policy responsibility for civil aerospace and for the health of theaerospace industry should be separated from policy responsibility for defence procurement and should be exercised by a separate Minister of Cabinet ranksupported by a small high-quality staff; and that there should be a singleorganisation under the Secretary of State for Defence for the execution and management of the totality of the civil and military programme.

The staff effort on procurement in the Research and Development Establish-ments which is included in this Table amounts to some 5,000 White Paper grades,some 9,000 other non-industrial grades and 14,000 industrial grades. The precisenumber in the Establishments cannot be broken down more precisely as variousestablishments carry out defence work of a non-procurement nature. The total intra-mural costs of these establishments (i.e., capital, maintenance and staff) is about 90m. a year.2.

Paragraph 38 of our report recommends that there should be a post at Con-troller level with responsibility for the administration and general health of all research and development establishments, including the provision of capital facilities, and forthe intra-mural and extra-mural research programmes. The holder of this post wouldhave two functions, both critical to the success of the procurement organisation.Firstly, by virtue of his control of the establishments, he would provide staff and facilities as needed by the Systems Controllers for the execution and management oftheir projects. Secondly, by virtue of his management of the research programmes, hewould be expected to ensure that there is a sound technological and scientific basefrom which new projects can be confidently launched.2. As regards the first of these functions, as we have said in paragraph 80, hewould not himself be in the executive chain of project management; nor would hehave responsibility for the day-to-day work of staff in the establishments engaged on specific projects, which would rest with the appropriate project management. Rather,it would be the Controllers responsibility to ensure that within the resources allotted to him for this purpose the establishments were so staffed, equipped and organisedthat they could make the best contribution to project management and execution. Inother words, the availability and quality of the service by establishments in support of projects would be his responsibility; the use made of this service would be determinedby the Systems Controllers.3. The research and development establishments currently cost about  90m. perannum and employ some 5,000 White Paper grades. During the early years of the new organisation, the Controller Research and Development Establishments and Researchwould be heavily involved in planning and carrying out the rationalisation of this large and multi-disciplinary complex of capabilities.4. We recognise that there are certain establishments whose sole or predominantfunction is to provide a service for a particular Systems Controller. These establish-ments, which are listed in the Annex, could be placed as shown under the appropriateController for day-to-day administration and for direction of their work. Even forthese establishments, staffing and capital facilities should be dealt with as part of the procurement organisation^ arrangements for these matters as a whole, and thereforebe the responsibility of Controller Research and Development Establishments and research. These establishments should also be included in the scope of the rationalisation-tion studies which we propose.
5. As regards research, the Controller Research and Development establishments and Research would not only be responsible for the broad strategy of intra-mural andextra-mural work in accordance with the requirements of his customers but wouldalso be required to review and manage this work in some detail, at least as far as applied research is concerned.6. In the present organisation, much co-ordinating and sponsoring of work inparticular fields of expertise is carried out in Controllerates, or equivalent organisa-tions, which have a responsibility for development as well as research. With theSystems Controllers restricted to development activities, the Controller Research andDevelopment Establishments and Research would take over such co-ordinating and executive functions.    v7. He would also be responsible for liaison with Universities and extra-muralresearch organisations and for co-operation in research with NATO and other coun-tries, including the activities of the Tripartite Technical Co-operation Programmeorganisation.8. The inputs to guide the Controller in his task of ensuring that research pro-grammes are well directed to future defence and civil aviation needs must come from elsewhere in the Ministry of Defence and from the Department of Trade and Industry.We attach great importance to closer links for this purpose than have existed in therecent past between the Services and research staff at headquarters and in the establish-ments.9. A particular organisational problem arises because of the blurred nature of theinterface between research and development. The overlapping interests of the Con-troller for research and the Systems Controllers come into sharpest focus whenresponsibility for feasibility studies is considered. We see considerable advantages inan arrangement by which Controller Research and Development Establishments and research would have primary responsibility for such studies but recognise that itwould then be difficult to ensure that Systems Controllers had the degree of influence on the conduct of the studies and the degree of commitment to the conclusions reached that they should have. We, therefore, accept th^t Systems Controllers will have to beresponsible for feasibility studies but, in doing so, emphasise that it will be importantat the end of such studies for the Policy Controller to advise on whether to proceedto development after having taken into account the balance and loading of theorganisation^ programme as a whole.10. Controller Research and Development Establishments and Research wouldalso be the professional head of the scientific staff of the procurement organisationand, as such, would handle policy questions on such matters as career developmentof scientific staff as well as senior appointments. In the career interests of the smallcells of scientists in the Ministry of Defence but outside the procurement organisation,this responsibility should be extended to cover all scientists in the Ministry. It shouldalso be extended, under arrangements agreed by the Civil Service Department, to theDepartment of Trade and Industry scientists dealing with the civil aerospace pro-gramme as a safeguard against degradation of the quality of the scientists in this field of the Department of Trade and Industry&apos;s activities. The Controller would not beresponsible for the details of such matters as recruitment, posting and training whichwould be covered by the personnel organisation for the procurement organisation asa whole.ANNEX to APPENDIX CEstablishments which it is Considered Appropriate to place under Systems ControllersController Sea SystemsAdmiralty Experimental Works.Admiralty Marine Engineering Establishment.Admiralty Oil Laboratory.Naval Construction Research Establishment.Admiralty Distilling Experimental Station.RN Nuclear Propulsion Test and Training Establishment.
