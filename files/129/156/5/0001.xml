THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government cp(71) 3012 March 1971SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT IN TRADE DISPUTESNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister, I am circulating theattached note by officials on the effects of various measures related to the payment of supplementary benefit in trade disputes.Signed        BURKE TRENDCOPY NOCABINETCabinet Office SW112 March 1971
SECRETSUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT IN TRADE DISPUTESNote by officials the purpose of this note is to set out the consequencesand relative advantages and disadvantages of various measures related to the payment of supplementary benefit(SB), designed to check abuses and redress the balance ofthe advantage that the striker derives from the social security system, an advantage which must have somepsychological effect on the negotiating position ofemployers.     It is recognised that the success of themeasures depends on their attracting the support of moderate opinion in the country, and, if possible, makingmoderate trade unionists less likely to heed militantelements.     But the effect of the various measures onsuch opinion is not susceptible of the objective analysiswhich the note seeks to apply in appraising their othereffects.2     The tables in this annex show the situation of ahypothetical wage-earner as it would be affected bysome of the measures considered and compare it with thesituation of a person unemployed through no fault of hisown.     They show that, with the disregard reduced to  1,the familyfs net resources would be no more than  11.75*of which supplementary benefit would provide  5.96.These figures would be no higher whatever the previousearnings, given the same family circumstances.3     The measures considered are the reduction of thedisregard, the recovery of SB during a strike, thelevying of income tax on SB paid during a strike andthe deferment of PAYE refunds till after a strike.     the note does not deal with the recovery of SB paid after astrike.     Nor does the analysis cover the possibility ofterminating altogether entitlement to SB during a strike,the most severe of all possible measures in this class.As a special aspect of the disregard, the note considers the position of capital savings.     With 2 exceptions thevarious measures could be used either alone or in combina-tionj if PAYE refunds are deferred there would be a very strong case also for recovering SB paid during a strikebecause of the additional sums that would have to be paid out in SB; and recovery of SB and the taxation of SB areincompatible in combination.h     One general feature must be noticed.     The legislationdealing with the payment of SB during trade disputes, whichdisqualifies the striker himself from SB, covers, inaddition to those ordinarily thought of as strikers, certain other workers who, though not participants in a strike,lose their work as a result.     This could be rectifiedby giving effect to one of the recommendations of the donovan Commission.     In addition the legislation treatsloefcouts no differently from strikes.     The absence of the distinction might be a special ground of criticism of themeasures covered by this paper and the question whetherone could be made would require further consideration.THE STRIKER&apos;S DISREGARD5     At the present time up to  h.,35 of a striker&apos;s income,
whether from strike pay, tax refunds or casual earnings,may &quot;be disregarded in calculating the SB payable to his family.     Where this occurs this has the effect of restoring to the strikers&apos; family the total basic amountof SB which would be available if he were unemployed,notwithstanding that he himself is debarred by law frombenefit as a striker.     This practice has already been recognised to be ultra vires and Cabinet had previouslyagreed to reduce the disregard to the normal  1.     Itwould follow then that any income of the striker over and above this sum would be available to reduce the SBpayable to the family.6     Such a measure would commend itself to public opinon as the remedying of an abuse of the law in the striker&apos;s favour.     It would reduce the personal resources avail-able to the striker and the amounts of SB payable tohis family.7     Other points are:-a     The striker&apos;s family would.be kept in verystraitened circumstances, as the Annex shows.b     Reduction of the disregard could have the effectof causing the Unions to pay little or no strikepay over and above perhaps the  1 disregard, thushusbanding their resources.     In practice, however,tax refunds already take up all or most of thedisregard.     Moreover, there would be pressure forstrike pay from the single striker to whom SBis not available except, rarely, in cases ofaltogether special hardship.c     If SB were to be made recoverable public sympathymight be secured by some generosity over theamount of assistance made available for thestriker&apos;s family by legalising the existing levelof disregard.THE TREATMENT OP STRIKERS1 CAPITAL RESOURCES8     The calculation of the striker&apos;s resources for SBof capital (including savings), is the same as for SBgenerally - ie less than  325 is completely ignored and greater amounts are deemed to yield weekly sums calculatedaccording to a tariff of 5p for each  25 between  325 and 800 and 12-gp for each complete  25 above  800.     the resultant income is aggregated with any other weeklyincome and, for strikers,  1+.35 is disregarded.9    The effect of this is that a claimant who has otherincome, eg from strike pay or tax refund, equalling orexceeding the  4.35 disregard would have the supplement-ary benefit entitlement for his family reduced by thecalculated yield of his savings.     At the other extremethe supplementary benefit for the family of a striker whohad only savings accompanied by no income from other sources would be unaffected until those savings amountedto about  11+25 (or  800 with a  1 disregard).2
10     Theoretically it would be no difficult matter to devisestricter capital rules for strikers, ranging from exception-ally severe rules denying benefit if savings exceeded acertain amount to relatively severe tariffs similar inprinciple to those used for other beneficiaries.     In astrike situation it would, however, be very difficult to check the administration of rules of this sort:   widespreadattempts at evasion could be expected.     Furthermore, theywould be regarded as a penalty inflicted only on the thrifty,whom it is social policy in general to encourage.     Verysmall numbers of strikers are likely to have savings of anymagnitude:   the deterrent effect could therefore only be small:   and it may be thought that to single out this smallarea, however anomalous, for particular treatment wouldappear unduly vindictive in the context of more generalmeasures of some severity.SB RECOVERABLE11     To make SB paid in respect of strikers&apos; familiesduring a strike recoverable (as is intended for payments made post-strike) should serve to stimulate demands onthe Unions to maximise strike pay, thus reducing the amountof SB paid out and eating into Union funds.     Though formany strikers the amounts actually repayable weekly wouldnot be very large if repayment were spread out over any considerable period, the total burden of debt could be substantial and cause the Unions to think carefully before embarking on a potentially lengthy strike; and the less the strike pay which the Unions were able to make available the greater would be the deterrent effect upon theindividual striker (depending on his family situation).12    There may be thought to be little point in seeking to recover only part of the SB paid during a strike from the strikers generally but some arrangements to mitigate hardship to the lower-paid by some sliding scale for repaymentwould no doubt be thought advisable as an integral part ofthe proposal.     Thus presented, this measure might wellappeal as reasonable to much of public opinion in so far as existing practice is felt to weight the balance in thestriker&apos;s favour.13     The main argument that has been advanced againstrecovery is that the resentment it would cause would bedisproportionate to its effectiveness, since it couldaffect only long strikes, whereas most strikes do not lastmore than a fortnight and are thus covered by wages in hand.It may be argued, however, that when a trade union leaderis contempkting a strike as one of the courses of actionopen to the union, he does not distinguish between a shortstrike and a long strike.     He hopes it will be short, buthe cannot count on its being short.     Nor can the employer.A measure, therefore, that has effect only in a long strikemust nevertheless have considerable influence on any decision to strike and on the employer&apos;s decision to resist.     From the fact that most strikes are short it isnot possible to deduce the relative strength or weakness of employer and employee; but the long strike is to some employers the type of industrial action which is most damaging.
Other relevant arguments are-a     It might cause much &quot;bitterness in the aftermathof a strike.     But this might be directed more tothe Union and shop stewards (and at the Government)than to the employers whose part would be no morethan that of agents.b     It might cause strikers to demand a bonus payment,to enable them to meet their debt, as a condition ofa return to work.     This would obviously depend onthe two parties&apos; negotiating strengths at the endof the strike.c     It might lead to an increase in the damage, already very extensive, done by short guerilla strikes,working to rule and other alternatives to long strikes,d     The recovery of sometimes large amounts would place an extra burden upon employers and this task wouldbe further complicated by arrangements for mitigatinghardship to the low earners, but there is reason to suppose that the CBI would be prepared to accept theburden.     Some extra staff would be required for theSB Commission.e     It could lead to protests that the supplementary benefits scheme was being misused and possibly toresignations from the Commission.TAXATION OF SB15     To tax SB generally, ie that payable to all classes ofrecipients, would not be held to be logical if one did nottax short-term benefits as a whole.     These wider issues are already under examination on a remit from the Cabinet(CM(70)ii0th Conclusions).16     For present purposes, however, it may suffice if weconsider the deterrent possibilities against long strikes oftaxing SB paid to strikers.   This might be held to involveless bitterness than the recovery from employers of supplement-ary benefit paid during a strike; the operation of the tax system itself might be held to safeguard the low earner; andit might be thought a reasonable result by the public at large in cases where the striker&apos;s normal earnings were notinconsiderable and were boosted by subsequent overtime madenecessary by the strike.     Such an operation would, however,involve recalculation and recoding and it would be upwards ofa year - perhaps eighteen months on average - beforecollection of the extra tax actually began.     Much the samework would be involved by employers as with a straightrecovery provision and it seems evident that whatever the merits of taxation of SB generally taxation could, on this time scale, have little deterrent effect in a strike situation.
WITHHOLDING OP TAX REFUNDS DURING A STRIKE17     This differs from the other measures discussed in this paper in that it is not directly concerned with SB.     It maybe thought to be one tMng to reduce or make recoverable a benefit provided by the Government and quite another to withhold private money owing to the striker.18     The striker can obtain his tax refunds more readilythan the unemployed man.     To withhold tax refunds would deprive the striker of certain personal resources thoughits incidence would be erratic depending on his taxsituation and the time of the year.     The single strikerwould lose one of the main sources of income left to him and become still more dependent on strike pay? and thestriker with a family might similarly be led to make demands on Union funds in so far as, if tax refunds were notavailable to take up the present striker&apos;s disregard itwould be worth his while to receive money from his union which in present circumstances would merely serve to reduceSB.19     In so far as other resources were not available, the withholding of tax refunds would increase the demands forSB and therefore the total amounts of benefit paid out.If SB were to be made recoverable it could be argued thatit would not then matter how much was paid out during astrike and that tax refunds might be withheld so as to add to the striker&apos;s problem, but the refunds thus withheldcould subsequently be used by the striker towards repayment of this additional debt.
ANNEXIllustrative Family Incomes in Different SituationsThe following examples relate to a family consisting of the bread-winner, a dependent wife and 2 children - paying  3 rent and rates, with:-f at 1 970/1i   Gross Wages-  25.20 iii   Income Tax   rate?)        3.20ii   Family Allowances     0.90 iv   National Insurance     s1 55ContributionsNOTES1  The requirements of a highly paid worker&apos;s dependants would be assessed at the same level as those ,of the relatively low paid familyon&apos;which the following examples are based (in fact the SB entitlement ofthe higher-paid worker&apos;s family would tend to be lower because his taxrefund would be correspondingly larger).     The reduction in income duringstrikes will therefore be greater for the family v/hose breadwinner hashigher earnings.&apos;2  The availability of tax refunds depends on the extent to which PAYE &apos;deductions have accumulated by the time the payment of earnings isinterrupted.     The amounts available, if any, early in the tax year willbe very small.A At- Work.Resources consist of   Take-home pay       .  20.45Family Allowances    0.90Total         21.35B During Strike under existing SB rules,     late in Tax YearRequirements according resources to SB scalesWife  4.15 Tax Refunds       4.95*Children  3.60 F^ly  0.90Rent and - :   Allowances******* . -rates -&amp;2-  5.85 4.35 10.75 AmountdisregardedAmount takeninto account   ^1*50Supplementary Benefit payable  9.25Resources of family consist of tax Refunds  4.95Family Allowances  0.90Supplementary Benefit  9.25&apos;  15.10  15.10* Over a period the weekly amount of tax refundswill vary between  4.80 and  5.0B1    If the striker receives strike pay, say of  5, then with tax-  refunds as in the example above, exceeding the disregard of  4.35,the effect would be to reduce the Supplementary Benefit entitlementby  5 - leaving the gross resources the same in total, ie  15.10.
