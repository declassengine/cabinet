C(76) 27COPY NO      r 48 March 1976 U *CABINETPUBIJC EXPENDITURE AND THE BALANCE of resources IN THE MEDIUM TERMMemorandum by the Central Policy Review staff-        The Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) agrees with the conclusionsof the Chancellor of the Exchequers memorandum C(76) 25.    Any increasein public expenditure over the levels shown in the White Paper justpublished are likely to be damaging to the Governmenfs major economic objectives.2. The Governments main economic objectives in the coming five years are clear.    They are:-i.      the control of inflation;ii.       the reduction of unemployment;iii,       the improvement of the balance of payments;iv.       the achievement of a reasonable balance between public expenditure, taxation and privately financed consumption.3.        Any forecast about the British economy four or five years aheadmust involve great uncertainties.    In the last three years the world economy has experienced a rate of inflation and then a slump which areunprecedented in recent decades.    We do not know how fast the world wiJlrecover from the slump.    Most commentators expect that the recoverywill be comparatively slow, and that higher than normal levels ofunemployment will persist for some time.    They could be wrong.    Forexample, in most industrial countries, personal saving has been running at surprisingly high levels for some time.    We do not know when, or evenif, this savings rate will return to more normal levels.    But the forecast of the savings rate is a crucial determinant of recovery and the level of activity.4.        In the particular case of the United Kingdom, we have additionalworries about the structural relationships within the economy andexternally.    We are unsure of the timing and speed of the recovery inthe British economy and the extent to which that upturn might worsen thebalance of payments by pulling in more imports.    In particular, we do1DOCUMENT IS THE HlOPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GOVERNMENT
not know how fast our exporting and import saving industries could expand,given strong demand for tht?ir products.    So far as the balance of payments is concerned, in addition to the usual uncertainties about physical imports and exports, we have new degrees of uncertainty on invisibles, particularly with the growth in the operations of oil companies.5.        The present medium-tarm strategy, as set out in the last public expenditure White Paper, was to hold down the growth of public expendi-ture so as to release resources for the &quot;prior claims&quot; of productive investment and the balance of payments.    Some doubts have beonexpressed by outside commentators (including the Select Committee on expenditure) as to whether these prior claims will in fact take up these&quot;released resourcfts&quot; at the wpeed and for the -length of time assumed inthe White Paper projections.6. These doubts might turn out to be justified.    We cannot know the effectiveness of the Governments micro-economic policies to encourageindustrial investment and the shift of manpower and resources intoexports and import substitution.    The rates of expansion postulated(an 8\ per cent growth in manufacturing output for three years -i. e. 28 per cent) is unprecedented.    Yet there is no doubt that something of this order is necessary if Britain-s present balance of payments problem and past decades of relative industrial decline are to be tackled.If the resources are not made available for investment and   the balanceof payments, then the objectives have no chance of being met.7.        But what if the critics should turn out to be right and the expansionof investment and of manufacturing manpower and output does not happenat the rate postulated?8.        The choice than would depend on the circumstances at the time.The failure of investment and manufacturing to expand adequately wouldbe reflected in the level of unemployment: that unemployment could bereduced by reflation provided that the balance of payments would standit.    As was said above, we cannot be certain as to the state of thebalance of payments so far ahead.    It could be favourable enough forus to be able to reflate.   Alternatively, the balance of payments mightnot be very favourable but our borrowing capability might still be good.In which case we could reflate and borrow to cover the deficit.9.        Reflation could be brought about comparatively rapidly, either by reducing general taxation (PAYE or VAT), or by increasing transfer payments (old age pensions and other cash transfers).    No decision about this needs to be taken now.    It would be relevant for fiscal policy in1977 or 1978, when some of the present uncertainties would have been resolved - one way or the other.2
10.       On the other hand, if we set now to plan increased public expend!-ture on goods and services wc will increase the manpower locked up in thepublic sector and fail to make it available for investment and for manufacturing.    To do so will make the priority objectives of higheTinvestment and a favourable balance of payments incapable of achievement.To increase planned public expenditure now will therefore prejudice all theother objectives of policy.    Furthermore, it could entail an increase inthe tax burden which is likely to be politically unacceptable, and make anymedium-term counter-Inflation policy still more difficult to sustain.11.       If, nearer the time, we find that the manpower is not being picked up where we would wish it and unemployment remains stubbornly above an acceptable level, we can then decide what action to take in the light of the then current circumstances - the balance of payments, our foreignborrowing capabilities, the desirability of increasing privately financedconsumption as against say old age pensions.Cabinet Office8 March 19763
