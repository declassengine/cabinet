CHAPTiSB 1INTRODUCTION1.1   Transport policy has not been comprehensively reviewed by government since the late 1960s.   That review led to the transport act 1968, which provided for the development of a transport systembased on the mixed economy, with significant Government intervention in the market in order to meet Bocial as well ae purely commercialobjectives.1.2   This broad approach is still widely accepted.   But the 1970shave witnessed a growing concern, often reflecting changes either in economic conditions or social attitudes, with the way in which ithue worked out in practice.1.3   First, despite the advances made in the 1968 Act we still appearto many to lack a proper framework for the co-ordination of transport policy both at national and local level.   The authoritativeSocialiat Commentary^^ report reflected the widespread view thatpricing and investment decisions for each mode were not taken withinthe framework of an integrated approach, but in almost totalisolation.1.4   Secondly, while no one challenges the inestimable benefitsconferred on famih&amp;s and individuals by the growth of car ownership,there ia mounting anxiety about the adverse affect of this trend on public transport.   Some 55S&amp; of households now own cars - 70$ inSocialist Commentary April 1975
country areas.   But an important minority of households - some 30?  -will not own a car for as far ahead as we can foresee; while many people even in car-owning families do not have access to a car whenever they need it and so must rely on public transport.   Many of thosedenied access to a car are the poor, the old and the infirm, who areof prime concern to this Government.   How to ensure that those withoutcars ean still be mobile is becoming a pressing social problem.1.5   Thirdly, concern for the environment and the quality of life hasincreased dramatically in recent years.   Although something has beendone to civilise the heavy lorry and remove through-traffic fromtowns by means of by-passea, the growth of heavy freight traffic stillcauses a serious environmental nuisance in many areas.   Surely, it isaaid, more could be done to shift freight from road to rail and alsoto relieve the traffic congestion created in cities and country townsby the unrestricted use of the private car.1.6   Fourthly, the energy crisis of 1973 led many people to doubt the forecast increase in the ownership and use 0f motor vehicles.   Criticshave argued that the higher price and /or growing scarcity of fossilfuels will, or should, compel us to limit the use of private motortraffic in the interests of energy conservation.1.7   Overshadowing all these developments ie the present public expenditure situation.   On the one hand, public spending on transporthas increased rapidly in recent years.   Between 1968/69 and 1975/76subsidies on inland transport rose from  300milHon to  630 whilepublie transport investment rose from  285 to  430 million^2&apos;.Figures at 1975 Survey Prices.
1.8   But the Government have now decided to limit the growth ofpublic expenditure in the interests of higher exports and investment.This requires first a painful re-appraisal of the priority to be accorded to transport as against the competing claims of housing,education and the social services, and secondly a ruthlessre-examination of transport expenditure to ensure that it is actually(which many critics doubt) achieving the social and economic endsin view.1.9   All this adds up to a formidable case for a transport policy review.   Indeed the case is proved by the recent ferment of ideas on transport policy in this country, reflecting iteelf in a veritabledeluge of new publications - the report of the Socialist CommentaryStudy Group, the document on Transport Policy published by the TUcJ^the report of the Independent Commission on Transport,^ and a largenumber of academic publications, articles in the press, and debates in both Houses of Parliament.    All of these have raised numerous points which have been carefully considered in the course of our review.1.10   This document is the first fruit of that review.   Its aim is to stimulate discussion, tot to define hard and fast solutions.   TheGovernment now seek the views of interested parties and (just as important) the interested public on the facts and ideas set out in tnfedocument.   (Comments should be sent to the Department of the  nviron-ment, Room , 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 3^B by 15 June).After a period of thorough consultation, the Government will make a detailed starement later in the year *f their own views on howtransport policy should dyelop in the years ahead.*3&apos;TUC Statements on Transport 1975&apos;Changing Directions.   Coronet Books 1974
CHAPTER ?TRENDS IK TRANSPORT AND ITS FINANCE&quot;The dominant economic f*ct of our own eve is the develop-ment not of the manufncturi.tk* but of the transport industries.   It is these which are growing most rapidly in volume -anti in individual power&quot;.   So Alfred Marshallwrote in 1890.   The nicture is little diffe^nt today,though the impetus now comes from road and not the railways.PA3KICNCER TRANSPORTPrivate Motoring.The trends in passenger transport in this country, as inmany other industrialised countries are dominated by the growth in private motoring-   Twenty years ago public transport was moreimportant than private motoring.   Now nriyate motoring, measured interms of passenger kilometres travelled, is nearly four times as important as public transport.   It predominates for all lengths offorJourney, and/both business and leisure.2.2.     More than one in two households now own a car - more than two in three in country areas.   As many as one in ten own two or&quot;lore cars.   Car ownership has changed little over the last two years;but this is no more thnn a temporary reaction to the Jump in petrolPrices nnd the recession.   How far down the income scale and howfast ownership will ultimately spread ie uncertain.   Post-war experience of the relationship between income and car ownershipsurest th.it the proportion of car-owning families might rise to60% by 1980 and ?0% in 1990.   (Volume 2 includes detailed forecasts of future levels of rond traffic and car ownership and a discussionCDQf the arpnTTmtions lying behind them).     Events since 1973 and theexperience of other countries are both comnatible with these fore-(l) Volume P.   Paper 1.   Statistical Orende and Forecasts.
casts;   but it will be some time before the trends are clearenough to be treated with confidence.   The Government will ofcourse keep the forecasts under constant review.Car ownership and car use appear to be only moderatelysensitive to the price of petrol - business use very little,leisure motoring rather more so.   Other uses  of oil, eg forgeneral heating, are more sensitive to price.   The rate of growth of inco-ie is a more important determinant of car ownership andu?e than the price of oil.Even with this steady rise in car ownership, a largeminority w;ll still remain dependent on public transport.   Single-person households rarely own cars.   Many of them are either toopoor or too old to drive, others (particularly in larger urban areas) choose not to own a car.   At present, only one in six ofthese households own cars as against three in five of other house-holds, end for the foreseeable future most of this group willremain dependent on public transport for their mobility.Public Transport2.5.     In the last two decedes inland travel measured by the total(a)number of kilometres travelled by passengers has more than doubled, while travel by public transport has fallen by a quarter.Rail travel has not changed significantly in volume, for growth in long-distance inter-city travel has compensated for the heavydecline in local travel.   Domestic nir travel has grown rapidly,but is still only an insignificant fraction of the total, 0.5%.(p)ln this document &quot;passenger kilometres&quot; are generally used asthe measure of travel, since it is necessary to take account notonly of the number of passengers carried but also of the varyinglengths of journeys by different methods of transport.   For thesame reason &quot;tonne kilometres&quot; are generally used as the measureof freight transport.
2.6.     The main decline has been in bus travel.   Over the last decade the number of bus and coach passengers has been dropningby 4% a year.   The decline slowed during 1973 and 1974, but has since resumed.   Within the total it is the stage carriage services which have been most affected;   express coach services have heldtheir own, and contract and private hire services have increased their share of the market.2.7.     The main reason for this decline has without doubt beenthe rise in car ownership.   Households with a car make on averageabout 300 fewer bus journeys in a year than comparable householdswithout a car.2.8.    The volume of nublic transport services has not fallen asdrastically as ridership.   On the railways, many services have become ^ore frequent over the last decade.   London commuterservices, train and underground, have altered little.   In the urban areas, in spite of heavy falls in ridership, bus se-vices have beenbroadly maintained;   bus, kilometres on municipal and PTE serviceschanged little between 1970 and 1974.   But in rural areas services have been sharply reduced;   bus kilometres r^n by the National bus company, who are responsible for most rural stage services inSn^land and Wales, fell by 7% over the same period, and there werefurther reductions in 1975.Post and Fares2.9.     Until 1973 the price of motoring rose more slowly than price as a whole, while that of public transport rose faster.   The increasein oil prices combined with rising subsidies to public transportteTimorarily altered the picture in 1974, but the effect was limited.Comparing the position at the end of 1975 with that at the end of
1970, retail prices had risen      93%) motor running costs by105%, bus fares by 110% and rail fares by 136%.2.10.     Fares have been rising because costs have been rising.Public transport is labour intensive, wage costs accounting for70% of tot^tl costs.   Unit wage costs are therefore the maindeterminant of the fare levels that would have to be charged with-out subsidy.2.11.     During the early and mid-1960&apos;s thore were marked increases in productivity on the railways.   Important productivity gains were also made in buses through the widespread introduction of one-manoperation.   But recently productivity has ceased to rise, while at thesame time wages of nublic transport workers have improved relative to other wn^-es;   as a result, unit wage costs have risen sharnly in real terms.   Sven if relative wages do not alter, so long as thegeneral level of real wa^es continues to. rise   so will real unitcosts, unless means can be found of stimulating further rises in productivity.   This will be particularly hard on the buses, wherethe scope for further substantial benefits from one-man operation is reducing.P.1?.    Public transport costs are aVo highly sensitive to the pattern of demand.   The total amount of tracks vehicles and (inpart) manpower needed is closely related to the peak level of demand,with the result that they are then under utilised for the rest ofthe day.   Demand for public transport has remained highly peakedover the la;&apos;t decade in spite of the widespread adoption of farescales aimed at filling off-peak capacity,   This peak has been a factor in keeping unit costs high.
Subsidy and Finance.2.13.     In spite of rising fare levels, central and local govern-raent subsidies to public passenger transport now amount to over 550ra a year - or nearly^  30 per household per year on top   ofwhat is paid in fares.   Local authorities presently provide seme 45m a year in addition,  in support of concessionary fareschemes.2.14.     The heaviest losses are on the railways.   The trend of growing railway losses has continued since the 1950&apos;s despiterevenue and capital grants and capital write-offs over the lasttwenty years totalling some  3,000m in current prices.   Under theRailways Act 1974, following the breakdown of the financing systemfinancialestablished under the Transnort Act 1968, the Government gives ^support to the whole of the rail passenger system.   The Act set aside a total of  1,500m for this purpose, which was intended tocover a period of 5 years.2.15.     By the middle of 1975 it was clear that the  1,500m would run out sooner than expected unless strenuous efforts were madeto cut coats and increase earnings.   Railway passenger subsidiestaking prices ruling at the time rose from  75m in 1970 to over 340m in 1975.   In real terms they almost doubled between 1973and 1974 as a result of relative cost movements, government policies of priqe restraint and increased investment.   In 1975 BrittenEtoU also  suffered a loss on their freight operations of  70m(current prices).   The Government is also meeting this throughthe provision of bridging grants.(*)At price-q ruling at the time of the 1975 Public Expenditure Survey.
2-16.     Direct subsidy from central government to bus operatorscomprises two items.   New bus grant - covering 5^*% of the costof now buses - amounted to some  35111 and fuel tax rebate t^ 37m in 1975/6.   In addition the Scottish Transport Group receive a subsidy amounting to  3.5m in 1975/6 for their shippingactivities.2.17-     These subsidies are supplemented by substantial con-tributions b^ local authorities who receive Rate. Supnort grants from the Government and Transport Supnlementary Grants in Englandand Wales.   Up to 1972-73 these contributions were running atunder  10m annually, but by 1975-76 they had risen to  1^5m.Over half the subsidies to operators were GLC payments to london transport.   Until 197% the underground and bus se vices taken together succeeded in breaking-even, but have since moved heavilyinto deficit.   In 1975 the deficit was  125m.   A fifth of thiswas met by a separate payment from the rates to cover the cost ofthe free travel for the elderly introduced in 1974 at the GLC&apos;request.   As noted earlier, other local authorities in GreatBritain were also paying some  45m in support of concessionaryfare schemes for pensioners and for the disabled.?.1B.     Outside London mort of the sunnort in England and Valeswas in metropolitan counties.   The non-metrouol-itan counties oaidonly abnut  10m in 1Q75/7R largely to the NBC.   In Scotland,regional and inland councils provided over  10m suoport for busoperations.
2.19.     The National Bus Company, which operates    over about half the total distance covered by stage carriage services madea  12m loss in 1974 and predicts a larger loss for 1975.   TheScottish Bus Group, after several years without loss, also moved into deficit in 1975*2.20.     Experience of deficits, particularly for local passenger transport, is not unique to Great Britain.   The deficit on all forms of urban public transport in West Germany for exampleincreased from  520m to l000m between 1970 and 1974(orices rulingat the time), and financial support to the whole of the railway system is now running at nearly  2,000m a year.   In Holland,subsidies for public transport in 9 cities alone are expected torise from  ?0m in 1974 to  100m in 1976.   Despite their strongeconomies, it appears that these countries are becoming concerned about the increasing issues on passenger transport and are con-sidering what to do about them. The experience of thesecountries is discussed more fully in the technical papers published(4)in Volume 2 of this study.FREIGHT TRANSPORT2.21.     Over the last decade, road freight traffic has increased byabout a quarter.   Pipeline traffic has trioled;     but freight traffic on other modes - railways, coastal shipping and inland waterways - have all drooped.   By 1974, road accounted for 65^ oftotal freight traffic.   Rail accounted for half the remainder, with most of the rest being; taken by coastal shipping.   Road&apos;s share interms of total tonnage wan even higher at 85%.   Nearly two-thirds oftonnage carried by road was on hauls of 25 miles or less, asagainst a third of that carried by rail.(4)   Volume 2.   Paper 8.   Aspects of Transport in e.c. countries.
2.22.     Although the volume of goods carried by road has grownsharply in the last decade, there has only been a small, (7%)increase in the total distance travelled by loaded vehicles.   TheIncrease in traffic has been catered for by increases in the sizeisof lorries.   Half the traffic/now carried in vehicles over S tonsunladen weight (around 24 tons gross weight).   The big increases have been outside urban areas.   While traffic on motorways hasquadrupled since l&quot;i64, goods vehicle traffic on urban roads has been falling.2.23,     Road handles all types of commodities;   but the other modes are much more specialised.   Coal, iron ore, and iron nn-i steel account for 70% of the freight carried by rail.   90% of that carried by coastal shipping is fuel - mostly petroleum.   Pipelines are almost exclusively used for oils and petroleum (water and gas are excludedfrom these figures), and of tbe ve-y small amount of freight trafficcarried on inland waterways, solid fuel and bulk &quot;liquids account for two-thirds.2.24.     On bulk long-distance hauls, haulage by modes other thanroad has major cost advantages, particularly if delivery can bemade direct to private sidings and thus avoid the need for trans-shipment and final delivery by road.   Consequently, over the last decade the railwaya have been concentrating on the development oftheir train-load traffic, in which goods are mjved in whole trainsusually from private siding to private siding.   Such traffic now form3three-quarters of British Rail hauls- as against a half in the previousdecade.   The share would be greater if the drop in coal output inthe years up to 1973 had not led to a fall in the total volume ofcoal traffic.
Because of this concentration on large bulk flows whichare cheap to handle rail is much cheaper than road in terms of average resource cost per tonne kilometre and has been becoming more so.   In 196* the ratio was about 4 : 1, in 1974 7:1,(l.2p per tonne kilometre as against 8.5p).   These estimates areaverages and take no account of differences in the mix of trafficsor lengths of haul.   Coastal shipping and pipelines are evencheaper, because they concentrate even more on bulk goods.?.?6,     Under the Railways Act 1974, rail freight has to be runas a commercial business, but on the special basis that it is charged only with the costs that would not be incurred if therewere no freight traffic.   The costs that are truly joint withthe pansen^er business are covered by the passenger service.2,27.     In spite of this favourable accounting basis, BR&apos;s freightoperations were running at a loss of  70m in 1975*   Some part ofthe deficit is due to the recession - the sharp cut-back in steeloutput having a particularly damaging effect on revenue.2.28v     The National Freight Corporation is also currently operat-ins: at a substantial loss.    This is largely, but not entirely,attributable to the operations of its subsidiary National CarriersLimited,, which was taken over from the railways under the Trans-port Act 1968.
RESOURCES AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE2-29.     Transport has grown slightly faster than the economy general!?&apos;In 1974- spending on travel represented 11.4% of total consumersexpenditure whoreas it accounted for o^ly 10% in 1964.    Measuredagainst the growth of.GDP, expenditure by business on goods trans-port also rose slightly faster in the same period.Public Expenditure2.30.     Public expenditure on transport is of three kinds:    invest-ment in renewing and improving transport infrastructure and vehiclesmaintenance and other current expenditure on roads, and subsidies tooperators.   The main investing agencies are -- the nationalised transport industrieslocal government, which is responsible for most of theroad system and, eitVr directly, or indirectly throughthe passenger transport executives -nd London Transport,for a large share of investment in buses and localrailways;- central government, which through the Secretaries ofState for the Environment and for Scotland and for Vales(invests directly on the trunk road and motorway network.Central and local government also pay for the maintenance of theroads for which they are responsible.2. 31     The subsidising agencies are- central government for British Rail services outsidethe PTE areas, bus fuel rebate, and new bus grant- local government for British Rail services within thePTE areas, and for subsidised bus services including those run by subsidiaries of the National Bus Company.
The Pattern of Expenditure in 1975-760. 32* Total provision for public expenditure on inland surfacesurface transport in 1975-76 is just under  2400 million at 1975survey prices.   The main elements are as follows:Investment by th^ surface transport nationalised industries in 1975-76 is: m at 1975 Survey pricesBritish Railways Board	(including shipping)	242British Transport Docks Board	12British Waterways Board	2National Freight Corporation	58National Bus Company	31Scottish Transport Group	7	 332mLocal government is investing  130m in buses and local railways,of which  30m represents contributions to the railway investmentshown above.2.33.

Expenditure on subsidies to transport operators in 1975-76,taking central and local government together amounted to over  600mof which some  410m is going to the railways and  200m to thebuses.   In addition local authorities are spending some  50m onconcessionary fare schemes.The Government&apos;s Priorities.2.36.     Since 1970-71 public expenditure on inland transport has grown broadly at the same pace ss public expenditure as a whole.Its share has remained stable at between 5% and 54$.   The figures are as follows:- m at 1975 Survey prices1970-71    1973-74    1975-761.   Total public expenditure programmes 36,223    41,067      46,3722.   Public expenditure oninland transport 1,950      2,117       2,3943.   2 as % of 1 5.4%       5.2% 5.2%2. 37.     However, the Government&apos;s White Paper on Public Expenditurepublished in February 1976 projects a fall in real terms in transport expenditure over the next four years from just under  2400 million to just under  2000 million.(5)   Cmnd 6393.(6)   Tables 3 and 4 of the Appendix to this volume give the completerun of figures published in Cmnd. 6393.
2.38.     Since 1973/74, there has under the present Government beena substantial shift away from roads and towards public transport.In 1973/74 expenditure on road   construction and maintenance   carparks etc totalled  1,327 million;    in 1975/76 it was  1231 million.On the other hand, investment in public transport, transport subsidies and concessionary fares rose froi   653 million to  993 million.Despite the decline which is planned in total transport expenditure over the next ft;w years the shift to public transport will continuewithin the lower total.    The following table illustrates the point:  million at 1975Survey prices	1973-74	1975-76	1979-801.   Road investment etc	874	790	6442.

The White Paper mentions that, in due course, some revisionof expenditure priorities for transport within the total figuirr:aay be necessary.   The Government will, in fact, be reconsideringthe balance of transport expenditure at the end of the period for consultations on this review.

CHAPTER 1INTRODUCTION1.1   Transport policy has not been comprehensively reviewed by government 3ince the late 1960s,    That review led to the Transport  -Act 1968, which provided for the development of a tr^uisport systembased on the mixed economy, with significant Government intervention in the market in order to meet social as well as purely commercialobjectives.1.2   This broad approach is still widely accepted.   But the 1370shave witnessed a growing concern, often reflecting changes either in economic conditions or social attitudes, with the way in which ithas worked out in practice.1,3    First, despite the advances made in the 1968 Act we still appearto many to ]ack a proper framework for the co-ordination of transport policy both at national and local level.    The authoritativeSocialist Commentary^^ report reflected the widespread view thatpricing and investment decisions for each mode were not taken withinthe framework of an integrated approach, but in almost totalisolation.1.4   Secondly, while no one challenges the inestimable benefitsconferred on families and individuals by the growth of car ownership,there is mounting anxiety about the adverse effect of this trend on public tr;tnsport.   Some 55$ of households now own cars - 70% in^Socialist Commentary April 1975
country areas.   But an important minority of households - some 30$ **will not own a car for ag far ahead as we can foresee; while many people even in car-owning families do not have access to a car whenever they need it and so mu3t rely on public transport.   Many of thosedenied access to a car are the poor, the old and the infirm, who areof prime concern to this Government.   How to ensure that those withoutcars ean still be mobile is becoming a pressing social problem.1.5   Thirdly, concern for the environment and the quality of life ha3increased dramatically in recent years.   Although something has beendone to civilise the heavy lorry and remove through-traffic fromtowns by means of by-paases,  the growth of heavy freight traffic sti^causes asertoua environmental nuisance in many areas.   Surely, it is3aid, more could be done to shift freight from road to rail and als0to relieve the traffic congestion created in cities and country town9by the unrestricted use of the private car.1.6    Fourthly,  the energy crisis of 1973 led many people to doubt tfc&apos;forecast increase in the ownership and use of motor vehicles.   Criti&quot;8 Jhave argued that the higher price and /or growing scarcity of fossilfuels will, or should, compel us to limit the use of private motortraffic in the interest its of energy conservation.1.7   Overshadowing all these developments is the present public expenditure situation.    On the one hand, public spending on tranapo^has increased rapidly in recent years.   between^bn 1968/69 and 1975/76subsidies on inland transport rose from  300foillion to  630 while(2)publie transport investment rose from  285 to  430 millionx    ._-_______^Figures at 1975 Survey Prices.
1*8   But the Government have now decided to limit the growth ofpublic expenditure in the interests of higher exports arid investment.Thia requires first a painful re-appraisal of the priority to be accorded to transport as against the competing claims of housing.education and the social services, and secondly a ruthlessre-examination of transport expenditure to ensure that it is actually(which many critics doubt) achieving the social and economic endsin view.1*9   All this adds up to a formidable case for a tr^aisport policy review.    Indeed the case is proved by the recent ferment of ideas on transport policy in this country, reflecting itself in a veritabledeluge of new publications - the report of the Socialist CommentaryStudy Group, the document on Transport Policy published by the TUCp^the report of the Independent Commission on Transport,^ and a largehumfaer of academic publications, articles in the press, and debates in both Houses of Parliament.    All of these have raised numerous points*hich have been carefully considered in the course of our review.1*10   Thia document is the first fruit of that review.

Tt is these which are rrowir-g most rapidly in volume an&apos;1 in 1-dividual power&quot;.    3o Alfred frn-^sha &apos; 1vrrotP  in 1800.    The nioture is little diff^^nt today,though th&quot; impetus now oomes from road and not the railways.PA:i:-:;w::-:H TiVA^;t-OHTP^iy-ite Motoring;.The trends in passenger transport in this country, as inn&quot;ny oth^r industrialised countries are dominated by the growth innriv/jte motoring.    Twenty years ago public transport was moreimportant than private m-toring.    Now oriy-&quot;te motoring, measured interm.? of passenger kilometres travelled, is nearly four tlnas as important as public transport.   It predominates for all lengths offor-iourney. and/both business and leisure.2.P.     Morp th,-n one in two households now own a car - more than two in three in country areas.    As many as one i* ten own two ormore cars.    Car ownership has cha ged little over the last two years but this is no more th-m a temnorary reaction to th* jump in petrolPrices &quot;nd th** recession.    How far down the incvnp scale and howfast ownership will ultimately spread Is uncertain.

casts;    but it will be some time before the tr^n^q ^r? clearenough to be treated with confidence.   The Crovernra^nt will ofcourse l^eep the forecasts under constant review.2.3.     Car ownership and car use appear to be only moderatelysensitive to the price of petrol - business use very little,leisure motorinp; rather more so.    Oth^r  uses   of oil, er forgeneral heating, are raore sensitive to price.    The ratp of srowthof income Is a more important determinant of cnr ownership andu^p th^n thp price of oil.?.4.      Even wit1&apos; this steady rise in car ownership, a largeminority w 11 still remain dependent on Public transport.    Single-person households rarely own cars.   Many of them are either toopoor or too old to drive, others (particularly in larger urbana^eas) choose not to own a car.   At oresent, only one in six of the^se households own cars as sn-nins^ three in five of other house-holds, rmd for the foreseeable future most of this *roup willremain dependent on public transport for their mobility.Public Transport2.5.     In the last two decades inland travel measured by the totalnumber of kilometres travelled by passengers has more than doubled, while travel by public transport has fallen by a quarter.Rail travel has not changed sip-nifleantly in volume,  for growth in long-distance inter-city travel h.3S compensated for the heavydecline in local travel.    Domestic ^ir travel has frown rapidly,but is still only an insignificant fraction of the total, 0.5%.(0)ln this document &quot;passenger kilometres&quot; are generally used asthe- measure of travel, since it is necessary to take account notonly of the number of passengers carried but also of the varyinglengths of journeys by different methods of transport.    For thesame reason &quot;tonne kilometres&quot; are generally used as the measureof freight transport.
TVie main decline has been in bu?? travel.   Over the last decade the number of bus and coach passengers has been droppingby i\% a year.   The decline slowed during 1973 and 1974, but has since resumed.   Within the total it is the stage carriage services which have been most affected;    express coach services have heldtheir own, and contract and private hire services hove increased their share of the market.-.7.     The moin reason for this decline has without doubt beenthe rise in car ownership.   Households with a car make on averageabout ^00 fewer bus journeys in a year than comparable householdswithout a car.The volume of -mhlic transport services has not fallen astfr-sticary as ridership.   On the railways, many services have become -nore fr^nuent over the last decade.    London commuterservices, train and underground, have altered little.   In the urban areas, in spite of heavy falls in ridership, bus sevices have beenbroadly maintained;    bus kilometres on municipal and PTE services^Hanged little between 1970 and 1Q74.   But in rural areas servicesbave been sharply reduced^   bus kilometres r^n by the National bus company, who are responsible for most rural stage services in^lqnd and Wales, fell by 7% over the same period, and there werefurther reductions in 19?5.$ st and FaresUntil 1973 the price of motoring rose more slowly than oricesas a whole, while that of public transport rose faster.   The increasein on n-ices combined with rising subsidies to public transporttemporarily nitered the picture in 1974, but the effect was limited.Sparing the position at the end of 1975 with that at the end of
1970, retail prices had risen b^ 93%, motor running costs by10%, bus fares by 110% and rail fares bv 138%.P.10.     Fares have been rising because costs have been rising.Public transport is labour intensive, wage costs accounting for10% of total costs.    Unit wage costs are therefore the maindeterminant of the fare levels that woi^d have to be charged with-out subsidy.2.11.      During the early and mid-1960&apos;s ttvre were marked increases in productivity on the railways.   Important productivity gains were also made in buses through the widespread introduction of one-manoperation.    3ut recently productivity has ceased to rise, while at thsame time wages of public transport workers have improved relative to other w-es;    as a result, unit wage costs have risen shar,r,ly in real terms.    Even if relative wages do not alter, so long as theren^ral level of real wap-es continues to. rise    so will real unitcosts, unless raeans can be found of stimulating further rises in productivity.    This will be particularly hard on the buses . whereth&quot; scone for further substantial benefits from one-man operationvr. reducing.p. 12.     Public transport costs are al-o highly sensitive to the pattern of demand.   The total amount of track., vehicles and (inpart) manpower needed is closely related try the peak level of demand,with the result that they are then under utilised for the &quot;est ofthe day.    Demand for public transport has remained highly peakedover the l^-t decade in spite of the widespread adoption of farercales aimed at filling off-peak capacity.   This peak has been a factor in keeping unit costs high.
Subsidy and Finance.2*15.      In spite of rising fare levels, central and local govern-ment subsidies to public passenger transport now amount to over 550ra a vear - or nearlv  30 per household per year on top   ofwhat is paid in fares.   Local authorities presently provide scrae&amp;*-5m a year ir addition,   in  suo-nort of concessionary fareschemes.2.14.     The heaviest losses are on the railways.    The trend of growing railway losses has continued since the 1950&apos;s despiterevenue and capital grants and capital write-offs over the lasttwenty years totalling some  3,000m in current prices.    Under theRailways Act 1974, following the breakdown of the financing systemfinanci^1established under the Tranmort Act 1968, the Government gives ^support to the whole of the rail passenger system.   The Act set&quot;side a total of  1,500m for this purpose, which was intended tocover a period of 5 years.?*15.     By the middle of 1975 it was clear that the  1,500m would run out sooner than expected unless strenuous efforts were madeto cut costs and increase earnings.   Railway passenger subsidiestaking prices ruling at the time rose from  75m in 1970 to over 340m in 1975.   In real terms they almost doubled between 1973and 1974 as a res&apos; It of relative cost movements, government policies of price restraint and increased investment.   In 1975 Britishto&apos;l also   suffered a loss on their freight operations of  70m(current nricee).   The Government is also meeting this throughthe provision of bridging grants.(5)at prices ruling at the time of the 1975 Public Kxnenditure Survey.
2,16.     Direct subsidy from central government to bus operatorscomprises two it;ems.   New bus grant - covering        of the costof n^w buses - amounted to some  35m and fuel tax rebate t^ 3?m in 1975/6.   In addition the Scottish Transport Group receive a subsidy amounting to  3.5m in 1975/6 for their shippingactivities.2.17.     These subsidies are supplemented by substantial con-trlbutions b^ local authorities who receive Rate. Support grants from the Government and Transport Supplementary Grants in Englandand Wales.   Up to 1972-73 these contributions were running atunder  10m annually, but by 197^-76 they had risen to  135m.Over hal^ the subsidies to operators were GLC payments to london transport.   Until 197*, the underground and bus svices taken together succeeded in breekinr-even, but have since moved heavilyinto deficit.   In 1975 the deficit was  125m.   A fifth of thiswas Tiet bv a separate nayment from the rates to cover the cost ofthe free travel for the elderly introduced in 1974 at the GLC&apos; request.   As noted earlier, other local authorities in GreatBritain were also paying some  A-^ra in support of concessionaryfare schemes for pensioners and for the disabled.&quot;^IS.      Outside London n?o^t of the support in Snglan^ and Valeswas iv. metropolitan counties.    The non-metropolitan counties oai^only ab^ut  10m in 1^75/^ la^gelv to the 1TOC.    In Scotland,regional and inland councils nrovided over  10m support for busoperati ons.
2.19.     The National Bus Company, which operates    over about half the total distance covered by stage carriage services madea  12m loss in 197* and predicts a larger loss for 1975-   TheScottish Bus Group, after several years without loss, also moved into deficit in 1975.2.20.     Experience of deficits, particularly for local passenger transport, is not unique to Great Britain.   The deficit on all forms of urban public transport in West Germany for examplei-ncreased from  520m to 1000m between 1970 and 197* (nrices rulingat the time), and financial support to the whole of the railway system is now running at nearly  2,000m a year.   In Holland,subsidies for public transport in 9 cities alone are expected torise from  70m in 197* to  100m in 1976.   Despite their strongeconomies, it appears that these countries are becoming concerned about the increasing issues on passenger transport and are con-sidering what to do about them. The experience of thescountries is discussed more fully in the technical papers published(*)in Volume 2 of this study.FREIGHT TRANSPORT2.21.     Over the last decade, road freight traffic has increased byabout a auarter.   Pipeline traffic has tripled;     but freight traffic on other modes - railways, coastal shipping and inland waterways - have all dropped.   By 197*, road accounted for 65/  oftotal freight traffic.   Rail accounted for half the remainder, with most of the rest beinp taken by coastal shipping.   Road&apos;s share interras of total tonnage wan even higher at 85%.   Nearly two-thirds oftonnage carried by road was on hauls of 25 miles or less, as.against a third of that carried by rail.(*)   Volume 2.   Paper 8.   Aspects of Transport in T5EC countries.
2.22.      Although the volume of goods carried by road has prrownsharply in the last decade, there has onlv been a small, (7%)increase in the total distance tr&apos;veiled by loaded vehicles.   Thencrease in traffic has been catered for by increases in the sizeisof lorries.   Half the traffic/now carried in vehicles over 8 tonsunladen weight (arorind 24. tons gross weight).   The big increases have been outside urban areas.   While traffic on motorways hasquadrupled since lX^-, goods vehicle traffic on urban roads has been falling.?.23.     Road handles all types of commodities;    but the other modes 81much more specialised.    Goal,  iron ore, and iron ap1 steel accountfnr 70% of the freight carried by rail.    90% of that carried by coastal shilling is fuel - mostly petroleum.    Pipelines are al  ostevclufiively used for oils and petroleum (water and are excludedfrom these figures), and of the ve y small amount of freight trafficcarried on inland waterways, soli&apos;1 fuel and bulk 1iqnids account for two-th1rds.P.24,     On hulk long-distance hauls, ha^l-^ge by modes other thanroad has ma,ior cost advantages, particularly if delivery can bemade direct to private sidings and thus avoid the need for trans-shipment and final delivery by road.    Consequently, over the last decade the railways have been concentrating on the development oftheir train-load traffic, in which goods are rajved in whole trainsusually from private siding to private siding.   Such traffic now ?ot^three-quarters of British &quot;Rail hauls- as against a half in the previous^3decade.    The share would be greater if the dron in coal output inthe years up to 1973 had not led to a fall in the total volume ofco^l traffic.
?,?5*     Because of this concentration on large bulk flows whichcheap to handle rail is much cheaper thnn road in terms of average resource cost per tonne kilometre and has oeen becoming more so.    In 196* the ratio was about 4 :  1, in 197* 7:1,(l.2p per tonne kilometre as against 8.5p).   These estimates areaverages and take no account of differences in the mix of trafficsor lengths of haul.   Coastal shipping and pipelines are evencheaper, because they concentrate even more on bulk goods.2.26.     Under t^o Railways Act 197*, reil freight has to be runas a commercial business, but on the special basis that it is charged only with the costs that won!d not be incurred if therewere no freight traffic.    The costs that are truly joint withthe nar-sen^er business are covered by the passenger service.2.27.     In spite of this favourable accounting basis, BR&apos;s freightoperations were running at a loss of  70m in 1975.   Some part ofthe deficit is due to the recession - the sharp cut-hack in steeloutput having a particularly damaging effect on revenue.2.28.     The National Freight Corporation is also currently operat-ing at a substantial loss.    This is largely, but not entirely,attributable to the operations of its subsidiary National CarriersLimited, which was taken over from the railways under the Trans-port Act 1968.
RKSOTT-iC      AND PURLIC EXPENDITURE2,29.     Transport has grown slightly faster than the economy gene^sl^In 19?* snending on travel represented 11.4% of total consumersexuenditure whereas it accounted for o^ly 10% in 196*.    Measuredagainst the growth of.GDP, expenditure by business on goods trans-port also rose slightly faster in the same period.Public Expenditure2.30,     Public expenditure on transport is of three kinds:    invest-ment in renewing and improving transport infrastructure and vehicle5&apos;maintenance and other current expenditure on roads, and subsidies tooperators.   The main investing agencies are -the nationalised transport industrieslocal government, which is responsible for most of theroad rvstem and, eith r directly, or indirectly throughthe passenger tr^nsoort executives &apos; nd London Transnortifor a large share of investment in buses and localrailways;-   central government, which through the Secretaries ofState for the Environment and for Scotland and for Vaie^iinvests directly on the trunk road and motorway network&apos;Central and local government also pay for the maintenance of theroads for which they are responsible.2. 3L     The subsidising agencies arecentral government for British Rail services outsidethe PTE areas, bus fuel rebate, and new bus grantlocal government for British Rail services within thePTE areas, and for subsidised bus services including those run by subsidiaries of the National Bus Company&apos;

In addition local authorities are spending some  50m onconcessionary fare schemes.The Government&apos;s Priorities.2.36.     Since 1970-71 public expenditure on inland transport has grown broadly at the same pace as public expenditure as a whole.Its share has remained stable at between 5% and 5^%.   The figures are as follows:- m at 1975 Survey prices1970-71    1973-74    1975-761.   1&apos;otal public expenditure programmes 36,223    41,067      46,3722.

However, the Governmenfs White Paper on Public ExpendituP3published in February 1976 projects a fall in real terms in transport expenditure over the next four years from jus*under  2400 million to Just under  2000 million.(5)    Cmnd 6393.(6)   Tables 3 and 4 of the Appendix to this volume give the completrun of figures published in Cmnd. 6393.
2.38.     Since 1973/74, there has under the present Government beena substantial shift away from roads and towards public transport.In 1973/74 expenditure on road   construction and maintenance    carparks etc totalled  1,327 million;    in 1975/76 it was  1231 million.On the other hand, investment in public transport, transport subsidieand concessionary fares rose fro.1   653 million to  993 million.Despite the decline which is planned in total transport expenditure over the next fjw years the shift to public transport will continuewithin the lower total.    The following table illustrates the point:  million at 1975Survey prices	1973-74	1975-76	1979-801.   Road investment etc	874	790	6442.

AN EFFICIENT TRANSPORT SYSTEM3.1 .   The transport of raw materials for industry, the movement of- exports, theinternal distribution of goods, and our journeys to work and for leisureall depend on the availability of satisfactory means of transport.   Thefirst objective of transport policy is an efficient system which providesgood value in transport terms for the resources used.i.2.   But the transport system cannot be left solely to market forces, for thereare other objectives also.   First, a social objective relating to passenger transport: the market would not, left to itself, ensure i-hat all membersof the community had reasonable opportunities for mobility.   Secondly, anenvironmental objective; for the movement of goods and people imposes realcosts on the community in terms of environmental damage and accidents.Thirdly, a resource objective; the market alone does not prevent theextravagant use of scarce resources, notably energy.   The transport marketmust therefore be strictly managed in the interests of these three non-transport objectives.SOCIAL OBJECTIVESPeople without cars,   people have a right to expect a reasonable degree ofmobility; and the social objective of transport policy is to ensure thatthis is available to all and not just to those who own cars.   As previouschapters have shown, the motor car has now become the predominent form of passenger transport; and thu growth In car ownership is likely to continue.But even in the Vy90s nearly one-third of households will not own a car,and nearly half the population will not have a driving licence.Moreover the spread of car ownership actually worsens the position of this large minority in two separate ways.   On the one hand it weakens theCHAPTER 3THE OBJECTIVES OF TRANSPORT POLICY
financial bast of public transport and so threatens to deprive those who cannot afford cars, or dc not have access to them, of the mobility to whichthey have been accustomed.   In some areas, particularly in country areas where public transport has been most extensively reduced, the opportunities for mobility of people without access to a car are lower now than they havebeen for a generation or more.3.5-   Xet at the same time as mobility has been reduced for those without a car,its advantages have increased.   For as car ownership spreads, schoolsbecome larger, hospitals are regionalized, out-of-town shopping centresmultiply and the council offices are situated further away; meanwhile thelocal shop and post office have often disappeared.   Mobility becomes evermore necessary; but command over it for the minority grows less.   This is perhaps the most important problem which emerges from this review of thetransport scene.3.6.   Help for those who most need it.   The: social objective of transport policytherefore points clearly to the provision of a basic public transportnetwork.   This is not a matter of paying out indiscriminate subsidies, forall the evidence shows that these go predominantly not to the less well-off minority described above but to the better-off.    It is the better-offwho travel most.   Whereas average expenditure on food as a proportion oftotal expenditure falls as personal incomes rise, the reverse is true ofexpenditure on travel.   It is the higher income-groups who use the railwaysmost regularly for travel to work and business journeys, while those onlower incomes travel by rail much more sporadically.   The use of bus services is more   evenly spread across household income groups; householdswho do not own a car spend, on average, abouL 2j- times as much on bus travelas those who do own a car.   But even here public expenditure constraints willimpose a high degree of selectivity on the payment of subsidies.    (Thesefindings arc-; described iajr 1 1&quot; Lilly In the annex at the end of this chapter,while thu technical detail is set out in Volume 2 , paper 2, &quot;The distributionof public transport use by income groups&quot;). ?
3-7.   Thus indiscriminate subsidies not only have their well-known undesirableside-effects (eg on efficiency, cost-consciousness and incentives) andtheir obvious public expenditure drawbacks, but they often fail the mose essential test; the benefits do not go to those who need them most.    Butselective subsidies (especially for buses) must without doubt form partof a total strategy, discussed in more detail in later chapters, for thtimaintenance of a public transport system adequate to provide mobility for those who cannot use a car.ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES3.0.   There is today, and rightly, immense public concern about the effects ofthe growth of transport, especially road traffic, on the environment; and government is under an imperative obligation to find ways of reconciling the benefits of the motor vehicle with its environmental costs.   These costs are of Kevural kinds.   The unrestrained movement of travelling vehicles -cars and lorries - can have a damaging effect on local communities.   Inour- cities it results in noise, fumes and often hideous visual intrusion.It spoils many of our historic centres.   It results in accidents, personalstress and physical damage to the urban fabric.   And where heavy lorriesusfi residential roads, living conditions for the residents suffer badly.In our smaller towns and villages traffic creates an inhuman contrast inscale as heavy lorries thunder through narrow streets.   Damage and disruptionare caused to local communities when new roads are built or existing oneswidened; while in the countryside road building takes valuable land andintrudes on the landscape.3-&apos;A   Much has already been dune to mitigate these nuisances.   3ritish regulationson lorry size and weight, noise, fumes and safe loading are more effective than those of any other KKC country.   In our town? and cities, traffic management and parking policies, allied to shifts in population and employ-ment, have prevented, since the 1960s, the worsening of congestion which
might have been expected in view of the increase in vehicle usage.   InLondon, for example, passenger traffic into the central areas during the morning peak fell by almost 100,000 between 1966 and 1971-   While rail andbus passengers declined by 7k,000 (8 ) and 31,000 (18$) respectively, thosetravelling by cars and cycles rose by more than 6,000 (5$)^^; yet averagespeeds rose slightly, though congestion now tends to last longer and to affect wider areas.   Such evidence as there is suggests that traffic speedshave at least been maintained in other urban areas.3-10. But much more needs to be done.   There are various weapons available to central and local government - the road programme, taxation, nationalvehicle regulations and local traffic measures.   What should be the guide-lines for their use?   The following suggestions are amplified in laterchapters.   First, the effects on the environment must be taken fully intoaccount when the need for a new road is assessed.   These effects are ofcourse difficult, if not impossible, to quantify.   Views about environmentaldamage and visual impact differ widely.   A balance has to be struck betweenthe benefits of faster and safer travel and those of peace, quiet and anunspoilt environment.    Judgements of this kind must be reached within the democratic framework, at central or local level.   But the Government intendfor the future to give more emphasis to environmental considerations, and agreater priority within the road programme to schemes which bring significantenvironmental gains, such as bypasses to take traffic away from sensitiveand heavily congested areas.3-11. Jecondly, commercial vehicles, especially heavy lorries, should meet notonly the resource costs which they impose upon the community but also anadditional element to cover their environmental costs as well (though the/7j ) &quot;Office Location Review11 published by HMtiO?k
most that can be hoped for is rough equity between different modes ratherthan major environmental improvement).   Thirdly, we must take further action to reduce the impact of the heavy lorry on the environment, forexample by strengthening noise and smoke controls and improving the systemof vehicle inspection.   Fourthly, the Government are seeking to develop anadequate system of lorry routes to take heavy traffic away from unsuitableroads and residential areas as resources permit.   Fifthly, we need a stillstronger approach to the control of traffic in towns - through more flexibletraffic management, measures, bus priorities, parking control and the rest.3.12. But what of the popular belief that a dramatic environmental gain would accrue if only we shifted a large amount of long-distance freight traffic form road to rail?   Alas, it is a fallacy.   To begin with, no large-scaleshift of such traffic is practicable.   British Kail already hold the majorshare of bulk long-distance traffic which is particularly suited to railhaulage; for example, it carries some 7$% of all coal.   The TUC statementarguus that only perhaps 2-h% of total road haulage traffic is relevant to[2)this is sue And even if all freight movements of more than 100 mileswere transferred to rail, total road traffic would be reduced by only 2-h%%again, even a $0% increase in rail freight (which nobody, including therailway industry, believes to be remotely possible) would reduce total road traffic by less than 2% and goods traffic by under 3%.3.13. [jor would this small transfer of traffic necessarily produce an environmentalgain.   For unless the traffic is from private siding to private siding, the extra rail freight will need collection and/or delivery by Lorry, oftenfrom terminals in urban centres.   The gains from getting some lorries offinter-urban roads might well be offset by losses in sensitive urban areas.It is estimated, for example, that about U0 heavy lorries or double that(2)   TUC ijtatements on Transport, Chapter 1.
number of medium sized lorries would be needed at either end to load andunload the average 700 ton freight train.   Even new private sidings, whichthe Government are eager to encourage, are often opposed by local planning authorities on environmental grounds.Nevertheless, even if. the gain from a road-to-rail switch is likely to bemarginal, most people would agree that we should try to achieve It.   Buthow?   A long-term subsidy to rail freight would (as Chapter 5 makes clear)not only be exceedingly hard to justify on social and economic grounds;it would also be ineffective since charges are often not the decisivefactor in a consignors decision to choose one mode rather than another.Quantity licensing would be unlikely to achieve the desired results withoutexcessive costs in additional bureaucracy and without serious confusionin industry.3-15- The most effective way of achieving whatever switch of traffic is practicablewould be for British Kail to identify potentially profitable traffic in the comprehensive freight studies which they are now carrying out as a follow-upto the &quot;100 Firms&quot; initiative^.   In doing so they will be helped by the availability of grants under the Railways Act 1 971a for the installation of private rail sidings and associated equipment.   Rail freight shouldalso be helped by the present method of rail costing (which relieves the freight business of all but avoidable costs).   And Chapter 5 in this document makes clear the Government&apos;s determination to ensure fair competi-tion between road and rail by charging heavy lorries the full costs (socialas well as economic) which they impose on the community.We should not assume, in any case, that new road3 inevitably result inenvironmental loss.   Some roads may bring an environmental gain, particu-larly bypasses taking heavy traffic away from town centres and strategic(3) In 1 yyh the then ilinister for Transport (lit- Hulloy) invited 100 of thelargest firms to discuss with British Rail the potential for transferof traffic from road to rail.
lorry routes which enable heavy lorries bo travel with the minimum impact on built-up areas.   Anxious attention is now paid to the appearance of newroads and the manner in which they fit into the landscape.   The sensitivitywith which the MUO crosses the Chilterns is a meritorious example; thoughhow wi&apos; should weigh its aesthetic and emotional appeal against that of the oldRoyal Scot and the American Super Chief on the one hand and that of the JapaneseTokaido line on the other ie another matter.3-17. We must conclude that the environmental considerations, crucial as theyare, seldom point clearly in one direction; in particular, they d&quot;- not support a simpliste pro-rail and anti-road position.   Most schemes throw upboth environmental gains and environmental losses.   The aim of transport policy must be to develop a multiple approach to these matters,  so thatLhi; value judgements which have to be made at the end of the day are basedon a sophisticated appraisal of all the environmental factors.J*&apos;J. l&apos;u us-&quot;-; resources economically is (or should be) the aim of alJ industries,in transport this will often involve measures of control to preventunrc,nil;ittjd demand or unregulated competition from making transport less efficient than it need be.   Cars are convenient, but they lose their*ifficicncy if the roads are so congested that all journeys, includingjourneys by bus, arn badly delayed.   In large towns and cities total demandfor the use of the roads must be held within the reasonable capacity ofthe road system.   Buses cannot be operated economically on behalf of thecommunity in the face of free-for-all competition - there must be someregulation of vehicles offering transport to the public-Hor does the market take full account of tho need to husband material sources L&apos;or reasons of long-term prudonce, in particular fuel, but alsoother materials and land.    Taxation provides a means ofindicating to the consumer that the resources have a greater value than short-term marksL forcos recognise.   This is nowhere more important than in the conservation of energy.
3-20. Energy.   Many people are concerned about our heavy dependence in transport on a non-renewable resource - oil fuel; transport consumes nearly a thirdof the country&apos;s oil supplies.   It is therefore suggested that the use d the private car and lorry should be discouraged, and use of the railwaysencouraged, in the interests of energy conservation.3.21. Comparisons can be made of the energy use of different modes of passenger transport.   Buses, and then trains, are more energy-efficient than cars or aircraft.   But sound comparisons for freight are much more difficult tomake.   The range of energy consumptions for each make of freight transport is quite wide; it varies according to the journey, and whether or nottranshipment is necessary from one kind of transport to another.   As ageneralisation, ships and barges, and then freight trains are more energy-efficient than lorries and vans given the loads they carry.    It would bedifficult in practice to achieve the precise transfers of traffic whichmight be required.   Nor are the energy savings from any such transfer likelyto be as great as might be expected.   For example, if one-third of urbancar travel in peak periods was transferred to buses, together with a smalltransfer of off-peak travel, only 2% of energy In the transport sector wouldbe saved^).   Similarly, transfers of freight from road to rail, or towaterborne vessels, offer only limited energy savings.3.22. Nevertheless most of the Governments transport objectives do in practicematch the requirements of energy conservation; a sophisticated system of fuel taxation, the maintenance of public transport, the discouragement ofcommuting by car to congested urban centres, and grants for the installation of private railway sidings.   In addition, speed limits have been and con-tinue to be Imposed on out-of-town roads; and the economic assessment ofnew road proposals is now being undertaken on a high-energy price assumption.(U)   CPUS Study;   Knergy Conservation.   July 1&apos;^7u.
3.23-   Generally the higher price of oil, coupled with higher fuel taxation,provides an incentive to the public and to industry alike to economisein the use of petroleum products and to use the more energy-efficientforms of transport.   The current financial pressures on British Railwaysand the bus industry also encourage operators to reduce unremunerativevehicle mileage as much as possible (though this should not go to thepoint where economy becomes self-defeating in commercial terms and evenin energy saving terms, with people turning to car transport at an increasing rate).3.2li.   The physical availability of oil supplies for transport is unlikely to bea serious problem for many years the United Kingdom can expect to beproducing oil at least equivalent to its own total requirements throughoutthe 1980s and very possibly beyond.   But we must look to the longer termwhen oil begins to become really scarce.   The changes in technology andinfrastructure that will eventually be required to cope with physicalshortage of conventional oil are so great, and will take so long to bring into effect, that we must start now to give the problem the most seriousattention.   We must begin to explore a range of alternative technologies,including oil-from-coal processes and various methods of applying elec-tricity for transport purposes, from amongst which we can expect the eventual solution to be found.   And we must study the lead times that wouldbe involved in major changes in transport modes in order to satisfy our-selves that the basis on which we currently take decisions will lead tosufficiently early adaptation to possible future physical shortages.CHOICE AND LOCAL DEMOCRACY3*25.   Such are, or should be, the main objectives of transport policy.   Thereare of course other objectives which are not peculiar to the transport industries.   Transport policy must take account of the Government&apos;s totaleconomic and industrial policies - regional, employment, counter-inflationary
and the approach to the motor industry.   These particular aspects call for special comment.3.26.   One relates to free consumer choice.   Although there are social, environ-mental and resource grounds for intervention in the market, we shall notsolve our problems by the administrative direction of particular movements of people or goods to particular modes of transport.   It is an essentialobjective, in transport as in other activities, to preserve as muchfreedom of choice as possible within the regulatory and fiscal framework.Management should seek to extend the range of choice within each modejwould it not be-fefl.s&quot;M&amp;, for example, actually to ask rail passengers mofe.which they preferred - a slightly faster journey or a very much betterbuffet?3.27,   Many transport problems and priorities can only be settled at the locallevel by democratic decision.   This is as it should bej and the Gov^r^vail.propose to build on the system of local transport co-ordination estab-lished by the Transport Act 1 ?63 and the Local Government Act 1972  (inScotland the Local Goverrjnent Act 1^73)*THE INTERESTS OF TRANSPORT workers.28.   Still more important, we must safeguard the interests of all those whowork in the transport industries.   The need for the more pfficient use of resources and the limitation of public subsidy will intensify the pressure for higher productivity and greater efficiency.   This is right.   for transport workers a period of change ahead is inevitable.   But the changemust be nade manageable, and come about with the close and completeinvolvement of the trades unions.   The extension of industrial democracy,at present under inquiry in both private and public sectors of industry,will have an important bearing on these matters.
THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE CONSTHAINT3.29.   Finally, to attain the objectives will usually cost money; and money is in short supply.   The White Paper^ lays down the limits on total public expenditure in the period aheadj and within those limits spending on transport, whether on investment in roads or the railways or on passengersubsidies, must compete with the still more urgent demands of health,housing and the social services.   If additional money were miraculously tobecome available for public expenditure, it is hard to believe thattransport could establish a stronger claim to it than house improvement orpensions or the National Health Service.    So we must do the best we canwith what we have, and adjust our policies accordingly.3.JO.   The resources which are estimated to be available until 1979/30 for themain elements of transport have been summarised in Chapter 2.   When the consultations on this document have been completed, the Government willre-awsess the forward pattern of public expenditure on transport.   Therewill be little or no scope for increasing the total amount of plannedexpenditure over the next few years, but the Government may wish afterthe process of consultation to make changes in the distribution of the overall total.3.J1.   In the early 1980s, the constraints on public expenditure should be ratherL;ss severe than they are today, and some limited expansion in transportspending may then be possible.    But the need for economy will persist,and transport plans should not be based on the assumption that all we need is a temporary slow-down in expenditure.(5)   Cmnd 6393.
SUMMARY.3.32.   The main objectives of transport policy may be summarised as follows:-(i) Efficiency! to maintain a safe and efficient transport system which provides good value in transport terms for the resourcesused;(ii) social; to give high priority to the social -welfare aspects oftransport, and in particular to the public transport needs ofthose without access to a car;(iii) environmental; to protect and relieve the community from theunwarranted impact of transport on the environment;(iv) resources; to secure the efficient use of scarce resources,notably energy.(v) choice and local democracy; to leave as much freedom of choiceas possible both to users and to democratic decision;(vi) the interests of transport workers; to ensure that the changesahead are accomplished in the context of full trade unioninvolvement;(vii) public expenditure; to recognise the need to restrain public expenditure and in particular to confine subsidy to the areasof greatest need.3.33.   The Governments aim is a co-ordinated transport policy which balances allthese objectives.   The role of central and local government in achievingsuch a policy is discussed in the next chapter.
WHO USES PUBLIC TRANSPORT?annex to CHAPTER 31 . StudiesCOof lh-i income characteristics of non-business users of railways showthat the richest 20,1 of households account for nearly S0% of total householdexpenditure on rail travel.   For journeys to work the proportion rises to nearlyThe richest U0$ of households account for over 70$ of household railexpenditure; and ttOjh of expenditure on railway journeys to work.    By c mtrast,the poorest \\\.)% of households account for only         of household rail expenditure.2.      Tht: preponderance of railway and Underground travel by people in the higherLncomo group..; lr. most noticeable in London and the South East.    5l% of house-hold expenditure on rail travel is incurred by people in the top 20% of tlK- incomer,ir,;7.; - and nearly 3u,g by people in the top h0% of the range.    Less than 10,&amp; ofexpenditure ir. incurred by the poorest b,0,  of households.   The pattern of railway&quot;pending is very nearly the same for work journeys as for non-work journeys -though members dF poorer households use rail proportionately more for leisurepurposes, and members of the richer households proportionately less.3.     The conclusion that stands out is that the predominant users of subsidisedr;uL ,-ervj.ce:; are members of better-off households, or business travellers.^*     It is sometimes argued that a reduction in the levels of subsidy will makesupport for rail even more regressive than is currently the case; the preponderanceQf &quot;better-off users would become still greater.    But as against this;a.   Such changes would be unlikely to alter much the pattern of use between income groups; for example, little change occurred in tht: characteristics of those using rail between the twoNational Travel Surveys in 1^65 and 1972/3.    Nor is there any evidence that the real fares increases that occurred between 1 Q?and 1n72, or the very large increase in subsidy between 1 &apos;fl2 andly7u, were accompanied by any significant change in the pattern of rail useVolume 2, Paper 2: The distribution of public transport use by income groups.
b. Even if fare increases did result in proportionately greaterreductions in usage by low income groups, it would be a mistake to conclude that this result was necessarily regressive.   Host ofthe additional revenue raised would come from &apos;better-off&apos; house-holds, and the consequent savings in public expenditure might bemarie available for &quot;progressive&quot; expenditure such as selective help to disadvantaged groups.   Conversely higher rail subsidies couldmean cuts in other social programmes.c. A reduction in fares without an increase in subsidies would be unlikely to pay for itself through increased ridership - a pointdealt with at greater length in Chapter 7-5.     The picture for stag^ bus travel is markedly different.   Even excludingconcessionary fare travel,  the use of bus services is much more evenly spreadacross the household income groups.   About        of expenditure on buses is under-taki.ii by households in the top hOji of the income range (about 1 d/o by householdsIn the top 20% of the range).    About 30% of bus expenditure is accounted for byhoureholds in the bottom of the income range.    The balance -jf 2h% of busexpenditure is incurred by households in the middle 2U$ of the income range,iriith the exception of the highest income group, households make increasing use ofbuses as incomes rise and this is largely accounted for by work journeys.Spending on bus travel is about 2^- times as great for non-car owning householdsas for car owning households.   Where general subsidies are paid to support busoperations, some of the benefit goes to the richer members of t:v: community; but more of the help is likely to find its way to poorer people and  tc those withoutcars, than in the case of the railways.-j.      The pattern of bus travel among income groups is much ths same throughoutthe country but two features are noteworthy.    In London there ir, more bus travelby households in the top 20^ of the income range than elsewhere.    In the
provincial conurbations bus travel as a whole is at a higher level than in therest of the country, reflecting the lower levels of car ownership in these areas.7.     Expenditure on bus travel by old age pensioners is largely accounted forby people in the poorest income groups.   Nearly 80% of bus expenditure was undertaken by CAP households in the bottom h0% of the income range - and abouth3% by households in the bottom 20%.   Where concessionary fares are made availableto OAPs, the benefits are likely to go predominantly to poorer people.
CHAPTER 4THE HOLE OP CENTllAL AND LOCAL government,1   The role of Government in achieving the objectives of transport policy outlined in the previous Chapter has b.en well summarised in theSocialist Commentary Report:&quot;Government has to play ..... an important role in the transportsector.   Not only does it own major parts of the sector, but inaddition by determining the level of taxes and subsidies on public and private transport, the regulations and levels of investment in road track and the nationalised transport industries, it sets the rules of competition between thedifferent modes of transport.   The real meaning of transportco-ordination is the setting of these rules in such a way as to yield the greatest social benefit&quot;,4.2   Government must thus develop a controlled and managed market in transport, rejecting both the market philosophy of a free-for-all and,at the other extreme, the approach of those who would forcefullyallocate transport between different modes by administrative direction.The aim is to set a framework for pricing, investment, taxes, subsidyand regulation which reflects the full range of social and environ-iiental objectives.   Similarly the Government will seek to pursue the se same objectives through the control which they exercise overSocialist Commentary.   April 1975
the nationalised industries and the influence which they exert on localautoorities centrally or through Rate Support or Transport SupplementaryBut within the overall framework individuals and local communitiesshould be allowed to make their own decisions.4.3   National Go-ordination.        Transport policy will be properlyco-ordinated at the national level only when there is a coherentframework of this kind.   Co-ordination is not an end in itself, buta means whereby the objectives of policy can be achieved.    Tneinstruments available to Government include:- fixing the financial objectives of the nationalised industries and monitoring their performance- determining the level of transport investment in the public sector and approving major projectsroad taxation, particularly fuel duty and vehicle excise duty- the assessment of social and environmental benefit eg in higb-way schemes, urban transport investment, traffic restraint- determining the scope and level of paaaenger subsidies (eithercentrally or through Transport Supplementary Grant)- providing local authorities with guidelines for localtr;inHport policy and expenditure- making regulations for safety and environmental standards4.4   These instruments must be used to reflect the social,  environ-mental and economic priorities and in particular the needs of public transport; and to take account both of the various modes and the
balance between them - lorry, car, bus, rail and air - and thedifferent fields of activity - large city,  town and country areas,with special emphasis on big-city congestion and the problems of rural areas.    Later chapters on the individual sectors of transport describein detail how these various instruments might be used to achieve the desired co-ordination of policy.4.5   Local Co-ordination.       Local authorities also have a crucialrole in the co-ordination aid integration of transport.    Within thepolicy and expenditure framework laid down by central government, itfalls to them to ensure that in their areas people and goods have adequate access to means of travel, and the provision for movement is consistent with the social and environmental objectives.   They havethe responsibility for safeguarding public transport and meeting theneeds of those without access to cars;  for preserving an adequatelevel of provision, particularly in rural areas, and for encouraginginnovation and experimentation with less conventional forms of travelwhile preserving standards of reliability, safety and working conditions.    And through traffic management and parking controls,they must deal with the problem of congestion and the preservation ofa civilised urban environment.4.6   All these matters are properly for local democratic decision,though of course the decisions will be powerfully affected by government policy,   Each area has its own transport characteristics;there is no universal blue print.   Again, we quote the SocialistCommentary Report.&quot;While there is a role for central government in influencing thedirection of local policies, detailed co-ordination cannot beachieved by central government, neither is it efficient for
central government to try to lay down any detailed rules and regulations which it believes ought to bind local governmentin their transport policy.    If for no other reason t is isunwise, because there is such diversity of transport needs and resources within individual areas, no meaningful comprehensivetransport policy can be laid down except in the broadestoutline(in Scotland 1973)4.7   Parliamentary Acts in 1968 and 1972/eatablished the presentsystem for the co-ordination of transport by local authorities.Chapter 6 discusses whether local powers in respect of transport services should be further widened in the non-metropolitan areas,possibly on a regional basis. The position in Scotland and Wales is discussed in Chapter 12,4.8   A^flew Authority for Transport?        Proposals have been made, e^(2)by the TUCV      for the creation of a new national transport authoriW&apos;with the tasks of co-ordinating and controlling prices, subsidy and investment decisions, monitoring the performance of the nationalistindustries and allocating freight traffic to particular modes.4.9   While understanding the considerations which led the TUC to ^this view, the Government do not believe that these functions could properly be exercised Dy an agency operating outside Government.   ^instruments dfecu33ed above for achieving the right framework for transport policy (eg road taxation, the level and distribution of passenger subsides, and the amount of publicly   -   finance.^investment) are all properly deployed by Government and localauthorities acting within democratic political control.    Their usemust b* guided by social, economic and avironmental objectives and(2)TUC Statements on Transport.    1975.    Chapter 2:    Recomiaendatifor Transport Integration.ofl9
priorities which, again, are for Government to determine.   And theconflicts between priorities which arise when public res urcesare limited can be resolved only within the democratic process.Transport is, after all, a part of the whole economy and cannot be planned in isolation.4.10   Consider the type of decision which has to be made at national level:   eg a major road scheme   or railway closure.   In the former ca*athe weight to be placed respectively upon the economic and environ-mental factors - indeed the decision on whether or not to build theroad at all - is a matter on which Government must have the final word.The techniques to be used for arriving at such a decision arelegitimately for public discussion and concern - this is discussedmore fully in Chapter 5 - but the final decision must remain apolitical one.   Again, a decision to close or not to close a railway line must be taken not solely on financial or technical transportgrounds but on the widest social and environmental grounds.   It isfor Government and Parliament to aesess these wider issues.   Theseare responsibilities - and there are many others - which could not beabrogated in favour of a non-elected, non-accountable organisation.4.11   The Government therefore reject the notion that our transportproblems can be solved by major organisationichange or hiving-off toan outside body.   But this does not mean that all in the *rden islovely.   There has been too little co-ordin ition and coherence in transport policy in recent years.   The answer lies partly in revisingand clarifying both the aims and the instruments of transport policy(which is precisely the object of this review); partly in changeswiten Government to strengthen the capacity to co-ordinate andmonitor tr ,transport policy and partly in establishing an outside forum,
not for the execution of policy but for its continued scrutinyand supervision.   Proposals to this end are made in the finalChapter.
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 5A FRAMEWORK FOR PRICING AND ItlVESTflENTThe previous chapter argued that the job of providing the right framework,notably for pricing and investment decisions, is essentially one forgovernment.   This chapter discusses what that framework should be.PRICINGThe strict economic approach to pricing would be to ensure that the userpays at least the full marginal resource costs of his transport; then there would (in theory) be no misallocation of resources.   But Chapter 3argued that in the real world we cannot conceivably leave the provisionof transport solely to market forces: the user does not always pay the costshe     imposes on other people; and there will always be situations wherefor social or environmental reasons part of the total resource costsshould be met by the community.   So the central issue for pricing policyis first to define the resource costs, then to identify the exceptions to the general rule that the user should pay these costs in full.    (By&quot;user&quot; we mean the motorist and the consignor of freight as well as thepublic transport passenger).There are complex problems in determining the resource costs which haveto be met.   For example, the resource costs of rail and road transportinclude the costs of the track which they use.   But track is nearly alwaysused in common between passenger and freight traffic, and resource costscannot be determined without deciding how the joint costs of providing and maintaining the track should be shared between the. two.   There are nosimple accounting rules on which to base automatic answers to thesequustinns Lhat are right for all purposes.   Allocation of genuinely jointcosts is ultimately a matter for business judgement of what differenttraffics will bear, given that the costs must be borne by the traffic as
a whole.   Much work has been done to clarify these issues for road transport; this is described in Volume 2.^^S-h.     The problem of pricing is further complicated by the absence of directroad pricing.   The motorist or road transport operator does not pay forroads and road maintenance in direct proportion to the wear and tear whichhe imposes.   Instead he pays road taxes (vehicle excise and fuel duty)which represent, in effect, a surrogate price system.    When it is said,therefore,  that the car and the lorry must meet the resource  (and environ-mental) costs which they impose, this means in the first place that roadtaxation should fully reflect these costs.    (Car parking charges fall into the same category).   It follows that government pricing policy for transport must embrace not only the obvious aspect of rail and bussubsidies, but also road taxation.S-S-     This review suggests that substantial changes are required on both ofthese fronts.    The detailed implications for each sector are discussed inthe separate chapters, but the core of the policy for freight and passenger transport is explained below.   But two broader points need to be borne inmind.   In so far as adjustments to taxes can contribute towards transport policy, any changes will need to be compatible with the immediate require-ments (for example, contra-cyclical) of economic and financial management.Hence the tax changes implied by the review represent a set of medium-termobjectives to which the Government intends to move over a period of years.The Government recognise too that tax changes of the kind contemplatedmay have important implications Tor the British motor and commercialvehicle industries as well as the road haulage industry.    In accordancewith the January 1/^6 White paper on the British Motor Industry,^ and(1)   Paper 6, &quot;The allocation of road track costs&quot;.(2)   Cmnd u 377
Policy on Industrial Strategy Government intends to consult these industries on the scope and form of the tax changes.FREIGHT5.6.      First, road freight.    Until recent years goods vehicles as a wholecontributed substantially more in fuel and licence taxes than the roadprovision and maintenance costs which could reasonably be allocated tothem.   But in the last few years the levels of tax have fallen behind the pace of inflation.    Recent estimates show that the resource costs arisingfrom lorries - and particularly from heavy lorries with few axles - now well exceed the taxes levied on their use.   Goods vehicles over 3-5 tonsgvw only contributed about 80$ of the road provision and maintenance costs which could be attributed to them in 1975/76-   Estimates of the additionalenvironmental costs caused by goods vehicles cannot be made with the same degree of confidence but they are likely to be significant.5-7.     There is no social justification for goods vehicles meeting less than their resource costs.   There is, thus, a strong argument for lorrytaxation to be more systematically related than it is now to the bestestimates that can be made of the resource costs which lorries impose,with some addition to reflect the environmental damage associated withlorry traffic.   This approach would, among other things, entail therestructuring of vehicle excise duty in order to reflect better the costscaused by different types of lorry.   This would mean steeper tax increases for heavy lorries, particularly for those with few axles and high axleloading which cause disproportionate damage to the roads they use.Estimates of some of the environmental costs attributable to heavylorries - noise, air pollution and vibration - have been given by Prykeand Dodgsoi. and are discussed in Volume 2.^^(3)   Cmnd 6315(k)   Volume 2, paper 6, &quot;The allocation and road track costs&quot;. j
Since demand Tor road freight appears to bo largely price-inelastic,these tax changes will not radically alter the volume of such traffic.But such reductions as do occur will be sensible ones.   Bulk trafficover long journeys will have the greatest incentive for switching to rail;while empty or part-loaded running will be discouraged.Tax changes on these lines would raise freight costs and these increases would, at least in part, ultimately be passed on to the consumer,    livenso, it is desirable to restore a sounder relationship between the taxationcontribution made by the road transport industry and the costs it impose..1on th&apos;.; community.    On present estimates the annual operating costs for commercial vehicles might eventually rise at the most by         withmaximum increases of about \$% on some of the heaviest, vehicles.   Taxincreases on road freight would have to be phased over a period to giveboth the road haulage industry and the vehicle manufacturers adequatetime to adjust to these changes.    /However the Uovernment propose totake in this year&apos;s Finance Bill powers to begin the procss of recordinginformation about lorry axles and laden weights to make possible a mor^relevant approach to lorry taxation75-10.    Rail freight is also failing to meet its costs even though only avoidabletrack costs are charged to it.    In 1^75 the subsidy to British RaiLway:,attributable to freight traffic amounted to about  70 million at nut-tart-prices.   There are no social grounds for such a subsidy.   Neither, forthe reasons given in Chapter J, is there a justifiable environmental case for a general subsidy to rail freight.    There are other and better way::of reducing the environmental nuisance of the heavy lorry.Given, then, a fair system of taxation on the heavy lorry (and the specialSection 0 assistance mentioned earlierj, it is right that British Railways&apos;freight losses should be extinguished as soon as possible    both road and
rail freight should be run on normal commercial lines, carrying the traffic for which they are best suited.PASSENGERS5*12.   The motorist.   Although cars generally fully meet their overall share of road costs, they do not always pay sufficient to cover the congestioncosts they cause in particular urban centres.   Moreover one of the obstacles in the way of a better balance between different forms oftransport is that motorists do not always appreciate the true costs ofthoir journeys to the community, including the congestion costs imposed on other road users and alro the environmental costs.   The use of cars tends to be governed more by the perceived costs of journuys, mainly the priceof petrol, than the overall cost of motoring.   If vehicle excise duty oncars were abolished and the revenue collected instead through increasedpetrol duty this would raise the perceived cost of each additionaljourney.   To take such a step in present circumstances, however, would seriously disturb the tax environment of British car manufacturers andadd to their difficulties.   This is not therefore a step that the Govern-nent could for the time being contemplate.-*&quot;l3.   There is however a case for more effective vehicle restraint in eomecentral areas in order to ease congestion, help public transport(especially during peak hours), reduce energy use and improve the urbanenvironment.   The existing means of managing traffic c-uild be morerigorously applied in some areas.   Charges for local authority parkingshould be put on to a viable basis, while meter charges should be adjustedin line with inflation.   New measures would include local authoritycontrol over commercially-operated public car parks, and the extension ofparking control and charging to private non-residential parking.
A fair and comprehensive approach to &quot;pricing&quot; must also take accountof the private use of company cars.   The motorist whose employer provide?the petrol and parking facilities has an incentive to use his car fortravelling to work, whereas the motorist whose full costs are met out oftaxed income does not.   The use of company cars for commuting in peakhours contributes to congestion.5.1$.    The Government fully acknowledges the importance of motoring as the mainform of passenger travel, and would not lightly contemplate proposalswhich would lead, over time, to increases in its cost.    But most familiesneed to rely on public transport as well as private.   They will accept that we need a system which is fair as between transport users and, inthe urban areas, gives public transport a better chance to do its job,especially at a time when bus fares will need to be raised.   It is to thai,problem that we now turn.5-16.   Public passenger transport.   The most pressing of our problems is public transport.   As we have seen in Chapter 2, ridership on local trains andbuses has been consistently falling for at least 20 years, as the motorcar has become the predominent form of passenger transport.   At the sametime, in a number of our urban centres the level of traffic is still too high.   Subsidies to railways are of long standing but have increased verysharply of recent years and substantial subsidies to buses have also been introduced.   Most advanced countries face similar problems; in fact some european undertakings are more heavily in deficit than our own.&apos;^   i/ehave tried to deal with this situation by higher productivity on the onehand and substantial public subsidy on the other.   Indeed, subsidy to public transport is currently running at historically unprecedented levels.In 1975/76 passenger subsidies amounted to over  60u million, of which someUi10 million went to British Itail,  20o million to tht busos and i 0 million(5)    Volume 2, Paper 8, &quot;Public Transport Expenditure in e.c. Countries&quot;
to concessionary Tares.   At out-turn prices the community spent some jjO a year per household ( 25 of it on rail) to keep services going andfares down.^ ^The provision of public transport is, as was argued in Chapter 3, a basiccommunity need.   Both central and local government must intervene in themarket to ensure a basic public transport system.   The problem is:(a) to match the level of financial support to theresources available and(b) to ensure that the type and amount of help givenis such that it helps those who need the help, iethe less well-off and those without access to a car.We have already argued that generalised or undiscriminating subsidies areeconomically inefficient and socially wasteful.   And as far as the environment is concerned, while it is often claimed that subsidising fares( 7)relieves congestion in the cities, the evidence      suggests that motoristsdo not forsake their cars to any large extent when fares are held down.Is there then any justification for subsidies on anything like the present scale?   We must return to the social objectives described in Chapter 3,which identified for priority consideration people on lower incomes who do not have access to a car and are dependent on public transport,people living in country areas where lack of public transport servicesimpoverishes community life, and those special minorities - the young,the old, the disabled - who also depend heavily on public transport.The proble.m is to see that passenger subsidies follow these socialpriorities and are not given indiscriminately.   Subsidies would then bejustified on the following grounds-.(6)   passenger subsidies at out-turn prices in 1975/76.   Railways:over  500 million.   Buses:   over  2U0 million.(7)   Volumt: 2, Paper 3, &quot;Methods of Limiting Car Use in Urban Areas.&quot;
i.   help to particularly vulnerable groups of usersfor whom full fares represent real hardship;ii.   selective help to maintain an adequate level oftransport services in particular areas;iii.   phasing arrangements to avoid enormous jumps in fares;iv.   limited and temporary financial support to promoteinnovation in new types of services.S.2&apos;\ .    It will take time to move from ths present, system to one more closelyconforming to tho; above categories.    By far the largest share of subsidygoes to the railways.   Reductions in that subsidy would call for a com-bination of manpower savings through higher productivity, cost reductionsthrough service reductions, and fare increases.   A reasonable set of objectives would be for inter-city services to operate on a viable basis;for commuter services in London and the South East to meet all but acomparatively small percentage of their costs; and for losses on services in other metropolitan areas and in the rest of the country to be sub-stantially reduced.   These propositions are discussed in more detail in chapter 7 on British Railways.^.22.    Bus services are less expensive in resources per passenger kilometre thantrain services.   Subsidies to local bus services, including those to national Bus Company and Scottish Transport Group services, should bedetermined locally.   This should be done.in the context   of local transportplans and within agreed limits of public expenditure.   It will be for local authorities, with guidance from the Government, to decide localpriorities in their areas and in particular to ensure that the less well-off and more vulnerable members of society are not left without essential services.   An important question for discussion in these consultations isa
what levels of support are needed to keep essential bus services going,in the country areas the problem of maintaining services is acutej thereneeds to be much more flexibility to try unconventional solutions.   Andin some areas the sensible answer may be to withdraw heavily subsidisedlocal rail services and replace them by cheaper bus services.   financial support for buses is usually very much more cost-effective than support for rail services.   There is a possible &quot;trade-off&quot; here Ln certain areas by way of substituting an assured and cheaper bus service in place of amuch more expensive local train service.   This is a matter the government proposes to discuss fully with local authorities, British Railways andbus operators.The effects of reducing rail subsidies would be felt most heavily by thosmaking inter-city journeys and by longer distance commuters.   But transpocharges in real terms will be higher almost everywhere.   The Government,local authorities and the transport operators must between them - througneconomies in operation, through cheaper alternative forms of travel and through the selective use of subsidies - find ways of ensuring that thereis a reasonable level of service within the capacity of the less well-offmembers of the community for their essential journeys.   There is also acase for a more systematic approach to the provision of concessionary busfares to reduce hardship for the elderly and the infirm.   All -Ji:i:so L-jsucar^ discussed in greater detail in Chapter 6 on Local Transport and theBus Industry, Chapter 7 on British Railways and Chapter ii on Freight.One final point must be emphasised here.   No pricing system in transport is likely to be fully equitable as between all users.    The best we canaim at is rough justice between main groups, tempered by both gradualimplementation where individualr. are most vulnerable and a systematicallygreater priority for mitigating the hardship likely to be caused to those
least able to help themselves.   Therefore, issues of subsidy, roadtaxation and vehicle restraint must be considered together as part ofa co-ordinated approach to pricing in transport.INVESTMENT5.26.    Sound investment in public sector transport requires planning andco-ordination.   Otherwise resources will not, be used to the best effect and there may be wasteful duplication of facilities.    There is a lot at stake.    In 1975-6 over  1200 trillion was invested in inland transportwithin the public sector.    (In addition over  2U00 million was invested in the private sector mainly on the purchase of vehicles).5.27.   Different types of public sector investment.   For road transport thepublic sector is responsible for providing virtually the whole of thetrack, but relatively few of the vehicles.    For railways and canals thepublic sector finances not only the track but also most of the vehicles,though there is some private sector investment in vehicles and terminalfacilities.5.20.    The pattern of investment.    Between the mid-1 J^Os and the early 1970sthe nation invested heavily in its transport system - the motorway network,railway modernisation, up-to-date buses, goods vehicles and cars.    Inrecent years the balance, which was heavily in favour of roads, has begun to move towards public transport.    This is described in Chapter 2.    Thetotal amount we can afford to invest in public sector transport in theperiod up to the early eighties will be limited and,  therefore, it is of prime importance that within the total we get the best value for money.INVESTMENT PLANUINu5.29.    Investment appraisal.    The 1967 VJM te Paper       laid down the general(d) Nationalised Industries: A Review of Economic and financial objectives (Cmnd JU37).
principles that should govern the, planning of investment in public sectorenterprises.   The key concept was the inter-connection of pricing and investment policy. Prices should reflect long-run marginal social costs,and investment returns, given proper pricing, should be comparable withreturns currently being obtained in the private sector.&apos;-30.   central government seeks to promote comparability by prescribing period-ically the tiist discount to be employed.   A review of the test discountsystem and the TDR is taking place at present under the leadership ofthe Treasury.&apos;*31.   Pricing is important.   Without proper pricing users and operators will not receive the right signals about the true costs to the community ofdifferent ways of meeting their transport costs.   Investment decisions in both private and public sectors will be distorted and scarce resourceswasted.*32.   The proposals made earlier in this chapter for improving the pricing oftransport are therefore key to the optimum planning of investment.*33.   Neither central government, nor any other agency, could take decisions onall transport investment projects in the public sector.   But centralgovernment does have a responsibility to ensure that as far as possiblecommon methods and criteria are used for judging investment schemes bythe many people responsible for day-to-day investment decisions in public sector transport.&quot;3lu   Cost-benefit analysis.   In transport there are two main quantitativetechniques used in investment appraisal - financial appraisal and cost-benefit analysis.   The former is used for most public transport projects.The latter has been developed to cover the cases where the former is either inapplicable or clearly biased.   A full description of present(Q)practice is given in Volume 2.    &apos;(9) Paper 5: Investment appraisal of inland transport in the public sector.
$-25-   Cost-benefit is needed to help assess road schemes,   hoad vehicles canbe made to pay through taxation for the development and upkeep of theroad system as a whole; but there is no feasible method of associatingtax revenues with particular road proposals.   Other means have to befound for assessing the worth of a new road to its usersand balancing itagainst the costs of construction and the other disadvantages that the roadmay bring.   Cost-benefit, cannot however value accurately either the impact of extra noise and pollution, or its relief by the construction of abypass.    Nor can it fully value the loss from the destruction of housing.5.36-   For urban public transport schemes, cost-benefit can help to valuebenefits to non-users through reduction in congestion.    These cannot becharged for and are not, therefore, reflected in a narrow financialappraisal.   The technique can also be used to value benefits to usersnot charged for in fares.   But cost-benefit is not, as often supposed,something entirely distinct from a financial appraisal.    Forecasts oflikely revenue are an important element in the cost-benefit assessment of urban public transport schemes.$.37.    Much has been done to standardise cost-benefit methods to enable them tobe applied consistently by different agencies.    But inevitably an element of subjective judgement is called for where there are gaps in preciseevaluation.   There has been a lot of vocal criticism of the application of cost-benefit techniques, especially for roads.    The intention is therefore to seek an independent view of the methods of appraisal employed for roadproposaLs; and this is discussed further in Chapter y.Resources will be misallocated unless these two techniques give comparableresults.    Some have argued that present practice i:; biased in favour of projects assessed by cost-benefit analysis such as roads.   This issue isnot a simple one (see Volume 2); but the Government is considering whether
any change would be desirable as part of its present review of the testdiscount rate.5-39.   1&apos;ithin the general guidelines above, the various government departments,nationalised industries, and local authorities must generally be left tomake their own decisions within their total investment programme.   Monitoringby government or, where appropriate, local authorities should be restricted to the minimum required to ensure that investment is being planned andexecuted in conformity with the guidelines. &apos;Over recent years, there have been complaints that uncertainty about the intentions of central government has made investment planning in the nationalised industries harder than it should be.   Business investment,in transport as in other industries, takes years to mature, and is made more difficult if plans have to be radically revised from year to yearbecause of changing objectives and changing availability of resources.Unfortunately the national economic situation in the last three years hasmade it necessary to change the levels of investment in noiae industries,sometimes at fairly short notice.-&quot;-M .   In common with other public industries, the public transx^ort industries aretaking part in a review^of Government/nationalised industry relationsdesigned to achieve a better defined relationship.   There has also been a review of nationalised industry investment planning, under the auspices of the National Economic Development Council, with the aim of achievingmore stable programmes for the benefit, of the industries and theirsuppliers.   There are some aspects of these reviews peculiar to transport industries which are worth discussion h-re.In the public passenger transport industries, commercial objectives are(10)   Being undertaken by the National Economic Development Office attlie request of the Government.5.1.2.1 J
closely interwoven with social and environmental considerations.   Thisis particularly true where the industry, like British Railways or thebus operators, is receiving financial support from central or localgovernment to help it to pursue social objectives.   All of this makesinvestment plaining inherently more difficult than in an industry whereprimacy can be given to commercial aims.5-u3-   The Government recognise that the Boards of the industries need to know what broad objectives and pricing policies they should pursue and whatpriorities they need to observe.    The industries should ideally be clearabout the resources which are likely to be available for the business for several years ahead.   But thi,r; is easier said than done, when economicconditions are changing rapidly and when the industries finances aredeteriorating.   A start has been made, following the 1JEDC initiative lastyear, in authorising firm investment commitments for the transport industries two or three years ahead.Co-ordination.   Pursuit of certain common principles will go far to ensurethat transport investment is planned in a way that gives good value for money.   But each agency drawing up its own plan can only see part of the picture, and plans drawn up independently of each other may fail to getthe best value for money for the community as a whole.   The government therefore has a general responsibility to ensure that adequateco-ordination takes place without detracting more than necessary from each undertaking^ responsibility for achieving the best results.Much of the need for investment co-ordination is a matter of commonsense,calling for no special machinery.   Travel often involves interchangesbetween modes, and the planning of these must be done with the problemof both modes in mind.   Clearly each undertaking will need to consider how well its own projects fit in with the rest of the transport system.1U
Local co-ordination.   Local government is responsible for local roads,comprehensive transport planning and for some transport undertakings; andth*s public sector transport industries provide many local services.   Closerconsultation, and co-ordination, about investment plans may need to bedevelop&quot;d at local level; where this is at present lacking, local transportHutho.rit.itis are well placed to undertake the initiative.   They will also need to relate these plans to their wider plans for tho development oftht: communities, as reflected in structure and local plans.national co-ordination.   For reasons given at the end of the last chapter,tho Government has rejected the idea of a new national transport authority as a means for ensuring a better degree or national co-ordination.Similar arguments would apply to the co-ordination of investment alone -the right course for government is to make the objective;; and the criteriaclear, not to get involved in the detailed planning of investment.    But.in the [articular field of the longer-term strategic development, theGovernment needs to play a more positive role.   There is danger of dupli-cation especially in relation to major development projects with a long period of gestation - for example, major new motorways, the electrificationof main railway lines or investment in new air services.    TheGovernment therefore propose, in association with the industries concerned,to undertake an early study of tho future long-term demand for and pro-vision of public passenger transport for inter-urban journeys.   Therewill be particular emphasis on the investment and development strategyto be pursued by the different competing industries - road, rail and air.J&apos;h*$.   ijext steps.   Following the consultations on this review, the Governmentis intending to ask each of the public transport industries to review their corporate plans and investment programmes in the light of the
objectives and priorities which emerge.     The aim will be to achievegreater stability of investment than in the past on the basis of agreedpolicies.    In the particular case of the railways, the Government pro-poses that this review should lead to a planning agreement between theBoard and the Government drawn up after full consultation with theunions.   This is discussed more fully in Chapter 7.   Further guidance on policies will also be given to local authorities as a framework fortheir transport planr;.
CHAPT..H 6LOCAL TwALJPuKT AND BUS INDU -TRY6,1   The solution of local tj transport problems requires close and effective collaboration between central and local government.    It iscentral gov rnmenfs role to set the broad lines of transport policy;-to g .ide local authorities in the development of their local plansnnd policies Cor roads and public transport;  to provide a substantial amount of the money needed to carry out approved policies;  and to insure that the bus and rail industries are so organised aa to provideefficient and co-ordinated services which  ^re responsive to publicnt-&apos;dissapointed.    Within the national policy framework,  it is for the localauthorities, as eLected member3 with full knowledge of local circumstances,  to shape their policies to meet local needs,  to securethat transport services are provided and ensure that ti transport plans are properly integrated with longer term plans for land use.6.?   There are no easy solutions.    Our inheritance of established townsw*which grew up before the motor age, and more dispersed patterns of housing development with longer and more diffuse journeys to work makethe task of integrating traffic with urban living formidably difficult.There are conflicting interests, and    painful       compromises betweenthem, iiaking judicious use of regulation, pricing and investment,   irehecesu^ry  to achieve a proper balance between freedom of investment^nd a decent quality of  life.     In rural areas,  public transport hasbeen gradually eroded oV&apos; r a long period.Public &apos; Y;.in:)port.    As we  saw in Chapter  j,   the mO:-;t crucial  .30c  &quot;.!&apos;3&apos;&quot;biiMQ to emerge  from th^  tj-;jfimport review is  lack of mobilitythose without access to a car.    The first priority   among the0ojHctive:.; of transport policy therefore ia to ensure the existence of effective local public transport to meet the needs of those dependent0n it.    For tlis purpose bus services are much more important thanrail services, except in some parts of London aid the South taut.    Evenln- the other metropolitan counties, railways carry only a relatively
small proportion of local passengers. Buses now account for about12% of all travel, i. nd most bus juurneys are local.6.4   The Problems.    The main problem which has long confronted the busindustry is the progressive decline in patronage.    Despite itsconvenience,  the bus has not been able to withstand the increase in theuse of cw.r3.    dr ownership roughly doubled between  L962 and 1972,bringing Iowt bus ridership, especially off-peak.    Bus journeys onstygp services fell from nearly 11.8 billion in 1964 to 7.7 billion in1-974.    luore and more services have bcoine uneconomic.    Althoughinmortint productivity gains have been made through the introduction ofone-man operation on a wide scale, productivity has stopped rising inn&apos;c nt years and at the same  time, costs (and particularly wage costs which represent 1.)% of all buy costs)  have  increased sharnly.    these have  forced reductions in services arid higher fares.    After twoyears of deliberate restraint by many authorities fares were increased on average by more than a half in 1975, and further increases areexpected this ye;ar.    tfuch increases have already encountered somepassenger resistance, and the Government ^re watching the situationc!one Ly.6.b    The decline in ridership has continued despite substantial increases in subsidy in recent years.    Total support to the busj nd us cry from centra J  and local government rose from /about  70m/in 1972/73 to over ^200m in 1975/76; with the bulk of the subsidygoing t(j metropolitan areas.    As is shown in Chapter 7,  local;.ja:jS(ji.ger railway services have oeen subsidised even more heavily,with much of the benefit going to the better-off members of thecommuni ty.6.6    Present forecasts indicate that the growth of car ownership willcontinue  for the rest of the cenliry.    However rapid th.t growth,  therewiil  regain a vry substantial number who are dependent on publictr.i:;port for freedom of movement, among them the poorer sections oftee coiriMurity and the disabled-ivautaged.    To meet their needs  there  will need  to be a combination of different measures and policies.    -iomea. nrcaches are discussed in the  following paragraphs.
-^.6a    In rural areas about 70  of households have cars, and tht- uf uctQft bus patronage has been severe.   Seivices have had to be withdrawn^d   rowing numbers no longer have access to conventional public transport.   Liany people, even in car-owning households, have no curavailable to meet their day-to-day needs.   Kew ways of meeting tteirweeds through unconventional forms of se. vice have been, and arebeing, tried out;   but more will have to be done.   The Government having:alrL&apos;ady announced their intention to promote a number of experimental^transport schemes to test out what can be done to help ruralcommunities.   Legislation is also proposed to enable modest relaxationQf the bus licensing system to be tried in specific areas.r*.6B.    In course of tiwu it may be sensible in some areas - especiallyin the country - to substitute good bus service for iieaviiysubsidised rail services.    The former would be cheaper, even thoughIhty would still have to be maintained with grants.    Previousattempts to provide bus alternatives h ;ve often not succeeded becausePatronage has declined.    It would be necessary to ^ive some assurance^at the new services would be fitted ii,to a stable pat Urn of localW3 5i;rvicbs designed to m*et local m^ds rather than simpiy followt ;e route of the railway.    The aim would bt: to provide a betterPublic Xrm sport seivic--, better adapted to the needs of the co. uut-ity^ with less cost to iublic subsidy,  before closure of the rail8ervices was allowed to go ahead.6 C.     In urban are-^s    the uaiu need is for re Liable survic-s - vt-n  -1*te Cost of lower theoretical fr qencies than at present.    Local^thoritios mu^t help bus^s to operate reliably and eoono icallyih the face of competing demands for road space.   Comprehensive^a3urea of traffic man.,,-merit (see paras 6.25 to 6.38) should givePl&apos;oper priority for the mov ment of buses and for restraining privatemovements through controls over parking.   Some new ventures have^efen ^ urtt being tried in urban aruea with novel forms of transport8Uch as dial-a-bus.

6.7   Bua Licensing.      In due course the case for more general changesin the licensing code will have to be examined in the iight of theresults of these experiments.   The current bus licensing system was originally designed to safeguard the regular and safe operation ofthe general network of bus transport.   The system limits the competititepressures wi thin th e bus inducj try and af fords 3ome financial pro tec t i onto bus operators.    Though it does not stop applications to start new3i.*rviceu, many obnervers argue that the present system inhibitsinnovation and change since,  in practice,  it is difficult for otherthan established operators to obtain road service licences,    ilut a      *Policy of unbridled competition might  &quot;put many co: i-^ntional stareRerviofts out of business; any services provided would have togive yome guarantee of continuity,    Moreover,  in making   any changesin the pre fient ay stem,  it would be essential to preucrvw high  standardsQf vehicle maintenance and good working conditions which are a concernQf government, unions and man igement.    Nevertheless,  it is in everyone&apos;^^nteru^ts that licensing arrangements should not prevent  the gradual;*dju;jtment Qf public transport to the changing need  of us^rs.6.8   Bus Suosidies.     Subsidies are a major instrument available  toc^ntr;il and  local government.    The (Jovermaunt recognise    th&apos;it continuirgfinancial as^v-jtance will, be necessary for bus services.    what the  leveldistribution should be are among the key questions raised, in thisConsultation.f&apos;&apos;3   Chapter 5 ban shown that indiscriminate subsidies are not an effective way of meeting environmental and social objectives.    InPractice, general subsidies to fares do not reduce congestion becausethey attract few car drivers to uae buses:    fare savings cannot offsettn** time aaving and convenience of using a car.

Paper 1.    Statistical Trends and Forecasts.
6.10   The general principles on which selective subsidies would bejustified have been described in the previous chapter.    Firstly,  inmany areas an adequate network of bus ti transport cannot be maintainedwithout some form of selective financial support.    Such help is most likely to be needed in ru, al areas; but even in some urban areasparticular social or transport requirements might also warrantspecific subsidies.    In last y^ars&apos; allocation of Transport Uupple-mentary Grant in England and -Vales    the Government gave priority tosupporting proposals for maintaining minimum levels of service,especially outside  the conurbations; and it is proposed to continuethe same priority in future years.    In Scotland, similarly,  an increasing proportion of assistance i3 being paid in support of themaintenance of basic services.b.ll   Second,  limited subsidies may be required to stimulate experi-mentation and innovation.    The decline of patronage for conventionalbus services has underlined the need for more experiments with novelforms of public transport that can better meet the changing needs ofthost; still reliant on it.    In some cases, methods of operation,closer in convenience and speed to the car,  may De capable ofdevelopment at an acceptable cost.    In others  the  effort will oedirected  towards seeking cheaper methods of operation.6.12   Concessionary fares.      Concession ry faivs schemes for well-defined groups of vulnerable people,  such as the elderly,  blind and disabled, are well justified.    Their importance is reinforced Dy the rising cost of fares inherent in a   policy of reducing the ure3.ntgeneral subsidies wnich will b ar hardest an such groups who are lea!able to look aft r themselves.&apos;i.lj    Local authorities were given the general discretionary  power inthe Transport Act 1963 to arrange and  finance  travel concessions onbuses for elderly,  blind and disabled people.    The use of this power has varied  from one area to another,  and  the result is a patchwork ofschemes with a wide range of benefits and costs.    All Jiie tropoli tancounties in r-england and Wales,  and  the Greater London Council,  haveconcusslonary fare schemes (supplemented in some cases by schemesoperated by metropolitan district councils) but in some 60 out of thejjj non-m tropolitan district council areas no scheme operates   at
either county or district level.    The wide disparities in the provisionof farts concessions between one local authority and another awemunfair to many of those who are statutorily eligible for concessions,but whose local authority ha3 decided not to provide them,  or toprovide only relatively modest schemes.    Hot only i3 tVc presentsomewhat haphazard arrangement sometimes unsatisfactory from a socialpoint of view, but there is also the dager that some schemes are not cod value for money.6.14   Moreover,  the Government have to ensure that concessionary fares&apos;can be accommodated within the severe constraints on public expenditure.The total expen iture by local authorities in England and Wales onconcessionary fires his more than doubled since lfJ73/4 to an estimated 55m in 1966/7 (at 1975 survey prices).    The Government have had no option but tochecn this trend.    For this reaaon the Department&apos;sCircular to local authorities on the Hate Support Grant Settlera&amp;otfor 1976/77 said that theie will be little or no room for the extensionor improvement of existing concessionary fare schemes and authorities were a3ked to reconsider concessions at peak hours which, if b,ses areanyway working to capacity, may add to the cost of services as a whole.^-15   There is an urgent need to obtain the maximum social benefit from^aourcea expe-extended on concessionary fares.    As s first step a jointworking party with local government associations is being set up to&quot;lake a quick examin tion of current practice in order to provide thebasis for further discussions to achieve this objective.6.16   The responsibility for deciding how these principles for subsidyean best be appLied in each community to promote these objectives   mustlocal.    The Government will aim to provide local authorities and  thebus industry with a firm prospect of stability in the finance availablefor laubsidy in order to allow proper planning.    As Chapter 2indicates,  the Gov rnment will review the allocations of public expenditure within the total available for transport up to 1979/80following the consultation, and it may well be necessary to increasethe hubs provided for bus subsidy to accommodate an adequate level of;1,-lective support.    But that could only be done by making unpalata.uleEductions in other areas of transport expenditure.
6.17   New Bua Grants.     As part of ita review of subsidies theGovernment arealso considering the future of new bus grant.    Atfor stage operation provided they meet prescribed technical standards.Grant is expected to amount to about  40m in the current year.    Onemain purpose of the grant was to promote the wider use of one-manoperation.    By the time the powers to pay the grant expire in 1930,a good deal of progress will have been made towards this objective andthe Government is considering,  subject to the consultations which will now t,tke place, whether it should be terminated then or at some later date.    Should a decision be tiken in favour of termination,  this wouldbf phased ov-r a period so as to minimise any distasting effect on thedemand for new ou3es6.18   School Tr ivel.      Finally it is important to consider thetransport requirements of children travelling to school along withthose of other travellers so that the provision made represents thebest use of resources.    This is especially necessary at a time whenthe cost of transporting school children is rising and the demand fortravel at peak periods has resulted in British hail and bua operatorsquestioning the commercial justification for concessionary schemesduring  the period when cants are at  their highest.    The general policy on charges for travel to school  is under review following the issue ofa consultation document by the Department of Education and Science,6.IS   Urban Transport Banning.    The approach to urban transportplanning ha.j changed fundamentally since  the Buchanan Report and the transportation studies of the early 1960s.    Then transportationplanning was too often simply highway planning writ ldrge.    It was assumed that the demand for unrestricted ctr use for a period of15  to 20 years a lead could be met without unrealistic calls on financi&apos;resources or detrimental effects.    But urban road building ha:-; ,.roved,far tiiore expensive and  f-.ir more disruptive  than  foreseen.

Above all,   the environmental  costs of any attemptto cater for unrestricted urban traffic growth are now much betterappreciated.    The blight and disruption engendered by driving majorhighways through established com..unities have rightly become r^tt^rs 0serious public concern; indeed they have bteome unacceptable.present the Government make    grants of 50$ of the coat of new buses
&apos;v Urban  tr.muport planning is now a comprehensive procesy censider-ing movement as a whole:    transport in all forms is inter-related andchanging one form affects all others.    It follows that each area mustbe considered as a unity,  and  that no one policy will provide a uniquesolution fbr its problems.    The process must start with a realisticrecognition of the resources likely to be available, of current problems and their possible solutions.    It must make the best use ofall -jxistin^ infrastructure and means of transport, with particularconcern for the role of public transport and the travel requirementsof the disadvantaged.&quot;,?1    Like transport planning as a whole, urban planning must be concerned with the cost of movement,  the contribution which efficientmovement of people and good3 can make to the economy, and the distribu-tion of the benefits of movement.    These aspects are discussed inother chapters.    In the urban context, environmental factors are,however,  particularly important.    Where there is heavy traffic on roads and in areas not designed for it,  the effects of noise,  fumesand visual intrusion can make lift? intolerable.    It must be a specialConcern for urban  transport planners to orotect residential areas from through traffic,  to design pedestrian areas which allow andenhance the pleasures of walking,  strolling and shopping whilePermitting access for deliveries to shops and by public transport,  toprevent heavy lorries  from ureas where  their intrusion is unacceptaDie.If such measures require controls and even restraint of particularhinda of movement,  tneir costs may have  to be recognised and accepted.6.22   Traffic Management,    leaking the trade at use of what already existsnnvans, essentially, comprehensive traffic management.    The conflict between the transport ne--ds of local residents and through traffic,  ofprivate enrs, buses, commercial vehicles, motorcyclists, cyclists and pr^dfiitrians can ue resolved only by compromise.    Comprehensive trafficmHnugement is not   ju:.it a technique for improving the capacity of ther&quot;ud i-tyuten;    it is di ngned  to give priority to particular us .rs inParticular places,  to promote road safety and to steer traffic away^oig onviroj.ini ntal ly sensitive areas.
6.2i    The Government already collaborate    in many experimental trafficra nagement projects.   Current activity includes a scheme in Nottingham -designed to ease morning peak congestion and help public transport bymetering traffic through dgnal control points which buses are allowedto bypass;   the development of specific traffic management measures in Bath do ;signed to reduce traffic pressure on the historic centre;  theevaluation of a scheme in York designed to achieve similar objectives.In London, Glasgow, Liverpool,  Leicester, Wolverhamnton, Coventry andLottingham Urban Traffic Control systems consisting of computer&apos; inked signa]s have been or are-    being installed.    -Juch systems reducedelays to all traffic a3 well as giving priority to buses when required.&apos;-.,24    The control of h-avy lorries in the interests of amenity is partof local  traffic management.    The proposed national system of lorryioutes will provide a framework for local plans.    Local authoritieswi Li need  to concentrate  their efforts on keeping heavy lorries away from those areas where congestion and environmental damage is causedand e i    &apos; i? w ih it well located parking places are available.h.?5    Bus Priorities.      Good access by buses and the chance for therato circulate fre-&apos;ly in central areas with minimal delays and servicedisruption should be a major aim of traffic management.    Bus lanes,bus-only streets,  bus penetration into pedestrian areas,  freedom to make mov ments at junctions denied to ott^r traffic,  and busac tuated signals can all  provide  bene fit  in specific si taatLons e achof which needs  to be separately approached.    Congestion usuallyaffects only part of a bus mute, and is usually only one of the factors behind service delays:    Other factors are often as  important,ataff shor .ages (a 25% shortage in drivers in mid-1974  for LTL servicedfor example) mvi delays in delivery of spare parts and new buseslargely resulting from dislocation in double deck bus production in earlier years have also disrupted services.     decause of pastdislocations in double deck bus production there is till a backloguT about 1000 orders at a time when annual demand approaches theproduction capacity of auout 22 )0 vehicles.
6,26   The Government haw oacked experiments designed to test juspriority measures and develop innovatory bus services and will continueto do so.    In the Bus Demonstmtion Programme the results of selectedbus priority scheme a (in London, Heading, Manchester, Derby and southampton) and the use of novel bus services (in Leeds and inerseyaide)were systematically assessed and publicity given to the results so that other authorities and operators can learn from this experience whenpromoting schemes in their own areas.    The Programme has shown thatwell-designed bus priority measures and novel types of bus service can,achieve worthwhile results, especially where they are planned in close co-operation between the transport and planning departments of localauthorities, bus operators and police.6.27   Staggered Working Hours.    One way of reducing peak demands on public transport and reducing congestion would be to adopt staggeredworking hours.    In some areas relatively minor changes to hours ofworking can improve local travel conditions,    tfhile the possibility of introducing such schemes,  and the benefits to be obtained from them,will vary from place to place and with the type of employment involved,the general concept deserves every encouragement.    After an initialslow start there is evidence that the practice of working flexiblehours ia spreading more rapidly in the UK and abroad.    fhe Departuontof employment fitis^ produced a manual de scribing the main methods offlexible working- which commended to local authorities and to employersand unions in the public and orivite sector.6.28   Traffic Restraint.    In the past ton years, peak-hour trafficspeeds have risen, but increased traffic levels now affect wider arf^for linger periods.    In London,  for example,  there lias b en an increase*n the number of private car commuter journeys  to  the centre arid yetaverage jYi,. r\n have risen slightly.    Traffic mangerafnt,  improved c tr,Jnd driver performance, and the increased use of side streets have allcontributed  to maintaining traffic speeds but at some expense  to  theSfin-rrtl  environment.    There  is some ( vidence  that  the direct costs ofGonge;ition have been nthr exaggerated in the past^&quot;^.    But in some(2)Changing Patterns of Working Hours. DK Manpower Paper No Ij.

urban areas traffic restraint may be essential for achieving public     jtransport priorities,  freeing residential areas from traffic noiseand vibration, creating pedestrian streets, and ensuring safe andspeedy traffic movement.6.29   HestJaint is essentially a positive measure to enable local planning and transport objectives to be attained which may bepossible only when the demand for road space is ri duced.    While the congestion itself is at present limited in extent and duration inmost towns,  it has a cost - in delay, in wasted energy, inenvironmentaL pollution which may be expected to grow.    niea*ure3 todeal with future congestion could be extremely costly, especially if they involved road or car park construction.    Restraint can be anessential component of the package of measures needed in some urban areas to provide  for continued movement at a cost which is acceptablein monetary and environmental terms.    Traffic restraint is fundament-ally related to public transport.    For one thing, restraint may onlybe possible where there is an acceptable public transport alternative to car use.    For another, restraint policies a:e likely to increasedemand for buses.in the peaks, when operation is most expensive,  andto reduce off-peak demand.    (This raises the question whetheroperators should move to fares systems which reflect the difference in costs between peak and off-peak).6.JO    For some time to come parking control will in most areas reiainthe best means   of achieving restraint.    More elaborate systems, suchas road pricing and supplementary licensing, are too complex and tooexpensive to be justifable for most cities, at least in the next deca*Gordon systems may be right in some places, but tollbooths and  the associated qui-ues of traffic take up road space.    Other restraintuy 3 turns,  such as Nottingham * s zone and collar,  are  worth investigate011elsewhere, perhaps initially on an experimental basis.6.31    In some areas restraint through parking control will requirecontrol over charges, bourn of operation and the number of spaces.In many urban areas parking charges are far too low;  they should be revised, especially on all-day parking by computers, and meter charsshould be adjusted in line with inflation.    There is no justification
for subsidising public off-street parking whether from rates or taxes.At the very least, revenue from charges should ia^et not only currentoperating costs, but also provide a proper return on capital (thoughspecial arrangements may have to be made for park arid, ride).    Despiterecent increases in charges in many ar;as,  some local authority carParks still operate at a loss.    Departments will be discussing withthe local authorities concerned the steps they propose to take to remedy this stage of affairs,n.j2   LocaL authorities, however, have no powers to control privately   &apos;operated public oar parks, or arivate non-residential parking (eg.  inoffices,  factories, shops and other business premises).    These&quot;Ce^unt for more  than half the parking space in many cities,    Londonamong them.    Operators of such parking are liable on.y fr-r &apos; or? - . jjjl&quot;ates:    there is no power to make them contribute to the social co3tscaus-d by the traffic their existence has created,    measures tocontrol parking of this kind would be essential to a policy oftighter restraint,  but would raise difficult problems.    The mainPossibilities - the compulsory reduction of spaces or some form of tax - will be analysed in a separate consultation document to bePublished shortly.k*3j   The achievement of effective and equitable urban car restraint&quot;ill remain difficult as long as the private use of business cars is3o favourable financially.    As mentioned in Chapter 5(  the questionbe looked at only on a national basis.^*34   Local roads.    Road building is not the only -vay, and usuallyriQt the best way,  to tackle- urban traffic problems.    Earlier urbanroad plans were conceived on much too grandiose a scale; and theGovernment now plan    (as recommended by the Jelect Committee onl,expenditure) a major run-down to this field.    By 1979/80,    spending on^ocal road construction should be more  than a tnird below the averageror 1970/75.fM5   Road building is understandably unpopular with those whose livesor homes may be directly affected, however hard the attempts to mitigate th^ effects.    In future, the emphasis with urban road works will be on safety, and on making the u- st use of existing roads.    Hew
construction or improvement will generally be linked to traffic management,  the improvement of public transport or environmental gains.6.36    The benefit of many new and improved rurul roads, such a3 reliefroads in country towns and bypasses of villages jre enjoyed as much by those who live and work in the areas as by transport users.    road schemes of this nature should remain of considerable importance.6.37   A continuing but much reduced programme of new roads and improve-(iicntH must therefore- continue, both inside and outside  towns.    Localauthorities will have to decide which schemes deserve priority in thelight of the  Limited resources and in the context of the comprehensiveapproach in their Transport Policies and Programmes,It is also planned that maintenance expenditure on local roadsshould be reduced to a point where most authorities will have littlemoney to spare for amenity maintenance,    aiding quality, especially on the les3 heavily used roads, wiLl suffer and tie maintenanceuf footpaths is also likely to be reduced.    This is a price that willhave to be paid to achieve other transport priorities,6.J9   New Technology.    During the past decade there have been variousstudies of the contribution new technology can make to transport.Substantial improvements are same time 3 possible,    British Hail&apos;s advarC^passenger train for example would make a major impact on int.r-cityjourneys by raiL,    Research into pneumatic pipelines holds prospects for the conveyance of 3uch mat.rials as aggregates and coal in bulk.However, new transport tectnology i3 costly,  takes years to develop, ^lus to be adopted on a scale sufficient to offset the development cos*a*S.40   Until recntLy some have argued  that the problems of urbantransport could  be re-solved by capital intensive  solutions such ascabtrack or minitraiii.    The Department made a detailed system study ofthe  Latter, which would have employed small electrically poweredcomputer controLied driverless vehicles running on segregated trackbelow or -ibove street level.    As part of the evalu ,tion, a study wasmade of a possible public demonstration in Sheffield.    In the event,pressures on public expenditure, some doubts about the appearance of
the system in Sheffield and about outstanding technical issues led to a* decision not to proceed, at least for the foreseeable future.    A numberof similar systems are being studied and developed in various countries,but there are few signs of a breakthrough which would provide a serious economic alternative to the tried and tested systems of car, bus,  tramand train.    ^ven major projects such as Tyne and tfear&apos;s rapid transitsystems involve the use of existing infrastructure and technology wsic ,by and  Large,  is already tried and tested in operation in the UK or elsewhere.f&apos;.41    Research in  this country is therefore  being concentrated onimprovements  ho existing infra H,rucutre - such as the rapid transitimprovement programme being carried out in conjunction with london transport and British Kail.    Nevertheless there are projects which can()n\y be tackled in the long term.    For example, res jrch into sodiumsul hur batt-Ties or into various kinds of electrically powered vehicfes,Gould have  long term implications for alternative energy sources.    Orwork on linear motors might conceivably open the possibiiit,/ of urbanlight railways propel.ed by linear motors and supported magnetically,but the research problems are formidable.b.42   Railways into HoadsV     A recent study^ on the case forconverting rail formations into busways concluded th.it the buildingQf general-purpose roads on rail formations would generally bebeneficial.    This conclusion is based however on dttailed costings ande!&apos;timates of benefits on which the Government have a number ofreaerv i tions.    For example  the construction costs seem to have  been substantially under-estimated and the proposed  tieatment of railu*&apos;idges, embankment and clearances for double-deck bus operation seem*o be especially questionable.    There are also doubts about the time&quot;avings claimed and about the traffic flows which would be attracted*o the new roads.

ORGANISATION AND CO-OWDTITATION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT.6.45.      Much transport by its nature cannot he limited by administrative boundaries.   Successfulprovision of local trans-port depends heavily on co-ordination between local government,the nationalised industries, municipal transport operators andother bodies concerned.   The^e is also the role of the traffic commissioners to be considered.   Responsibility for transportplanning ani co-ord; nat ion in England and -ales-^lies with themetropolitan and shire county councils and the GLC.    The influence of central government is now mainly exercised through the co-ordination of annual Transport Policies and Programmes, which havebeen in operation for the last two years.    Th^re is scope forfurther development of co-ordinntion, particularly with regard to technical co-ordination such as the integration of train and bustimetables, through the present arrangements.    liut it may benecessarv to go further.6.44.   Public..Transport in London.    In and around London british railways make a particularly important contribution to theprovision of public transport facilities, complementing the busan^ un7eTirround services of the London Transport Executive end thebus services provided by the transport operators in the rest of the region.    Tho London Rail Study group, which reported last year,concluded that with two operating bodies (BR and LT) each answerable to a sepamte political authority (the Department of the iinviron-ment any th^ Greater London Council), there was a risk that theymi^ht pursue incompatible policies on railway investment and fares.Th^ Groim th^refOT*p recommended the four bodies to come together in n standing advisory committee, which would help them to co-ordinate their policies on these subjects.   The need for such co-cdinatin&quot;- arrangements is emphasised by the constraints on public expenditure that h^ve developed since the London Rail Study was completed.    Arrangements &quot;ire in hand for setting up an advisory-committee on thf lines recommended, and the extension of itsremit to include London Transport&apos;s bus operations needs to beconsidered.(rO    Th&quot; &quot;^st of this chapter does ^ot apply to &quot;cotlond, whichSr. d^alt; with separately in f-hapter 12.
6.4-5*     Bus services.    In England and Wales the stape carriagebus industry, outside London, is now divided into three mainpublic nectors.    Local authorities&apos; bus services in the sixmetropolitan counties are opDrated by the Passenger TransoortExecutives who are also jointly responsible with the metropolitancounty councils for nlanninp; a properly integrated and efficientsystem of Dublic transport (including passenger transport bv rail&apos;to meet the needs of their areas.    In the shire counties provision is split between municipal operations run by 50 district councilsan-1 the National Bus Conpany. which also operates in certain areaswithin metropolitan counties.    The private sector accounts for only       of vehicle miles on starve carriage services.    The -3C is organised into 30 companies which provide local and inter-citybus sor-vices in most counties in finp;lvnd and VJales, includingscne sor-Lcpr. into metropolitan counties and into the areas ofthe district council undertakings.6.^6.    The present pattern of local authorities and bus operatorsleads to some conflicts of Lnternst.    For ins&apos;^nc^, some PTEsh-&quot;ve assumed responsibility for the former TfBC ooerations ir. their areas:    but there remains pressure froTi other metropolitancounties and their PTKs to take over \&apos;BC one-nations in their areas also.

^ILENTIALCHAPTER 7BRITISH RAILWAYSThe invention of the railway hag had the most profound effectsnot only on all modern economies, but also on our culture and our way0f life,    &quot;Since railways came into existence&quot;, wrote Marcel Proust,&quot;thae necessity of not missing the train has taught us to take accountMinutes whereas among the ancient Romans, who had not only a morecUr3ory science of astronomy but had leas hurried lives, the notion^ of minutes but even of fixed hours barely existed.&quot;-Vhile opinions will differ as to the virtues of this more frene-atylc of life, no one will challenge the important role which theftUways play in our national life, even though it is now considerablyfinished, nor the appeal A-hich they have for the British public.^ this cannot absolve us from the need to examine in the mostporous fashion the proper function of the Railways in a modern^^sport system.-3.    n.Jince the early 1950s the railways have experienced successiveltlahcial crises and been rescued by successive subventions from theThere has been policy review after policy review:   theecking Report, the Railway Policy Review of 1967 and latterly the^3 Review.   All have failed to provide a stable financial frameworkCfiis important national asset.Why is this?   First, there is the growth of road competition.e raiiways have found it impossible to compete over the whole fieldn the private car and lorry and other form3 of public transport.&amp;hey have had to maintain a larger infrastructure and to provide*i-ces over and above those which users were ready to pay for.
7.5.      Secondly, the rapid inflation of recent years has particularly affected the railways because of their highly labour intensive opera-tions.    Costs have risen much faster than revenue, particularly duringthe period when fares were held down as part of the counter-inflationpolicy from midr-1971 until early 1974.   Rail fares rose less than theRPI, while railwaymen&apos;s wages were increased considerably in 1974 and1975.    There were also substantial rises in the cost of energy andother resources.7.6.     The financial effects of these divergent trends have been severerDespite current and capital subsidies of over  3,000 m. during thelast 20 years, the railways require a subsidy which has risen from 75 m. in 1970 to over  500 m. in 1975 (out-turn prices).7.7.     Faced with t&apos;iis ranid growth in the rate of loss, the Governmenthave already taken short term measures to limit the call on public expenditure.    They decided last year that- rail passenger grants for 1976 would be kept (in real terms) within the 1975 figure;-*       ceilings would be set for the longer-tern for thetotal level of support and borrowing within -which BritishRail would have to manage the railways;- the rail freight strategy review which had beenBritishset in hand by4feil should aim at eliminating assoon as possible the freight losses of  70 m.which had emerged in 1975.recent7.8.     Since then, the/public Expenditure tfhite Paper K  J hasset new ceilings for railway subsidy and investment.    These envisagethat support and investment will both continue at the historicallyhigh levels reached in 1975.7,9.     British Rail have already found it necessary to take unpopularmeasures to implement the Government&apos;a short-term decisions.Cl) cyril\ 6393 ^
In 1975 they- increased fares and charges by over 50^;- cut the level of 30ine under-used services -e.g. weekends, Boxing Day;- made significant manpower economies, including a virtual cessation of recruitment in some areas,amounting to a saving of about 7,000 staff in thelast nine months of 1975;- held back some investment projects.^*10.   Further economies of this type will be necessary to meet thefinancial ceilings referred to earlier, but it is important thatthey should be related to longer term plans for the railways.    despite the recent economies, subsidies to the Railways in 1976/77 will takeabout two-thirds of the total subsidy available for inland surfaceBritishtransport./Rail investment will amount to some  260 m,:   this con-3titutes about 25^ of total public investment in surface transport,and is spent on a network of 11,300 mile (compared with over 200,000^iles of road) which carries about 7% of passenger movement and 18 Qf freight movement.&apos;H.    This is a 1 ot of money,    *Ve must therefore ask first whether weare getting proper value for it in transport terms, and then whetherit is helping to achieve the other objectives defined in Chapter 3.And we mu3t a3k these questions in the light of previous conclusions^hat indiscriminate Gubsidies are seldom justified on welfare groundswhii   the environmental argument for special support for rail mustbe, treated with caution.*HE MAIN RAILWAY ACTIVITIESThe railway is a complex mixture of a number of quite differentactivities.   Some are highly efficient and provide a vital nationalservice.     Others are of secondary importance.
7.13.   First, freight anil parcels:   railways are at their &quot;best in such activities as bulk movement of coal and trainloads to power stations.For wagonload or short distance traffic rail is less suitable - thereare for example 800,000 shops and factories but only 2,000 freightand parcels access points.   Nevertheless, about 18$ of freight traffic goes by rail.7.14.    Second, Inter-City;    these are passenger services between maintowns and cities.   They account for about 43^ of rail passengermileage - about 250,000 passenger journeys a day.    There have beengreat improvements in speed and frequency over the past decade, andthese will continue.    The 125 m,p,h. High Speed Diesel Train is being introduced  on the route from London to Bristol and South Wales, andthe Government have approved the Board&apos;s proposals for introducing iton the East Coast Main Line.   Eventually the Advanced Passenger Traiwwill enable still faster services to be operated.7.15.    Third, London and South-East:    this is the major commuter net--vorV,, on which people make about one million journeys a day - 43^ 0^rail passenger mileage,   and 37^ of all commuters of Central London.Heavy morning and evening peaks require a lot of rolling stock ana acomplex infrastructure which is under-used at other times.7.1&apos;i.    The two remaining categories are of less importance nationallytthough they may bo very important locally.7.17.    Provincial commuter services form part of the conurbation trans-nort systems.    They carry only about 8^ of rail passenger mileage.Investment, fares and the level of services are controlled by theMetropolitan Counties in England and Strathclyde Region in Scotlandthrough their ^passenger Transport Executives (cTEs).7,l8.    Other provincial services comprise the general run of local andstopping passenger services outside PTE areas.    They carry 6$ of rai1passenger mileage,    llany of them are only lightly used.
&apos;&quot;19.    None of the above activities is at present profitable.    On a rough ana ready allocation of current railway costs and revenuesderived from estimates made by British &quot;Rail (which leave out of account over  100 m. of unallocated overhead costs) it would seem that:-- freight will require a subsidy estimated at  60 m.;- Inter-City earnings fall short of allocated costs byabout 5$,some  15 m. a year;- London and South-Oast services earnings fall short of allocated costs by about 10?*, some  80 m. a year;- Provincial commuter services will receive some  28 m.support via the PTTIs from the ratepayer and the taxpayer;- earnings from many of the other provincial services donot cover even their direct costs - in all their short-fall on allocated costs is well over  100 m.Rail;/ay objectives*20.    it follows from the diverse nature of these main activities andtheir widely different financial results that they should each be examined on their merits, with financial objectives beingaet for each of them,&apos;21.    But first it is helpful to discuss three factors which have a particularly important influence on railway operation and finance,^hese arc investment, manpower and pricing.InvestmentBritish^2.   For the time-being, the decision to stabilise/lfeilinvestment atResent levels should form a basic input to railway business planning.this level is lower than that envisaged in the 1973 Rail Tolicy Review.the 1973 programme wa3 criticised in the Socialist Commentary^6port.   Moreover, only a minimum proportion (about 4$)   was to be
devoted to the key sector of freight anti parcels.   The level nowproposed is still historically high.    It has risen in real ternsfrom  130 m. in 1969 to  260 m. now, a higher figure than in any year3ince 1965 (and one-third higher than proposed in the SocialistCommentary Report),    In our present economic circumstances we simplycannot afford a figure higher than this.7.23.   The Board are now considering with the Government the implications-tions of the reduction from the 1973 figure.   Difficult choices willhave to he made between a number of alternatives, e.g.:-- concentration on essential renewals - i.e, trackand signalling;- a selective approach to produce improvement;- limiting further electrification;- a less comfortable and slower service;slower introduction of HST and APT.7*24.    Only the Board have the detailed knowledge necessary to choose between the various relevant factors.   But it will be open to theGovernment in the light of the outcome of the present consultationsto give broad guidance between, for example, freight and Inter-City?or between manpower saving investment and higher quality rolling stock.   The aim will be to provide a better basis for an investment programme which will have more assurance of stability than in thepant.    It follows that there will also need to be rigorous observantof the iirocO&apos;&apos;uros for appraisal of individual projects to ensure th**they give a proper return, on the lines described in Chapter 5.Manpower and Productivity7,25. -Vageo and salaries account for more than two-thirds of the coS*of operating the railways. Improvements in productivity and the useof manpower are therefore vital to the railways&apos; financial health.
The key to success lies in the identification of those areas wherespecific tasks can be dispensed with, or where changes in workingPractice can improve productivity.   The recent introduction of cora-Puter control for wagon movement points the way forward.7.26.    There were significant manpower savings in the 1960s but these have slowed down markedly since 1970 as the following figures show:-	Railway Employees1963	476,5451964	439,5511965	399,0051966	365,0431967	338,7401968	318,0921969	268,970-  1970	253,395   -1971	250,7771972	242,4901973	234,9721974	228,5901975	234,2181976	230,972Brit ish Rail recognise the problem anu have plans for further savings which they will be discussing the the railway trades unions.*2*7.    The unions indeed have a crucial role and their co-operation is693ential in the long term interests of the industry.    British Rail^ave therefore invited them to discuss a large number of specific proposals for improving productivity over their whole range ofderation and administration, including train crews, station andaePot staff, track and signalling employees and of course office workers.28.   The renegotiation of agreements on manning and working practices&quot;ill require much good-will and a willingness to accept change in the wider national interest.   But the more that is achieved through higherpro4uctivity, the less need there will be for cuts in railway services0r higher fares. y
7,29.   There has been some argument about the relative efficiency ofBritish Kail and railways abroad, and about the respective outputs ofBritish and foreign railwaymen.   Some comparative statistics analys-ing performance on Western European and Japanese railways are annexe^to this Chapter.   Each railway has its own special characteristicsand markets, so that international comparisons can be misleading.   Butit certainly appears that there is room for a large improvement on british Hail.Fares Policy7.30,   After a period when they rose less than prices generally, railfares have doubled in the last two years.   This has led to the sug^e3&quot;tion that the railways are writing their own death warrant by pursuita policy of repeated fares increases:   that there is a spiral in whi0^higher fares produce less traffic which calls for yet further rises 111fares.   Some believe, therefore that the fares increases are self-defeating and that we have now reached the point where the rightsolution would be to reduce fares substantially, thereby attractingmore people to use the railways and increasing the Board&apos;s earnings&quot;7^31.    In fact, the recent fares increases have had remarkably little effect on the volume of traffic.   The Board estimate that there were about 2$ fewer passenger journeys last year than in 1974 despite therise of 50^ in fares during 1975.    On the other hand, the Board*earnings increased by an estimated  90 m, la3t year a3 a result ofthe action they have taken on fares;    and the increase made on 28thf&quot;arch this year is expected to add a further  30 m. to passengerearnings in 1976.7.32.    It is certainly true that at some point a further rise in fareswould actually worsen the Board&apos;3 financial position.   But that poiJ1&apos;that not yet been reached.
7.33.    In the present situation then, there is no alternative to some further increase in fares.    There can be no question of a general increase in Government subsidy for all the reasons analysed in chapter 3.   While as for the idea that reducing fares would increaserevenue, this is not a realistic possibility.    If fares were reducedby 25^, an increase in traffic of a third would be needed simply to recover the lost revenue, let alone increase the Board&apos;s earnings.And a 50^ fares reduction would require the volume of passenger traffic to double to recoup the lost revenue.    There is no evidencethat a general reduction in fares of this order would be successful in attracting sufficient passengers to avoid increasing the Railways&apos;looses and hence adding to the subsidy required.    Moreover, thePresent rolling stock and infrastructure would not be adequate to cope with a substantial increase in traffic during the peak period.7*34.   Reduced fares outside the peak periods are another matter.    Infact, nearly half the passengers on British Rail who db not buy season tickets already travel at less than full fare through the Board*sreduced fares policy for off-peak journeys.   The &quot;Book Ahead EconomyReturn&quot; for example, offers travel at half the ordinary fare forjourneys made mid-week provided the ticket is bought three weeks inadvance.    &quot;Pensioners and students can also travel at half farethrough special schemes.7.35.   This pricing down is justifiable where, for example, it increases the off-neak use made of - and the community^ benefit from - the extensive infrastructure and rolling stock which is needed to meetthe demands of peak-feriod travellers.7*36.    Even the rail commuter, whose needs call for so much expensiveequipment for just a few hours in the morning and evening, obtains asubstantial discount by buying season tickets.    After the recent fares
increases, season ticket holders are still paying only about 3 pencea mile to be carried regularly in all weathers to and from their tvorfc*7.37.   The conclusions to be drawn are- the stage has not been reached when further faresincreases would worsen the Board*s financial position;higher subsidies could be paid only at the expense ofother vital programmes and would not be sociallyjustified;a general reduction in fares would not increase the&quot;Board&apos;3 earnings.    It would, on the contrary, lowerthem, whilst increasing the cost of services inorder to meet higher demand, and thus add to thesubsidy required;- but reductions to encourage off-peak travel are justified and 3hould continue to be offered,7.38.    ffe now turn to discuss detailed policies for each of the mainbusinesses of British Rail.The Rail Freight Business7.39.    Rail freight is (ji3cussert in Chapter 8 as part of the total com&quot;complex of freight issues.    Thi.3 brings out the considerable assistance which rail freight already receives from the fact that the infrastruc-ture it shares with passenger services is mainly financed through tberail passenger grant.    It also brings out the scope for selectivesubsidies such as the grants for encouraging traffic between privatesidings.    But it rules out general subsidies and advocates the purs^*of viability for all modes of freight operation.The Intor-City Business7.40*   The Board market their Inter-City services as an integrated ne*&quot;*work.   These services operate almost entirely over the core of therailway network and are the rail passenger operations which are bestplaced to meet competition from other modes and private transport.
7.41.    Inter-City traffic has grown consistently over the last 10 yearsand further growth is forecast.    With Government encouragement the underlying objectives have been to provide faster, more frequent andmore reliable services.7.42.    This policy has resulted in Inter-City covering its direct costs and contributing substantially to system costs, though at presentfalling some way short of full viability (estimated  15 m. shortfallon allocated costs).    Given the further investruck necessary to sus-tain a high quality service, the Board predict a growth in ne trevenue and are proposing to continue Inter-City on much the pretientpattern.    There will be further operational improvements such as theintroduction of the High Speed Diesel Train which has been authorised for the &quot;ast Coast Main Line and the London/Bristol/South .7alesservice.7.43.    As Inter-City comprises the Board&apos;s most profitable passengerbusiness,  it is not an area where closures are likely to be a signifi-c-ant source of savings.    The main scope for economy lies instead inadapting the pattern of services to match demand more closely.    some action or. these linos has been taken.7.44.    It will bo for the Board to examine the trade-off between higherfares and lower service provision.    Over the last year or so theyhave increased Inter-City fares by an average ofJanuary 1975        -   12^Kay 1975 -   1^September 1975     -   15$Tlarch 1976 -   VlfRespite these substantial increases, there has been a growth of net revenue.   T^ven the third increase in 1975, while lead-ing to &amp;. drop in volume,  increased net revenue by about 7&apos;/&apos;.    It seems that there remains scope for real increases in Inter-City fares.
7.45.    The 3ocial effects of a high fares policy are of less importancein thi3 sector than in others.   Business travel accounts for about35^ of revenue, while most regular users are from the higher income groups.   Moreover, many of the rest of the journeys are for leisurepurposes,    Thile there is also a need for family duty travel concernedwith funerals, weddings and illness, there is no strong case forsubsidising these on welfare grounds, particularly when express bus services are generally available as an alternative,7.46,.    It is therefore suggested that the Board should pursue a commer-cial policy for Inter-City with the aim by 1981 of covering all allo-cated costs, and in addition, meeting some part of residual unallo-cated costs.    It will of course be necessary to monitor carefully theresults of price increases to ensure that they produce worthwhileincreases in revenue.London and the Southeast (LSB)7.47.   This is the third major activity of the Board which has an assure long-term future.    Only a handful of services are under-used to a V0^where closure is conceivable;   and savings from closing them would he3mall.    The vast majority of the services provide an indispensableelement in the life of London and the surrounding area;   but subsidi-e5go more to the better-off in this sector of the railway business tha^in any other.7,48.    The primary objective must therefore be to maintain and adaptfiis network to fulfil its present role while reducing its shortfall in recovering allocated co3ts.7.49,   The main characteristic of the business is the heavy morning aJl0&quot;evening peak, which in effect determines the level of rolling stockand infrastructure.   Both of these will require extensive renewalextending into the 1980s and beyond.    This adds to the need for
increasing net revenue.    Some savings can be effected by cuttingcost3, through reductions in services, and manpower economies;    butthe main instrument must bo a combination of fiscal and pricing policy.    To eliminate subsidy for commuter travel altogether, fareswould need to increase very steeply.   A more limited objective ofcontaining the subsidy would still moan considerable increases inpa3SGn&apos;er fares.   &quot;But if the price is not paid by the rail commuter,,it falls on taxpayers at large, some of whom hardly ever use therailways, let alone for travel to work.7,50.    There are in fact two main types of commuter service in the3outh-&quot;ast.   The Outer Suburban services, such as those to Brightonor Tunbridge &apos;&apos;/ella, are more comparable to Inter-City in operatingfaster services comparatively profitably over long distances.    the inner Suburban services, such as those to Bromley or Ilford are moreakin to London Transport or PTE services.    They have no prospect ofviability, as far as can be seen.7*51.    It is therefore proposed to make a different approach to settingfinancial objectives for these two groups of services.7.52.    For the Outer Suburban Service, it is suggested that BritishRail should aim at meeting full allocated costs by 1981.    The time-scale envisaged for this financial improvement is the same a3 forInter-City, so allowing a lengthy transitional period to enableadjustments to be made where necessary in working habits.7*53,   For the Inner Suburban Services the aim should be to containfin/, if possible reduce, Government support, through raoro effectiveintegration of bus, Underground and surface rail services in greater london.    This will require a much closer partnership between government, the Greater London Council and the transport operators,^&apos;54,    The intention ha.3 been to set up a new London Rail Advisorycormittee to keep London commuter rail services under review, and to
advise on the co-ordination of fares policy an-&quot;  investment progranr-S3,But this may not go far enough.    For example,   vhat use should the C-l^be expected to make of their powers to su^-ort British Rp.il services?And how much sco^e is thorn for closer co-ordination between theoperations of British Rail end the London Transport &quot;xccufcivo, bothbus and rail.    The possibilities nc^^ to be reviewed, ^mi the propos^now Committee might he expected to study them in the light of the analysis of passenger transport in urban areas in Chapter G.Services Provided fn** the Passenger Transport &quot;dxneutivos7.55.    The  ruilw;iy\i provide services to meet tho requirements of thevetrooo&quot;1 it^n Counties in England and -Vales and they 3erve Greaterninsgow.    Tie1 faros end the frequency of the service are determinedby these authorities, who pay the subsidies to British Rail (althouS^a lergo element of then is coverea by Central government support).7.56,    Tho Government&apos;s approach is that the policy to be aJoptcd ineach locality should continue to bo .-i matter for each local authorityooncerncd  to consider,    The question is - should them be a ce&apos;lin on Government payments for th:is purpose, as is alreany the case forth&quot; mtional  rail passenger network?Other Passenger services.57.    About 6?&apos; of total passenger mileage is accounted for by passen e1&apos;services other than those discussed above.    Throughout the country,there are many which do not cover their direct costs end it is opento question whether they give value for money even after takingneeount of the social b mefit they confer.7.5C,    Tb&quot;fe is little scope for saving net eosts through further reductions in serving, nor -would  it make much iiipact to increasefares,  cinen revenue  is already only a fraction of total cost.    Onthe other hand, closing these services might bring no great saving
in relation to the to&apos;al level of subsidy in Vac short term, thoughtlio cost of renewal of assets would eventually be avoided.7.59.    Yet the users of these services are being very heavily subsidised,an! there nightbe cheaper ways of providing for the public transport needs in each area -for example, by linking bua or coach services with the railhead.There are advantages in examining alternatives to raying out largesuns for little used services.7.60.    The&apos; question is - would there be advantage if Government,together with local authorities and transport interests, now con-siderod  together whether a bettor integrated ami chopper public trans-port system could not be provided in some areas based on subsidisedbus services with an assured future in place of some local railcervices, with the buses inter-linkcd with the remaining railservices?IMPLEMENTATION7.el. These proposals should, of course, be viewed in the context ofthe other proposals for an integrated transport policy discussed inthis doeunent,  including -- increases in the taxation of heavy lorries- charging cars more for parking,  restricting non-residentialprivate marking taxing private use of business cars;- new initiatives on rural bus transport, with provision fortradin^-off poor value rail services for better bus services;- more Government grant for private sidings to assist railBritish.freight   md  temporary grants to assist botb/Kail and NFCwhile in deficit;- a lengthy transitional period, of 5 years for -hasing out railconmuter subsidies to Outer Suburban services in the South-&quot;ast, and Inter-City.
7.62,   The new rail policies suggested will need development in detail with a number of interests, including local authorities but princi-Britishpally/Hail and the railway trades unions.   The Government are already committed to Planning Agreements with the major nationalised indus-tries and this would seem to provide a convenient umbrella for working out during the course of 1976 a new plan for the industry, with theunions fully involved, covering the whole range of pricing, investment and resource issues and including exports, where British Rail workshop3have important potential.SUMMARY AND POINTS FOR DECISION7.63.   The public expenditure decisions already taken provide a finan-cial framework within which new transport policies, including newrailways strategies, must be evolved.    In doing so, the followingseem to be the main considerations -- social, environmental and economic considerations do not seemto justify the large subsidy which railway users now receive,bearing In mind in particular that railway subsidies areregressive;- the railways should increasingly concentrate on thoseactivities for which they are best suited, particularly bulkfreight haulage, fast Inter-City passenger services and densecommuter flows;- there is no evidence that lowering fares and charges would attract sufficient additional traffic to offset the loss ofrevenue.   On the contrary British Rail should continue to pursue a commercial pricing policy, over the whole range oftheir passenger and freight activities;
- although there is scope for manpower savings and betterproductivity, these do not promise significant savings inthe short term;    there must first be renegotiation of agreements with the Unions;But if the deficit is to be contained even at its present recordlevels, there will have to be either drastic economies,or substantial fare rises, or cuts in services.   The most likelyrecipe is a mixture in some proportion of all these ingredients.To the extent that any one remedy is foresworn, the burden willhave to be that much greater on the others.In order to focus discussion on Railway issues, the government consider that the questions to be asked should be specificallyrelated to each of British Rail&apos;s main business activities, asfollows: -British- ahould/iailaim to achieve viability for rail freight as soon aspossible?British- should^&amp;il aim at covering allocated costs on Inter-Cityservices by 1 981 and, in addition meeting a share of overheadcosts?British- should/Rail aim at covering allocated costs on London OuterSuburban services by 1 981 ?- should the Government and GLC promote the integration of busand rail services in the London area to give a better service with less need for financial support?- should PTE objectives continue to be worked out locally in thelight of overall financial constraints and local transportpolicies?- should savings on other local provincial services which givepoor value for money be sought through examining the scope forreplacing expensive rail services by lower cost but improvedbus services on a long term basis?
- would the available funds be better spent on modernisingand improving the railway system - or on subsidies to keepfares down at the risk of a deteriorating service?7,65.   Alternatively, what other objectives should be set forBritish Rail?

CHAPTER 8FREIGHTINTRODUCTION8.1   Chapter 2 has demonstrated the importance of an efficient freighttransport industry to the economic health of the country.    We cannot afford to waste resources in such a vital sector nor induce w^ste inthe Industries iW.cn use transport.8.2   We have already argued in Chapters 3 ana 5 that there is no case for a general subsidy to freight on social, aivironmental or energygrounds.   Similarly investaent of public funds in freight mustnormally be expected to offer rates of return a3 good as those in thepriate sector.   The Government does, however, accept that while theindustry must be expected to cover its full costs, the need forniaximum efficiency must be tempered by the need to protect the environment, to ensure the safety of the public and to protect thosewho work in the industry.    This chapter describes the present situatiaiand discusses possible policy changes designed to achieve these various objectives.Balance between road akd hail^.3   The Government share the view of the TUC^that the &quot;roadversus rail&quot; argument is a barren one.   The vat majority of freightMovement is over snort distances and most journeys will continue to be^tuc Statements on Transport 1975
made by road.    Certainly it ia right that lorries, especially heavygoods vehicles,  should meet the resource and environmental costs whichthey impose on the Community (see chapter 5).    Moreover we might seekfurther improvements in safety and environmental standards for roadfj fight (paragraph 8.20); and the cost of implementing e.c. regulationson drivers&apos; hours and tachographs, whatever form this takes, would be substantial.    All these developments will add to the cost of road haulage and improve the competitive position of rail fr ight.Nevertheless even their cumulative effect is unlikely to alterradically the distribution between road and rail.    Unless privatesidings are available at both origin and destination, rail will normally continue to be more expensive for wagon-load traffic ov^rdistances of less than 150 miles.   For shorter journeys the additional cost of road/rail transfer at one or both ends usually outweighs(except for bulk traffic) the lower cost of the rail part of the journey-Bulk goods travelling by road over 75 miles now account for only about$ of road ton-mileage.8.4    It should also be remembered that the Government,  following theRailways Act 1974, adopted a system of support whereby the freightbusiness met only those track and signalling costs which would be avoided if there were no freight business , together with a propershare of the administrative and interest charges.   In this way railfreight has been relieved of substantial overhead charges and this wi^be of continuing benefit to the rail freight system.8.5   Unfortunately rail freight operations have suffered severely ove?the last year from the economic recession and, although freight was expected to break even on the foregoing basis, there was a seriousdeficit in 1975 amounting to some  70 million.   Although it meant
diverting resources that could have been used for important socialobjectives, the Government felt it necessary to provide temporarysupport for rail freight in order to allow the freight operations to be rationalised and the deficit to be eliminated in a sensibleway without damage to the rail freight system.   The similar supportbeing given to the National Freight Corporation in discussed later in this chapter,8.6     The British Railways Board are carrying out a fundamental reviewof their rail freight operation, which should be completed in thecourse of this year.   This is re-examining the freight strategy fromfirst principles and will enable the Board to produce a plan leading to a more efficient and reliable rail freight system.    This system will involve exploiting the acisting openings for profitable traffic,and the further opportunities which have been identified, including those revealed by the recent &quot;100 finns^ study which covered private firms and public authorities with major transport requirements.   Atthe same time it will be necessary to review all the other freightservices currently provided, to see how those whcli cannot justify theUse of the resonrcee at present devoted to them may either be renderedviable or eliminated and the resources thus freed xr more effective use elsewhere.   The Government intend to review the rail freightPosition in the light of this study.8.7   As indicated in Chapter 3 one of the most promising ways of helping rail freight is through the grants under Section 8 of theRailways Act 1974.   The increased use of private sidings can often(though not always) offer real environmental benefits.   New investmentSchemes of this kind take some time to get under way but a number of grants have already been agreed and  25 million (at 1974 prices) has
been earmarked for this purpose over the next five years.   TheGovernment believe that this scheme could have a variable part to play in strengthening the rail freight system and would also be preparedto consider developing it for environmental reasons.FKLIGHT INTEGRATION8.8   The Transport Act 1963 set up comprehensive arrangements forsecuring better integration of freight services.    These included theformation of the National Freight Corporation (NFC) as an intermodalorganisation.    The basis of its operation was that rail should be usedwherever tHis was &quot;efficient and economic** bearing in mind theCorporation&apos;s statutory duty to break even on revenue account.    Sincethe original transfer of National Carriers Ltd (NCL) from BritishRail to the National Freight Corporation there has, in fact, been someshift away from rail - partly because of increased British Railfreight charges but more particularly because exclusive reliance onrail would not provide the flexibility of service demanded particularly by the highly competitive small freight market.    Nevertheless NCLremains a major British Rail user either directly through wagon-loador indirectly through freight liners.   freight liners itself remains apredominantly rail-ba3ed company and now carries 50$ more containersthan in 1969, contributing 10$ of NFCs total turnover.8.9   NFC&apos;s trading profits ro3e from  4 million in 1969 to  9 million in 1972 and its    load-based companies were particularly successful.But more recently the Corporation have suffered from the name diffi-culties as British Hail freight services and 3Te expected to record alogs of about  30 million for 1975.    The Government are providingtemporary financial assistance in the early months of 1976 while a review is currently looking at ways in which the NFC&apos;s deficit can be eliminated.
8,10   The 1968 Act contained provisions for Quantity Licensing but these have never been activated.   Particularly in the present economic circumstances, there would be serious disadvantages in introducing sucha system which would inevitably involve elaborate and expensiveadministrative machinery, would complicate freight movements in industry and would add to their costs without any clear environmentalbenefit.    The Government are therefore not at present persuaded thata Quantity Licensing scheme   would on balance be in the national interest,8.11   The Freight Integration Council was established by the 1968 Actto consider common problems affecting the various freight authorities.Although the concept was a good one the Council has not been a success,primarily because the Government were not intimately associated withits work, which was therefore deprived of a general, non-selectiveview.    By contrast the Government   would be fully concerned withthe alternative arrangements proposed in the final chapter of this document.8.12   One area for further examination is parcels and small freight.The Government have been studying the various aspects of the public sector parcels service, following their reply to the Select Committeein 1974^2*.    The four public sector operators - IJCL, Roadline UK Ltd.(previously British Iioad Services (Parcels) Ltd.), British RailExpress Parcels Service and the Post Office - are largely concernedwith separate markets providing different kinds of service.   the operators are currently improving the financial position of theseParcels business by streamlining their services and by pricing action.&apos;Cmnd 5722L
In particular British Hail and the National Freight Corporation aretogether considering ways of rationalising their parcels service.The proposed examination would need to take account of the workalready done and the outside inquiry (The Carter Inquiry) alreadyinstituted into the Post Office parcels service.8,13   It is for consideration whether, in the longer term,  there migh*be scope for integration of freight services based on the intermodalapproach in the 1968 Act.    This would provide an opportunity to reviewonce again the suggestion that IVCL and/or freight liners should betransferred to the control of the British Railways Board.   In thecase of freight liners careful regard will need to be paid to the1973 Select Committee on Nationalised Industries Report on theNational Freight Corporation, which concluded that the arguments forreturning full control to British Rail were not strong enough to outweigh the cost and disruption likely to result from a majororganisational change.    The review should also consider the feasibility of extending the carriage of freight by inland waterways.8.14   Finally, it remains the Government intention that there shouldbe an extension of public ownership in road transport.   In tie presentnational economic situation, however, the upheaval of a majorreorganisation in a service   so important to the efficiency of induedwould not be appropriate.    In any case, in the transport field there organisation of the ports has priority for major legislation.Nevertheless we propose to consider with those concerned what steps might be taken to this end in the shorter term.
THE H^AVY LGkUY AND THii ^VIHONluENT8.15   As indicated in Chapter 3, scu,me atepa have already been takento reduce the environmental impact of the lorry.   But much more remains to be done and the measures outlined below would produce substantial improvements.8*16   First the road? themselves.   Heavy lorries cause few problems whentravelling on good roads away from residential areas; and some newroads are therefore essential to our purpose.    Within the much reducedtotal road expenditure, the Government plan the completion of a strategic network of high quality roads linking major centres of population, industry, ports and airports.   There will be increasingerapha3is in the national programme on bypass schemes such as those for Canterbury and Berwick.8.17   The Government are also pursuing proposals for a national system0f lorry routes which will ensure that the maximum use is made of thecountry*s better roadfc   Discussions are proceeding with the maininterested groups including the road haulage industry to settle the broad principles, after which the routes will be chosen in consultation between the Government and local authorities.   The system will be*ivigory, at least for the time being.   It will be kept under review^d will be modified as new and improved roads become available.8*18   The Government are particularly concerned about the environmentalimpact of heavy lorries in urban areas.   Local authorities are preparing plans for the control of heavy lorries in the interests oflenity, under powers provided by the Heavy Commercial Vehicles Act^973 and other traffic legislation.    Initially, most is probably to beSained by the prohibition of h- avy traffic from unsuitable roads and bybaling with known local trouble spots.
8,19   There is also  a pressing need to 3tudy methods of lorryoperation that will further reduce the environmental nuisance intowns.   The independent Lorries and Environment Committee are alre dycarr/ing out 3uch studies, including an examination, of the problems oftranshipment.    Their report should be available shortly.   TheGovernment intend,  in the light of this report,  to develop a new initiative in this field and would welcome specific proposals aboutthe farther measures that might be taken.VLHICLE INSPECTION AND REGULATION8,20   The Government intend to pursue, within the European community or in our own regulations as appropriate, measures to improve the standards of lorry construction.    These would set more comprehensiverequirements for vehicle braking, and standards to ensure that tyresare properly constructed and that steering systems and the coupling9of large trailers and semi-trailera perform as they should.      other measures would include requirements for the provision of adequatemeans of securing the load and for improved protection againstunder-running.    Action is already being taken to see if the appaiti^nuisance of 3pray in wet weather can be reduced; and it may prove possible to lay down requirements for the suspension systems that wou^reduce vibration.    There are alBo plans to reduce noise and smokeeither by prescribing lower levels or b*y requiring better standards 0^quality control to ensure that engines from the production linemaintain a ^ood performance.8,21   Although the standards of vehicle design and construction are largely a matter for international agreement,  the enforcement of thostandards lies in our own hands.   Drivers of heavy lorries must alreii
pass a stringent driving test before they become qualified and thenumber of drivers1 hours is closely controlled.    The condition of the vehicles themselves dur ng their working life is checked by periodicinspections and spot checks at the roadside.    These tests haverecently been reviewed; it is suggested that better results could beachieved without additional costs if a higher proportion of available resources were devoted to spot (tecks.8.22   To ensure that lorries are well and safely operated,  operators&apos;licensing (introduced by the Transport Act 1968 and strengthened by theRoad Traffic Act 1974) requires sound operating standards, includingmaintenance, d?ivers* hour a aid safe loading.    The power of the licensing authority to revoke, suspend or curtail a licence is a powerful instrument towards securing safe operation.    This system is soundly based but the Government would w&amp;come suggestions for measures to tighten control of entry and stiffen the penalties formisdemeanor.8.23   The Government also intend to raise standards of management bylicensing transport managers on lines compatible with the ttfiC Directiveon Admission to the Occupation of Road Haulage Operator, which comes into effect in 1978.8.24   A voluntary scheme for fixing hazard information panela to roadtankers carrying dangerous goods came into operation on 1 July 1975.The panels include coded information to assist the emergency services to take the correct action in the event of an accident.    TheGovernment are initiating further action to ensure that the general public are immediately aware of the presence of dangeroua goods vehicles on the highway.
8.25   The movement by road of abnormally wide or heavy loads makesextra demands on the police when they escort them.   The Governmentare considering whether those who move these loads should defraythe cost of police escorts.QUESTIONS8.26       (a)   While economic difficulties will limit what can be done inthe immediate future, what longer term measures couldimprove integration and co-ordination in the freightfield?(b) Bearing in mind the drawbacks of a quantity licensing system, what other ways are there of encouraging thetransfer of suitable freight from road to rail&apos;.&apos;&apos;   Howcan greater use be made of Section 8 grants to accruefurther environmental benefits?(c) What views are there about the measures proposed inparagraphs 16 So 25 toninimise the environmental effects of the huavy lorry?

CHAPTER 9ROADS9.1   In previous chapters, there has been discussion of roads, vehicletaxation and the environment.    In general,  taxation should cover totaltrack costs and help to offset environmental damage; while theconstruction of particular roads should be heavily influenced byenvironmental considerations.    This chapter discusses the total size of the road programme and, in detail, how to appraise individualschemes,9.2   In 1970 the previous Labour Government published a White Paper^*Roads for the Future&quot;.    It set out proposals for an expandingEngland.programme of expenditure on inter-urban roads WThe aim was to produceby the mid-1980s a strategic network of some 4200 miles that would be within easy reach of all major towns and ports and on which trafficcould travel freely, safely and without frustration and congestion.The 3ame White Paper also envisaged a growing programme of expenditureon urban road building as the planning difficulties associated withurban construction were gradually overcome.   Clearly the urgency of theneed for new roads was less acute than in 1959 before the start ofthe motorway programme, but the economic benefits were stillconsider d to justify the heavy costs.9.3   Since then,  for both economic and environmental reasons, therehas been a steady erosion of the programme visualised in 1970.   Urbantoads policy ha3 radically changed in the way described in Chapter 6.New roads in urban areas will be needed only when it can be shown that other measures (traffic management, parking restraint,  improvement of
public transport and bus lanes,  and more limited road improvements)cannot cope with the needs of the towns.    But even for inter-urbanroads there have been sharp cuts in the volume of planned exp*jnditure&apos;9.4   Present Hoad Programme.     Expenditure on roads in England^Scotland and Wales, as set out in this year*3 Public expenditure white Paperia summarised in Table 5 of the appendix.In terms of total transport expenditure a substantial switch inpriorities is already taking place:    in 1973/74 68$ of all such expenditure was on road construction and road maintenance;  in1975/76 only 52$.9.5    The proposals for new construction in Wales and Scotland areheavily influenced by their development needs, particularly in thecase of Scotland for North Sea oil.    But in England the currentproposals involve a reduction of capital expenditure on trunk road3and motorways by the end of the decade to about 80$ of theaverage for the last five years.    Local authority road a expenditure will be about 60$ of a similar average.9.6   The extent of the change in priorities that has taken place oV 1the last few years is illustrated by comparing these figures withprogrammes published in earlier years.    The programme for England)included in the figures in the previous administration White Paper 0*December 1972^ required an increase in expenditure between l97l/^and 1976/77 on trunk roads and motorways of 62$, on other road3 ofand on maintenance of 32$.    In all cases decreases are now propelinstead for the next five year period.(2)Cmnd 6393t3)Cmnd 5178
9,7   So far, in England about 2000 miles of the strategic network ofmotorways and trunk roads have been completed.   A further 1100 miles ofnetwork i3 regarded as of high priority.   This will not now becompleted until the second half of the 1980s.   The remainder of theprogramme consists for the most part of small improvements to existing roads,  such as bypasses or dualling existing single carriage-ways.    These schemes, which would not be finished until about 1990,would complete a strategic network of 4500 miles9.8   The current Programme concentrates fairly heavily on work in theSouth East in the next few years.   This reflects the fact that theearlier Road Programme wa3 deliberately related to the needs ofdevelopment areas, and that congestion is worse, or is likely to becomeworse, in the South East.    Over the next few years work is due to start on further sections of some important roads to the ports,including the W2Q to Folkestone,  the M130 to Immingham, and the A45from the Midlands to Felixstowe, Ipswich and Harwich.    Bypasses tohistoric towns which are due to start in the next few years incudebypasses to Cambridge, Canterbury, Dorchester, East Dereham andLudlow and to various towns on the routes to the West country suchas wimborne Minster, Okehampton and Bideford.   Some of the schemesthat are designed to reduce severe congestion include the wideningof the southern end of the Ml, the Chelmsford and the ColchesterEastern Bypasses and the M42/M40 South Eaat of Birmingham.9.9   Following this year*s Public Expenditure white Paper/2^  thereWill be some further deferments of the lower priority schemes due to start in the next two to three years.    Some 70 schemes will be delayed,from a few months in the case of schemes of relatively high prioi ityto two or three years for those of lower priority, but schemes ofthe highest priority, such as London Outer Orbital Road the iW25, are unlikely to be afTected.
9.10   Road Maintenance.      The Government announced last year that, &amp;present economic circumstances, expenditure on road maintenance mustbe reduced from the present high standards.    It is now planned thisyear to reduce further the amount spent on maintenance; in Englandexpenditure should be 14$ less in 1979/BO than it has been on average over the last five ye-irs.    The intention is to ensure that roads are maintained sufficiently not to break up under frost or heavy traffic&apos;&apos;and that maintenance standards affecting safety and fa3t trafficnot be sacrificed.    Inevitably the quality of the riding surface onminor roads, and the maintenance of footpaths and oth-r aspects notrelated to safety or traffic, will suffer.    Not enough is known atpresent about the extent to which maintenance can be reduced without some risk of structural failure or if serious detriment to the user;research has oeen commissioned to get more information.    In themeantime,  reductions in maintenance must run some risk, but in preseteconomic circumstances this has to be accepted.9.XI   Have we  one far enough - or too far?     On the one hand, manyvocal critics question whether even the present cuts in investmenthave gone far enough; yet there are likewise strong pressures in theother direction from road users and from communities which would be relieved from traffic pressures by road improvements.    But we can judge the issues of total road investment after considering the criteria by which individual road decisions are taken.    To this we now turn.9.12   fload Planning.     The process of planning, designing and buil0^a major road is necessarily protracted.    It covers traffic suiveyStsoil surveys, study of alternative routes, public consult tion aboutroutes, statutory processes, public enquiries     into the line and tfl
aide roads, compulsory purchase orders, going out to tender,and muchdetailed design work even before construction can begin.   The time between adding a scheme   to the Preparation Pool and the completion ofthe road is often 10 years or more.   The roads now in the PreparationPool could not all be completed until about 1990.   ^oads are normallydesigned for the traffic expected 15 years after they have beencompleted.    It would be uneconomic to build them without some initialspare capacity.    So inevitably it i3 necessary to consider whatprovision is needed a very long time ahead.9.13   This means taking a view about the appropriate standards of design,  the  Level of future traffic, the likely economic return frombuilding particular new roads, and the environmental pros and cons ofdifferent types of road.    Inside towns, there is evidence to showthat traffic is generated by new and improved roads.    Outside townsthe link    between road provision and car use does not seem to be strong; and there is nothing to show that traffic growth can berestrained much by not providing adequate capacity.9.14   Design Standards.   The then Minister for Transport announced in1974 that the design standards for roads had been changed,    Roads arenow designed on the assumption that they will be able to carry a bigger flow of traffic than was previously thought practicable.Exp experience in this country has shown that these flow rates are possible and safe,  but they are higher rates of flow than normallyregarded as desirable in other countries.   Their adoption as a basis for design will promote economy.   Inevitably when the time comes tomaintain the road, there will be little or no spare capacity.    so the price of economy in construction will be congestion at times ofmaintenance.    But assuming thit traffic is no higher than forecast,then the balance comes down in favour of tighter standards.
9.15    Traffic Forecasts.       The techniques employed are described iogreater detail in Volume 2^^.    For the time being roads in Englandhire being planned and deigned on a cautious traffic forecast based onthe assumptions  that the GDP will increase on average by only 2$ ayear and that petrol prices will rise in real terms by some 50$ overthe next 20 years.    In present economic circumstances and given the inevitable uncertainty about energy supplies in the long term it 9^ew*to tke a cautious view of the growth of traffic and to accept theriak of under-providing for the future.    The lower GDP forecast   notonly affects the forecast level of traffic on the road system, butalso the level of benefits per unit of traffic, some of which are dependent upon real income.    Yet even the use of the lower assumpti0&quot;1still gives an increase in traffic nationally of nearly 50$ over t&amp;8next 15 years.    The growth of traffic is also affected however, bylocal factors,  and in general will be lower in towns.9.16   Economic Criteria.    Two types of criteria are adopted in determining whether or not a new road 3hould be built,  or an improvement made to an existing road - economic criteria and environmentalcriteria.    Road schemes are normally subject to an economic assess^&apos;using a cost-benefit technique^^.    The majority of schemes are wo*appraised using a method called C0BA.^^his provides a means ofrelating the economic merits of different road schemes and differ13&apos;&apos;1&apos;variations   within a scheme.    It compares the traffic benefits toderived from the new road, discounted to the present day, with the costs incurred in building it.    Like all such methods ite results ^^Transport Policy in Great Britain.    Volume 2.    Paper 7-    TheNational Traffic Forecasts - HM30.^ ^ ^   Thi rt    Panitr   S -      Tnup ^tmpn t.

The decision to investin a road scheme is a matter for judgement.   coba jUys an important part in thi3 decision, but factors which COBA cannot measure,  such asthe possible stimulus to regional growth, must also be taken intoaccount.9.17   So much for the general descriptive background of the approach to road investment decisions:    now for the finer detail.    the calculations of benefit take into account- the reduction in accidents due to the new road (normallyabout 20$ of the total benefits);- savings in operating costs (varying widely from substantiallypositive to negative where, for example, a oypass increases the journey length);- savings in working time  (on average 50$) - cars 26$, goods vehicles 22$, buses 3$;- savings in non-working time (on average 30$), includingjourneys towrk (6$), shopping (3$), social activities (9$),holidays (6$), cars 23$, buses 6$.9.18 Most  improvements in transport are about 3avings in time andempirical evidence shows that people, both at work and in   theirown time,  are prepared to pay substantial 3uras to save even small amounts of time.    The cost/benefit analyses assume that  the value ofany working time saved is equal to the saving in cost to the employer.The value of time taken for non-working purposes, which is based ondata of what people are prepared to pay, ia about a quarter of theaverage hourly earnings of travellers.   No benefits are included inthe calculations for any traffic generated by a new (inter-urban)road which is generally small.
9*19   The calculation of costs includes the co3t of compensation!noise insulation of houses near the new roads and of the environment^treatment of the road, for example, noise screens, bunds, treeplanting.    (No figures are included for the environmental benefits)eg loss of noise nuisance and visual intrusion in towns which are tobe bypassed).9.20   Environmental Criteria.    It is difficult, if not impossible, tcquantify the effect of a road on the environment.    It means makingjudgements about things on which views may differ widely; and inbalancing advantages and disadvantages.    we are all aware of thepassionate opposition which some new roads arouse.    But many new r0^take traffic away from towns and environmentally sensitive areas.This is true not only of bypasses but also of motorways which arechannels for heavy traffic.    Indeed,  the whole concept of lorryis that these routes will enable heavy lorries to travel quicklyicausing the minimum of environmental damage.    Govt;r the last fewyears there ha3 been a substantial rise in h-;.vy lorry traffic onmotorways whereas the number of lorries in towns has actuallydecreased.    This effect is at least partly due to the improvementin the inter-urban road network.9.21   The arrangements for compensation of those living near new ?   for the noise insulation of their houses, or for the erection ofnoise barriers and screens, have been greatly improved over the lafilfew years.    There has oeen a steady improvement in the generalappearance of new roads,  in their landscaping and in the way in wJl1they are made to fit into the landscape.    This work has been gre^t^assisted by the Landscape Advisory Committee.    Indeed it can be he^that some of the new roads,  such as the M6 in Cumbria or the       s0of Bristol, add distinction to the landscape and provide spectaCJviews for those who use  them.
9.22   The probable environmental effects of a new road, both positiveand negative, are fully taken into account before any appraisal is completed.    In some cases, roads which do not pass the usual economictests are approved and built if the environmental case for them is sufficiently strong.    The new bypass of Berwick-on-Tweed that willtake the AI traffic from the centre of the towns falls into this category.9.23    Independent Assessment.    COBA, and indeed the whole presentsystem of appraisal, ha3 been much criticised.    It is proposed,therefore,  to seek an independent assessment to comment on, and recommend any necessary changes in the Departments appraisal of road schemes, including the traffic forecasts and the weights given to continue and environmental factors.9.24   Consultation and Inquiry Procedures for Trunk a-oads andMotorways.     The procedures, both statutory and non-statutory, for deciding whether or not a trunk road should be built, have given ri3eto a lot of complaint.    As announced in the House of Commons on20 January this year,  further changes are planned.    The aim will beto make the present arrangements more acceptable and to improve the presentation and clarity of the information provided to objectors.In particular, proposals for the adoption of formal rules of procedure for inquiries     into trunk road schemes are being discussed with theCouncil of Tribunals.9.25   Annual White Paper.     The Department of the imvironmentpublishes each year a report on &quot;Roads in England&quot;.   This contains an account of all the roads in the Preparation Pool, the progress thathas been made during the previous year, and a statement of recent
policy changes.   A map of Great Britain showing the development ofthe trunk road network is published annually; the Government ackno**ledge, however,  that in its present form the annual report is an account of progress rather than a full and up-to-date explanation 0^policy on the trunk road programme.    It is proposed, therefore,  t0replace it by an annual White Paper which would set down theGovernments policy in clear terms, explain the economic and environmental justification for the highway projects included inprogramme, and show how major schemes fit into tie overall transp0l&quot;*framework.9.26    Roads Board.      From time to time it is suggested that the planning and construction of roads should be handed over to a ko&amp;d3Board, which would report to the Secretary of State.    The Board woulihave access to, and possibly some control over,  the revenue raised from road users.    But the raising of revenue, and the allocation 0^public expenditure are matters for the Government,   Decisions abot**the need for new roads, and the choice of routes involve judgement8about the environment and weighing the interests of one set of Ve0^against another.    Such decisions must be taken either by theGovernment or by local government,  in other words by people answeJ&quot;a0to the electorate.    A Roads floard might be a perfectly competentorganisation t)maintain the road system (which is,  in fact, a tas^.1i Oil&apos;undertaken well by the counties in England and Wales, and the reg1in Scotland as   agents for central government).    But it could nev^1&quot;the final judge of the building of new roads which invariably jB-sewider political questions.    The existence of a Roads Board wouldifact, lead to much duplication of Junctions and friction with cen^1and local government.
9,27   The future road programme.    We return to the question posed inparagraph 10.11:is the total road programme now at broadly the rightlevel?   Any discussion of roads policy must start from the transportobjectives discussed in the earlier chapters of this report.    Thegeneral thesis has been that central government should set a framework for the transport market, in which us i.rs should generallypay the full economic, social and environmental costs they impose onsociety.    Within such a managed market, people, as individuals and a 3transport operators, should be free to take their decisions about themode of carriage for their goods, and the journeys they make.   this approach implies that, given that taxation of road transport is at the correct level,  there should be no direct restraints on industry from using the roads for freight movement; that there shaald be no attemptto check the growth in car ownership, and that the U3e of cars shouldbe restrained only in congested urban areas.    It follows that if thecountry&apos;3 economy prospers, the volume of traffic will grow and that additional roads and improvements to existing roads will be needed.9.28   On the other hand,  there is bound to be dispute about the extentof traffic growth.    Central governmenfs methods and assumptions fortraffic forecasting have been criticised.   There is disagreement aboutthe application of the economic criteria:    the COBA method of analysishas been aiticised for the emphasis it places on time saving and therelief of congestion, bearing in mind that about 30?  of savings are inion-working time.   iload building appears less and less in tune withPopular sentiment because in some situations it may involve housingloss or intrusion into pleasant scenery   or because people fear thathew roads will generate extra traffic that would be environmentallyobjectionable.   Finally, road a must compete not only with other trans-
port expenditure but also with public expenditure generally, forexample on housing, education and health. So road building is amatter of political and social, as well as economic, priorities.9.29   In the present situation should we, therefore, only buildroads when:-a. actual or prospective congestion is in some sense intoler*able;b. there is an exceptionally strong case for the prevention 0*accidents, orc. there are powerful environmental arguments;d. when there is need to support industrial development.9.30   view would also be welcome on these questions:-a. Is the method of traffic forecasting (see Volume 2) sour^. . toand fair?   If not, what alternatives are there&apos;.&apos;1   Is it righ*plan on a   cautious forecast of growth and, bearing in mindlong term uncertainties about energy supplies, is it low enowb. Is the general approach to the determination of the econO^benefits satisfactoryr   More specifically, is the techniqueexemplified by C03A       satisfactory?   If not, what should Deput in its place?    (The Gov rnraent have decided to ask anindependent group of experts to examine this).c. Should there be a built-in bias against unpaid-for benei(seeking, for instance, a higher return on Cost Benefit projcompared with the current return on revenue-earning project
d. Do we pay too much attention/too little attention tosafe tyVe.    Ia enough weight given to environmental considerations.Should more weight be given to benefits (eg through removingtraffic from towns); or should more account be taken ofdisbenefits (eg effects of new roads on neighbouring houses)?If so, how should allowance he uade for such factors?9.31   Finally, within whatever total programme is agreed in thelight of answers to these questions, are the priorities right aabetween the inter-urban strategic network, smaller improvements(including small bypasses) on trunk roads, improvements in and around towns, improvements related to the environment     or toaccident prevention?
oCaiPTEB 10BOAD SAFETY10.1 Nearly 20 people are killed on our roads every day, and over 200 seriously injured.   These aocidents cost us about  9$0 million a year in police and hospitalcoats and lost production) the suffering and bereavement they represent aannot bequantified.   Nor doee the problem stand a till:   every week about 15,000 newlyqualified driven take to the roads; every tern 300,000 new pupils set off for school.   There never will or can be a complete solution to the problem of road safety; nonetheless no Qovenment oan aflbrd to relax the struggle against thewanton waste of life and happiness.10.2  Each road aocident is deplored In retrospect as an avoidable tragedy; inadvance however, all accidents are improbable.  A oar on the roads of Britain in1971. would hare travelled on average 1,61.0,000 idles before being involved in afatal or serious accident.  This Is &quot;ore than many people drive in their entireUvea and It in small wonder that drivers do not have a lively sense of anyimminent risk of aa accident, and sometimes resent the restraints which governments must Impose to reduce the risk.  fixation can all too easily cloud discussion of road safety policies; It is Important therefore that the Government shottt use thebest techniques available to assess toe oasts of road safety policies and thebenefits they are likely to bring.10.3  Accidents arise In multiple and complex ways but they oan only be reducedby measures that are simple and practical.   Large sums are spent every year on theimprovement of roads, and great Ingenuity is devoted to new devices and techniquesfor Improving the safety of vehicles; but research suggests that, while vehiclefailures can be held largely responsible for about 8  of accidents, and
deficiencies of the road environment for?8%, human error contributes to95%.   There is still scope for improving the engineering of roads and vehicles, but the law of diminishing returns is beginning to operate.It is human behaviour that lies at the root of the road safety problem.If the struggle is not to be abandoned in the longer term, growingemphasis must now be placed on policies for helping road users to behavemore safely.10.h   At present there is no doubt that the beet buy among road safetypolicies is the compulsory wearing of seat belts.   They are now fittedin the front seats of nearly all the cars on the roads, and if everybodywore them 5 of the lives lost every day would be saved.   People find itdifficult to appreciate the scale of this useless carnage, involvingterrible injuries as well as deaths; but it could be stopped at once,permanently and without cost, if the simple habit of doing up a bucklewere to become universal.   Massive publicity has gradually induced about one-third of those who have seat belts to wear them; but publicity isexpensive and it is clear that to get the wearing rate significantlyhigher compulsion will be needed.   In Australia wearing rates of up to90% have saved 15,000 casualties over the last ?. years; and it is nowcompulsory to wear seat belts in every country of Western Europe exceptIreland, Italy, Portugal and th*; UK.   The Government is in no doubt aboutthe value of this policy.   A bill to give effect to it received a SecondKeading in the House of Commons by a substantial majority nu a free vote,and the Government hopes that detailed regulations, making    provision for appropriate exemptions, will come into force before the end of the year.10.!^   The other aspect of human behaviour that offers major scope for reducing accidents is the consumption of alcohol.    If nobody drove orrode after drinking we should save at least 10% of the casualties onthe roads, perhaps Pi) per cent.   This problem faces every country where
care and alcohol are available and everywhere the problem is growing.    Itis still seriously under-estimated by the public at large.   In Britain theintroduction of breath testing in 196? made a dramatic improvement, andhas saved at least 5,000 lives; but the effect of that legislation hasgradually worn off and the relentless rise in the statistics of casualtiescaused by drinking and driving has been resumed.   Before the Road SafetyAct 1967        of drivers killed in accidents had a blood alcohol concentrationabove the legal limit; after the Act this dropped to 15 per cent; now it ismore than a third.   During the &quot;drinking hours&quot;, between 10 at night and4 in the morning, 70% of drivers who are killed are over the limit, and among those in their late teens and early ?0s the proportion is stillhigher.    Not only is this a growing evil, but it is growing fastest amongyoung people, and action, is urgently needed.    Mr Blennerhassett&apos;s Committeeof Enquiry into the law on drinking and driving has recently reported.   TheGovernment will be considering measures to restore the effectiveness of thelaw in this field after there has been public discussion of the Committee&apos;srecommendations.10.6   Every year 6,000 children under 10 are killed or seriously injuredcrossing the road; 2,000 of them are under 5-    This is one of the saddestfeatures of the road safety scene:    the waste of young life is particularlyabhorrent, and yet the problem baffles easy solution.   The seeds of theseaccidents are sown in traditions of independence and freedom; sometimes alsoin thoughtlessness and lack of care.   Parents and children alike need to beeducated in the dangers and the means to reduce them; the Government havelaunched a campaign to bring home to parents their own responsibility forteaching their children this le;;son for life, and are actively promotingamong school teachers the need for road safety education and knowledge ofits techniques.
10.7   Although road accidents as a whole have been falling over the past3 years, the number involving riders of motorcycles and mopeds has sharplyincreased.    There is no single cause: more people are taking to this formof transport, and riders are often victims of other drivers1  inadvertenceor lack of consideration.    The casualty rate is more than ?Q times as high as that for car drivers.   Particular anxiety attaches to mopeds, the onlymotorised vehicle which may be ridden by 16-year olds.    The performance ofthese machines has been increasing rapidly in recent years and the government propose, in common with other Kuropean countries, to restrict their maximumdesigned speed, so that they wi.ll revert to being the relatively safe lowspeed machines for which low minimum driving ages are appropriate.    Riderscan protect themselves- in two ways:    by wearing crash helmets and otherprotective clothing, and by making sure that they can be seen.    The government propose to include advice to this effect in the new Highway Code, and are planning a campaign to publicise this problem.    There is also a need for better training of learner riders:    local authorities are expanding thenumber of courses, and the Government are increasing the help which they give them and other organisations, including a growing financial contributionto the central organisation of the ifAC/ACU Training Scheme.10,8   Suggestions have been put forward from time to time that special roadsshould be constructed - or reserved within the existing road system - forpedal bicyc3es.    Local authorities are responsible for the safe and convenientmovement of people and goods in their areas and must consider what share ofthe available resources should /70 to making movement safer for the more vulnerable road users, including cyclists.    Kully segregated routes arelikely to raise various problems, but there is scope for giving cyclistsa safer ride on the existing roads, and the Government are encouraging severallocal authority experiments with this object.    It is only in new towns thatit is likely to be possible to construct a special system of cycleways, butthis can hardly be justified unless large numbers of people who would otherwise
have used the general road system in their own vehicles can be attractedto use the cycleway system.   Only in local areas where there are largenumbers of home to work, or school, journeys over a ver^ short distance(say under three miles) has this condition a chance of being fulfilled.The existing cycleway system at Stevenage is available for study, and asimilar comprehensive system is planned in Peterborough.   These offerstarting points for further experiment!) and the Government will supportschemes put forward by other authorities which promise benefits commensurate with their cost arid can be financed within available resources.10.9   Speed limits have a crucial part to play in promoting safety on theroads.    Lower speeds save accidents (and help to conserve expensive fuel).-&apos;*peed limits can only work by public consent:  limits that are set too loware ignored, and tend to bring the whole system into disrepute.    The Governmentis constantly pressed by motoring interests and individual motorists to relaxspeed limits, and by local communities to make them more stringent; they mustbalance the interests of safety and the claims of fuel economy against theproblems of enforcement and the desire for speed.    Surveys last summer showed that most drivers were observing the temporary speed limits of 50 and 60 mph,which have been renewed for another year.   Further surveyB will be made thisyear to assess the response of drivers before a decision about the future ofthese Bpeed limits is taken.10.10   All traffic law is a delicate balance in the complex circumstances of modern traffic.    It is important that there should be a framework whichprotects the rights of all road users and enables everyone, drivers,passengers, riders and pedestrians, to know what they may reasonably expect of others.    A simple code of behaviour is essential and this the highway Code sets out to provide.   The present version, however, is outof date and many comments have been received on the draft revision which
,fwas published as a Green Paper last year.    As a result a new draft awaitsthe opportunity for discussion in Parliament.    The Government regard    this as the citizen&apos;s key to survival and will commend it to all road users,including pedestrians.10.11    Other policies should be briefly mentioned.    Local authorities arebeing given advice and guidance on the fulfilment of the duty laid on themby the Road Traffic Act 197^ to prepare and carry out programmes of measures designed to promote road safety; the present constraints on Jocal authoritymanpower and spending make even more attractive the benefits that can be derived from small schemes that are well researched and planned.    TheGovernment have published proposals for the future of driving instructionand the driving test.    They have also recently announced the outcome of a review of coach safety, following the disaster at Dibbles Bridge and otheraccidents last summer which gave rise to public concern.    Coaches remainmuch the safest means of road transport; but the Government are consulting the industry about various improvements in the design and construction ofcoaches, and are considering proposals to strengthen existing procedures forthe licensing of operators and the testing of vehicles.    The MOT test isbeing strengthened by the addition of new items and more stringentrequirements for examiners.   The Government have also published proposalsfor improving the quality of professional car driving instruction and toestablish that new drivers have a proper degree of driving competence before being granted a substantive driving licence.    Discussions are proceeding withthe motor industry on the introduction of a regime for the type approval of cars comparable with the system used by our major trading partners.    Withinthe KBC and other bodies the UK is actively involved in harmonising internatio^jstandards relating to the construction and use of vehicles, and in particular 1-Sapplying the results of recent research on the protection of car occupants inaccidents.
questions are there further steps which the Government should take to impnave road safety,at a reasonable cost to the community and without creating an excessive administrative burden?Is the balance of the present programme about right or should the prioritiesbe changed?
CHAPTER 11OTHER MODES CP TRASS PORT11.1   Conventional road and rail transport are the most Immediate areas wheredecisions about future development of policy have to be talen.   However the part played by other nodes in the general pattern of transport needs to be noted,11.2   Two-wheeled Transport.    There has recently been a considerable increasein the use of two-wheeled vehicles.   Hew registrations of mopeds and motorcyclesin 1975 were 75$ higher than in 1972.   Two-wheeled transport is convenient,economical and helps to avoid congestion In towns.   On the other hand motorcyclesare noisily intrusive and, as we have seen In Chapter 10, travelling on two wheelsis very much more dangerous than travelling on four.U.3   Pedal cycles provide cheap personal transport and, unlike motorcycles, donot cause pollution or create excessive noise.   They save energy (except that of thecyclist).   Bat for every mile driven they are 10 times as dangerous as oars, andare especially vulnerable in heavy traffic.   They will continue to be useful forsport and leisure, but real encouragement of their use for journeys to work incrowded city centres would need to be accompanied by extensive and sometimes costlysegregation measures.   Given our geography and climate bicycles are unlikely tobecome a serious alternative to tha oar or public transport, except on very shortJourneys.11,k  Coastal Shipping.     Coastal shipping carries a significant proportion of thetotal amount of freight moved in the United Kingdom.   In 197U 1*3 million tonnes(15$ of the total tonne kilometres) of freight were carried by coastal shippingbetween ports in the United Kingdom.   In 1965 the corresponding figures were $3 million tonnes (21$) and in 1955 39 million tonnes (17$).
11.5   Cargo carried by coastal shipping consists almost entirely of bulkcommodities but where the greater part formerly consisted of coal, which amountedto 75% of the dry cargo and $$% of the total In 1955f the latest figures show thatcoal has fallen to about 10% of the total.   About 80$ new consists of tanker cargojmainly petroleum products; a considerable proportion of this is carried betweenparts in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.   Sea transport plays a particularly important role for both passengers and freight In the Highlands and Islands ofScotland.11.6   Sea transport is the most efficient of all forms of transport in energy tei**but its full potential can only be realised in the carriage of bulk goods and where either shipper or the consignee, or both, are situated on navigable waters.While therefore it is unlikely to take any of the traffic which makes the great bulk of freight transported by road, it can be expected to continue to take all o*the traffic for which it is suitable.11.7   Pipelines.   Pipelines contribute a modest but growing share of total goodsmovement, carrying about 2,$% of total tonne kilometres In 197U.   At presenttraffic Is mainly in petroleum products (apart from water and gas);   pipelinescarry nearly 20% (expressed in tonne kilometres) of all refined petroleum products transported.   However, even if petroleum pipeline capacity were doubled*this would result in a reduction of only about l&amp;E an the freight trafficpresently carried by road transportj   the effect on rail would be much mor significant.U.8  There are possibilities for extending the use of pipelines to transportbulk solids such as aggregates, and there are environmental advantages in so do:However, this is usually feasible only where a constant high throughput between
fixed points is required, for example between production sites and distributiondepots.   Pipeline tonnage of aggregates night reach 30-35 million tonnes p.a.with haul distances of U-10 miles.   There are also prospects for transportingwaste products such as slurry by pipeline, but again only in cases where heavyflows can be expected.U.9  There are indications that the technology for both hydraulic and pneumaticcapsule pipelines could be developed to yield alternatives to road and rail inparticular situations where regular mass haulage between fixed points ia involved.Techniques for the application of hydraulic pipelines to the transport of a wider range of solid material are currently being investigated.11.10  Domestic Air Passenger Transport.   In 197k about 3^ million passengersjourneys were made on domestic air services (excluding Northern Ireland, theChannel Islands, and the Isle of Man).   General distribution of these betweenthe main routes is shown below.   About three quarters of these journeys were toor from London, with London-Scotland traffic accounting for nearly one half.Good Internal air services are of course of great importance for relativelyremote areas such as the Scottish Highlands and Islands.PASSsVOES JOUHNETS BT AIR(19710Routes*000DistributionLondon/GlasgowEdinburghAberdeenLondon/Mancheater/LIverpodLondon/Newcastle -TeessidsLondon/other mainlandairportsTotal London routesOther mainland routesGRAND TOTALl5Ul517375230266387835UU315U67525100Interliningas a proportionof total on each route..25.1A.35.1*2.32.2ll*Basad on 1972 data.Source.   Civil Aviation Authority
11.U  Of these 3^ million Journeys, about one quarter were for purposes ofconnecting with flights (&quot;inter-linlng&quot;) to or from overseas points.   Thislater-lining traffic was concentrated almost entirely at London area airports.On some shorter routes such as Birmingham-London and Leeds/Bradford-London,inter-lining passengers accounted for the greater part of all domestic traffic.11.12   The Government are currently consulting local authorities and the many other Interests about airports strategy in Great Britain.   As part of thisstrategy the Government would wish to encourage a greater use of regional alrporf&apos;Over the years and  as demand grows, an increasing number of internationalservices are liJcely to be provided at airports outside the London area.Nevertheless, there will always be a number of routes where the total nationaldemand could only support a reasonable level of services from one or two majorairports and the demand for inter-lining is bound to continue.11.13   The total number of mainland domestic Journeys amounted to less than2\ million In 197U.   This is a reflation of the country&apos;8 relatively small size and comprehensive road and rail network.   The railways provide a reliable,all-weather and frequent city-centre to city-centre service \   but air servicesstill offer considerable savings on overall journey time on some routes.   On the trunk routes between London and Scotland the British Airways shuttle service,dispenses with the need for advance reservations while still guaranteeing seatson particular flights, has eroded some of the advantages of the rail service.11. la  Over the last few years many domestic services have been operated at a l00^even taking into account contributory revenue that international networks have gained for Inter-lining traffic.   The Civil Aviation Authority, which is responsibility^for the regulation of these air services have emphasised the need for them to be restored to profitability as soon as possible; and since these services areN
overwhAtlnglj- used by the better-off, this accords with the arguments set out inQiapter 2.   Recent Policy Guidance^ given by the Secretary of State for Tradereminds the Authority that In carrying out its air transport licensing functions in this area It should take account of the desirability (much stressed In recentpublic discussion) of avoiding unprofitable duplication of transport services.11.15   As noted in Chapter 5, the Government will be undertaking a study of thedemand for inter-urban public passenger transport and the resulting investment and development strategy to be pursued.U.16   Inland Waterways.   There are 2,000 miles of nationalised inland waterways inGreat Britain which are managed by the British Waterways Board.   These motorwaysare mostly canals but include a number of rivers, though not the major tidal riverssuch as the Thames, Mersey and Humber.   The Transport Act 1968 divided the BWBwaterways into three categories;   cqmmealal (about 350 miles), cruising (about1,100 miles), both of which are to be maintained to the standards appropriate forthe traffic which customarily used them at the time of the Act; and the r-&quot;1nderwhich must be dealt with In the most economical manner possible.   The emphasis Inthe use of these waterways Is now clearly on leisure and recreation.11.17   Freight carrying on inland waterways has been declining for many years andin 197U constituted only 0.1% of total tonne kilometres.   Traffic In the 5 years1969-7U fell by almost half (from 6.6m tonnes to 3.9m tonnes).   The Government&apos;apolicy remains to encourage the transfer of as much freight as possible from road to rail or waterways wherever it Is economically, socially and environmentallysensible to do so.   However the Government must devote the limited resources available to areas where they will produce the greatest national benefit.Cowantators t2) (3)       naTft lo^d at the possibility of transferring more freight(2)  Changing directions.

to the Inland waterways recognise that its future role In freight carrying is limited.   The main reason for this is that British Waterways are too narrow andtoo shallow for the size of the craft which it would be economically sensible to operate.  Moreover the extended British coastline means that a higher proportionof freight can be carried by coastal shipping than, for example, In France andGermany and many heavy Industries have been located on the coast precisely to minimise haulage costs.11.18  Massive expenditure on a new system would be needed to enable water transport to make any significant impact on the freight market and there wouldbe no benefits for passenger travel.   There may however be specific cases wherenew traffic could be attracted to waterways and these should be examined on their merits.11.19   The British Waterways Board depend upon Government subsidy to meet their statutory obligations to maintain the waterways.   Grant-in-aid has increasedsteadily since the 1966 Aot came Into force.   In 1975 it amounted to about 9 million, the greater part of which went to the cruising waterways.   TheGovernment have recently received the report of consulting engineers on the cost of operating and maintaining the BWB&apos;s waterways and have undertaken to put in hand *separate review of policy towards the waterways.   Moreover, in the consultationdocument on the review of the water industry^) published recently they have announced their Intention to put In hand detailed consultation on the proposal th*fcthe BWB might be merged with a new Rational Water Authority to form the nucleus &quot;fnational navigation authority.   Such a merger would take account of the Importancemany of the waterways for water supply and land drainage and would make it easiera National Water Authority, in preparing a national water strategy, to give eff*c*to tbe navigational and recreational elements of national water policy.Published by DOE, MAFF and Welsh Office.

CCtfFIDffllTIALCHAPTER 13CQbTCLDSIOHS13.1  The reasons for undertaking a comprehensive review of transport policy were described in the first chapter.   It will not be finished until consultations onthis document have been completed.   But what are the major themes to emerge sofar?  First, there is the vital Importance of clarifying the objectives of policy,which have become blurred in recent years.   The review has shown clearly that because of social, environmental and resource objectives we cannot leave theprovision of transport solely to market forces.   In particular, as privatemotoring grows so the social objective - providing for the mobility of thosewithout access to a car - becomes more and more crucial.   This means that in some areas we must give much higher priority to essential bus services.13.2   Secondly, eaob major mode of transport - road, rail or bus - has its owncharacteristic .s and advantages.   We must use our still extensive and oftenunder-praised transport system to the best advantage and see that each mode does the job for which it is best suited.   There is no place in transport policy for thekind of prejudices which blindly favour one mode against another, irrespective of costs or circumstances.   We must therefore maintain an even-handed andbalanced approach to all aspects of transport.13.3   Thirdly, resources are limited, Including energy resources.   They must beused as efficiently as possible for the good of the whole community and with an eyeon the future.   Public expenditure Is under severe constraint.   La this situationwe need to be clear about priorities j and we Bhall need to examine carefully once more the allocation of public expenditure within the transport sector.   We cannot afford to subsidise public transport, indiscriminately - these subsidies tend to benefit the better-off more than the poor.   But selective subsidies are essential if there Is to be an adequate level of local public transport for those withoutaccess to a car.
13.U  Fourthly, ve ist  go on looking for better ways of protecting the enviro^80&apos;from the noise, fumes and visual Intrusion caused by roads and road traffic,especially the heavy lorry.13.5  Fifthly, it has emerged more clearly from this review than those in the V8^that the taxation of transport (mainly vehicle taxation and fuel duty) anst be important Instrument of transport policy though necessarily within the context 0?the Government * a overall fiscal policy.   Furthermore taxation and subsidies *u*tbe considered together if we are to achieve sensible pricing policies for all means of transport.13.6  These themes cannot be pursued successfully without a proper framework &amp;the co-ordination of transport policy at both national and local levels.   Prop00have been made, notably by the TUC, for a new national transport authority toundertaken the main co-ordinating functions and to draw up pricing and invest^&apos;policies.   For the reasons given in Chapter U, the Government do not believethat setting up a large new executive organisation is the right approach.   BU*there is a clear need for better arrangements for bringing the major interests **transport together with the Government - for keeping In touch with transportdevelopments and for overseeing the working of national transport policies.13.7  The Government now propose to discuss urgently with those ooncerned theformation of a national Transport Council.    This would be a high-level foru**with a Minister as chairman, on which all the main interests would be repress^the industries, public and private, management and the trade unions, localgovernment and consumers.13.8  A body of this idnd would become a national focus for monitoring Oreon a regular basis and for examining critically the pricing and investmentstrategy across the whole field of transport in the medium tern.   It would b*
an authoritative body for the discussion of Government proposals, and for tbeventilation and examination of new ideas on transport from outside centralgovernment.   The Council would be free, when necessary, to bring in outsideexperts to advise on specific questions and it would be able to Institute studiesand publish the results.13.9   There could be full industry and trade union Involvement In the affairs ofthe Council.   In the Governments view this would enable strategic problems tobe pursued more effectively.   The Council would be concerned with findingsuitable ways of Improving the co-ordination and integration of transport policy which the TUC, as well as the Government, are anxious to do.13.10  The review has identified a number of specific issues that a national transport Council might tackle.   For example, it might commission the major study of inter-urban passenger services proposed in Chapter 5j Investigate better ways of co-ordinating parcels and small freight as suggested In Chapter 8;   consider theindependent report on road appraisal techniques proposed In Chapter 9j investigate the returns on Investment In public transport; advise the Government on priorities in transport expenditure as part of the annual public expenditure surrey j andassume   responsibility for the proposed annual report on roads, with thepossibility of other reports on transport as a whole.13.11  The Council would help to bring about more open government for the transportsector.   It could wield a powerful influence on major policy decisions before theywere taken, bringing wide experience and expertise to bear.  The Government believethat, with the help of a body of this kind, they would better be able to achieve the policy objectives set out in this document.
