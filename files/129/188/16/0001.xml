this document is the property of her britannic majesty is government(76) 4123 March 1976COPY NOsicabinetCOMMUNITY MACHINERY FOR DECIDING FARM prices memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs.        On 11 March Cabinet asked EQ to &quot;undertake an urgent study of thequestion of the Community1 s machinery for deciding farm prices, and reportto Cabinet&quot; (CC(76) 9th Conclusions, Minute 5).2.        We have had a first discussion in EQ on this.    We are agreed thatwe need to undertake a much more thorough analysis; but my colleagues may like to have an interim report.3.        There are a number of aspects to the question which cannot be entirely separated from each other.    Most fundamentally there is thequestion of what strategy we would like to see adopted for a common agricultural policy (CAP).    In coming to decisions on this we shall haveto take into account certain constraining factors, such as the genuineconflict of interests, not only between producers and consumers, butoften also between ourselves and the rest of the Nine, where the agricultural interests are much more powerful both economically and politically; timenoad for consistency between the policy we advocate for the CAP and ou,rown agricultural policy; and the fact that some elements of the policy towhich we attach high importance, such as the maintenance of Community-financed import subsidies derived from the relationship between the greenpound and the declining market rate for sterling, and the need to dispose ofsurpluses in ways which cause least damage to world trade, themselvespush up the cost of the CAP.4.        On the basis of a paper which we have commissioned from officials on the nature of the Community machinery for deciding CAP prices, how ithas operated and the room for manoeuvre which Member States have, weare also considering what changes in machinery would help us to achieveour strategic objectives.    The best decisions in principle are of no useunless they are effectively translated into practice - the lack of effectiveimplementation of producer co-responsibility for dairy surpluses is a casein point.    We shall be looking at the pros and cons of a number of ideas,such as making the final determination of CAP prices a joint responsibility1
of Finance and Agriculture Ministers; establishing in another forumindicative ceilings for CAP expenditure; and the institution of a briefperiod for analysis and consultation between the emergence of the finalcompromise package and its adoption.    Similarly we shall be looking a tour domestic procedures in this field.    We shall consider whether or not it is possible to define in more detail the British objectives and specificfall-back limits in each annual price fixing, without weakening the Ministerof Agriculture^ negotiating hand.    We shall consider whether to adopt a regular practice of the Minister of Agriculture being accompanied at the critical sessions by junior Ministers or senios officials from the otherDepartments concerned will make it any easier when rapid collectivedecisions are required.    We shall examine what are the advantages and disadvantages of being more ready to demand an adjournment in thenegotiations, and the circumstances in which use of the veto would be in thenational interest.5.        On timing, EQ will pursue its discussion of these inter-related matters after the Cabinet&apos;s Chequers meeting, and in the light of any comments made there.    Although it was previously our intention to under-take a thorough stocktaking of the CAP in the autumn, I now believe that wemust examine this, and the related machinery aspects, well before then.Our aim is to have thought through, and received Cabinet endorsement of,how best to pursue the national interest, in both strategic and machineryterms, in time to influence the next round of CAP price fixing, which will begin towards the close of this year and come to a crunch early next year,when we would also hope to make maximum use of the fact that we shall then hold the Presidency.LJCForeign and Commonwealth Office23 March 1976
