PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PRIORITIESMemorandum by HM Treasury and the Central Policy Review StaffINTRODUCTION1. Ministers have already discussed the Economic Background to thenext Public Expenditure Survey and agreed (CC(76) 9th Conclusions) that itshould be based on the assumption that public expenditure up to 1979-80should broadly reflect the figures in the current White Paper.2.        This paper marks the second stage in this year&apos;s discussion ofpublic expenditure.   In line with the procedure approved last year(CC(75) 25th Conclusions) it provides a basis for a discussion of priorities in public expenditure.   A separate paper by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C(76) 35) makes proposals on the guidelines for this year&apos;s survey whichwill be looking at expenditure programmes up to 1980-81.PRESENT PRIORITIES3.        Ministers discussed priorities for expenditure up to 1978-79 at chequers last August (CC(75) 39th Conclusions).    Their main conclusions were;-a. high priority for i. programmes for improving industrial productivity and efficiency; ii* housing investment; iii, tacklingthe problems of inner city areas.b. high priority programmes could not be totally exempt fromcuts or treated as an open-ended commitment.c. relatively low priority for parts of the education and roads and transport programmes.d. greater selectivity in the social services.e. a major drive to cut back on the growth of central andlocal Government manpower.4.        As the analysis in the Annex shows, last month&apos;s White PapeTreflected these priorities.PRIORITIES FOR THE NEXT SURVEY5.        Are there any grounds for taking new decisions on priorities?Ministers spent a great deal of time discussing their expenditure prioritiesfor the current White Paper.   Although the economic background shows thatresources for public expenditure may be tighter, there have been no major1
changes in demographic forecasts or in any other factors which might affect relative priorities.    This suggests that, in setting guidelines forthe forthcoming Public Expenditure Survey, Ministers may wish tomaintain the general priorities agreed in December.MAKING PRIORITIES STICK6,        If Ministers accept that they do not wish to change the generalpriorities embodied in the White paper at this juncture, they will need toensure that their decisions on priorities are made to stick.    This involves:a. The application of priorities within programmes: forexample, the principles of greater selectivity in the social servicesand economy in central and local Government manpower have been endorsed; these principles must be applied to Individual decisions and the detailed operation of specific programmes.b. Ensuring that the agreed allocation between programmesdoes not become arbitrarily distorted over time,7.        Without close and continuing control priorities between programmeswill always be at risk, for two main reasons:-a. Open-ended commitments can run away, pre-emptingresources in an unplanned way, and thus distorting priorities,b. New policy decisions involving extra expenditure, taken in isolation, without at the same time securing off-setting savings,can distort the pattern, and may make arbitrary cuts unavoidablelater on.8.        Housing.    The programme for council house building and the related subsidies, is open-ended, and there is no direct control on localauthority subsidies to rents from the rate fund.    The implications of theseopen-ended commitments will need to be kept under review, and if necessary steps will need to be taken to ensure that they do not distort priorities.9.        Local Authority current expenditure continues to present a major and particular problem.   It accounts for a substantial proportion of public expenditure on goods and services.    Central Government can influence it but not control it.   In recent years it has often expanded much more rapidly than was estimated in the public expenditure survey plans.10.       On the other hand, during the past year or no the new consultative council and the more deliberate and sustained efforts by Ministers to exerttheir influence in restraining local authority spending, give grounds forcautious optimism.   However, if this optimism proves unjustified and localauthority rates are increased appreciably above the estimates, theGovernment will have to consider taking further action.   It is important notto lead local authorities to believe that mis period of expenditure restraintwill be of limited duration.2
11.       It would be premature to consider new methods of control untilMinisters have had the opportunity to consider the Layfield report.    Butit will be necessary to identify how closely local authorities are stickingto the plans set out in the White Paper, and Ministers will need to be readyto take offsetting action if there are significant divergences.THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY12.       The industrial strategy does not mean shifting a massive amount of financing from industry to the Government; on the contrary, one of the objectives of containing public expenditure is to leave Bcope for industry itself to mobilise the funds required for investment and expansion.    As itdevelops, however, the strategy is likely to carry implications both forthe level and the pattern of support to industry - e. g. in the direction ofmore selective and discriminatory assistance.    In the short term, therewill be new expenditure proposals emerging from the NEDCs sectoralstudies and some individual rescue cases to be financed.13.       While some types of assistance to industry are allowed for inforward programmes of expenditure on an on-going basis, many of theclaims of the kind just described are met from the contingency reserveas they emerge.    How far these requirements can be anticipated and, ifapproved, incorporated into forward programmes needs to be examined.In so far as they must remain potential claims on the contingency reserve,it will be important to estimate what these claims might amount to in totalso that Ministers can consider how much room should be left for them.THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE14.       The contingency reserve is not large and the Chief Secretary&apos;bprogress reports show that accepted and potential claims on the contingency reserve, even for a period as close as next year (1976-77), already add upto the total reserve for that year.    In addition to meeting genuinelyunforeseen changes in the situation, the contingency reserve can onlyprovide quite limited resources for new policies not included in existing programmes or previously agreed only in principle, or for any netadditions to the cost of open-ended programmes.    Monitoring claims onthe contingency reserve is not merely important for overall expenditurecontrol; it is an essential part of making priorities stick.CIVIL SERVICE MANPOWER15        The Cabinet have asked for a report from the Lord Privy Seal on themeasures needed to cut  140 million on Civil Service manpower in 1978-79.In any further discussion of priorities, emphasis should be given wherever possible to avoiding new commitments which add to public service manpower.3
PRIORITIES FURTHER AHEAD16.      While Ministers may decide that they do not want to alter their mainpriorities for the present public expenditure survey, next year they will need to be able to discuss the distribution of public expenditure from 1979-80onwards in detail, and they will need to consider the options for a wide range of programmes.    If this is to be done effectively, the necessary policyreviews should be set up now.17.       The results of the Transport Policy Review, the Housing FinanceReview, and the Review of the Social Services should all provide a basis for next year&apos;s discussion of priorities.    In addition, Minister a will soonhave to decide what subjects should be examined by tbe programme analysis and Review (PAR) procedure.    They will then need to fix a time-table which will bring forward the results of these reviews in time for the outcome to be taken into account in next year&apos;s discussion.    These policyreviews should be explicitly related to tbe Cabinet&apos;s request for a study ofpossibilities for public expenditure saving in the longer term.CONCLUSIONS19.       In discussing priorities for the next Public Expenditure Survey,Ministers may wish to consider the following main questtons;-i.    Are there any grounds for re-assessing the expenditurepriorities agreed last autumn?ii.    Is there scope for embodying the Governmenfs priority for industrial regeneration in more precisely defined expenditure programmes ?iii. Open-ended programmes could run away, and if they didpriorities could be distorted.    Two major areas for concernare housing and local authority current expenditure.     DoMinisters agree -a, that these programmes need to be very closelymonitored ?b. that, if there are significant divergences betweenactual and planned expenditure on either of these programmes,further action will have to be considered?iv. Should steps be taken to complete existing policy reviewsand initiate new ones in order to identify options for the discussionof priorities for next year&apos;s Survey,?Cabinet Office18 March 1976 4
OOKriEENTlALAMTEX.1,     The February 1976 White Paper Bhows the major cuts which have been madein planned future public expenditure in comparison with the figureB in lastyear&apos;s White Paper.   These figures, however, give only a partial picture ofthe Government&apos;b priorities.   The Charts in the Annex are designed to show how, sinco taking offioe, the Government has altered the pattern of expenditurein the last published White Paper of the previous Administration.2,     Chart A setB out the main ohanges in major programmes for 1977-78 Bincethat White Paper-   Ab the noteB to the Chart explain, some of the individualfigures are subject to qualifications, but the main changes in priorities arevery dear.   The largest increases are in social security, housing and trade;industry and employment.   There are substantial decreases in defence; roedeand transport; and education.3*     Chart B examines the annual average growth rates in individual programmesbetween the expenditure in 1975-74 and the planned expenditure for 197&amp;-79 eetout In the February 1976 White Paper.    Some programmes have been omitted fromthe Chart because the growth rates are distorted by special factors.   Of those that are shown the largest planned grovrth rates for major programmes are in overseas aid, social security, nationalised industries investment and housing.The growth in expenditure to improve the functioning of the labour marketdemonstrates the growth rate of a sub programme to vhioh Miniotora attaohparticularly high priority.   Defonoe and education remain at roughly the earnelevel and aotual reductions are planned for roads and transport and for otherenvironmental servioes.
1.  Social security the figures for social security in Cmnd. 5519 and Cmnd. 6393 arenot directly comparable. In Cmnd. 5519 they were based on thelatest known rates of benefit and subsequent real improvements inbenefit rates were left as a charge on the contingency reserve. in cmnd. 6393 an allowance was included for the further real improve-ment in benefit rates attributable to the Government^ upratingpolicy. In 1977-78, the year covered by this chart, this allowanceamounted to  300 million.2.  Trade, Industry and EmploymentBecause some elements in this programme represent a charge on the contingency reserve the total in each White Paper shows an apparentdecline from the current year to the end of the period. comparing the figures for 1977-78, which was year 5 in Cmnd. 5519 and year 3in Cmnd. 6393, thus exaggerates the change between the two white papers. If the provision for year 3 in Cmnd. 6393 had been corn-pared with year 3 in Cmnd. 5519, the increase would have been 445 million instead of the  SSO million shown in the chart.3.   AgricultureAbout two-thirds of the increase is accounted for by food subsidies.4.  defence the Cmnd. 5519 figure for defence in 1977-78 was provisional.Taking into account the re-assessment of the cost of the previouslyplanned programme, the difference in the provision for defenceamounts to about  610 million. This is the figure illustrated in thechart.5.  Nationalised industries the figure in the chart has adjusted the provision for shortfall in cmnd. 5519 to bring it into line with Cmnd. 6393. The decreasein provision of  483 million shown in the chart is mainly accountedfor by a reduction in the electricity investment programme to matcha fall in the expected growth of demand.6.  education the reduction in this programme is in part accounted for by reviseddemographic forecasts between the two White Papers.7.  OtherThis comprises the Common Services, Other Public Services andNorthern Ireland programmes.8.  Civil Service Staff costs the chart does not take account of the reduction in civil service staff costs announced in Cmnd. 6393 which has yet to be allocated toprogrammes.Notes on Chart A

Notes on Chart B      1.  CoverageThis chart does not include all programmes and only includes partof some programmes. It excludes, for example, parts of the Trade,Industry and Employment programme where an overall growth rate would not give a genuine indication of the importance attachedto the programme.2.  Civil Service Staff costs the chart does not take account of the reduction in civil service staff costs announced in Cmnd. 6393 which has yet to be allocated to programmes.
