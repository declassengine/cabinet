DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government(76)3519 March 1976CABINET1976 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer, In my paper on the economic background to the 1976 public expenditure Survey I said mat, for practical reasons, it would be desirableto base the new public expenditure survey so far as possible on thedecisions we have so recently taken and to avoid reopening policies at such a short interval if this can humanly be avoided; though we shouldalso have to take account of the economic background summarised in my paper.    In the light of our discussion I was invited to put forward specific proposals on the ground rules for the Survey, on the basis that totalexpenditure up to 1979-80 would broadly reflect the figures in the recentPublic Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6393).2.        I now enclose a note setting out the proposed ground rules for preparing the Survey report.    These are designed to apply the broadapproach on which we agreed in our last discussion.    There has beeninterdepartmental consultation at official level on the specific ground rulesto be adopted.3.        It will be seen that, for the years up to 1979-80, the point of departure is provided by the figures underlying the White Paper, adjustedfor any decisions which we have taken on the use of the Contingency Reservesince then.   Any proposals for increases, whether for maintenance ofexisting Departmental policies or for new developments, will be brought out separately for our consideration.    In order that we can take decisions on these without exceeding the overall total, the ground rules also askofficials to identify possible options for reductions, amounting to at leastZ\per cent in each Department^ programmes in 1977-78 and 5 per centin the subsequent years.    This is not meant to imply that, if reductionshave to be made, they should be uniform across the board, but only toensure that the broadest possible range of options is displayed in thereport.    This is necessary if we are to have room for manoeuvre when we come to take decisions in July.COPY NO    0 A1
4.        For 1980-81, a year not covered by the recent White Paper, the base figures would be the same as for 1979-80, with limited adjustments.One point of this is to avoid pre-empting resources for increases inparticular programmes at the outset of the Survey in a situation of greatuncertainty about the economic outlook over the medium term, which explained in my previous paper; this procedure would also avoidpre-judging collective decisions about the future development of individual programmes.    But the costing of possible increases orreductions, which I have just described, would enable us to take decisions on these issues with regard to 1980-81 as well as the earlier years,5,        For the nationalised industries I propose that we should in thefirst instance have a separate report on the outcome of the investment programme reviews as we did last year, and the handling of this wouldthen be geared into the decisions on the public expenditure Survey as awhole.    The formulation of options for these particular programmes would take place in the context of the annual rolling forward of thecorporate plans of the nationalised industries, with regard to thecommercial nature of their operations.    The approach would thus in some respects be different from mat applied to the other programmes, but itwould certainly not be any less rigorous.   As regards the local authority services, arrangements are being made separately to obtain the views ofthe Consultative Council on the provision for these services and the priorities between them.conclusions.       Accordingly I invite my colleagues to approve these ground rules for preparing the 1976 Survey report, which are designed to avoidprejudging our eventual decisions, but to provide a basis on which wecan take those decisions in the summer.D W treasury Chambers19 March 19762
annex     DRAFT GROUND RULES FOR PREPARATION OF 1976 SURVEY REPORTt1.     The purpose of the Survey is to enable Ministers to review thepublic expenditure programmes in the light of the latest view ofthe economic prospects, and any other new developments includingchanges in basic data, without any general increase in the total amount allocated in each Survey year to programmes and the contingency reserve.The Base-line2.     For the years up to 1979-80 the &quot;base&quot; should be the programmefigures which underlay the February 1976 White Paper (Cmnd. 6393),adjusted for -(a) policy decisions taken by Ministers before the startingdate for the Survey ^SS Marct^;(b) any estimating changes which have been accepted by ministers as a charge on the contingency reserve before the startingdate;(c) any offsetting savings that may have been imposed as acondition of (a) or (b);(d) any approved classification changes;(e) revaluation to 1976&quot; Survey prices.3.     For 1980-81 the &quot;base&quot; figures should be the same as those for1979-30 calculated as in paragraph 2   above, except to the extent that adjustments may be necessary for a particular service (either upur down) because of specific demographic Cartes accepted for thepurpose of calculating the 1979-80 figures in the 1975 Survey Report.The Survey4.     Subject to paragraph 7   below, the figures for each year in the survey tables for each service should not be greater than the &quot;base&quot;figures as defined in paragraphs 2   and 3.    If existing policy canJiovv be carried out with less, the lesser figures should however besubstituted.5.     Proposals for additional expenditure, either for the maintenancecf existing policies o^/new developments, should be separately costedfor each Survey year.   The Survey Report should contain a briefdescription of any such proposals and the  reasons for them,distinguishing between (a) additional requirements for services which
ANNEX(pagc 2)are demand-determined and governed by statute or binding contractualcontmitments: (b) other requirements for the maintenance of existing policies; and (c) proposals for new developments.   It should alsoexplain how expenditure could be held within the Survey figureseither by policy modifications or by other suggestions for offsetting savings within the departments programmes.Options6.     In addition to any savings identified under the previous paragraph, the report should also display feasible illustrativeoptions showing how reductions of at least 2^ in 1977-78 and 5% inthe later years could be achieved in each departments programmes.These should be costed for each Survey year, with a brief commentaryon the practical and, where relevant, legislative implications ofeach item.   Where programmes have separate Scottish and Welshcomponents, options should be included for these also.    (nationalised industry capital investment will be handled separately in the reportmentioned in paragraph 7- (a) below.)xOther points7.     The following categories should be treated as indicated below -(a) The investment programmes of the nationalised industries inProgramme 5 (and the Civil Aviation Authority) will be thesubject of a separate report to Ministers.    If decisions havebeen taken on that report before the Survey report has beencompleted, the Survey report should give a brief summary ofthe effect of those decisions on the Survey figures.ib) Cmnd. 6593 mentioned certain approved expenditure proposalswhich had not at that stage been fully costed, and thereforerepresented a claim on the contingency reserve.   wherever possible, these should now be realistically costed and thefigures set out separately in the Survey report so that decisions can be taken on them.e.c.(c) For debt interest and unattributed/contributions, thelatest forecast should be given.8.     The Survey report should reflect the decisions taken to implement the savings in Civil Service manpower announced in Cmnd. 6393, and any consequential savings in programmed expenditure.   The options inparagraph 6   should be additional to any such savings.
