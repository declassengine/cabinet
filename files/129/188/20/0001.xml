TEAII3PCET POLICY EEVTF&apos; COiiSULTATICN DOCUMENT;    SCOTTISH CHaPTEETo a large extent, transport in Scotland forms an integral partof the transport system of Great Britain and virtually all of the considerations outlined in the earlier chapters of this documentEpply equally to Scotland as they do to ether parts of the countryand vie-is on them from representative &quot;bodies end individuals inScotland uill be velconed.     At the same time the formulation oftransport policies and their application in Scotland must tsjee full account of the special characteristics of the transport situation there and of the differences in institutions, including theGovernment&apos;s proposals for devolution of powers to a scottish assembly iv&apos;hich vdll have considerable significance in the transportfield.     This chapter does not repeat the considerations and proposals outlined in earlier chapters but deals only with thoaepoints especially or peculiarly significant for Scotland.Lonr. Distance transport the considerations relating to long distance communicationsoutlined in chapters 7 (railways), 8 (freight) and 9 (roads)apply to Scotland but there is a difference in the emphasis ofthe investment programmes in Scotland.     The Government are givingpriority to the improvement of both road links and of sea andairport facilities serving the oil development areas in the northand north east of Scotland and to the completion of the raotorvrayand dual carriageway network connecting the main industrial areasof the central belt.     This strengthening of Scotland&apos;s basicinfrastructure represents an integral part of the governments policies in support of economic and industrial development inScotland and vill require a continuing large proportion of available resources for roads ana transport in Scotland until -at least theearly 1980s *     In particular a scheme of improvement to Perth -1.

Eural^ AreasScotland has l^r^e sparsely populated rural areas 1 &quot;here thereis an inescapable need for basic public transport services. The government recognise that this Till require continuinr financial support for public transport operations.     The issue therefore is not whether
there should, &quot;be subsidy but how best to ensure that the maximumtransport and social benefits are obtained from the assistanceoffered.     On this the considerations outlined in chapters 5 and 6will be relevant.     The need for careful examination of the role of different methods of transport provision - air and shippingas -ell as bus and rail, some of a more unconventional nature,is likely to be particularly great in Scotland.     This task is primarily for the regional and islands councils to undertakewith appropriate Government support out it is hoped- that the rural demonstration prelects recently announced by the Ministerfor Transport, of which one will be in Scotland, win provide a valuable source of information end new ideas.Shipping services the Government already make available substantial financial support,both directly and through Rate Support Grant and on both capital and revenue account, for the shipping services to the ScottishIslands&quot;1 which axe vital to the daily life and development of the communities there.     Policy has three principal objectives:modernisation of services through conversion to roll-on/roll-offoperation; maintenance of services which, while socially essential cannotpay their way without increasing charges to an unreasonably high level; and concentration of Government help on the main arterialroutes, leaving local authorities to act in the case of local and minor services.In support of modernisation, the Government have continued to make available substantial funds (currently about  2.5m a year) for thecapital costs of terminal facilities needed for the change toroll-on/roll-off operation.     Substantial progress has been madewith this programme, and it is intended that it should continue/Footnote/ 1     Official Report, 16 April 1975: Col 107.5.
until all essential services have roll-on/roil-off vehicle ferriesin operation, where conditions are suitable.     As the majorexpenditures on this programme have already &quot;been incurred, it isexpected that there will he a decline in expenditure from 1977as modernisation approaches completion.The scope of revenue grants for uneconomic services was considerably-extended in 1975 when it became apparent that a considerable numberof the services on the Clyde and to the Vestera Isles would not beable to pay their way in the foreseeable future without increasingcharges to an unreasonably high level-     Expenditure is now running at about  5.5m a year.     Support on this wider scale will continuewhere necessary for the maintenance of essential services, thoughthe Justification for it as traffics develop, the level at whichit is paid and the services to be covered must be the subject ofcontinual examination.     The need for subsidy for island shipping services has to be established by reference to the social andeconomic circumstances of the community concerned and the costs and revenues of the shipping service in question.     Acceptance bythe Government of a case for support does not mean that there mustbe a standstill on the revenue coming, from users of the services,who must expect to have to meet increases in charges as costs rise.The Government aclmowledge that air services are in Scotland animportant basic means of conmrunication.     The Secretary of Statefor Scotland now has powers, which he is exercising to supportuneconomic air services in the Highlands and Islands, and sinceNay 1975 regional and islands councils have been able to supportlocal air services.4.
c.     Urban AreasMost of the considerations relating to traffic management urbanroads, restraint of private cars and priority for public transport in urban areas outlined in chapters 3, 5 and 6 apply with equal,force to urban areas in Scotland and comments on these matters willbe welcomed.     Already the Secretary of State for Scotland has suggested to regional councils that in the present economic situationthey should concentrate attention on the greater use of existingassets in urban areas by the application of comprehensive traffic management measures including, where necessary, restraint of privatecar traffic especially at peak hours and priority measures forbuses.     It is clear that a major issue in the next few years will &quot;be how best to provide a satisfactory level of public transportservice in urban areas bearing in mind that in large parts of urbanScotland over three out of four households do not own a car.     Itis likely that the best way to tackle this problem will be to concentrate assistance where it is most needed, for example, throughconcessionary fares for the elderly and in socially deprived areas,especially those situated some distance from city or town centres.The public expenditure implications of these trends in localtransport in rural and urban areas are reflected in the white paper on Public Expenditure where some reduction in local authorities&apos;capital expenditure and on road maintenance over the next fewyears is envisaged but no cut in the level of revenue support for public transport services.     The future pattern of expendituremust of course depend on the priorities set by the regional and islands councils themselves but the Government would welcomeobservations on whether the balance suggested in the white Paperseems right.5-
