DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government(76J 3819 March 1976THE TINDEMANS report memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth AffairsINTRODUCTION1.        The 1972 Paris Summit called for the formation of a european union, undefined but &quot;transforming the whole complex&quot; of the relations of Member States.    This, together with full economic and monetary union,was to be achieved by 1980.   When we came back into office in March 1974it was already clear that the proposals for economic and monetary union were unrealistic.    This Is now generally recognised.    I set out toestablish whether any precise meaning was to be attached to the phrase&quot;European Union&quot; and found that widely differing views were held.    Itwas partly in response to our probing questions that the Heads ofGovernment, at their meeting in December 1974, invited the Belgian PrimeMinister to submit a report on this subject by the end of 1975.2.        Tindemans just met his deadline and I circulated his report to mycolleagues on 6 January, as soon as it was available In English.    The Ninegovernments have been considering it.    A second reading discussion willtake place at the European Council meeting on 1-2 April.    It will thenprobably be referred back for further work by the Council of foreign ministers, the renults of which will be considered at subsequent meetingsof the European Council,THE SUBSTANCE OF THE REPORT3.        Tindemans&apos; broad thrust is to take the Community as it is and tosee how co-operation can be intensified in various fields of activity, of whichthe main ones treated are (A) foreign policy matters, (B) economic,monetary and social policies, and (C) institutional matters.    I annexthree notes by officials summarising and analysing the Report under theseheads.    Though Tindemans pronounces himself a federalist, he makes noproposals of a federalist nature, preferring (as he says) to concentrate onimproving the operation of the present institutions which have the approvalof the Parliaments of all the Member States.    In his introduction heexpresses the aim as being to overcome age-old conflicts between Nation-States, and to build a more humane society in which the accent will be11COPY NO     01CABINET
placed more on the factors uniting us than on those dividing us.    Hisdescription of &quot;European Union&quot; (pages 4 and 5 of the English version)relates more to the substance than to the forms of co-operation in Europe.It contains nuances with which I am sure we would not agree, but muchwhich appears fairly harmless as an outline of how the Community should develop.    He does not even lay down a deadline for achieving the degree of progress which he defines as European Union and he makes no attempt to lay down more distant aims of a federal kind.    He says that we should look at the situation again in 1980 and see how far we have got.    We can applaudthis pragmatism.    And I am glad to be able to report that the French andthe Germans seem in practice to be approaching the Report in just as un-Federalist a spirit as we are.    They seem unlikely to support any of its proposals which involve even minor Treaty amendment in the near future.To sum up, the Tindemans Report marks another stage in the acceptance by the federalists that European Union is not the same thing as a federalsystem and that any federal structure is a very distant prospect, if indeed it is a prospect at all.    Europe will evolve as fast as the constituentGovernments (and their public opinion) wish, but no faster.4.        Tindemans seems at one point to suggest that bis proposals must beseen as a whole and &amp;*t only if they are all adopted will there be progress towards European Union.   This itself seems a rather strange argument,but in any case the prospect of all the proposals being adopted is negligible.All the Member States are going to like some of his proposals and dislikeothers.    Some of his suggestions could be put into effect soon, eg his interimsuggestion for the method of appointing the 1977 Commission (see the bottom of page 35).    Others will require considerable amendment before agreement can be reached.    Yet others will fall by the wayside.   Nevertheless, Iexpect that the European Council will wish to look at the work done on theReport as a whole, even if in the end decisions on the various points are taken whenever they are ripe.FOREIGN POLICY MATTERS5,        The Report (Chapter IX) lays particular stress on the need to takecommon positions on foreign policy matters.    This is a field in which I myself have constantly stressed the value of Community action.    It makes a number of suggestions for future action, some of which need furtherelucidation and others of which seem unlikely to commend themselves to usor other member governments in their present form.    But equally thereare a number of suggestions which can be taken as an acceptable basis fordiscussion.    For example, I am not convinced that there is any need fora new legal commitment to consult or for any legal instrument to mergepolitical co-operation and Council Ministerial meetings.    Indeed therewould be some disadvantages.   But I do agree that efforts to take commonpositions on North/South issues, Mediterranean and Middle East proble:ms -and I would add East/West matters - should be stepped up.   Again, as :faras bringing the work on political co-operation closer to that of the councils concerned, we can certainly welcome the idea that Foreign ministers should, like Heads of Government, meet &quot;In the Council and in the context of Political Co-operation11 at the same time.    It is only sensible to do sc?.2
Indeed, it is something we have on occasion done already,    hi this part ofthe report M Tindemans touches on the question of defence co-operation.Though he specifically says that he does not propose early action to move towards a common defence policy, we shall need to go cautiously in this field, when we consider his proposals for discussing defence-related matters and co-operating over arms production, in order to make quite sure that we do not cut across what is done in the Atlantic Alliance.    he also suggests that one of the Heads of Government should be delegated to talk to the Americans about United States/European relations.    Thisproposal would be likely to create more problems than it solved, and I doubt if it will get support,ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND SOCIAL MATTERS6.        The chapter on economic and social policies (Chapter IH) 1b much less satisfactory.    The two main issues it raises are:-i. Two-speed progress towards European Monetary Union (EMU).In view of the potential political difficulties of any &quot;two-tier&quot; system,particularly one in which we should be in the second tier, it isfortunate mat there is a general consensus among the Member Statesthat it would be wrong in principle to &quot;institutionalise&quot; any arrangements of this kind, even if in practice some members ofthe Community wish to do certain things together which others do not.ii. The SnakeThe report places far too much emphasis on the Snake both as thecentral mechanism for progress towards economic and monetaryunion in the longer term and as a focus for integrating economic policy in the short-term.    The decision of the French Cabinet towithdraw was taken whilst this paper was being written and It is too early to see what form (if any) discussion will take at the EuropeanCouncil.    The Chancellor or I may be better able to report when wemeet.    If progress is to be made towards EMU, the essentialpriority - which is desirable in itself - must be the achievement of a greater degree of convergence in the performance of the economies of the Member States.    The report only partly recognises the need for this and Tindemans makes references to the need fortransfers of resources from the more prosperous to the lessprosperous regions in the Community.    We have to recognise thatthere could be pressures for even a modest increase in the present level of such transfers to be contingent on some new form of monetary co-operation to take the place of the Snake within adefinite time-scale, and also some commitment on the domesticeconomic policies judged necessary for this purpose.    The general view among member Governments at present is that the Nine cannot in the foreseeable future go much beyond the degree of consultationabout economic management in which they now engage.3
In general, therefore, this part of the report seems to pay rather littleattention to recent thinking in the Community and presents some specificunwelcome features for the United Kingdom.    However, given recent developments among the Snake currencies, the arguments for adopting amore realistic and flexible approach to the Snake should have been strengthened; and the debate on this part of the Tindemans report may provide us with an opportunity to ask our partners some fundamentalquestions both about the future operation of the Snake and their views onthe longer term purpose of the arrangements.7.        The other parts of Chapter IH covering sectoral policies, energy,research and social and regional policy, are pretty thin.   It is on the face of it unlikely that they will give rise to new work or proposals.    But thereis some risk that Tindemans&apos; presentation, if accepted, might mean thatany increases in the Regional and Social funds could be made contingent on constraints on domestic economic policies, which we would have to reject.    Given the attitude of the majority of member Governments, itseems likely that such a link could successfully be resisted.INSTITUTIONAL AND OTHER MATTERS8.        The report contains a section entitled &quot;A Citizens&apos; Europe&quot;(Chapter IV) which also contains rather few proposals, though where it isprecise, eg about the gradual disappearance of frontier controls, it is liable to cause difficulties.    There is however a promising suggestionabout making more of the Community&apos;s role in consumer protection whichI think we should welcome.    It ends with a proposal to create a Europeanfoundation, of which the object would be to promote greater understandingby placing the emphasis on human contact.   Although we shall need to look at any precise proposals with great care in order to assure ourselves that public money will not be wasted, this is an imaginative and interestingidea and deserves study.    If it served to spread knowledge of theCommunity among ordinary people it could be useful.9.        The final section of the report (apart from general conclusions)deals with strengthening of the Institutions (Chapter V).    Here again,there are some points which we shall want to approach with caution.    Wemust, for example, make quite sure that efforts to get those in a minorityto fall in with the majority where no important national interests are at stake (this is desirable and is aimed primarily at the French) do not inany way detract from the consensus that there must be unanimity wherethey are.    But on the whole the proposals which M Tindemans puts forwardare modest in scope and would not affect the balance between the institutions in any important way.    Several of them would improve theworking of the Community.4
GENERAL COMMENT10.       Now that the question of our membership is not in dispute it is inour general interest that the Community should work well.    We need further to improve its decision-making processes, though it is fair to saythat decisions seem to be being taken more easily now than they were inthe first year or two of our membership.    (There is a section on missubject in my companion paper on enlargement).    In particular, 1 believethat our foreign policy will be strengthened whenever we can reach commonpositions of the Nine on a wide range of international issues, particularlyin international organisations.    Of course we cannot expect always toagree, or to find exactly the compromises we should like; and as our attitude to Tindemans1 proposal on European Economic Community (e.c.)/United States arrangements shows, there are limits to the possibility ofharmonisation.   But the hard fact remains that in pursuing our objectives in the world our likelihood of success is in modern circumstances likelyto be less if we act completely on our own than if we act together; and thatfor positive results our best approach will normally be first to promoteagreement among the Nine.    It is with these considerations in mind thatI studied the Tindemans report; and also with the thought that, if we areto get our way in the national interest on matters such as the CommonFisheries Policy, it is important to give the other Member States theimpression that we are co-operative in the Community and are seeking tomake it work well.    We shall need to judge each proposal for action in theCommunity, or for common policies or positions, on its merits and toform our own opinion about how far we want to go.    We shall want to becautious about any proposals which would involve any amendment of the treaties.    But we should always bear in mind that it may not be necessaryfor us to take the lead in shooting down those which we do not like or inmodifying those which we could not accept in their present form.    other member States, particularly the French, will do our work for us and,in so far as we can do this without giving away points of substance whichare important to us, we should let them attract whatever odium mayaccrue from other members of the Community.11-        The discussion in Cabinet will provide the basis on which thePrime Minister and I can give preliminary British reactions to Tindemansreport on 1-2 April.    I hope it will be possible to express a cautious and non-committal welcome, and to join in proposals for more detailed work.I am anxious that we should not appear unnecessarily grudging, orgratuitously isolate ourselves on this occasion.    There should beopportunity to report back in due course on how the work on Tindemansis progressing, and whether any tricky problems arise for us.FUTURE WORK IN THE COMMUNITY12.       After a Second Reading Debate at the 1-2 April European Council,Foreign Ministers are likely to be asked to study the report and come backto the European Council at a subsequent meeting.    The Nine will then need to get down to work at the official level and it will have to be organised in a5
way which allows the right experts to deal with their own subjects.    Forexample. Treasury representatives will need to play a leading part in discussions on economic and monetary questions and the results will haveto be submitted to both the Finance ministers and Foreign Ministers1Councils.    Thereafter the work will need to be brought back to theEuropean Council so that Heads of Government can give further instructions about action to be taken.13.       The final results are unlikely to be dramatic.    Even modest results are likely to take some time to mature.    But I think that there is areasonable chance that a few useful improvements in the way theCommunity works will emerge in the long run.CONCLUSION14,       Subject to the views of my colleagues, I suggest that the PrimeMinister and I should, in giving our preliminary views at the EuropeanCouncil on 1-2 April, speak on the general lines indicated in this paper and its annexes.    1 shall then report back in due course as to how the workon the Tindemans report 1b progressing and whether any tricky problemsare likely to arise for us.15.

ANNEX ATTNDEMANS&apos; REPORT ON EUROPEAN UNION: FOREIGN POLICY ASPECTSNote by OfficialsINTRODUCTION1.     H Tindemans lays particular emphasis on the role of theCommunity in the world.   Europe has succeeded in its originalobjective of reconciling former combatants: but the ordinarycitizen has become disillusioned with the Community^ failure to achieve genuine unity which alone can compensate for theweaknesses of individual states in the face of the world&apos;sproblems.   European union must therefore present a united frontto the world.   The classical distinction between conventionalforeign policy and the rest of external policy (economic,commercial, financial, industrial) no longer makes sense.European union must therefore mean a fully global, coherentand common foreign policy.   He is seeking what he describee asa qualitative change in the nature and intensity of member states&apos; relations.SUMMARY OF proposals. To achieve this M Tindemans proposes that in the field of the Community&apos;s external relations, the European council should decide now:(i)     To end the distinction between Council and PoliticalCo-operation Ministerial meetings and to considerall aspects of problems within the Council (but  Tindemans makeB it clear he is not proposing that the subordinate machinery of the Council andof Political Co-operation should be correspondinglyamalgamated); /(*a\
(ii)     To change the political commitment which is thebasis of political co-operation into a legal obligation;$iii)     The institutions of the European Union should beable to discuss all problems when they touch onthe interests of Europe:(iv)     In the areas of external relations where Statesundertake to pursue common policies, the minorityshould accept the view of the majority;(v)     In working towards the Union member States should now undertake the political commitment to pursuea common foreign policy in four main fieldsselected in relation to their importance and theprospect of practical results.(a)     New World economic order, where in multilateralnegotiations bearing on the new world economicorder, we should decide that the majorityinterest in common action should prevailover divergences in assessment or of interests.The Union should also decide that national(bilateral) aid should be progressivelytransformed into Community aid and that therest of our activities in this area shouldbe co-ordinated; and that we should adopt acommon stand on general political problems which could arise in our relations with thenew world.(b)     US/ECC relations, where the European council should delegate one of its members to discuss with the USA a common study of the nature and content of US/European relations;Ac)
(c) Security, where there should be regular exchangesbetween the Nine on specific defence problems andon European aspects of multilateral negotiations on security; and co-operation in armaments production(d) The European region, where the Nine should acttogether on all important political questions orcrises arising in Europe or the Mediterranean region(in which he includes the Arab/Israel question).3.     More generally, M Tindemans argues that the Europeanidentity must be put across in international organisations;relations must be defined with China, Canada and Japan; and particular attention should be paid to democratic european states;   The Ministers for Foreign Affairs should submitsuggestions to the European Council as to how considerationof problems in external relations &quot;which bear upon theEuropean Union in the medium term&quot; might best be considered.GENERAL COMMENTU.     M Tindemans&apos; pragmatic approach, in external affairs asin Internal, is to be welcomed.   Some of the phraseology isambiguous.    In some cases, M Tindemans may not mean what wethink he does.   Those of his proposals which at first sightseem to be difficult or unnecesssry and whose handling willrequire careful thought are (a) that member Btates shouldcommit themselves legally to consult together on certainforeign policy questions; (b) that bilateral aid shouldprogressively be turned into Community aid; (c) that the nine should have regular exchanges of views on specific matters in defence and that a European armamentB agency should beestablished.    Subject to clarification on these points, the external part of the report fits in reasonably well with ourown thinking./Line
Line to take5.     All in all, there seem a enough in M Tindemans* proposals in the external field that we can agree with to enable us to welcome them as forming the basis of a positive contribution towards the sdarch for the outward looking Community, speakingwith one voice in the world, that we have always advocated.But all of them will need further elucidation and study.DETAILED COMMENTI.      MACHINERY(a)     Legal Commitment in Foreign Policy Questions6.     The wording of this section is difficult.   M Tindemansappears to be advocating that the Nine should undertake a legal commitment, by an appropriate modification of theCopenhagen Report, to consult one another over all importantforeign policy questions.   This should lead, though M Tindemaneseems to imply at a later date, to a political commitment to define the &quot;broad outlines&quot; of policy within the Council.   Atneither stage, however, does he appear to think that these processes would imply a legal obligation to come to agreement,merely a political commitment so to do in which the &quot;minoritywould rally to the majority&quot; at the end of the day instead of,as now, often blocking (or breaking away from) a common positionwithout really strong reasons.   If this interpretation is correct - and we need further clarification from M Tindemans- the main practical differences between the present system and the regime that would prevail under his proposals is thatthere would be a much stronger moral obligation to come to agreement and an actual legal obligation to consult in orderto try to do so.   This latter consideration presumably raisesthe theoretical possibility that one member state could takeanother to court for failing to consult.    In practice this seemsa most unlikely eventuality especially if, as Tindemans appearsto say, the obligation to consult does not imply the obligationto agree./In
In general, we should see advantage in providing greaterpressure on member states to reach, and stick to, commonpositions.   It is the French, usually, who tend to go theirown way, often to the detriment of ourselves and other members.But we should need to look very carefully at the wording ofany proposals for new legal obligations.Line to Take7.     The UK is ready to make greater efforts to achieve commonpolicies in foreign affairs, and to consult more to achieve this.   We are doubtful whether it is necessary to introduce a legal obligation for this purpose, and we are not clear whatexactly M Tindemans proposes.   Before we make up our own mind,we should like to hear more from the Belgians and to know theviews of other Member States.(b)     Amalgamation of Council MeetingB and PoliticalCo-operation Ministerial Meetings8.     M Tindemans&apos; proposal for a legal obligation to consulton foreign policy is made in the section where he puts forwardhis ideas for &quot;a single decision making centre&quot;.   His suggestionthat there be a Juridical instrument appears also to relate tothe need to empower the Council to cover political co-operationmatters in addition to those which it covers at present underthe Treaties.   But although the legalities will have to be looked into carefully, it could well be better to take upM Tindemans* suggestion in a more pragmatic way by merelyintensifying the practices already grown up without seeking a juridical basis for them.   We ourselves have always advocatedthe closest possible co-ordination between the Council andpolitical co-operation machinery.   The decision of the EuropeanCouncil in December 197U that Ministers of Foreign Affairs,meeting in the Council would act as initiators and co-ordlnatorsand could hold political co-operation meetings at the sametime owes much to our advocacy.   But practice has/already

Mediterranean Region13.     The situation has been much the same when the Nine have tried to maintain common positions in the Mediterranean region,particularly in relation to the Arabs.   The most notable examples(but by no means the only ones) in the past year have been whenthe French refused to stay in line over the Palestinian resolution-contributions and on the resolutions on Zionism and racism in the UN.We have no realistic alternative, Jcowever, but to persevereand every interest in trying to hold back the French and tosome extent the Italians, from going ahead too far too faston Arab/Israeli questions while recognising, of course, thatfor this very reason, the French in particular may be reluctant to act on Tindemans&apos; suggestion.There is one major lacuna in this section of the report.Although M Tindemans, in the section on security, referB tothe Nine&apos;s achievements in the CSCE and the need to extendcooperation into the achievement of a common policy to allthe important problems in the field of detente, he does not suggest any significant development in the Community^ policy towards Eastern Europe.   Nevertheless, this is a field wherethere is scope and, In the light of relations between the e.c. and the CMEA (which has become active Bince M Tindemans wrote)obvious need for effort towards enlarging the area of commonpolicies and for greater coordination in the politicalcooperation framework.Line to take15     We are ready to made a political (although not a legal)commitment to intensifying our efforts to reach common policies in North/South relations and in the European/Mediterranean area.We note that M Tlndemane is not suggesting majority voting, butwe are ready to rally to the majority view if we are in a minority on issues arising in these areas where our important national interests are not engaged.   And we Bhould be happy tosee this extended to an area which Is haidly touched on in thereport, the Community^ relations with Eastern Europe./16.
US/European Relations16.     The two other areas (US/Buro^san relations and security/arms production) where W Tindemans surest s comnonpolicies are different from these, and from each other, and do not seem entirely suited to his purpose.Nevertheless, tb^ practical steps he proposes are notdramatic and, if moulded to meet our own objectives, couldbe acceptable.   Member states&apos; relations with the TJ3 coverjust about every field of world activity.    For the Communitytn adopt a common position towards the U3 in all these fields means in effect that the Community would have toadopt common positions on all sorts of questions where itdoes not have a common policy at present.   His surest ionputs the cart before the horse since he himself is onlyproposing a more binding commitment to reach common policies in very much narrower areas.   The idea wj.ll probably causedifficulties for most other member states who are likelyto share our caution.17.     Even putting aside the suggestion that we should adopt common policies across the board towards the UnitedStates, M Tindemans1 proposal needs some further thought.Ills ^rocific proposal is that the Buropean Council shoulddelegate    one of its members to enter into discussions withthe United States Government,   The eventual aim of thediscussion seems to be that certain principles and rulesdetermining the content of and procedures for cooperationbetween Europe and the United States should be laid down.This sounds very like Dr Kissinger&apos;s ideas for the &quot;year of fturope&quot;.   Why does M Tindemanr think it necessary or,perhaps more important, any more achievable, to se?k toestablish &quot;principles&quot; and write them riown on tablets of/stone?
atone?   We believe that the pragmatic Schloss Gyranichformula has established US/e.c. relations on a good footingand that there is no need to elaborate new principles.We think that the Americans broadly share this view -probably partly because they fear that it would be difficultto discuss procedures for consultation without endangeringthe present fabric of consultation itself.   In addition,it would be strange for a Head of Government to talk to the americans without involving himself in Community affairs,particularly given the thrust of the Tindemans Report for more cohesion between political cooperation and Communitybusiness.   But this would pose real problems because of thedifficulties brewing between the e.c. and the US over, forexample, agriculture and the MTNs.   Consultation would belikely to result in dispute and, in any case, given the differing views in the Community on agriculture, inparticular, it is unlikely that the Council would be ableto agree on one of its members sneaking for the Community.On the Community side, therefore, it would be best simply to let the present system of regular talks between the Commissionand the US continue.    On the political cooperation side, wehave considered whether there is any room for expansionof the consultation procedures with the US conducted on an ad hoc basis by the Presidency and whether we should suggestin the Community that the Foreign Minister in the Chair, once in a Presidency after a Ministerial Political Cooperationmeeting, might brief the Administration of foreign policydiscussions among the Nine and hold a general exchange of views.   Formalising the present arrangements to this limited extent could run into problems both among the Nine and withthe Americans and would have to be handled very carefully.Line to take13.     We are glad to see th-? importance which M Tindemansattaches to gJSCAB relations.   This must be right.   But/because
because Member States&apos; relations with the United Statescover such a wide field, we doubt whether there is scopehere for common ESC policies towards the United states in all these fields.   We too doubt whether it would be wise,or indeed practicable, for the Buropean Council to delegateone of its members to talk to the United States since this could lead us back into the difficulties encounteredduring the Tear of Europe.   The Gymnieh pragmatic formulawhereby the Presidency keeps in touch with the Americansis still appropriate, although we must make sure that itfunctions properly.   We feel that there may be room for improvement here and have an open mind as to how this mightbe done as long as another &quot;Year of Europe&quot; is avoided.Security19.     H Tindemans includes defence matters in the priorityareas where the Nine should decide now to commit themselvesto common policies.   This must be because of the importancehe attaches to security than because there is any likelihood of early substantial progress.   Indeed, he notes that member states are not yst ready to determine the general policywithout which no common defence policy is possible &quot;andare unlikely to be able to do so in the near future&quot;.   Inconcrete terms, all he is proposing for the foreseeable future is an exchange of views.20.     The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has recentlylaid down that nothing should be done which &quot;might endangerin the slightest our major requirement of maintaining thecomplete confidence and support of the US for NATO&quot;.   It neednot be inconsistent with this to go along with discussion/among
among the Nine of appropriate defence matters (and even withcommon positions) provided that none of this cuts acrossour common responsibilities within NATO or risks impairingthe solidarity of the Alliance, in particular by worryingthe Americana,   But the scope will be limited and others willalso be cautious.   Defence policy issues must continue to bedealt with primarily in NATO.   But the Nine have alreadyshown that they are capable of coordinating policies on non-military aspects of European security and should be ableto continue this process in the run-up to the 03CS reviewmeeting in Belgrade in 1977 and also perhaps in discussingfluropean aspects of MBFR, though we must continue to handle this very cautiously in relation to NATO.21.     As regards cooperation in arms production, thiscomplicated problem is now coming under discussion between theten European members (including seven of the Nine) and theFrench with a view to forming a new group open to all the interested European members of the Alliance.   M Tindemans&apos;suggestions are sketchy and obscure.   Despite his reference toa European armaments agency (an idea which we think may be premature) it is possible to interpret the report as sayingthat while standardisation is tackled in the general frame-work of the Alliance, the Community should complement thateffort by means of common industrial policy for the defenceIndustries of the Nine.    Certain industrial policy aspects ofarms procurement are in any case due to come up soon in theCommunity when the Sninelli Report on the European aerospaceindustry (not at all promising in its original form) isconsidered.   It remains to be seen what sort of cooperationamong the Nine will find favour with our partners./22.
22.     Any consideration of defence and the Nine raises theIrish problem, though it is doubtful if they would want tomake difficulties.   There is the need to avoid alienatingthe Greeks, Turks and (especially important) the Norwegians.But although we are sceptical about the likelihood of a useful outcome, we should be prepared to ta^e part inexploratory discussions of the Tindemans ideas and see whether anything useful can be made of them.Line to take &apos;23.     We note that although defence is listed as one of theareas suggested for common BBC policies, M Tindemans is onlyproposing exchanges of views for the foreseable future.Providing that we do nothing which would cut across our common responsibilities with NATO or risk impairing the solidarity of the Alliance, we are ready for discussions on non-military aspects of F,uropcan security.2&apos;i.     We should need to benr in mind that the complicatedproblem of European arms production is being discussedelsewhere.   It may be that what M Tindemans has in mind isthat while standardisation is tackled in the general frame-work of the Alliance, the Community should complement this effort by means of common industrial policy for the defenceindustries of the Nine.    We look forward to joining in a careful study of the proposal.Aid25. As part of the process of presenting a united front atmultilateral negotiations relating to a new world economic/order.
order, but outside any present commitment to a common policy, M Tindemans proposes that decisions should be takengradually to transfer to the Community a substantial partof national appropriations intended for developmentcooperation; and to coordinate the remainder of member states&apos; activities in this field.   Thus the question is not simply one of harmonising national positions but also of theCommunity gradually subsuming national programmes.26.     Such a proposal will inevitably r^ise difficulties, but is in principle one which we can accept as a]ong term objective.   Of course, all Member States will be anxious toensure that the emerging Community programme reflects theirown priorities.   In our case, support for it must depend on theextent to which the Community can develop a world andpoverty oriented aid programme.   A crucial question for-is isthat of aid to non-associates.    On the right terms (whichwe should have a chance to influence) it would result in ashift of total SBC aid funds towards the poorest developing countries; and constitute a useful part of the developmentof the Community over the next few years 4    Similarly we haveno objections to harmonising and coordinating national policies, providing we harmonise &quot;upwards&quot;, and have said soin the current discussions in Brussels.27.     Nevertheless, the process of increasing the Communityshare of total BSC aid spending will not be easy.   member states&apos; bilateral policies and attitudes span a wide field.All Member States will be seeking to ensure that the commonpolicies would be satisfactory to them./28.
Line to take28.     We should welcome the i&apos; indenahs * proposals in the aidfield as sensible objectives towards which some progress shouldbe possible over the next five&quot; years and say that the UnitedKingdom will play its full part in its detailed and on-goingdiscussions that will be necessary to work out commonpositions.Other Proposalsj^nsAys^s and Line to take29.     M Tindemans has suggested that the institutions of theEuropean Union should be able to discuss all problems whenthey touch on the interests of Europe.   It is not clear what he means by this and we shall have to seek elucidation.   TheEuropean Assembly already has the right to ask questions on political Cooperation matters (following the Heads of Stateand Government in Paris in December 197&apos;&apos;) and has debateddefence issues.    Is K Tindemans suggesting, for example, thatthe Commission should discuss Political Cooperation subjects?Probably not.   He may only be suggesting that we explicitlyagree to go on doing what we do already.30.     M Tindemans also has a number of other mir eHlaneoussuggestions in the external field.   We can certainly agree thatthe European identity must be put across in international organisations.   We aro in fact close to reaching an agreementwith Canada.   We certainly need to redefine our relations with japan, and to try to make nrogress with the implementation ofa common commercial policy towards that country.   Perhaps/the
the Community should think harder about relations with china, although considerable progress has been made in thelast year through the establishment nf a Chinese mission to the Community in Brussels (negotiations for a trade agreement will be starting in the near future); and throughthe studies on relations with China which we have initiated inthe political cooperation framework.   The suv-^stion that particular attention should be paid to democratic countries of europe arises no doubt partly from Danish insistence thatthe Community takes account of Scandinavian views and ageneral feeling, in the political cooperation framewonc, thatwe should keep in touch with all democratic Suropean states.The purpose cf the proposal tlrvt Foreign Ministers shouldmaire suggestions to the Suropean Council on how to tackleproblems in external relations which affect the european union is not very clear - it would no doubt be useful forForeign Ministers to ta-e an overall look at relationswith the rest of the world to try to establish priorities in the medium term - even though M Tindemans has m-de it clearwhore he considers they lie.
ANNEX BTINDEMANS&apos; REPORT:   ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND INDUSTRIAL ASPECTSNote by OfficialsSummaryThis note comments on the broad economic and political issues raised in chapter III of the Tindemans&apos; Report, which deals with Economic and MonetaryUnion (EMU) and with Community Regional, Social and Industrial Policy.2.     The main conclusions are that the two central suggestions in Tindemans*new approach - on the one hand two-speed progress and on the other theacceptance of the snake mechanism as the main means of achieving economic integration - need cautious and careful analysis and are probably unacceptableat least as they stand.   In particular, there are no prospects that we couldrejoin the snake in present drcumstanae&amp;In particular, we should wish to argue:that the snake is not the main means of achieving economic integration;    rather that convergence in real economic performance, not simply co-ordination of policies or a particular exchange rate mechanism, is required for effectiveeconomic integration; and that there may be other and better ways of achieving this.   It would not be prudent to undertake any commitment to join the snakeuntil the necessary underlying economic convergence has been achieved.A Two-Tier CommunityJ.     Comment on Chapter III of the Report has concentrated on the idea ofa &quot;two-tier Community&quot;, (which Tindemans himself reportedly disavows).   Theidea has been criticised both by the President of the Commission and the dutch and it is likely to be opposed by the Italians.   The German attitude, asevidenced in Herr Schmidt&apos;a recent visit to London, is sceptical both on this and on much else in the Report as well.k.     Attention has in particular concentrated on the rather striking passages in which Tindemans states that:-&quot;thc-se States which are able to progress have a duty to forge ahead&quot;, while&quot;those States which have reasons for not progressing which the Council ...acknowledges as valid do not do so.&quot;1
Apart from this, the main Tindemans proposals with a two-tier element are that within the snake group there should be free movement of capital,automatic short and medium-term currency support through the EMCF, somepooling of reserves and close harmonisation of economic budgetary and monetary policy.   There would also be an additional flow of assistance to the non-Snake members in order to enable them to join the snake at a later stage.Such assistance would, no doubt, be conditional both on the acceptance of a commitment to rejoin the snake and on a degree of joint decision making oneconomic policies.   Other e.c. countries must be expected for varying reasons to be equally chary of moves in this direction.5.     There are a number of elements in these proposals which we dislike,quite apart from the political disadvantages of the two-tier element.   Theproposal for strengthened short- and medium-term support arrangements limitedto snake members only may be based on a misunderstanding, since apart fromthe very short-term snake intervention arrangements, the existing Communitysupport facilities are available to all members and it would be most objection-able to introduce a discriminatory element into them.   We would have reservations about arrangements for reserve pooling among snake members only, since there area number of important technical questions connected with reserve pooling andthere would be a risk that these would be solved in ways which would not suit us,if and when we subsequently rejoined the snake.   It is true that Tindemansenvisages that non-Snake members would have a voice in decisions about themanagement and operation of the snake.   In theory, this may be an improvement on the present arrangements.   But it seems in practice unlikely that the snakeGovernments would accept that the decisions should be greatly influenced by thevoice of those outside who are not accepting the obligations of snake membership.The least objectionable among the proposals mentioned above is that for closerharmonieation of economic policies among snake members.   This could be acceptable and consistent with a single-tier Community at least if it took&quot;place within the framework of existing arrangements to coordinate economic policy among the Nine as a whole.6.     The heart of the problem, however, which is examined in more detail in the following paragraphs, is Tindemans&apos; proposition that non-Bnake members should accept snake membership as a goal (and probably also as a path to EMU)and that (in return) assistance should be given to them to help them rejointhe snake.2
7.     Taking the Tindemans&apos; proposals as a whole, there is clearly a risk,that if adopted, they could strengthen and institutionalize the alreadypresent tendency of the snake countries gradually to evolve into an innercore within the Community.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s speech inHamburg on 22 January underlined this aspect.Tindemans and the &quot;Snake&quot;8.     The main problem posed by Tindemans is not so much on any of his specific recommendations to action, but in his reaffirmation of the view that ... &quot;the&quot;Community Snake&apos; which lies at the heart of monetary stability is the starting point ... The &quot;Snake&quot; must be consolidated and extend its action to fieldswhich it does not cover today&quot;.9.     It is therefore implicit in Tindemans&apos; recommendation that, (1) the&quot;Snake&quot; is the appropriate method for progressing towards a final locking ofparities and EMU:    (2) although some countries may not be able to join the&quot;snake&quot; now, they should aim to do so in the future (and presumably soonerrather than later);    (?) regional and industrial assistance should be given toenable non-members to join the &quot;snake&quot; and should be linked with an acceptanceof &quot;snake&quot; obligations and of a closer alignment of internal economic and monetary policies.   In Ihis sense, the Chapter III proposals represents a&quot;package&quot;.10.   Finally, two specific proposals of Tindemans about the operation of the&quot;snake&quot; should be mentioned.   He proposes that any changes in the centralrelationship between one &quot;snake&quot; currency and another (the &quot;pivotal exchange rate&quot;) should be made by joint decision and, similarly, that &quot;snake&quot; members should undertake to withdraw from it only in cases of manifest cirsis asestablished by a joint decision.UK&apos;s Attitude to &quot;Snake&quot;(a)   History11.   If other Member States were to accept the Tindemans, message with or without the &quot;two-tier&quot; colouring - HMG could be faced with a need to define its attitude towards the &quot;Snake&quot; and EMU in a way which did not arise during therenegotiations.   Reflecting the long-term commitment accepted by e.c. Presidentsand Prime Ministers in December 19?^i Cmnd 6003 mpde it clear that, whileEMU remained a &quot;valid, though distant, objective&quot;, and that HMG would consider any new proposals on merits, we were not committed to any particular method ortime-table for achieving it.   Specifically, we rejected any commitment to3
maintain a fixed parity other than in circumstances of ourchoosing.(b) Short-term Considerations12.   There can be no question of our being able to rejoin the &quot;Snake&quot;on any terms in present circumstances.   Our inflation rate is still morethan double that of Germany;   the contents of the second stage of the counter-inflation policy, let alone its success, are far from assured and we still have a difficult period ahead in which a substantial balance of paymentsdeficit has to be financed.    It would therefore be highly risky to commit ourselves to rejoining the &quot;Snake&quot;, still less on terms which would restrictour freedom to leave it once we have joined.(c) Longer-Term Considerations13-   It is our objective that in the medium-term we should achieve and maintain a more stable relationship between sterling and other e.c. currencies.It would be for consideration at that time whether it would be appropriate for us to rejoin the &quot;Snake&quot;, on the grounds that the existence of a jointCommunity or European currency bloc would create a more stable international monetary environment and a better relationship with the dollar bloc.   Thepros and cons of this approach are still being examined.   We would not want to be committed to it in the present state of uncertainty about our economic prospects.   Much would depend upon the strength of our economy at the time andthe extent to which we had managed to make up the considerable leeway in our economic performance compared with other Community countries.   But wewould certainly not want to rule out the possibility that rejoining the snakemight be a helpful choice at a later stage.1**.   However, it is not clear from the Report precisely what Tindemans means by the snake.   Our view would be that the &quot;Snake&quot; is simply a technicalarrangement for managing exchange rates, and that it will bs a sustainablearrangement only if the behaviour of the economies which are members of it is sufficiently compatible and does not diverge over time.   Current difficultiessuggest that these conditions are not met even between existing snake members.On the other hand, Tindemans appears to view the snake as part of a generalsystem of monetary discipline, immediately constraining exchange ratemanagement but leading to and supplemented by more harmonisation of domesticeconomic and budgetary policy.   This wider concept, advocates of the SnakeIf
argue, can provide a basis for moving towards, integration.   Here again wewould argue that ability to work within a snake-type exchange rate regimedepends not just on harmonisation of policies but also on convergence ofeconomic performance, which is a longer-term problem, and only in partsusceptible to influence through macro-economic policies.15*   A great deal would, however, depend on the terms attaching to snakemembership and the flexibility with which the snake is operated.   The main point here is that it would be important for us to retain the freedomeeither to change our exchange rate within the snake or to withdraw freely from it, if we judged it necessary to do so.   Even on an optimistic assessment the OKeconomy could be convalescing well into the 1980&apos;s;,and there is no certainty that our economic performance and rate of inflation would have convergedsufficiently or permanently with that of our Community partners.16.   As has been done in the past, Tindemans links the proposals for strengthening the obligations of snake membership and introducing a degreeof joint decision to an increase in the short- and medium-term assistanceavailable for intervention purposes.   There is no evidence that he (or indeedother Member States) have yet faced up to the fact that the snake in itspresent form constitutes an invitation to speculators to move against anycurrency which comes to be judged likely to have to move out of the top or the bottom of the band.   Given recent developments among &quot;Snake&quot; currencies, the debate on Tindemans might lead to a more flexible and realistic approach tothe Snake in the Community and, if the opportunity arises, there are a numberof fundamental questions which could be put to our partners.   Do they considerthat there is any possibility of the snake in its present form successfullycontaining all or even most Conmunity currencies for a long period?   Would notsubstantial reserve pooling and unlimited support be necessary if speculationwere to be deterred?   Even then, would they not agree that, pending a muchgreater degree of convergence in the economies, Member States would need to beable to make changes in their exchange rates in good time (as soon as theyjudged that disequilibrium was developing) if speculation were to be successfullyavoided?   Would it not be necessary to ease the potential burden of snakemembership by sharing of interventions against the dollar (as proposed both byTindemans and, at an earlier stage, by the French) and perhaps by the acceptance5
of wider margins between snake currencies?   It will be desirable to complementour argument that economic convergence rather than monetary arrangements should be the centre-piece of progress towards EMU with presenting a convincingcase that the snake, at least in its present form, is unlikely to be a ssatisfactory instrument for promoting monetary stability in the period whileefforts are concentrated on achieving convergence.17.   Finally, there is the question of accepting firmer obligations on theharmonisation of domestic economic budgetary and monetary policy.   Here,there is a balance to be struck between the risk to our essential freedom ofmanoeuvre and the potential gain in influence over other countries&apos; economic policies.   Much would depend on Germany&apos;s attitude to her responsibility as a surplus country.18.   It is therefore too early to judge at present whether snake membership onthe necessary flexible terms would be obtainable by us in the future.   Even if,at a later stage, the snake membership were judged acceptable at least on atemporary basis, it is doubtful whether we should accept the snake as thebest means of approaching EMU.   As indicated in paragraph *t9 of Cmnd 600J, therewould be considerable dangers in accepting permanently fixed parities withoutfull convergence of economic performance having been achieved.   Prematureattempts to retain a fixed parity would either come to an early end or lead tosevere imbalance of the less prosperous regions of the Community.   It is,therefore, desirable to implant the idea that there may be   other and betterapproaches to EMU and, in particular that achievement of economic convergenceshould be the main target and means of progress now and that, if achieved,this would naturally promote more stable exchange rate relations among the Nine.Regional Transfers and Industrial Policy19.   We have emphasised that convergence of economic performance is aprecondition for EMU.   We have seen substantial transfer of resources fromthe more prosperous members of the Community (Germany, Benelux and France) tothe less prosperous (the UK, Italy and Ireland) as a means both of promotingthis convergence and in the meantime of offsetting the balance of paymentscosts of the CAP and the Community Budget.   Chapter III of Tindemans gives6
some acknowledgement of the importance of convergence of economic performance,and supports the idea of promoting it by transfers of resources (and theForeign Secretary&apos;s Hamburg Speech has emphasised the scale on which suchtransfers would have to be made).20.   The Tindemans Report may therefore offer us an opportunity to press the case for transfers on an increased scale.   There are a number of mechanismsfor transferring resources within the Community - the Regional development fund and the Social Fund - and the proposals for a scheme linked with industrialrestructuring outlined in   the note on UK Objectives in the Community is afurther possibility which nay be worth considering.   It is important to placeno extravagant hopes in these approaches.   If exchange rates were lockedbefore convergence of economic performance had been achieved, inter-regionalresources transfers - even on a very large scale - are unlikely to do morethan alleviate the worst consequences of divergent performance.   Moreover,in a Community which was further enlarged we would have to compete for suchfunds as were available not only with Italy but with Greece and the Iberiancountries.21.   In the shorter term it is doubtful whether much liberality can be expected from the snake countries.   This applies particularly to the Germans who wouldhave to carry most of the burden.   Schmidt made it clear during his visit toLondon on 6-7 February that the German Government would find it politically impossible to agree to any substantial new Community expenditure before theirelections on 3 October.   Moreover, the German emphasis is normally on the needfor &quot;discipline&quot; and self-help in laggard countries.   When Schmidt wrote inhis December memorandum of possible assistance for Member countries, it was&quot;on condition that certain economic policy measures be taken&quot;.     Given theGerman emphasis on the link between the flow of resources and actual movestowards political and economic integration, even after the German elections a modest increase in transfers could well be contingent not only on commitment to join the snake arrangements within a definite/scale but on domestic policiesjudged necessary for this purpose.7
Energy Aspects of the Tindemans Report22.   In the short section of the report devoted to energy, Mr Tinderaans saysnothing new and his general statements should not create problems for us.   To alarge extent the items on which he suggests decisions must be taken are already in train.    However, any concrete proposals following up the suggestion for central organisation of the energy market could cause us difficulty.Likewise, the possibility (referred to in Chapter IV) of Community regulationof the siting of nuclear power stations will have to be treated with caution.CONCLUSIONS2J.   Until we have completed our analysis of the detailed proposals in chapter III of Tindemans we will need to take a non-committal holding line.In present circumstances, we could not return to the snake for a considerable time ahead and, at this stage, we should not accept any commitment to do soin the absence of any prospect that the necessary underlying convergence isbeing achieved.   It seems improbable that we would be offered increasedtransfers of resources on a scale which would make it worth our while toaccept a firm commitment to return to the snake, particularly one with thetighter obligations proposed by Tindemans.   We should, however, be preparedto discuss possible changes in the operation and management of the snake,particularly if these would make it more flexible and lessen the burden of intervention.2*1.   In general, we suggest the following line be taken with our partners.HMG is still considering the detailed recommendations of Tindemans on EMU.   we welcome the fact that he has recognised that achievement of EMU by 1980 is a wholly unrealistic goal and the European Council should endorse this conclusion.We also welcome the fact that he has acknowledged the importance of the economicside of EMU.   We regret, however, the extent to which he still lays stress on.the Werner approach to EMU.    (It is the more disappointing because the tideof opinion had seemed to be improving, for example in the Karjolin report lastyear.)   We ourselves do not believe that the snake should be regarded as amechanism for approaching EMU or as the centre-piece of the Community&apos;s approach to economic integration.   This does not mean we are opposed to all forms of thesnake as a matter of principle, and we are prepared to discuss ways in which its8
operation and management could be improved.   Such improvements should allow for the retention of flexibility in the exchange rate system within theCommunity as long as it is needed, as do the wider agreements reached in theIMF in Jamaica.   In any case, in our present economic circumstances, there is no prospect that the UK will be in a position to rejoin the snake for some consider-able time ahead and, if invited or even pressed to do so we still could not make a commitment for the longer term at this stage.25.   We should continue to emphasise our view that the real priority is to achieve economic convergence  - that is convergence of economic performance,not just economic policy.   We should acknowledge that Britain has a lot ofleeway to make up;    and that the responsibility and burden of improving our industrial performance must rest mainly with us.   Given, the forthcoming Germanelections we should avoid any specific proposals for further resource transfersduring the next six months or so.   But we should try discreetly to steerCommunity discussion on EMU and other economic matters (eg unemployment)towards the theme of resource transfers between Member States in the interestsof improving lagging industrial performance, reducing unemployment and promotingeconomic convergence.HM Treasury9 March 1976
CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX CINSTITUTIONAL PROPOSALS IN TR3 TINDEMANS REPORT    &apos;Note by officials.   A number of the institutional proposals in the TindeaansReport have already been discussed at various times in theCommunity.   We can keep to our established line on these..Other pfccposals are new and may lead to protracted discussion in the Community.   -Some of them are, in varying degrees, ,unwelcome to the UK; and we shall want to ensure that they,are either modified or dropped.   It would not, however, bein our interest to be cast as the most negative member oftha Community in responding to the Tindemans proposals.   this could make it harder to achieve other objectives in theCommunity and affect our relations with Member States.   Itmay therefore be convenient for us to allow others to make-;the running in:-criticising specific proposals and to adoptas positive a tone as we can in commenting on the institutional proposals in general.2.   The main proposals are outlined and briefly commentedon below.   In addition, where necessary, a line is suggested for use in discussion with other Community Governments.3.   It is proposed that the Council 3hould undertake to con-sider Resolutions which the Assembly addresses to it, thuspermitting the Assembly to contribute towards defining/common
common policies.   This practice would later be enshrined ina Treaty amendment giving &quot;the Assembly a real right ofinitiative.   The Assembly would hold a general politicaldebate on the state of the Union at least once a year,inviting the President of the European Council and otherleading politicians to take part.CpniaentU.   Wa shall have to clarify what sort of Resolutions theAssembly would address to the Council.   If they containedgeneral political or economic views, of which the council could simply take note, thay would have no great significant^Two possible developments which we would want to discourage;are:a) They might develop into specific legislative proposalscoming from the assembly to the Council.   The immedi-ate consequences might be tolerable if the Councilretained&apos;the power of decision, but the longer termeffects would require careful consideration.b) Representatives of the Assembly ai^ht hope to secure3ome form of joint discussion of their proposals withtha Council.   This would be time-concuraing and wouldcomplicate the Council&apos;s work.5.   The proposal for general debates should not create diffi-culty.   The Assembly already holds wide-ranging debates and can invite visiting statesmen to speak./Line
Line to take6.   Member States are already deeply involved in&apos;thequestion o * direct elections which raises important politicaland practical problems.   It would be a mistake to complicatethis work by trying to deal at the same time with proposalsfor net-/ powers.   We should first see how the Assembly.    .   ......getc on in. handling its existing powers (dating from1 January 1975) on the Budget, and how the conciliationprocedure works.   We must also keep in mind the need not tocomplicate the work of the Council unduly and. will want tothink carefully about the proposal that the Council should&quot;consider&quot; Assembly Resolutions.   We see no objection to theAssembly extending the scope of its debates.THE aUBQgSaN COUNCIL7.     It is proposed that the European Council should actin accordance with Treaty procedures when it-takes decisions on Community matters; that in other cases it should gear its,decisions so fiat action will be taken by a specified . .institution within-a set tiiae-scale; and that its meetings^should be prepared by the Foreign Ministers&apos; Council.Comment and Line to take8.    In general this seems sensible and should&apos;lead to a moreorderly presentation-of the conclusions of the i^uropean/Council
Council and to a more effective follow-up.   iiut the idea ofacting in accordance with Treaty procedures should not become a basis for laying detailed legislative proposals before theEuropean Council.   The existing practice, under which theEuropean Council takes decisions in principle which otherCouncils can then put into legislative form, seems right.TSi; COUIIOIL9.    It is proposed that the Foreign Ministers&apos; Council should consist-ordinate the activities of the specialist Councils.   the distinction between Council meetings and political co-operationmeetings should be abolished.   Majority voting in the council should becoiae normal practice in the Conrmnity field; andminority opinion should rally to tVte view of the majority atthe end of discussions on foreign relations matters.   the presidency of the Suropean Council and of the Council shouldbe extended to one year.   Specific tasks should be entrusted to the Commission, to a single country or to an individualindependently of changes in the Presidency.Comment10.   If co-ordination by the Foreign Ministers means that thsyshould keep an eye on the work of tie other Councils and give an impetus Trom time to time towards a rapid solution of problems which is consistent with other developments in theCommunity, well and good,   If it means trying to do the workof other Councils or having frequent joint meetings, this wouldprobably be a waste of time.   The place for co-ordination is/generally
generally in national Cabinets.   But we need dot.object tosome broad co-ordination as long as it does not take up too much of Foreign Ministers&apos; time.11.   The amalgamation of Council and political co-operationmeetings, including the question of the minority giving wayto the majority in political co-operation matters, is discussed in the Annex on foreign policy aspects.  ;In general we have .doubts about going beyond present practice by formalisingarrangements in the way Tindemans proposes.12.   On majority voting we can continue to argue in Brusselsthat the minority should be ready to accept a majority view(preferably without a need for formal voting procedures) whenno &quot;important national interest&quot; is at stake.   But someincreased use of voting would probably be acceptable, partic-particularly in those instances where another Member Governmentactually wishes to show that it was out-voted.13-   On the extension of the Presidency to one year we mightpoint out that we shall be better placed to comment after our Presidency.    (In-practice, as Treaty amendment would berequired, an earlier change would be impossible.)   At that point all Member States will have had experience of at least one period as President and will be better able to form aview.   The administrative strain imposed by the Presidency,particularly on countries which have other extensive inter-national responsibilities, should not be under-estimated./It
It is also arguable that a gap of nine rears (or perhaps pent $g1more if there are new Members) is a very long time between?two periods in the Presidency.   xt is not clear ^ov serlftulSthe loss of continuity is when the Presidency changes atsix-monthly intervals.   The shorter period has the advantage that each country makes an effort to achieve something an,$lworks at high, pressure   to do so.   It also means that theeffects of a really bad Presidency are limited.   Any lack; p&amp;continuity could perhaps be compensated by greater use of W38*final sugges^i00 - tae delegation of specific tasks to governments or individuals.Line to takelh.   We agree that Foreign Ministers should exercise aco-ordinating role.   They will want to work out effectivemethods which will not take up too much of their time in theCouncil.15.   We would not be prepared to see a widespread use of majority voting, but we endorse the principle that the minority should accept the majority view when no important national interest is at stake.   If it helps other governments in this situation we do not oppose an occasional vote on community matters in the Council, although in general we would hope that the majority view would prevail without formalvoting.   This would be made easier if the Commission consultedMember Governments more fully about their proposals in draft and consequently put them forward in less contentious formthan they often do now.
16.   Ue shall be better placed to comment on the extensionof the Presidency after we have direct experience of it inthe first half of 1977*   There seen to us to be arguments on both sides.   In the meantime to help with continuity andto ease the strain on the Presidency we would look with interest at proposals to entrust specific tasks to otherGovernments or individuals.THS COMMISSION17-   ^he Report again proposes greater use of Article 155 -in effect the delegation of specified powers to the commission by the Council and calls for reports-on&apos;where this provisioncould be applied.   It refers to the Goal and Steel community as an example to follow.18.   The Report proposes that the President of the Commissionbe appointed by the -European Council and have &quot;his appointmentconfirmed by vote of the Assembly.   He would then appointhis colleagues in consultation with the Council,   ^he -nextPresident of the Commission, due to come into office on1 January 1977* would be appointed by the European council at its second meeting in 1976 and would help the member states to prepare for !;he Council meeting which will appoint the other Members of the Commission.Comment19. We can see what practical suggestions, if any, are madefor the delegation of powers under Article 155-   ^be example/of
of the Coal and Steel Community, which puts considerableindependent powers in the Commission and takes them outof the hands of national governments, is not one which UTIGwould wish to extend.20. The suggested new method of appointing the president and members of the Commission would raise a number of problems.   Agreement in the European Council on the president would be desirable, and some degree of consultation betweenthe President-designate and the Member Governments about theother appointments to the Commission could be useful.   Butthe President should not acquire a right of initiative innominating Members of the Commission; and the power of appointsment must rest with the Member Governments.   The partiallymodified procedure suggested for 1976, when the President-designate would &quot;help to prepare&quot; for the meeting to appointother Members, but would not have the power to appoint them,appears to be acceptable and should be tried out before anymore far-reaching change is considered.Line to take21.   We are ready to consider specific proposals to delegateresponsibilities to the Commission within the framework of community legislation.22.   We think the method of selecting the President and members of the Commission proposed for 1976 should be given a try.   We hove serious doubts about the more far-reachingchange suggested for later years and think the selection of/Members
Members of the Commission and their appointment must : rest with the Member Governments.OTHER INSTITUTIONS23.   The proposals relating to the Court of Justice are unlikely to arouse much interest at this stage.   The proposals on the Standing Cotaaittee on Employment and on the Economicand Social Committee are of limited significance.2h.   It is proposed that the Committee of Permanent Repre-sentatives should be empowered to take decisions on agreedpoints without formally submitting them to a Council as&quot;A&quot; Points.Comment25-   We see no real advantage in empowering CCRSPHIR tosettle &quot;A&quot; Points.   The existing procedure works satisfac-satisfactorily and does not take up time in the Council,   Theprinciple that only Ministers in the Council can enactlegislation is a defensible one.Line to take26.   The &quot;A&quot; Points procedure works well and is politicallyrealistic.   There is no need to change it.EDUCATION27.   As a means of encouraging freer movement, it is proposedthat student exchanges should be promoted and that a pragmatic/solution
solution should be found to the problem of equating diplomasand courses of studies in different countries.   A JhiropeanFoundation, financed partly from private funds should beestablished.Comment28.   Ths proposals here are modest, and in the case of edu-cation Tit in with what has already been agreed by the ministers of 3duc::tion and is to be imploraented by the EducationConnittce established by Ministers on 10 December 1975*   TheEuropean Foundation is an interesting idea and could be important but it clearly requires much more study.   It3relation to such existing non-Governmental organisationsas the Suropean Cultural Foundation would have to be consid-ered.   The Foundation*s organisation would be important: one possibility would be a small central organisation working inconjunction with national committees.Line to take29.   V/e have taken an active part in obtaining wider mutualrecognition of qualifications in the Community and shall con-tinue to do so.   The idea of a European Foundation is interesting and deserves study.FuIOUir^TAL RIGHTS30.    It is proposed that tie European Council should instruct the Institutions to consider how best to recognise and pro-tect fundamental rights.   At the least individuals should/have
have the right of appeal to the European Court against stetsr &quot;of an Institution in violation of fundamental rights. .rComment r .31- - This&quot; proposal will need careful examination, and could get out of hand.   Human rights in Member States are already&apos;protected by the Commission and Court of Human Rights inStrasbourg.   l\mdamental constitutional rights are protected&quot;by the Courts of the Member States.   There is no-go/pd case for usurping these existing jurisdictions.   However, thereshould not be too much difficulty if the role of the Courtof Justice of the Communities is confined to ensuring;; thatthe acts of the Communities and their institutions do notinfringe rfundarnental rights.   This would be in line with the &quot;current jurisprudence and trends of thai?&apos; Court^ which nay befurther clarified in a case now-pendingbefore&quot; the Court.Line to take -32.   These proposals will need careful study.   This is the .sort of thing which takes some years to mature.CONSUMER PROTECTION33.   Tindemans proposes that the Commission should make, everyeffort to put over to the public. the role it plays jLn nrotec-ting the consumer by the introduction.of common standards forquality and marketing, by mounting, an extensive consucierinformation programme./comment
Comment3U.   Thi3 is a field where we as a &quot;country under successiveadministrations have done a great deal.   It is an area whereaction on a Community basis would attract a good deal ofpublic support, provided that it avoids the mistake of pro- .promoting harmonisation for its own sake.Line to take35*   Tindemans&apos; suggestion is&quot; sensible.   We want to see theComimnity play a more active role in consumer protection.EIISCI&amp;LAITZOUS PROPOSALS36.   It is proposed that in addition to the uniform passportand a passport union the Community should aim for the gradualdisappearance of internal frontier controls on persona movingbetween Member Countries.   Other suggestions are for furtherlimits on discrimination in transport and telecommunicationsmatters, and the simplification of procedures for refundingmedical expenses incurred by travellers.Gocimoqt37.   It has already beon agreed that there should be a uni-fona passport, which can be introduced from 1978.   The UnitedKingdom is hot alobe, however, in recognising that further progress towards passport union, including the abolition ofinternal frontier controls, p&amp;ssents far-reaching problems.These matters are already under study.
3S.   The proposals to improve transport could be interpre-ted as encouraging the Commissions current attempt toapply the general provisions of the Treaty to sea and air transport, even though the Council has taken no decision toestablish a common transport policy in these areas.   we continue to be wary of Commission initiatives in this field.39.   We should be able to endorse the suggestion overmedical expenses at least in part.   The extension of benefits to all 3EC travellers would be an excellent first step.   Atpresent, treatment in the United Kingdom is available to allSEC Nationals.   The state health services in most other member States exclude the self-employed; and British travellersin this category cannot get treatment under them.Line to takeUO.   We have already agreed in principle to the introductionof a uniform passport and are ready to discuss other aspectsof easing obstacles to travel.   3ut proposals relating tofrontier controls raise many problems, as preliminary discussions in the Community have already shown.hi.   The proposals on transport will need careful examination.They should be pursued in the appropriate Council machinery,not at Head of Government, level.U2.   We welcome the idea of improving medical facilities forEJSC nationals travelling in each other&apos;s countries.   We havebeen urging progress on this for some time.Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office 8 Jtnrch 1976
LEO   TIKDE&amp;ANSEUROPEAN UNIONREPORT TO THE EUROPEAN COUNCILBRUSSELS, DECEMBER 1975
1000 Brussels, 29 December 1975&quot;Hue de la Loi 16Copy, of Mr Leo TBfDEMAHS&apos; letter to his European Council colleaguesAt the conference of Heads of State and Heads of Government of member States of the European Communities, which was held inParis on 10/11 December 1974- you asked me to define what wasmeant by the term *European Union1.When attempting to do this I obviously took into account thereports drawn up by the European Parliament, the Commission ofthe European Communities and the Court of Justice and also the opinions voiced during the past year by members of your government and other powerful forces in the various States.Throughout these contacts I was struck by a contradiction.On the one hand, some people believed that it was particularlyinappropriate to draw up a report on European Union at a timewhen the European concept was passing through a crisis and theincompleted European Structure was swaying. . Furthermoretherewas the feeling that the economic recession has made itself felt in our Member States throughout 1975 without any large-scalejoint action having been planned to counter the effects of .economic depression and unemployment.And yet - and this is most significant - almost all the people to whom I spoke stated that they could not imagine a betterfuture for their country than that offered by the building ofEurope.     The could not conceive of doing this other than bystrengthening the Community.
In this respect, there is a distinct divergence- of views between public - opinion and those who fulfil a political role- in their-respective countries.Public opinion is extremely sceptical on the-will to establish a genuine European Union and solve the real problems of the day at European level.     It wants results and questions the lack ofpolitical will on the part of its leaders.For me, the conclusion is obvious:   if we wish to safeguard the achievements of the Treaties and conquer new ground the member states must agree on new aims.At this stage, the stakes are political, that is quite irrefutable.This is the reason why I deliberately refused to draw up a reportclaiming to be, at least in part,, the Constitution for the futureEuropean Union.     Nor did I wish to describe what Europe ideallywhileshould be,/remaining personally convinced that Europe will onlyfulfil its destiny if it espouses federalism.The-crisis in Europe is so serious that we must, in the immediatefuture, save what has already been achieved and, working on this basis, take drastic measures to make a significant leap forward.I had to make a difficult choice.    My proposals do not directlyconcern the final phase of European development.     They state the objectives and the methods whereby Europe can be investedwith a new vitality and current obstacles can be overcome.My choice is based on the belief that at the present time anyother approach would either be unworthy of our faith in Europe,or else,because of its Utopian nature in the present circumstances-,would lose all credibility with the parties in power.Consequently, it represents a realistic yet feasible approach.
, For me, European Union is a new phase in the history of the unification of Europe which can only he achieved by a continuousprocess.     Consequently, it is difficult to lay down, at thisstage, the date of completion of the European Union.     It will only achieve its objectives by means of institutions whichhave been adapted to its new requirements.   . It is in fact bymeans of Institutions which have been strengthened and improvedthat the Union will be able to give increasing expression toits own dynamism.     In this respect, the role of a directly-elected European Parliament will be decisive in the developmentof the Union.     Finally, I am convinced of the-need, in 1980,to assess what we have already achieved so as to open up newprospects   and make further progress.That, after much reflection, is my conclusion.Seen in this light, the proposals put forward in my report should help us to overcome the present crisis, improve the functioning of the institutions, give shape to yesterday and today&apos;political options and work out new ones.     As I see it, thisis the main task at the present time.If we succeed in this, the European concept will be preservedonce and for all and because of this the future of our peoplesassured.I remain firmly convinced - as do the great majority of ourfellow-citizens - that we can only really develop if we havecommon policies in most sectors.Efforts to reach an agreement on vital questions of internationalpolicy and concertation on security are the basis of our policywhich aims at safeguarding our identity.     They are indispensable to Europe if a better world is to be built.The aim of European Union should be to overcome the age-oldconflicts which are often artificially maintained between
Nation-States, to build a more humane society in which, along with mutual respect for our national and cultural origins, theaccent will he placed more on the factors uniting us than on those dividing us.Such a Europe could awaken new hope in everyone and could be th^focal point in an ideal and significant resurgence.Any discussion which the European Council may wish to hold on my report should lead to a commitment to achieve by appropriatedecisions the qualitative change characteristic of european union.I am convinced that after a detailed study of this report youwill feel able to endorse its objectives and ensure that theyare carried out.

rChapter I.     A   COMrOf   VISION   OP  european.     Europe TodayWhy has the European concept lost a lot of its forceand initial impetus? I believe that over the years theEuropean public has lost a guiding light, namely the politicalconsensus between our countries on our reasons for undertakingthis joint task and the characteristics with which we wish toendow it. Ve must first of all restore this common vision ifwe wish to have European Union.In 1975 the European citizen does not view&apos; the reasons forthe construction of Europe in exactly the same way as in 1950.The European idea is partly a victim of its own successes:the reconciliation between formerly hostile countries, theeconomic prosperity due to the enlarged market, the detentewhich has taken the place of the cold war, thanks particularly to our cohesion, all this seems to nave been achieved andconsequently not to require any more effort.    Europe today-is part of the general run of things;   it seems to have lostits air of adventure.Our peoples are concerned with new problems andvalues scarcely mentioned by the Treaties.     They realise that political union does not automatically follow fromeconomic integration: too many fruitless discussions castdoubt on the credibility and topicality of our joint endeavour-vour:*   to this extent the European idea ia also a victim, ofits failures.In this state of mind we plunged into a crisis and areexperiencing rates of inflation ana unemployment the likesof which have never been seen by the present generation.It is therefore hardly surprising if the Community iscrumbling beneath the resurgence, which is felt everywhere, .of purely national preoccupations.    Especially as theCommunity, in its present state, is unbalanced:   in some fieldsit has been given far-reaching powers, in others nothing, orpractically nothing, has been done, very often because ourStates were too weak to undertake anything new:   the fragilenature of Europe must surely be a reflection of the powerless-ness of our States.An unfinished structure does not weather well:   it mustbe completed, otherwise it collapses.    Today Communityattainments are being challenged.Basically, however, Europeans are still in favour ofoloser links between our peoples as laid down in the treaties of Paris and Rome, first between the Six, later between the nine.   They even take this rapprochement as a matter of course and regret not having more evidence of it in their daily lives.
A return to selfish national attitudes, to national barriers,and to the antagonisms which they have frequently engendered wouldbe seen as an historic defeat, the collapse of the efforts of awhole generation of Europeans.If this extensive will for rapprochement is to take on apolitical dimension vital to ensure that action is taken, Europemust find its place again among the major concerns of publicopinion thus ensuring that it will be the focal point of thepolitical discussions of tomorrow.    We must listen to our people.What do the Europeans want?   What do they expect from a unitedEurope?1.     A voice in the world.During my visits I was struck by the widespread feeling thatwe are vulnerable and powerless.     This is a new experience forour peoples in recent history.     Inequality in the distributionof wealth threatens the stability of the world economic system;exhaustion of resources weighs heavily on the future of industrialsociety;   the international is at ion of economic life makes our system of prodtiption ever more dependent.     Our States seem veryweak to face these challenges alone.     What weight do isolatedvoices have unless they are those of the Super Powers?And yet the will to make an active contribution is still very strong as we can see from the 100,000 young Europeans whoare working in co-operation programmes throughout the world.Our peoples are conscious that they embody certain values whichhave had an inestimable influence on the development ofcivilisation.     Why should we cease to spread our ideas abroadwhen we have always done so?    Which of us has not been surprisedto see the extent to which the European identity is an acceptedfact by so many of the foreigners to whom we speak?     It is notonly from within that there is a call to the countries of europe to unite.Our peoples expect the European Union to be, where and whenappropriate, the voice of Europe.     Our joint action must be themeans of effectively defending our legitimate interests,&quot; it must provide the basis for real security in a fairer world, and enable us to take part in this dialogue between groups which is apparen-tly a new aspect of international life.     How can we reconcilethese requirements in today *e world if we do not unite?Europe must guard against isolation, against turninginwards on itself which would reduce it to a footnote in history,end also against the subjection and narrow dependence whichwould prevent it from making its voice heard.     It mustrecover some control over its destiny.   - It must build atype of society which is ours alone and which reflects the valuesWhich are the heritage and the common creation of our peoples.
2.   A new societyWe all feel that our society is in the state of anxiousexpectancy and conflict which is the forerunner of major changes.   New and sometimes contradictory scales of valuesare making their appearance in all fields of sccial life.The task of the present generation is to seek a transitionto a post-industrial society which respects the &quot;basic values of our civilisation and reconciles the rights of the individualwith those of the community.   If we fail our democracies willbe at risk and our children will inherit a decadent society.Despite the sometimes radical divergencies   ih thesolutions advocated there does exist a minimum consensus ofopinion between the democratic forces in Europe on the natureof the changes required.   A new type of economic growthdisplaying more respect for the quality of life and the physical and human environment and better able to reconcileeconomic and social objectives.   Growth which is oriented  *towards highly specialised activities and makes full use ofthe skills available in Europe, management and organisationalcapacities in the most advanced and complex fields of humanactivity; this is our One specific advantage in the inter-national economy: Europe&apos;s &quot;grey gold&quot;.   Finally, the develop-ment of individual personal responsibility in the social andeconomic sphere by associating workers with the decisionmaking, the management or profits of undertakings, bygreater freedom in the organisation of work, by more openness,decentralisation and consultation in public administration.Our peoples expect European Union to embody and promote the development of our society in the way foreseen above,toprovide a new authority to compensate for the reduced powerof national structures and to introduce reforms and controls which often cannot be implemented at state level, to give anorganic form to the existing solidarity of our economies, ourfinances and our social life.   Europe can and must identifyitself with the concerted and better controlled pursuit of thecommon good with economic resources being reoriented towardsthe collective interest, a reduction in regional and socialinequalities, decentralisation and participation in decisionmaking.   We will then have created a new type of society, amore democratic Europe with a greater sense of solidarity andhumanity.3.   A positive solidarityNo one wants to see a technocratic Europe.   European Unionmust be experienced by the citizen in his daily life.   It must make itself felt in education and culture, news and communications,it must be manifest in the youth of our countries, and in leisuretime activities. It must protect the rights of the individual and strengthen democracy through a set of institutions which havelegitimacy conferred upon them by the will of our peoples,The image of Europe must be in line with its motivations and opportunities, it must demonstrate to those within and withoutthe solidarity of our peoples and the values of our society.   Iam convinced that this Europe, a progressive Europe, will lackneither power nor impetus.
The basic choice made by the Founding Fathers of europe and embodied in the Treaties of Rome and Paris was to bringabout an ever closer union between our peoples.     Thisoption is still open to us.     In the face of the internal and external challenges of our society felt by the whole ofEurope six countries initially and then nine decided to fightback by joining forces.The 1972 and 197^ Paris Conferences decided thatEuropean Union was the best means of doing this at thepresent stage of the construction of Europe.As the aims and nature of European Union are no longervery clear the first task of our governments is to decideprecisely within   the European Council what are the impli-cations and consequences of these choices.     It is now up tothe European Council to decide on the general form which thejoint endeavour is to take during the Union phase.     The timeto enshrine in a legal text all the changes which have beengradually made to the European structure will be when theprocess Of building the Union has acquired its own momentum.As a result of my consultations in all our countries Ipropose that the European Council should define the differentcomponents of European Union as follows:1.     European Union implies that we present a united frontto the outside world.     We must coordinate our actionin all- the main fields of our external relations whetherit is a question of foreign policy, security, economic relations or development aid.   Our   aim is to defendour interests but also to use our collective strength to support whatever is just and legal in world discussions.2.     European Union recognises the interdependence of theeconomic prosperity of our States and accepts the con-Sequences of this:   a common economic and monetary policy to   manage     this prosperity, common policies in the industrial and agricultural sector and onenergy and research to safeguard the future.3-     European Union requires the solidarity of our peoplesto be effective and adequate.     Regional policy willcorrect inequalities in development and counteract thecentralising effects of industrial societies.     Socialaction will mitigate inequalities of income and encourage society to organise itself ina fairer and more humane fashion.4.     European Union makes itself felt in people1s dailylives.     It helps to protect their rights and toimprove their life style.5-     In order to achieve these tasks European Union is given
institutions with the necessary powers to determinea common, coherent and all-inclusive political view, theefficiency needed for action, the legitimacy needed for democratic control.    The principle of the equality of all our States continues to be respected within theUnion by each State&apos;s right to participate in politicaldecision making.6.     Like the Community whose objectives it pursues and whose attainments it protects European Union will be built gradually.    So as to restart the constructionof Europe straight away and increase its credibilityits initial basis is      the political commitment ofthe States to carry out specific actions in fieldsselected according to their importance and the chances of success.The different facets of European Union described above are closely connected.     The development of the Union&apos;external relations cannot occur without a parallel develop-ment of common policies internally.    Neither can be achieved without consolidating the authority and effectiveness of  commoninstitutions.     Ih this vast scheme everything goes together and it is the sum of the progress achieved lit parallel whichconstitutes the qualitative change which is European Union.The rest of this report will examine in each of the fieldsreferred to the aim and the first positive actions which need to be and can be taken.The general framework which I propose should be adoptedby the European Council must serve as guidelines for our efforts to build Europe.     The will of our States, expressedin this way, is based on the deep-seated motivations of publicopinion and can convey to it the guiding light of our common action. ,The political consequences of these choices must be 1carefully assessed.     They cannot occur without a transferof competences to common institutions.   They cannot occur withouta transfer of resources from prosperous to less prosperousregions.    They cannot occur without restrictions, freelyaccepted certainly? but then enforced unreservedly.     Thisis the price of Union.    But what price would we pay forinaction?     The crumbling away of the Community, voicesisolated and often going unheard on the world stage, -less    * and less control over our destiny, an unconvincingEurope without a future.
Chapter II       EUROPE IK THE WORLDOur States 1 reasons for presenting a united front in world discussions are convincing from an objective point ofview: they stem from power relationships and the size of theproblems.   From a subjective point; of view they are felt very strongly by our peoples: our vulnerability and our relativeimpotence are in the thoughts of everyone.   The convergenceof these two factors means that external relations are one ofthe main reasons for building Europe, and make it essential for the European Union to have a.i external policy.A.   A single decision-making; centreThe examination of our possibilities for action in theworld should be based on one obvious fact: the increasingintermeshing of different sectors of international activity.As described in the preceding chapter the European union should not only be concerned with foreign policy in the traditional sense, including security aspects, nor solelywith tariff and trade policies which are already commonpolicies by virtue of the Treaty of Rome, but also with allexternal economic relations.   The traditional distinctionsmaintained by diplomatic chanceries in this field makeincreasingly less sense in the modern world.   The recentdevelopment of international life shows that economic,industrial, financial and commercial questions will allin the future be the subject of negotiations, the significance of which will be highly political.    If the European Union didnot have the means to cover all aspects of our external relations it would not be equal to its task.   The Union musthave an overall, coherent outlook and plan of action.   Ipropose that the European Council should now decide:.a) to put an end to the distinction   which still existstoday between ministerial meetings which deal with political cooperation and those which deal with the subjects covered by the Treaties: in order to decide on a policy the Ministers must be able to consider all aspects of the problems within the Council.b) that the institutions of the Union can discuss allproblems if they are relevant to European interestsand consequently come within the ambit   of the Union.The existence of a single decision making centre doesnot mean that there will be confusion between those activities which today are the responsibility of the Community andpolitical cooperation activities.   The nature of the problemsdoes not mean that they must all be treated in the same way.Coherence of activity     on the other hand which is essentialrequires that&apos;the different aspects of the often complexproblems which the European Union will have to examine bedealt with together, at least at ministerial level, by thesame people and in the same place.
With this in mind I propose changing the political commit-ment of the Member States which is the basis of politicalcooperation into a legal obligation.     A very short protocoltaking up paragraph 11 of the Copenhagen Eeport (*) ought togive competence to the Council and thus clarify the legalframework in which it is to operate.The development of new policies on the basis of the treaties does not cause any particular problem:   theprovisions binding us are clear and there are-numerousprecedents.    The same thing does not apply in.fields not covered by the Treaties.     The way in which future develop-ments are to take place must be specified here,B.     Towards a common foreign policy&quot; In those fields of foreign relations not covered by the treaties the Nine nowadays coordinate their policies, and inrecent years this arrangement has been extended and has met with considerable success.    Such an arrangement would not,,however, be adequate within the framework of the european union.    It explicitly incorporates within its structure thepossibility of failure:   the pursuit of different policieswhenever coordination has not been achieved.    The Europeanidentity will not be accepted by the outside world so longas the European States appear sometimes united, sometimesdisunited.European Union obviously implies, within the fieldscovered by the Union, that the European States should presenta   united   front,      otherwise the term would be meaningless.The coordination of policies, which is important during a transitional period, must therefore gradually.make way for ..common policies, which means that our States must he able todraw up a common policy and act together within the framework of the European Union.(*)   This paragraph reads as follows: 1&quot;Governments will consult each other on all importantforeign policy questions and will work out priorities,observing the following criteria:the purpose of the consultation is to seek commonpolicies on practical problems;the subjects dealt with must concern European interestswhether in Europe itself or elsewhere where the adoptionof a common position is necessary or desirable.On these questions each State undertakes as a general rule not to take up final positions without prior consultationwith its partners within the framework of the politicalcooperation machinery.
Chapter V of this report gives details on the respectiveroles of the European institutions in the formulation andimplementation of a common foreign policy.   Here suffice itto say that the European Council has a vital role to play inmaking general policy statements based on global politicalconcepts, without which there can be no common policy.   Thepolitical decision, which is the application of agreedgeneral policy statements to the realities of everyday lifeshould be the responsibility of the Council.The main difference between coordinated policies, asformulated at present, and a common external policy, whichdistinguishes the Union, does not arise from the kind ofprocedure adopted or the nature of the relevant institution.It depends on the obligation to reach a common point of view.The States will undertake to define the broad guidelines foi-their policy within the European Council. On this basis, theCouncil will then have the obligation to reach a commondecision on specific questions. This obviously means that the minority must rally to the views of the majority at theconclusion of a debate.In order to provide the necessary impetus to thedynamic process of European Union, our States must now undertake the political commitment to pursue a common foreign policywithin a given number of specific fields, selected inrelation to their importance and the practicability offulfilling them.   During the gradual evolution of the Unionthis political commitment will have to be extended to all important aspects of our external relations.C.     Immediate positive actionWhen defining its foreign relations, the european union must approach major world problems as well asproblems arising in its own area simultaneously.   Owing totheir basic importance, four of these must be of foremostconcern to us:a new world economic order;relations between Europe and the United States;security;the crises occurring within Europefs immediategeographical surroundings.When dealing with such complex problems it is unavoidable that certain decisions should be subject toprovisions of the Treaty while others are not.    In thesecases of joint responsibility, common policies will have tobe based concurrently both on the provisions of the treaty and on provisions arising from Member States&apos; politicalcommitment mentioned above.
1.    A new world economic orderOur external relations with countries of the ThirdWorld are, and will continue to be, dominated by theproblem of sharing the world1 a economic resources and,to a lesser extent, by the after-effects of the colonial era.These questions affect our economic relations, our supplies,&apos;our cooperative effort and, finally, the solidarity of mankind and world stability.   This is therefore one of thoseeomplex situations in which the voice of Europe must makeitself heard.Furthermore&apos;, there is every indication that this isa field in which the Nine can and must formulate a common external policy without delay since:the main negotiations have not yet really begun;they will take place between groups of countries,and, in such circumstances, bilateral diplomatic relations, however   close they may be, solve nothing,whereas the e.c. has acquired valuable experience throughthe . Yaounde and Lome Agreements;the divergences of opinions and interests among the nine, which are unavoidable when dealing with sovast a subject, are not insuperable, as has been shown recently by the common stand   adopted at the7th Special Session of the UN General Assembly, andin the preparations for the Conference on international economic Cooperation;even without a new political commitment, the respect for Community authority, the requirements of politicalaction and the defence of our common interests, call for a very high degree of cooperation and oommon actionon our part.The Nine are already making serious efforts to present a united front at major negotiations ahead, and the European council meeting held in Home in December 1975 has, in this respect,produced some encouraging results.   Our countries have taken the initiative on joint negotiations in the Lome Agreement,the Euro-Arab dialogue and in Mediterranean policies.I propose, first, that we should decide:that come what may we present a united front at multilateralnegotiations relating to a new world economic order,at the various gatherings where these take place, andin the implementation of their conclusions.   Thismeans that we shall, in every case, place the primaryinterest of joint action above our divergent opinionsand interests that we shall designate, as the need arises, the delegates responsible for pursuing such policies onour collective behalf.
I propose that decisions should then be taken:to strengthen the instrument of our common action by gradually transferring to the Community asubstantial part of national appropriationsintended for development cooperation (major development projects, food aid, financial aid),and in coordinating the remainder of our activities in this field.to complement this approach by adopting a commonstand on general political problems which could arise in our relations with the Third World.If these decisions are taken, we shall dc facto bepursuing a common external policy in most of our relationswith the Third World.2.     Relations between Europe and the United StatesBelations with the United States, who are at one and the same time our allies, our partners and occasionallyour competitors, raise problems of vast proportions for theEuropean Uriion.   They are of prime importance in thepolitical field, in defence, in economic affairs, not onlyon account of the interdependence of United Stages and european economies, but also because of the joint responsibilityof these two industrial centres for the world economy, a responsibility which the Rambouillet meeting of December 1975has once again underlined.The need for Europe to speak with one voice in its relations with the United States is one of the underlyingreasons for the construction of Europe.   A constructivedialogue between the European Union, conscious of its identity,and the leading Western political, economic and military power,is necessary without delay.   Its usefulness has been recog-nised by the document on the European Identity adopted atthe Conference of Heads of Governments at Copenhagen inDecember 1973-   Only in this manner-,, as part of thedevelopment of the Union,shall We be able to establishrelations with the United States based on the principle of equality, free of any    sense of inferiority, which reflectsat the same time both what is common in our basic values,interests and responsibilities, and the differences in thedestinies of our two regions.It is doubtful whether the European States can have a strictly identical appreciation of relations between theUnited States and Europe so long as their respective analysesof the problems of defence are noticeably divergent.   Thisquestion must however be examined frankly and in detail with the object of laying down certain principles and rules
determining the content of and procedures for cooperationbetween Europe and the United States.In this context I propose that the European council should take the initiative to delegate one of its members to hold talks with the United States to arrive ata common understanding of the nature and scope of relations between that great Power and theEuropean Union.3.     Security ____By virtue of the Atlantic Alliance we in Europeenjoy a measure of security and stability which has .enabled us to undertake the construction of Europe.As soon as our States recognise the existence of a commondestiny, the security of one member will necessarilyaffect the security of others.   No foreign policy candisregard threats,whether actual or potential, and thepossibility of having to meet them.   Security cannot therefore be left outside the scope of the European Union.On the other hand, the Conference on security andCooperation in Europe has shown, if that was necessary,that in matters of security, political, military,economic factors and other factors such as those affectinghuman relations, closely eVerlap. - ....During the gradual development of the European tJhion,the Member States will therefore have to solve theSroblems of maintaining their external security.. European,nion will not be complete until it has drawn up a common defence policy.Meanwhile) I note that our States are not reallyat present in a position to determine the general policywithout which no common defence policy is possible, andare unlikely to be able to do so in the near future. Butthis does not mean that nothing should be done, and i therefore propose that we should decide;regularly to hold exchanges of views on specificproblems in   defence   matters   and on Europeanaspects of multilateral negotiations on security.Exchanges of views of this kind will one dayenable Member States to reach a common analysis Ofdefence problems and, meanwhile, to take account. of their respective positions in any action they take.
-       to cooperate in the manufacture of armamentswith a view to reducing defence costs, and increasing European independence and thecompetitiveness of its industry.    The measures taken so far to provide the European countries of the Alliance with an organisation for thestandardisation of armaments, on the basis of joint programmes, will have important con-sequences for industrial production.   Thisstrengthens the need to initiate a commonindustrial policy on the manufacture of armaments. within the framework of the European Union.Setting up a European armaments agency for thatpurpose must be given, consideration.- piOn,the question of detente the Nine have alreadysucceeded, through political cooperation, in out-lining joint positions that have enabled them, duringthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,to defend identical points of view.   This practicemust obviously be pursued and generalised.    It willalso have to include that element of obligation whichdistinguishes a common policy from mere coordination.It will have to be extended, during the gradualdevelopment of the Union, to all the problems whichplay an important role in the general field ofdetente, including agreements on economic cooperationand the increase of human contacts.The development of a detente policy in Europepresupposes that all those with whom we negotiate recognise the European Union as an entity.   Our resolveto act together in the field of external relationsis a reality in Europe today; it will be even more so in the future and all states, including thosewhich today still hesitate to do so, will then haveto recognise that fact.
k* Crises in the European RegionThe political problems which arise within our immediategeographical surroundings, that is to say   in Europe and inthe Mediterranean area, have a particular significance forthe European Union,     The credibility of our undertakingrequires that in this field, where our interests are greatest,we should from now on be united, that is to say, that we shouldacoept the constraints   imposed by a common policy.In the last two years, political cooperation has enabled the Nine- to adopt common positions on questions such as thecrises in the Middle Sast, Cyprus and Portugal and their -political action has often been expressed through the Conmunity.In effect, our States tend to prefer common action.   Indeed, the increasing political weight of the Nine, when they are united,and their&apos;common interests in lessening potential sources of conflict in their immediate surroundings, tend to induce ourcountries to act together, and will do so increasingly.I therefore propose that we decide to make what has been the constant practice in recent years into a general rule, that is tosay, to lay down a common policy and to act together within thisframework, with the constraints that this entails, wher-ever   important political problems or crises arise in Surope orin the Mediterranean area.      xX 4In the strictly political field of external relations the3uropean Union must, independently of the specific situationsmentioned above, carry on the kind of cooperation begun in 1970tin til the natural evolution of their undertaking leads member states to accept the more restrictive formula of a common policy.We must assert the European Identity in all internationalpolitical discussions, as the Nine have been doing, with increasingsuccess at the United Rations.     We must define our relations with countries belonging to other continents some of which, such asChina, Canada and Japan     show    increasing sympathy for the task of European unification.In Europe, we must pay particular attention to those european countries which have a democratic system similar to ours.     VTeshould establish relations with them which make it possible totake account of their interests pnd their points of* view -.:henformulating the union political decisions, and also to obtain their understanding and their support for our actions.   The habit of such informal cooperation will&quot;, in due course, facilitate the accession of there States Tfishin^ to join.\!e should s;ive greater joint consideration then in the p?.st tothose problens of our external relations which bear;- upon theEuropean Union in the medium tern.     I propose that the ministers for Foreign Affairs should submit suggestions to the EuropeanCouncil on hov joint coneideration of such problems car. beundertaken.
Conclusion:Our corrmon action with regard to the outside world cirnot,obviously, bo considered in isolation.     In son? fields thepractical oi-portur-ities for progress will depend on parallelprogress bein  mr.de in building the Union&apos;3 internal stricture:as in the cDce, for example, of monetary and fimr.oiQ.1 questions.The impler.entn.tion cf ccrrror. policies in our external relit.ior.Rpresupposes increased efficiency in the institutional system.Thene&quot;ouest-!;ons are extriined elsewhere in this report, and it isthe pro^rnp--&apos; of 4;he whole which will enr.ble Union to be achieved.Subject to that reservation, the proposals sot out in thirchapter constitute a qualitative change in the nature andintensity of our relations, and this is what the Union will seek to achieve.In order to ensure such a common front and such common actionin relation to the outside world, our States will gradually wishto submit the greater part of their external relations problerasto a cor.non policy, and they will accept the constraintsimposed in consequence.     In order to ,rive the necessary newimpulse to the dynamic process of Union, they should now take, ina number of selected sectors, certain binding politicalcommitments.     During the gradual development of the rJuropeanUnion, these will hcve to be enshrined in legal obligations whichwill confirm the nualitative changes which the Union see^s to achieve.     In the Very important field of our external relations the European Union will then hive become a living reality.
Chapter III     EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICIESSince 1969, the Conferences of Heads of Governments haveaffirmed the desire to consolidate the Community-by establishingan. Economic and Monetary Union.   It was an important politicalchoice, made by the highest authorities of our States.However, in recent years the Community has not progressedin this important field, and unless it does so European union will be meaningless.   The adverse international.economic.andfinancial circumstances are not the only caueei these couldequally well have induced a burst of activity.As pointed out in the report of the working group. chairedby M.Marjolin, the failure is also the result of two other causes: a failure of political will, and inadequate understandingboth of what an Economic and Monetary Union is meant to be andof. the conditions necessary for the creation and operation ofsuch a Union.In the first chapter of this   report   I emphasised the need to re-establish first of all a political consensus on the scope and consequences of our commitments.   With regard to economic and social questions, this consensus relates to:- a common economic and monetary policy;- sectoral policies;- a social policy and a regional policy.A.     Economic and monetary policy.     The present situationIn the course of my consultations in the various countries of the Community, those with whom I spoke everywhere recognised the need for European economic and monetary policy.   Everyoneagrees that this question is the crux of the internal developmentof the Union, and that isolated initiatives which may be takenin related fields, such as regional or industrial.policy, willbe meaningful only if a solution to the central issue is found.On the other hand, up to now no one has claimed to have found asolution which could be accepted by all our States.I am not in a position to produce a ready-made solution to problems which have long been studied and discussed, and whichmust eventually be settled by the European institutions, themore so since these will have the authority to take decisions and further action.
It seems to me that the situation is as follows:1) Our States confirmed in 1974 their resolve to attainthe objectives they had set themselves at the Paris Conferencein 19?2, which include a common economic and monetary policy.2) Today, however, there is no genuine political consensusto establish this common economic and monetary policy, doubtlessbecause of the absence of adequate mutual confidence to permit the transfer to common institutions of the powers which it isessential to grant them.3) There is also no genuine technical consensus on themanner in which a common economic and monetary policy shouldbe achieved.   After years of discussions no solution has emerged from the experts&apos;debates.4-) Added to this indecision there are the known objectiveeconomic and financial difficulties Doth at Community and worldlevel.5) The progress which it is possible and necessary to make,on the basis of a new approach to the problem, which I will mentionlater, falls short of what is required to make, in this field,that qualitative change which distinguishes European Union.In fact, there is no agreement on how to achieve a commoneconomic and monetary policy, nor is there even any sustaineddiscussion of the subject.   And yet this is a basic requirement for achieving a European Union.In the present state of affairs, no real progress can beexpected.   This situation cannot persist without causing the credibility of our Governments to be questioned when they asserttheir support for a European Union.I therefore propose that the European Council should now:(a) revive discussions within the Institutions on themanner in which a common economic and monetary policycan be achieved and its role in the European Union.During this policy discussion no proposals should be set aside a priori.(b) without waiting for the results of these discussions,instigate positive progress along the road selected in1969.In order to revive the discussions and give some indication of how positive progress can be made, I will now examine:- a new approach to the problems;- its practical application by the development of the &quot;Snake&quot;;- the road to follow to make further progress.
2,     A new approachIt is impossible at the present time to submit a credibleprogramme of action if it is deemed absolutely necessary thatin every case all stages should he reached by all the states at the same time.   The divergence of their economic and financialsituations is such that, were we to insist on this progress would be impossible and Europe would continue to crumble away.It must be possible to allow that:- within the Community framework of an overall concept ofEuropean Union as defined in this report and acceptedby the Nine,- and on the basis of an action programme drawn up in afield decided upon by the common insitutions, whoseprinciples are accepted by all,1) those States which are able to progress have a duty toforge ahead,2) those States which have reasons for not progressingwhich the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, acknowledgesas valid do not do so,- but will nonetheless receive from the other States anyaid and assistance that can be given them to enable them,to catch the others up,- and will take part, within the joint institutions, in assessing the results obtained in the field in question.This does not mean &quot;Europe a la carte&quot;t each country willhe bound by the agreement of all as to the final objective to beachieved in common; it is only the time scale a for achievementwhich vary.This system which accepts that there should temporarily hea greater degree of integration between certain members is not without analogy in the Community: Article 233 of the Treaty of Romespecifically provides for it in the case of the Benelux countries and the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union.   The system could, asmatters turn out, be of great assistance in enabling the processof development of the Union to regain its momentum, albeitimperfectly.X therefore propose that the European Council should adoptthe following guidelines:- bearing in mind the objective difficulties of certainStates, progress as regards economic and monetary policymay be sought initially between certain States inaccordance with Community practices, and with the limitations mentioned above.
Ifi.- the &quot;Community Snake&apos; which lies at the heart of monetarystability should be the starting point for this action.The Snake must be consolidated and then extend its actionto fields which it does not cover today.3.     The &apos;Snake&apos;The machinery of the Snake, which has proved itself by maintaining the stability of exchange rates, must be used to seek a convergence of economic and monetary policies between thoseStates which are in a position to achieve it.   In order to do this the Snake must:- be consolidated,- extend its action to the key aspects of economic and monetary policy,- be of a distinctly Community nature.To this end, I propose the following:1) Today the Snake operates and is controlled partly outsidethe Community.   In future this must happen within the commoninstitutions in accordance with procedures to be agreed upon.Without actually taking part in the management of the Snake thosemember countries not belonging to it will be brought into discussions so as to avoid increasing divergence and enable anyopportunities for alignment to be seized.   Community operationof the Snake is all the more imperative in that it constitutes the departure point for a policy which will later be extended toall members of the Community thus having a beneficial effect on trade as a whole within the Community.2) At present the Snake only lays down obligations in thefield of external monetary policy.   Its operation is thereforeprecarious and unbalanced.   Identical restraints must be accepted in the field of:- internal monetary policy: control of money supply- budgetary policy: extent and financing of deficits.- key aspects of economic policy as regards the short-term economic situation and the control of inflation.3) Within the framework of the Institutions, the systemmust provide for procedures enabling joint decisions to be reacnedon alterations in pivotal exchange rates.   Kember States notbelonging to the Snake must be brought into these discussions.Those countries belonging to the Snake would undertake to with-draw from it only in cases of &apos;manifest crisis&apos; as establishedby a joint decision.A) Along with these obligations, machinery for short and medium-term support between members of the Snake must be madeautomatic and considerably strengthened.   This means increasingthe activity and effectiveness of the European MonetaryCo-operation Fund which must become the embryo for a Europeancentral bank, in particular by some pooling of reserves.
5) Those countries in the Snake must gradually abolish the remaining obstacles to the free movement of capital betweenthem, in particular those set up since 1970, which onlydemonstrate how the process of integration has deteriorated.6) Finally, measures must be worked out to assist thosecountries not in the Snake to join.   The measures cannot be defined in abstracto and will not be automatic.   They will bedetermined case by case.   These measures will also include thosein the structural field, by means of regional, social, industrial and agricultural policies.   In connection with the developmentsexplained in previous paragraphs it is important to keep inmind the interests of the countries not taking part in the Snakein order to facilitate their future participation.   Hence theneed to discuss these developments within a Community framework.Thus consolidated and extended, the nucleus of monetarystability existing today becomes the basis for a real convergenceof economic and monetary policies.Strengthening the Snake will also be of direct help ingradually restoring greater international monetary stability.The first step in restoring this stability is to form significantzones of stability within which stable exchange rates can bemaintained.This strengthening will enable us to seek a betterco-ordination of economic and monetary policies between largeblocs with the aim of reducing the fluctuations, which in therecent past have been excessive, between leading currencies or groups of currencies and more particularly between the Snakeand the dollar.   In this connection the European MonetaryCo-operation Fund should gradually be made responsible for the intervention policy of the Snake vis-a-vis the dollar.Consolidation of the Snake will enable the Community to take partas such in international financial negotiations.4.     The search for a common policy the new approach, set out above, and its practical applicatiorto the Snake will not   by   itself  lead to the formation of acommon economic and monetary policy.   It is a starting point fromwhich a certain amount of progress can be made, and which canserve as a prelude to the important stages which will remain tobe reached.   The latter must be discussed within the Institutions.In steering this discussion we must learn from the past.For my own part I would draw the following conclusions from ourpast failures:a) Comprehensiveness and interdependence of solutionsThe approach problems raised must be comprehensive. If,as nustbe the casej progress is made in stages, each stage must involvea balanced set of measures in the field of economic policy as wellas monetary policy.
?.o.The interdependence of solutions also means that the automatic implementation of measures for giving aid or mutual assistance   which is of necessity part and parcel of any economic and Monetary Union, is directly bound up with anacceptance of the constraints which this union involves.?^S-irrSXSE5i^ili y-2 -*lie.55 ^i5 ryEven though equilibrium is sought at   each stage, it is inevitable that certain States should feel they are takinggreater risks than others, be it that they have less to gain in the immediate future or that they stand to lose more.To carry conviction, progress must be irreversible.   Thegeneral political benefits from definite progress towards astrong, integrated European Union will offset any short-terndisadvantage, be it real or imaginary, which a particular state has to face.   This means that the policy of * small steps&apos; cannotalways apply; sometimes a large step&apos; must be taken.It seems to me that this is the basis on which we shouldresume discussion of the problems involved in setting up anEconomic and Monetary Union.   The Werner Keport adopted by theCouncil set out the problems and the solutions which should beconsidered.   It must continue to form the basis for our discussions, along with the ideas which have been put forwardsince its adoption.   I am thinking in particular of the various proposals to create a European currency, which would on the face of it have a considerable political and psychological import.whatever happens, achieving Economic and Monetary Union inthe difficult circumstances we are facing at present will be alengthy business.   For this reason I have proposed positive steps which can be taken in the immediate future on the basis of a new approach.   These steps will lead to a degree of integrationwhich is doubtless imperfect but which will make it easier totake the &apos;large steps&apos; which at some point will have to be taken.However, these positive steps can only take on their fullsignificance as part of a long-term vision setting out a programme which is ambitious and at the same time realistic.   TheEuropean Council must lend its authority to this.   I suggestthat the Commission should submit an annual report to theEuropean Council on progress made in the search for a commoneconomic and monetary policy and that it should propose whichnew steps could successfully be taken.   This report could serve as preparation for an annual debate in Parliament on the stateof the Union.fiSc 2E5l.22ii i BWithin the framework of organised convergence of economicand monetary policies, the European Union must undertake specificprojects to guarantee the dynamism, profitability and future ofour productive apparatus in those sectors where action taken by our States is today often inappropriate or inadequate.
In the industrial field this means collectively safe-guarding our innate capacity for innovation and advanced technology, since this alone can safeguard our future prosperityin the world economy.It also means pursuing Community objectives as regardsopening up markets, adherence to the rules on competition, theabolition of   fiscal   barriers and drawing up a statute forthe &quot;European Company.Finally, we must display solidarity in solving the problemsof adapting our productive capacity, which the search for a new world economic order will inevitably raise.In the agricultural field an assessment has just been madeby the Council stressing the strengths and weaknesses of whatis our most highly developed and most integrated form of common action. Agricultural policy reflects one of the aspects ofEuropean Union in that it guarantees farmers income and living standards comparable with those of other groups in society.This objective is one of solidarity and justice.   However, the implementation of this policy cannot be viewed purely in thelight of agricultural problems.I do not think it either possible or useful to include inthis report an inventory of actions to be taken in such avast area.   That will be the job of the Institutions of tne Union.I would like however to set out one or two thoughts on the twosectors which are at the very heart of industrial development and hence our future: energy and research.1*     EnergyCurrent action by the Community both on establishing a community energy policy and on discussing energy problems ina wider international framework is inadequate.   In view of oue independence on outside sources of energy this issue radicallyaffects the stability and security of-our productive industry.European Union implies that a common policy should be worked out in this fundamental sector, and the European Council at Homeopened the way to progress.In order to demonstrate our solidarity and lay the basis for a common policy, I consider that the following decisionsmust be taken:a) to set up      machinery ensuring the solidarity of our states in times of supply difficulties:b) to define at Community level consumption and productiontargets;c) to develop, in the light of these objectives, a programme of alternative resources in the context not of each individualState but of the needs of the Community as a whole.
d) to develop additional production capacity by promotinginvestment and providing the means to safeguard and protectsuch investment;e) to mobilise at Community level the finance needed to achievec) and d) above;f) to establish a Community instrument to organise the energymarket.On the external front, the Conmunity will then be able to pursue a coherent policy, the basis of which will be the achievement of the aims of Community energy policy, both atthe Conference on International Economic Co-operation and in discussions with the other industrialised countries and any futurenegotiation of supply agreements.2.     research the Community&apos;s effort as regards scientific and technological research has cone up against a certain amount ofreticence on the part of national research institutes andindustrial users.   This reticence is caused by special interestsand a lack of confidence.   These must be overcome at all costssince the existence of a common research policy is directlylinked to the maintenance of our competitiveness, that is to sayour internal prosperity and our position in the world.Research policy must not be spread over a range of hetero-geneous and marginal activities.   It must be strictly concentrated on priority sectors determined in the light of three criteria:a) research directly connected with a common policy of the Union,such being the case, for example, with environmental researchwhich is a necessary support and adjunct to a commonenvironment policy.b) research directly connected with a common activity in a specific sector, such as research into alternative sources of energy.c) research too costly to be carried out by an individual state,like, for example, research into controlled thermo-nuclearfusion.In these specific fields the common policy must:- be backed by resources adequate in both quantity and duration for results to be achieved which can be used at the industrial level;* initiate an exchange of information on the activities and results of national programmes, thus avoidingduplication and making generally available the results obtained;- enable small States in particular to take part in workwhich would not be justified at national level.
One of the fundamentals of the European Union, set but inthe first chapter of this report, is the common search within a wider framework for progress towards a modern-society and a formof economic growth which respects human values and social needs.Social and regional policies meet this objective and givesubstance to the solidarity of Europeans by reducing theinequalities which separate them.   In this field I propose thatthe European Council should adopt the following generalguidelines&apos;. r -1*     Social policy ._.______The sine qua non of the social well-being of Europeans iseconomic prosperity guaranteeing full employment in conditionsof better controlled growth.   In this context an economic policywhich leads to greater control over production levels will havean immediate social impact.   The sane applies to environment and consumer protection policies.   Sharing out the benefits of this prosperity by means of taxation, social security and joint investment projects will remain essentially theresponsibility of the States, who can take account of the traditions and facts which vary fron one country to another.The social policy of the Union must manifest itself in specificprojects which give effect at European level to the social aims of our undertaking and which guide and supplement action onthe part of individual States.   Such projects involve thesecurity of the workforce, their involvement in economic decisioa-aaking Qsoncertation) and their participation in companydecisions and company profits. ya) Security __...Supplementing measures already in force within the Community,the Union must lay down standards applicable in all our states as regards wages, pensions, social security and working conditions, laying particular emphasis on the problems ofwomen at work.The Union must afford particular protection to certain categories of workers: migrants, the handicapped.It will thus provide a consensus in matters of socialjustice, without which our States cannot possibly pursue their common undertaking.b) ConcertationThe gradual transfer to the European level of some powersof decision in economic policy matters reflects a step which large firms took long ago.   This parallel development means that the practice of concertation between employers, workers and public authorities which exists to some extent in all ourStates, must also be introduced at European level.
Framework agreements or collective European settlementsmust be reached by means of concertation in individual sectors.This means considerably increasing the activity of theStanding Committee on Employment.   This body will have to be consulted during preparation of the union social policy,and it must be associated with its implementation.   It musthave a right of initiative vis-a-vis the European Institutionsso that, along with the Parliament and the Economic and social Committee, it can act as a spur to the development of thesocial side of the Union.c) Worker participationThe problem of the place of workers in an enterprise arisesperhaps in differing degrees but along similar lines, in all our countries.   In view of the increasing integration ofeconomic units this problem should be solved at the Europeanlevel by increasing worker participation in the management,control or profits of businesses.   This policy fits in withthe search for a more humane just society which lies at the heart of the European effort.xx    xSubsequent developments in the social policy of the Unionmust keep pace with progress in implementing a common economicand monetary policy.   In particular, the operations of theSocial Fund must be increased gradually in&quot;order, along withregional aid, to act as a corrective to any imbalances arising in the Conmunity.   When there has been some progress towardsthe alignment of the economic policies of the Kember countries the internal solidarity of the Union will have to find moreconspicuous expression, in particular in the fight againstunemployment.2.     Regional policy for an integrated economic and monetary unit to operateharmoniously there must be a substantial regional policy to off-set the tendency of the market to concentrate capital and activity in the more competitive areas of the Union.   Such apolicy will satisfy the clear desire in all our countries to revive the regions.This policy must necessarily involve a net transfer of resources from the most prosperous areas of the Community to theless favoured areas.   In part these transfers will be made, as now, through national regional development policies.   However,a large proportion of the transfers will have to be made throughthe Community budget, either directly by means of regionalaids, or indirectly by the effect on economic structures of theagricultural and industrial policies. Regional policy will therefore have to expand gradually in step with progress modein aligning the economic and monetary policies of the member countries.
2b.The regional policy must also be concentrated on the mosteconomically backward areas of the Community.   Funds must be allocated on the basis of objective criteria applicable tothe whole of the Community without national quotas.xX      XCONCLUSION&quot; The common policies referred to in this chapter are the veryessence     of European Union.   They give substance to the solidarity which binds our economies and our currencies.   they give expression to the desire to enable all regions and allsocial classes to share the common prosperity and share power.They aim to restore to us collectively that control over thedevelopment of the economy, industry and energy which istending to slip from our grasp and which is essential if weare to maintain economic activity and employment.   All in all they offer us the instruments which make it possible to strivefor new growth in a more Just, more humane society.Economic and monetary policy which forms its essentialbasis is also its most tricky aspect.   A new approach cannonetheless give results, so long as progress made is seen aspart of a long-term conception, arrived at after thoroughdiscussion and based on true political consensus.This political consensus must also find expression in the approach to economic and monetary problems at-national level.European Union will be on the right track when the Europeandimension is constantly in the minds of the decision-makersin the member States, when European action is no longer thought of as an extension of minor and marginal importance of a national policy based on national interests, when European decisions and action are accepted as the normal means of controlling oursociety and safeguarding the future.   Today we must push asideintellectual barriers.
Chapter IV   A   CITIZEN&apos;S   europe the construction of Europe is not just a form of collaboration between States.     It is a rapprochement ofpeoples who wish to go forward together, adapting theiractivity to the changing conditions in the world whilepreserving those values which are their common heritage.In democratic countries the will of governments alone isnot sufficient for such an undertaking.     The need for it,its advantages and its gradual achievement must be perceivedby everyone so that  effort and sacrifices are freelyaccepted.     Europe must be close to its citizens.The main contribution of the European Union in this field has been described in the previous chapter.Measures taken in connection with the social policy of theUnion, as regards security, concertation and participationwill be directly felt in the daily lives of Europeans.   Theywill emphasise the human dimension of the undertaking.It remains now for me to set out additional courses ofaction.     I propose that we should adopt two:the protection of the rights of Europeans, where this cannot &quot;longer be&quot; guaranteed solely by individual States;concrete manifestation of European solidarity by meansof external signs discernible in everyday life.Without going into detail,   I will simply indicatecertain areas where progress obviously can and must be made.A.    Protection of rights1-     Fundamental rights the gradual increase in the powers of the EuropeanInstitutions which will make itself felt while the Union isbeing built up, will make it imperative to ensure tbat rightsand fundamental freedoms, including economic and social rights,are both recognised and protected.     In this the Union will find confirmation of its political objectives.I propose that the European Council should instruct the institutions to propose how best to set about this recognitionand protection.     The latter must at all events mean thatindividuals will have the right of direct appeal to the Courtof Justice against an act of an Institution in violation ofthese fundamental rights.2.     Consumer rights the Community^ efforts to introduce common standardsfor quality control and marketing must be continued.     Inparticular they must be better motivated and more effectively
put over.     European consumers must be made to understand thatthey are being afforded real protection against the constantpossibility of fraud and other real dangers.     The individualState is no longer always in a position to provide this guaran-tee in a single market where goods are moving freely.The Commission should examine how best to put overjto publicopinion the role of Community rules in consumer protection andshould undertake an extensive consumer information programme in conjunction with the relevant organisations and associationsat national level.3.     Protection of the EnvironmentIt is obvious from the geography of Europe that one person&apos;s environment is also another !s and that its protectioncannot remain an exclusively national matter.In a single market, the constraints which need to be placedon industrial production can only be imposed at European level.The fields where the European Union can and will have.to inter-vene are legion.Because of its topicality I will quote an example of what we should do and make a specific proposal:The European Union should possess a common body responsiblefor regulating and controlling nuclear power stations, withidentical responsibilities and powers to those of the NuclearRegulatory Commission in the United States.     Control shouldbe exerted over the siting, construction and- operation of thepower stations, the fuel cycles and the disposal, of radio-active and thermic waste..The psychological reactions throughout the whole ofEurope against the setting up of nuclear power stations canonly be calmed by the existence of a supervisory body offeringguarantees of strictness, openness and in particular indepen-dence.     These guarantees cannot be found at national level sincemore often than not our States are themselves involved, directly or indirectly, in decisions as to siting and construction.The argument in favour of a European supervisory body is there-fore very cogent:   it is a question of rendering the necessarydevelopment of nuclear energy in Europe acceptable to publicopinion.     This argument is given additional weight by the factthat numerous power stations are planned for frontier zones wherethe problems arising go beyond any national considerations.B.     The external signs of our solidarity1.     As regards movement of persons, measures leading touniformity of passports and later to a passport union are currently under discussion.I propose that in addition the European Union should setas its aim:
- the gradual disappearance of frontier controls on personsmoving between member countries,as a corollary of passportunion;improved transport and communication,if necessary byharmonising rules, and by abolishing tariffs whichdiscriminate between national transport and telecommu-nications and those taking place within the Union;thenir.plificatiaiof procedures for refunding medicalexpenses incurred by Union citizens in another country of the Union.     Existing provisions are inadequatelyunderstood due to their administrative complexity anda lack of information.     This &apos;Health Europe&apos; must begiven life.. The day that Europeans can move about within the Union,can communicate among themselves and when necessary receivemedical care without national frontiers adding to the problemsof distance, European Union will become for them a discerniblereality.2.     Similarly we must encourage greater integration in educational matters by promoting student exchanges.     The aimis to give Europeans of tomorrow a personal and concreteimpression of the European reality and a detailed knowledgeof our languages and cultures since these constitute thecommon heritage which the European Union aims specifically toprotect.I propose that a pragmatic solution should be found tothe delicate matter of the equivalence of diplomas and studiesthis being the main obstacle in the way of integration of educational systems.Our governments shouldffoster bilateral or multilateral agreements betweenuniversities and educational institutions under whichthe latter  would undertake to organise student exchanges- give these agreements a legal status enabling reciprocalrecognition to be given to studies in various sectors.3h this way we would be reviving the zeal for movement and mutual enrichment which intellectual Europe has known inthe past-     In addition there should be initiatives based onthe achievements of the \ Office Franco-Allemand de laJeunesse1.3.     I propose that a serious effort should be made to promotecollaboration between, information media, in particular radio and television, to encourage tne spread of information and better knowledge of each other.Such collaboration will be of particular significance in
the context of direct elections to the European parliament which will provoke throughout Europe an electoral campaignon European themes.i** *Conclusion:The proposals for bringing Europe nearer to the citizenare directly in line with the deep-seated motivations behind the construction of Europe.     ThBy give it its social andhuman dimension.     They attempt to restore to us at Unionlevel that element of protection and control of our societywhich is progressively slipping from the grasp of Stateauthority due to the nature of the problems and the inter-nationalisation of social life.     They are essential to thesuccess of our undertaking in that it is not enough for theCommunity of the future to exist:   it must also be seen to exist.A strenuous effort must be made by the EuropeanInstitutions and by governments to improve the way in which our common activity is presented to public opinion and tolink the daily decisions of the Institutions .to the motiva-tions behind the construction of Europe and to the idea of society which is inherent in it.Some of the additional schemes proposed in this chapterare the responsibility of public authorities:   this appliesfor example to the movement of persons or the protection of human rights.     However, other activities fall within sphereswhere private enterprise normally plays an important role,as in the case of human contacts, youth exchanges and certain aspects of information and culture.With this in mind, I propose that the European council should decide to create a European Foundation, to be financedpartly by subsidies from the Community or the States butwhose activities will to a large extent be financed from private funds.     Its object will be to promote, either directly or by assisting existing bodies, anything whichcould help towards greater understanding among our peoplesby placing the emphasis on human contact:   youth activities,university exchanges, scientific debates and symposia,meetings between the socio-professional categories,cultural and information activities.     This Foundation will
also have a role to play in extending abroad the activitiesof a United Europe.By virtue of its character, this Foundation will often be able to intervene more flexibly and more effectively thannational or European authorities.     It will also offer theinnumerable supporters of European unification in our countriesan opportunity to make a personal contribution by aiding the foundation.     In this manner it will be more clearly apparent that the creation of the Union can and must be a matter forus all.
Chapter V   STRENGTHENING THE INSTITUTIONSThe preceding chapters have described the content ofEuropean Union, a stage which will both prolong and extend to new areas the efforts which have been made over the last25 years.   Ve must now examine how it should work:From the consultations which I have had in each of ourcountries, I have drawn the following conclusions:-. European Union can and must be built upon the institutional bases already accepted by the Member States withinthe framework of the existing Treaties:- This will require an improvement in the performance ofthe Institutions, whose authority has been reduced as is toooften shown by the absence or tardiness of decisions.   Incertain cases this may well necessitate Treaty amendment.Strengthening the institutional machinery is all the more necessary since the tasks which our institutions will undertakeare evidently difficult.   The European Community has integratedmarkets.   The European Union must integrate policy.   Thequalitative change which this vision demands depends upon thedecision-making process, that is to say upon the institutions.A return to intergovernmental co-operation would not help to solve European problems.   Such co-operation tends to underlinethe differences of power and interests between our countries and does not meet our collective needs.   It is therefore acommon institutional machinery which must be reinforced.To achieve European Union we must henceforth be able tofind in the different European institutions the authority needed to define a policy, the efficiency needed for common action andthe legitimacy needed for democratic control.   It also implies that the institutions should have that coherence of vision and ofaction which alone will allow them to define and then.pursue apolicy.   It is with these four criteria of authority, efficiency,legitimacy and coherence in -mind that we must determine what changes should be brought about in the functioning of EuropeanInstitutions.A-     I*l -?3 liS3 5tDirect elections to the Parliament will give.this Assemblya new political authority.   At the same time it will reinforce the democratic legitimacy of the whole European institutionalapparatus.
1.     The Powers of the parliamentary consequence of the Parliament&apos; s new authority will bean increase in its powers, which will take place gradually inthe course of the progressive development of the European Union,notably through a growing exercise of the legislative function.It goes without saying that the Parliament should assume animportant responsibility in the construction of the Union.I propose that:- the Council should immediately allow the Parliamentto take initiatives by undertaking to consider the resolutions which Parliament addresses to it.   This will permit the assembly to make an effective contribution towards defining commonpolicies.- in the course of the progressive development of theEuropean Union this practice should be enshrined in a Treatyamendment which would accord to the Parliament a real right ofinitiative-- Parliament should be able, from now on, to consider all questions within the competence of the Union, whether or not theyderive from the Treaties.&apos;2.     General Policy DebatesThe elected Parliament should influence the general direction of the Union&apos;s activities and focus public attentionby holding large scale political debates*   To enhance theauthority of these debates it is highly desirable that theleaders in each of our countries should be able to take part in them, even if the function that they fulfil at the national level does not in fact allow them to stand for election to theEuropean Parliament.To this end I submit for the Parliament&apos;s consideration the following two proposals:a) The Parliament should organize at least once a year(that is to say, according to the proposals set out below, onceunder each Presidency) a debate on the state of the Union andthe functioning of the institutions.The extension of the competences of the European Union andconsequently those of the European Parliament to mattershitherto discussed in the Assembly of the Western european union, leads one to question the need to maintain the activity of the parliamentary institution of the WEU.
it.b) Invitations to take part in this debate and otherdebates of comparable importance should be extended, both tothe President of the European Council, and to a limited number of leading.politicians who are not members of the European Parliamentchosen according to criteria to be decided.   These invitedpoliticians would be able to address the Parliament.B&quot;     ?^S-?K2E 55-council the institutional structures set up by the Treaties haveshown themselves in practice to be too weak to give the necessarycontinuing political momentum needed for the construction ofEurope.   This is what led the Heads of Government to meet,initially occasionally, and then regularly under the name of&quot;European Council&quot;.- So that the European Council should really bring somethingnew to the functioning of the institutions by strengthening theUnion&apos;s decision-making capacity, I submit to it the followingpropositions defining its role and its method of working:JL. .    The European Council is to make coherent general po^Ictstatements, based on a comprehensive vision ofprpbiems.   Thisis an indispensable precondition for an attempt to produce acommon policy.2.      Within this framework the Heads of Government willcollectively use the authority which they have at the national level to give from within the European Council the   impetus whichis needed for the construction of Europe, and to co-operate inthe search for that political agreement which will allow progress to be maintained, in spite of difficulties. ...5.      To ensure that it functions as an efficient institutionwhile maintaining a large measure of flexibility, theEuropean Council: -..- will, when it takes decisions on Community matters, actin accordance with the forms and procedures prescribed byTreaties.   The presence of the Commission at..European Council meetings is to be the guarantee of this;- in other cases will formulate its decisions or generalpolicy statements in such a way that they can serve asguidelines for those to whom their execution isentrusted.   The European Council will always indicate the Institution or the organisation entrusted withexecuting its decisions;- will at the same time indicate, if necessary, the time-scale for the execution of the decision;- and the preparation of its meetings is to be theresponsibility of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs
&apos;5K,C.     The council the Treaties lay down the powers and the procedures ofthe Council in. the Community field-   When it acts in fields of Union activity not covered by the Treaties, the competence of the Council will derive for the present from the politicalcommitment of the Member States and will later be confirmed bya juridical instrument.To reinforce the authority and efficiency of the Councilits activity should become more coherent, faster and morecontinuous.To this end I have formulated the following proposals:1.     Coherencea) The Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) should beentrusted by a decision of the European Council withco-ordinating in the most appropriate manner the activities ofthe specialist Councils.b) The distinction between ministerial meetings devoted to political co-operation and meetings of the Council should be abolished.   The abolition of this distinction would not howeveraffect the current procedures for preparing the diplomaticdiscussions of the Ministers.2.    SpeedSpeeding up the decision-making process requires greater use of majority mechanisms.a) Recourse to majority voting in the Council should become normal practice in the Community field.b) In those sectors of external relations where the member States have undertaken to pursue a common policy, theymust be able speedily to reach decisions and to act when facedwith a crisis.   This implies that by analogy with the institutional mechanism of the Treaties, minority opinion should,in these sectors, rally to the view of the majority at the endof the discussion,3*     Continuitya) A Treaty amendment should extend to a whole year the term of the Presidency of the European Council and the Councilin order to:- strengthen the authority of the Presidency,*- permit a more coherent dialogue between the parliament and the Council, - --- lend more continuity to its activity.
b) The European Council and the Council should entrustspecial or temporary tasks, like a negotiation or study, tothe Commission, to a single country or to one or more personsindependently of changes in the Presidency. -This should inno way diminish the powers which the Commission derives fromthe Treaties.D.     The commission.     Role of the Commission-Under the terms of the Treaty the Commission can considerablyinfluence the determination of common policies by the proposalswhich it submits to the Council.   It must do this unreservedlyby regularly making the Council aware of its responsibilities.It must not, however, restrict itself to making proposals.It must reassert its freedom   of action within the framework ofagreed Community policies.   This will enable it to add its-ownbrand of dynamism to the building of the European Union.   Thisfreedom of action was best expressed by the powers conferred on th*High Authority of the Coal and Steel Community.   We must followthis example.I suggest that:- Por the execution and administration of common policieswithin the Community greater use should be made of Article 155of the Treaty which makes provision for such powers to be conferreion the Commission.- The European Council should ask both the Commission andthe Council to prepare a report for it on instances where thisprovision could be applied today or in the near future.2.     The cohesion of the CommissionIn order to give the European Commission increased authority and cohesion I suggest that the Treaties be amended as follows:a) The President of the Commission will be appointed bythe European Council.b) The President when appointed will have to appear beforethe Parliament to make a statement and have his appointmentconfirmed by vote.c) The President of the Commission will then appoint his-colleagues in consultation with the Council and bearing in mind the number of Commissioners allocated to each country.While we are waiting for this amendment to be made to the-Treaty I suggest that the President of the Commission which isto come into office on 1 January 1977 should be appointed by theEuropean Council at its second meeting in 1976, that heappear before the Parliament and then help the Member states to prepare for the Council meeting which will appoint the othermembers of the Commission.
E. The Court of JusticeThe Court of Justice stressed in its report on european union that the Community constitutes a &quot;state of law&quot; and thatthis characteristic must he maintained within the Union.   Thisis an essential factor conferring legitimacy upon our under-taking which leads me to formulate the following:a) In the new sectors covered by the Union, the Court musthave powers identical to those which it has at present, if itis to be able to interpret the law of the Union, to annulthe acts of the Institutions not in accordance with the treaties and to point out when the Member States fail to comply with their obligations;b) Individuals must also be able to appeal directly to theCourt of Justice against an act of one of the Institutions ofthe Union infringing their basic rights;c) Once European Union has gained its own momentum weshould examine whether the Community&apos;s current legal system canbe improved or extended: the Court has made proposals about this.F. Joint Community Bodies1.     In Chapter III of this report I indicated how the activitiesof the Standing: Committee on Employment should develop.   this development is in line with the need to introduce into the institutions of the Union elements of concertation and workerparticipation in decision-making with which we are familiar inall our States.2.     The Economic and Social Committee, which is made updifferently, must&quot; carry on its work.   This is of considerableservice to the Community, since it draws representatives from various socio-professional categories into common policy making.It must be regularly consulted on the development of economicand social policy, on consumer protection and on the abolitionof technical   barriers to trade.3.     The important role played by the Committee of permanent representatives (COREPER; in the decision-making machinery of theCommunity must; be officially recognised in the European Union.I suggest that when at COREFER level there is a consensus betweenthe member countries and the Commission on a decision to betaken it should be taken at this level on the authority of theCouncil.   Today these decisions are passed up to the next council meeting which approves them without discussion (in the formof &quot;A points&quot;);      this procedure is legal red tape which wecan do without.The Permanent Representatives must make a real contributionto work on European policy proposals in their own countries, soas to become the indispensable bond between the formation ofnational points of view and the process of joint decision-making.
4.     The Political Committee has proved how effective it is in preparing the diplomatic discussions of Ministers.   The creationof a. single decision-making centre in the form of the Councilmust not change either its powers or its composition.&apos;  - I find however that the pragmatic development of:.the organsof political co-operation has chiefly been designed to work outCommon positions on topical problems.   Ve are equipped to reactrather than to act.   In order to adapt to a situation where therewill be much scope for joint action on external - policy theMinisters of Foreign Affairs will have to see.that^the existing machinery is improved.5.&quot;   The construction of Europe must take into account the-general trend towards administrative decentralisation which exists in all our countries.   The Institutions.of the Union willhave to make sure that specialised executive bodies are set upas required to take on specific tasks.   These bodies will haveto have flexible rules enabling there to be personal responsibility under the aegis of the Institutions..G.     The jleleg^tic^of^ executive power the effectiveness of an institutional system does not justdepend on the powers which are conferred on   the Institutionsbut also on the way in which they are exercised.In this field there is one principle which I.feel isessential if we are to have European Union: that of the delegation-of executive power. D elegation must become thegeneral rule if we wish to develop that degree of &quot;errxciency *whichis vital to the institutional system.   It is.both necessary asa tool of common action and as a visible external sign of oursolidarity.As to the principle of delegation I propose that we^ should actas follows:a) All policy worked out in common should normally be implemented by a body or a person empowered to do-so;b) Consequently every decision should specify theappropriate executive body;c) This executive body should have at its disposal, withinthe framework of a common policy, the necessary freedom ofaction to carry out its mandate properly.The practice of delegation should apply particularly tothe Council.   Because of the increase in common tasks theCouncil, if it is to be efficient, must concentrate on.its decision-making role and adopt the following measures:
&quot;3S.a) in the Community sector:- use Article 155 of the Treaty as described in C above;- delegate some of its power to CQREFER as described inP above;b) in the non-Community sector:- grant real delegation of power, going beyond the role of a mere spokesman,for the daily application of policies worked out together;- enhance the role of the Presidency for this purpose;- use, when circumstances so dictate, the States andtheir diplomatic machinery as authorised agents ofthe Union;- make considerable use of the Community institutionalmachinery which Europe already possesses.The distinction between what does and what does not fall within the scope   of the Community cannot be maintained in an absolute fashion at the executive stage nor at the decision-making stage.The existence of a single decision-making centre supplemented bythe principle of the delegation of executive power will enable us politically to make the best use of the available executivebodies, while still adhering to the Treaties,and will give our action the flexibility necessary to deal with complex situations.CONCLUSION:The qualitative change connected with European Union and emphasised in each of the chapters of this report is also foundin the institutional field.&quot; It does not necessarily mean anupheaval of the existing institutional framework.   But it doesmean increasing its authority, its efficiency, its legitimacy andits coherence.Much that is already under consideration within theCommunity points in this direction, in particular directelections to the Parliament and the completion of the system ofown resources which will be in force before 1980.   As provision has already been made for these I did not think there was any point in dealing with them here, but I want to emphasise theirsignificance and the need for them.The enhancement of the role of the European Council and the parliament, the extension of the use of majority decision-making and the co-ordination of the Council&apos;s activities, theincreased influence and cohesion of the Commission, the delegation of executive power are the chief measures which mustbe taken immediately if European Union is to progress.
In the last resort the institutional framework willreflect the spirit behind it.   It is the political consensus ofour States described in the first chapter of this report whichmust give new life to the common institutions.   The belief thatthe Union is vital and necessary will enable us to overcomeconflicts of interest and differences of opinion.. Only the resolvtto  achieve        Union can give the necessary powers to thecommon institutions.   Without this political kiss, of life the institutions of the Union will always lack substance.and force.
Chapter VI.   GENERAL   conclusions this report attempts to give an. overall picture of theEuropean Union and of the means of achieving it.     Theconclusions reached therein have been given in the precedingchapters.The task of our Governments and of the EuropeanInstitutions consists:in the first place, in arriving at a political consensuson the aims and main features of the Union in terms which give expression to the deep aspirations of ourpeoples;-      then, in determining the consequences of this choicein the various areas of the Union&apos;s internal and external activities;in setting in motion, by positive action in each ofthose fields, the dynamic process of attaining theUnion under conditions which give credibility to theEuropean undertaking;   and in strengthening the institutional machinery to enable it to cope with the tasks awaiting it;The progress achieved as a result will gradually transformthe nature and intensity of relations between our States.    Itis foreseeable that other European democratic States will want to join the undertaking.     This will be open to them, on condition that they accept the overall view of the european union as well as the constraints imposed by its gradualcreation.     New accessions must not slow down the developmentof the Union nor jeopardize it.The attainment of the European Union will certainly notbe easy.     It is, however, essential and deserves the supportof everyone.For thirty years the relative weight and influence ofour States in the world has been continually reducyd.   In step with this, the national governments&apos;hold over the means that makeit possible to influence the future of our societies hasconstantly diminished.     Both internally and externally, theroom for manoeuvre of the individual States has decreased.They attempt to maintain their balance in the face ofpressures and factors, internal as well as external, whichare outside their control.     The danger of the effects ofthis two-fold spiral of    impotence      is great;    it leadsfrom weakness to dependence, which itself is a source offurther losses.The construction of Europe is the only all-inclusiveanswer to this challenge;    it derives spontaneously fromthe will of our peoples and is embodied in the work of the FoundinFathers of Europe.     It is the only answer which seeks
everywhere to regain some of the control and power whichis slipping from us, and to enable us to build the society in which we want to live.      . -The establishment of the Community was the first stage of this historic undertaking.     The European Union which willextend   our joint action to new sectors and reveal,  more clearly the outlines of the society that lies neneath itis the stage that follows.     This is how it must be under-stood and achieved.At a time when unemployment and inflation are rampantin all our countries, where everyone questions the causes of the weakness of our economic and political structures,and when the prosperity of Europe depends on factors outsideour control, the European effort must leave no-one indifferent.Each of us must participate in the common effort in orderthat we may together regain an adequate grip on the economy and on inflationto ensure orderly growth x and that we maytogether shape a more just society in which our common values are observed so that we can make our voiceheard in the world with the power of our Union behind it.On that, in the end, will depend tomorrow our way of life and that of our children.
