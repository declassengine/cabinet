Document is the property of her britannic majesty*s government(76) 3316 March 1976COPY NO81CABINETTHE FALKLAND ISLANDS; FUTURE policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs.        The Defence and Oversea Policy   Committee (OPD) have invited me to report to Cabinet on the question of future policy on the falkland islands.    In a memorandum to the Committee I reviewed recent develop-mentB and discussed the only two policy options that are now open to us.In this paper I draw attention to the principal points for consideration and invite my colleagues to endorse OPD&apos;s conclusions.2.        In the two years since February 1974 we have tried to engage theArgentine Government in a dialogue of a kind wnich the Islanders might accept and at the same time might satisfy the Argentines.   The concept of an Anglo-Argentine condominium was explored, briefly, in 1974, butabandoned when Islander opinion hardened against it.    The second approach,in 1975, was based on the concept of Anglo-Argentine economic co-operation,using economic resources around the Falklands as a constructive input.But the Argentines refused to agree to talks about economic co-operationunless we agreed to negotiate about sovereignty.    It may be concludedfrom these experiences that;-i.    our policy has neither allayed the Islanders1 suspicionsthat we may not respect their wishes nor prevented increasingArgentine criticism;ii.    we have accepted that the constraints of pro-Islanderopinion should outweigh other British interests;iii.    we have assessed that Argentina would place good relationswith us above physical confrontation, but we can no longer take this for granted.3.        We are now 0&amp; a collision course and, following the incidentbetween Mediterranean Shackle ton and an Argentine warship, we have to face the risks of confrontation, for example, of blockade.    A military assessmentby the Ministry of Defence has indicated bow much would be required to counter determined Argentine action.   There are other options open to1
Argentina, which could incur heavy penalties lor us.    We are committed to the principle of self-determination and there is considerable symapathy for the Islanders in this1 country.    But we have very few friendsinternationally on this issue.4.        We have reached a point -where we have little more than a precarious respite in hand.    We must therefore consider now our intentions in the longer term, choosing one of two optionsa.   to stand firm and face the consequences; if so wemust be fully aware of the considerable military, politicaland financial considerations;or        b.    to seek to reconcile the Argentine claim with theIslanders&apos; wish to remain British.    This must ultimatelyrequire some diminution of British sovereignty.    We could,for example, consider a leasehack solution.5.        My colleagues in OPD favoured the second option above.    I donot underestimate its difficulties.   An articulate lobby in Parliament,the genuine and understandable wishes of the Falkland Islanders not tohave much to do with the Argentines, and the nature of the Argentineregime are all political factors which make the launching of this optiontricky.    Nonetheless, I have no doubt that the long term security of theIslanders depends on our reaching an accommodation with Argentina.Lord Shackleton&apos;s recommendations, including that for an extension ofthe British airfield now under construction, may point tiie way to increasingprosperity through co-operation with Argentina.    The Islanders alreadyaccept that Falklandb oil can be developed only with Argentineco-operation.    Any discussions with the Argentines should if possible beheld under a &quot;sovereignty umbrella&apos;, ie without prejudice to eitherGovernroent&apos;6 position on territorial sovereignty over the Islands.6.        If my colleagues in Cabinet concur, it will be my intention (as Irecommended to OPD)a. to send the Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs a personal message, proposing mat our two governments should start a fresh dialogue to cover all aspects of the falkland Islands dispute, including discussion both of thepossibility of Anglo-Argentine economic co-operation and ofthe nature of a hypothetical future constitutional relationship between the Falkland Islands and Argentina;b. to consult the Islanders and to take careful account oftheir legitimate concerns.We shall need to pay detailed attention to the projection, handling anddevelopment of this policy.   For example, OPD considered thepossibility of appointing a Select Committee.    Urgent consideration is
being given to these factors and in particular to the sensitive question ofcarrying the Falkland Islanders with us.    I must ask for the maximumdiscretion on the timing of each step.    Timing will be crucial anddependent on a number of factors, some of which are unpredictable atthe moment,7.        One question for early decision is that of extending the airfield,which the Minister for Overseas Development and I have been asked byOPD to consider further; this could entail an appreciable financial burden, but it is of fundamental importance to our strategy, whicheveroption is adopted.    This matter will be considered again in OPD.LJCForeign and Commonwealth Office16 March 19763
