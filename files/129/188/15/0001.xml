DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT81C(76) 40 COPY NO23 March 1976CABINETPRIVATE PRACTICE IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. On 19 February Cabinet agreed (CC(76) 6th Conclusions, Minute 6)that a Bill embodying the &quot;Goodman&quot; proposals for phasing out pay beds(see C(76) 19, Annex 1) should be introduced before Easter, and that I should publish at the same time a White Paper setting out my proposals for controlof developments In the private hospital sector in order to safeguard theNational Health Service (NHS), so that my consultations on this aspectshould continue.    Subject to them, and to further consideration by Cabinetin the light of them, an amendment, providing for such control, could thenbe introduced at the Report Stage of the Bill.2.        Parliamentary Counsel, who has consulted She House authorities,advises me that unless the Bill as first published includes some provisionfor powers of control, it would not be possible to introduce these byamendments later, because they would lie outside the scope of the Bill.(This is not simply a matter of the long title.)3.        The Goodman proposals of 15 December envisaged continuingconsultations with the professions and representatives of the private sectoron the Governments need &quot;to be satisfied that developments in the private sector do not significantly endanger the service the NHS gives to itspatients&quot;; and as to whether this could be achieved by voluntary means, andwhether any reserve powers that it proved necessary to take in thelegislation might be exercised by the independent Board.    I circulated to members of the Cabinet my minute of 16 March to the Prime Minister(Annex A) about my consultations.    Since then there have been further talks,both by me and my officials with the professions and the IndependentHospitals Group (IHG) involving Lord Goodman, from which it is clear thatthe British Medical Association (BMA) and the professions are unwilling to volunteer any proposals for regulating the private sector by voluntarymeans as they are firmly opposed in principle to any form of control.4.        Lord Goodman on the other hand believes that It might be possible toreach an agreement with the IHG which the professions would find itdifficult to oppose.    The essential elements of such an agreement would be1
the control by the Health Services Board of developments over a certainsize, and an abandonment by the Government of any control on the overallsize of the private sector.    The difficulty would be to reach agreement onthe size of the private developments which would be subject to control.Lord Goodman tells me that the IHG is thinking of exemption for all schemesinvolving 250 beds or less which he himself says is &quot;too high&quot;.    I for mypart have told him a. that there would be grave difficulties with the unions ifwe were to agree to any figure over 75 beds; and b. that the applicationsfor private developments so far made to my Department show that the vast majority involve 75 beds or less (see Annex B).    Lord Goodman considersthis to be a cogent argument which he is to put to a joint meeting of the BMAand IHG this evening.    I will report the result at Thursday&apos;s Cabinet.5.        Lord Goodman further told me that, subject to his further examina-tion of the question of the size of exempted developments, he would beprepared to state publicly that he considered these proposals reasonable and, if it would help, would float them as his own.6.        In the light of this and subject to my oral report to Cabinet onThursday, I Invite my colleagues to agree that the Bill should from the outset provide for control on the following lines:a. The independent Board, which could be suitably augmentedfor the purpose, would receive all applications for developments ofprivate hospitals.b. The Board would issue an exemption certificate automaticallyfor all applications which fell outside the acute sector of medicine(eg nursing home for the elderly, chronic sick) or which were forfewer than 75 beds (if a wholly new development) or which would not bring the hospital to 75 beds or above (if It was an extension of an existing one).c. The developer would have the advantage of being able to showhis exemption certificate to the local planning authority.d. The Board would assess non-exempt applications and beempowered to refuse authorisation of any development which itconsidered would endanger the service which the NHS gives to itspatients.e. It would be an offence to develop a private hospital withouteither a certificate of exemption or an authorisation and any planningapplication not supported by one or the other would be nullified,f. Regulations would cover such matters as procedure for anyenquiry, forms of applications, appeals and penalties.
7.        The provisions in the Bill relating to these arrangements (includingthe figure of 75 beds) would of course be open to debate and amendment inthe usual way, and consultations would continue on the details of theproposals, including the matters for regulations,8,        As regards the size of the private sector, provided there is a statutory control of all the bigger schemes on the lines above, I should beprepared to state that I am willing to abandon the idea of an overall ceiling.9.        It will not now be necessary to publish a White Paper in connectionwith my consultations as an alternative to the inclusion of control powers inthe Bill; instead I will publish an explanation of the arrangements at thesame time as the Bill.10,       I invite my colleagues to agree to the inclusion of control powers inthe Bill on the lines I have described so that we can meet the timetable for legislation agreed by Cabinet on 19 February.BAGDepartment of Health and Social Security23 March 19763
ANNEX A.PRIME MINISTERPrivate.Practice and the NHSIn my minute to you of 2 March I told you about my consultationson the subject of controlling new hospital developments in theprivate sector.   Since I wrote there have been further developments which, I think, make it advisable for me to delay putting a paper to Cabinet.2.   I had another meeting with Arnold Goodman yesterday at whichit became clear that he is anxious to reach a negotiated settlement on the control of the private sector and is notunhopeful that at least an understanding with the profession mightbe achieved.   He confirmed that paragraph 3 (f)* of his proposalsmeans that there has to be some kind of control of the private sector to protect the NHS; that a genuine attempt must be made toreach agreement with the profession on a voluntary system butthat, failing that, &quot;the government must take powers&quot;.   He alsoaccepts that even a voluntary system might require reserve powersto enforce it.   He therefore anticipates that it may well benecessary to include some powers in the Bill when this is published* &quot;As stated in the Queen&apos;s Speech the regulation of the private sector following the separation of pay beds will be subject tofurther consultation with the professions.   In the meantime theGovernment needs to be satisfied that developments in the private sector do not significantly endanger the service the NHS gives toits patients and will enter into consultation with the medical and dental professions as to how this can be achieved by voluntary means.The consultations would cover the point as to whether any reserve powers that it proved necessary to take in the legislation, might beexercised by the independent Board.&quot;   /ie the Board which it isproposed should be set up by the legislation to supervise the separation of private beds and facilities from the tiHSjCONFIDENTIAL
in April.   He put forward the suggestion that as a holding stepto allow more time for consultations, the Bill might empower meto make regulations controlling private hospital developments onthe clear understanding that this provision would need to be amended at a later stage, in order to take account of the further negotiations with the profession.   I told him that I had noobjection to this suggestion but that some of our intelligencesuggests that the profession would prefer the Bill to containan explicit power rather than a vague general power of the kindhe mentioned, even if it was made crystal clear that this was no more than a holding device while further discussions took place.He therefore said he would like to consider this further in thelight of his discussions with the profession which he now proposesto undertake.   Aa an alternative to a general power we discussed the possibility of providing in the Bill for the independent board to regulate private sector developments against established criteria&apos;The criteria might allow hospitals below a certain size to be excluded from such consideration, but this would be a matter for negotiation with the profession.   I also told Lord Goodman that I did not exclude the possibility of the Board having a legallyqualified Chairman as he suggested, and of abandoning the overallceiling on the size of the private sector proposed in lastSeptembers consultative document, if the profession were willing      ito agree some viable proposals for protecting the NHS.3.   Throughout our discussions Lord Goodman stressed that itwould be preferable for proposals to come from the professions inthe first place and he is to see their representatives again to try   [to persuade them to put forward their ideas which they have so farnot been prepared to do.   He is aware of the urgency of thesituation and has promised to try and report back to me by Thursdayi18 March when my officials are due to have a second exploratorymeeting with the profession.   In view of this I hope you would agreeto allow me to report the outcome of these consultations to cabinet next week so that the contents of the Bill can be settled-U.   Whatever we include in the Bill on this matter I have it inmind to publish a White Paper simultaneously to clarify our reasons and intentions.
