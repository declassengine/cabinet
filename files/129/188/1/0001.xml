ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1976INTRODUCTION1. In the 1975 Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 5977) the Governmentstated that it might be desirable to bring forward the 1976 Review, so that itpreceded the fixing of Community support prices by a reasonable margin. Thiswas done. This year&apos;s Annual Review has provided information both for theGovernments negotiating position on the Commission^ proposals for agri-cultural support in 1976/77 and for decisions on national support arrangements,including the guaranteed prices for sheep, wool, potatoes and milk. This white paper sets out the data established at the Review on the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdom agricultural industry. The forecasts for1975/76 generally reflect the position at December 1975. This Review wasthe first to be conducted in metric terms but, in order to ease the change, thefigures in the text and, for the year under review, in the statistical appendicesare generally shown both in metric and imperial units.2. During 1975 the Government set out guidelines to the 1980s in the white paper &quot;Food from Our Own Resources&quot; (Cmnd. 6020). This establishedobjectives and priorities which will be consistently pursued both in the decisionsfollowing the 1976 Annual Review and in the medium term. The decisions on agricultural support for 1976/77 are being announced separately.PART I-STATE OF THE industry. 1975/76 has been an exceptional year. In spite of difficult conditions, thevalue of gross output of United Kingdom agriculture is expected to rise in1975/76 by about 14%, but net product at constant prices is forecast to fall bya similar percentage. Unfavourable weather had its biggest effect on arableproduction. The sowing season during last winter and spring was very difficult for farmers, so that more land was left fallow. Late plantings and the dry summerreduced yields well below normal levels. The cereals harvest was about.6 million tonnes below the 1974 crop. Potato yields have been very poor.The harvested area of sugar beet is a little larger than in 1974 but yields are againbelow average. These results have inevitably had an adverse effect on total netproduct of the industry. Favourable weather returned, however, in the autumn.A large area has been planted with winter wheat and the sown area appears gen-eraJJy to be in excellent condition. Given normal weather, the next cereal harvestshould show a substantial recovery.4. Many livestock farmers had problems in providing adequate fodder fortheir stock, particularly in the late spring. The hay harvest was small, althoughof good quality. Farmers made considerable and successful efforts to helpthemselves by moving hay and straw into the livestock areas. The open autumnhas also been favourable and livestock generally went into the winter in very good condition. The dairy breeding herd at the June 1975 census was down butmilk yields have continued to improve. Milk production has recently been runningabove last year&apos;s level and total production in 1975/76 is expected to be aboutthe same as production in 1974/75. The beef breeding herd at June 1975 was
unchanged but the September sample inquiry showed a small fall in Englandand Wales. Home-fed beef production in 1975/76 is forecast to be at a recordlevel but may be lower next year. At June 1975 the sheep breeding flock in the hills was unchanged but the total breeding flock showed a small fall of 1 %. the pig breeding herd at June 1975, although 9% smaller than in June 1974, was atmuch the same level as in April 1975, with an increase in gilts in pig. It isprobable that a recovery in the pig breeding herd is now beginning. It is expectedthat poultry meat production in 1975/76 will increase by about 2 or 3% andthat egg production will be almost unchanged. Pouhryroeat production should increase again iff 1976/77.5. The aggregate net income of the agricultural industry at current prices isestimated to increase by about 7i% in 1975/76. In real terms it will again havefallen. Aggregate cost increases since the 1975 Review are assessed at  455 million.6. lathe course of the year since the last Annual Review and the fixing of community support prices for 1975/76 the Government have taken importantsteps to assist the industry. The Green Found (the representative rate at whichprices under the common agricultural policy are converted into sterling) was reduced in August and October by 5 % and 5.8 % respectively, the implement a-tion of the changes being deferred for some products. These changes raisedCommunity support prices for United Kingdom farmers by over 11% in sterling terms. Moreover, they were reflected in increases in the guaranteed price for milk. The guaranteed price for milk for 1975/76 in relation to estimatedproduction is now 8.148p per litre (37.04p a gallon), 0.504p per litre (2.29p a gallon) above the level of 7.644p per litre (34.75p a gallon) set at the 1975Review. In addition, the new beef regime introduced following the renegotiationof the terms of entry into the European Community has restored stability ofreturns to beef fatteners. Breeders&apos; and rearers&apos; returns this autumn showed a recovery from the severely depressed levels of a year ago.PART II-COMMODITY TRENDSOr** (Tables 1,5, 7 and 27)7; The area of cereals harvested in 1975 reached about 3-65 million hectares(9-03 million acres) compared with 3-75 million hectares (9-26 million acres)in the previous year. deduction is expected to total 13-8 million tonnes&apos;, wellbelow the record 16-4 million tonnes in 1974. The wet autumn of 1974 led toa reduction in the ftrefc sown with wheat, which was only partly offset by anincrease m barley. The oats area continued to decline. Yields of all cerealswere lower than in 1974 mainly because of late sowing. Market prices havebeen generally above 1974/75 levels, reflecting the continuing high level of world prices.8. The area planted to cereals in 1976/77 is expected to increase to slightlyabove the area planted in 1974/75. If yields return to normal next year, home production should approach the level of the 1974 crop.
Potatoes (Tables 2, 5, 9 and 27)9. In 1975 the target area of 229,000 hectares (565,000 acres) was under-planted by 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres). The prolonged drought in the summerimpeded the development of the crop and the average yield is expected to be only about three-quarters of that for the 1974 crop. Early in the season theGovernment lifted the normal baa on imports of main crop potatoes andbanned exports of ware potatoes. The short supply has raised prices and reduced consumption; the average market price for the season will be wellabove the guaranteed price of  27-56 per tonne ( 28 per ton). For the 1976crop the target area has been set at 221,000 hectares (546,000 acres),Sugar beet (Tables 2, 5,10 and 27)10. In 1975 the British Sugar Corporation contracted to purchase the beetfrom 197,500 hectares (488,000 acres). About 193,250 hectares (477,500 acres)were harvested, compared with 182,400 hectares (450,700 acres) in 1974.Because of drought in the main growing areas, average yields were again low and only slightly better than for the 1974 crop. Production, therefore, thoughmarginally better than in 1974 was still only about 70% of that for 1973,Because of the move to full Community support prices on 1 January 1975,and a significant increase in e.c. prices for 1975/76 besides the reductions of the Green Pound growers should receive, on average, about 28% moreper tonne for their beet in 1975 than in 1974.11. The British Sugar Corporation has announced that it hopes to contract for the produce of up to 206,390 hecfares (510,000 acres) for 1976. With normalyields this should produce at least the United Kingdoms basic Communitywhite sugar quota (1,040,000 tonnes).Oilseed rape (Tables 2, 5, 8 and 27)12. Although adversely affected by poor weather and the effects of thechange to new low erucic acid varieties, production of oilseed rape increased in 1975 to a new record level. Oilseed prices have fallen during the year but,in spite of this, a further increase in production is expected next year.Beef and nut (Tables 2, 5,14,15,16 and 27)13. The results of the 1975 June census showed the beef breeding herd atvirtually the same size as in the previous June but the dairy herd was 5%smaller. Because of the continued high rate of cow culling after June some further decline in the total breeding herd is expected to be shown in the 1976census.14. In 1975 home-fed production of beef and total marketings of fat cattlewere at the highest recorded levels. With reduced imports and increased exports,however, the total supplies available for consumption in 1975/76 are likely tobe 6% below last year&apos;s very high level. Prices for fat cattle rose sharply at thebeginning of the marketing year in March. After a shallow seasonal fat ismid-summer, they were by mid-November over  12 per 100 kg ( 6 per livecwt) higher than a year earlier. Producers&apos; average weekly returns exceeded the monthly target prices from the end of February to the beginning of June
(except for one week early in March) and again in several weeks towards theend of the marketing year. At other times returns were supported at the levelof the monthly target prices by payment of variable premiums. The new support arrangements have contributed substantially to market stability.IS. The average milk yield per cow in 1975/76 is expected to be higher thanin 1974/75. There is likely to be only a very slight fall in total sales of milkthrough the Milk Marketing Schemes. The amount of milk sold for liquidconsumption m 1975/76 is expected to show a small increase over 1974/75.As a result of the slight fall in total sales of milk off farms, the increase inliquid consumption and increased utilisation for cheese and other purposes,butter production in 1975/76 is expected to show a reduction below the previous year&apos;8 level. The increases in the guaranteed price for milk and the standard quantity at the 1975 Annual Review and the further increases in the guaranteed price since the Review have resulted in a substantially increased average producerprice for milk in 1975/76.16. Following the Governments action this year, it seems likely that the fallin the dairy herd will be checked during 1976. It is expected that milk yieldswill remain at a high level in 1976/77.Sheep and wool (Tables 2,14,18 and 27)17. Between June 1974 and June 1975 there was a slight decrease in the total united Kingdom breeding flock. The decline occurred mainly in the lowlandareas. Some further small contraction of the breeding flock seems likely by june 1976. An increase of home-fed mutton and lamb production is forecast for 1975/76, but production is expected to fall back slightly next year. Imports of mutton and lamb in 1974/75 were lower than expected because they were affectedby shipping delays in the last quarter. The backlog caused by these delays led to higher imported supplies this year. Total supplies in 1975/76 are expectedto be about 11 % greater than in 1974/75. Fat sheep prices were relatively highat Uie beginning of the 1975/76 fatstock year but below the level of the guarantee.Except for a five week period in May and June 1975 they remained below the guaranteed level until mid-October 1975. Subsequently, prices firmed and roseabove the guaranteed level. Prices paid for hill lambs and draft ewes at the1975 autumn sales were above those paid in 1974 and, in some cases, as high as those paid in 1973.18. Production of wool in 1975 remained static. Prices recovered substantiallyfrom the low levels of 1474, although over 1975/76 as a whole they are expectedto remain below the guaranteed level. The prospect is of further increases in prices in the coming year.Ftp (Tables 2,14 and 27)19. The decline in the United Kingdom pig breeding herd continued into 1975.At June 1975 the breeding herd was 9 % below the level of June 1974. substantial increases in the numbers of gilts in pig were, however, recorded in the second half of 1975, indicating that a recovery in the herd had begun. Reduced output was reflected in market prices which rose substantially during 1975 to reachnew record levels. An increase in pig numbers and in pigmeat production is forecast for 1976/77.
Fodtrymeat (Tables 2,14 and 27)20. Total production of poultry meat is expected to recover in 1975/76after the reduction in 1974/75. Prices also increased during 1975/76. Chickplacings rose sharply in the second half of 1975 and it seems likely that produc-tion will increase again next year.Eggs (Tables 2, 5, 17 and 27)21. The average size of the laying Sock is forecast to show little changebetween 1974/75 (June/May) and 1975/76. An increase in yields per bird isexpected, with a further increase forecast for 1976/77. Total production in1975/76 (April/March) is expected to be very similar to that of the previous year. Over 1975/76 (April/March) as a whole producer prices are expectedto be on average slightly below 1974/75 but they have shown substantialvariation during the year.Seeds (Tables 13 and 27)22. The area of certified herbage seed fell by about 8% in 1975 comparedwith 1974. Seed crop yields were higher but total seed production is likely tobe down because many crops were used for silage or other purposes. Perennialryegrass prices have fallen substantially due to reduced demand and a buildup of stocks and the prices of other main species have declined.23. The area of field bean seed sown in the autumn of 1974 and the spring of 1975 to produce certified seed was less than expected mainly because of poor sowing conditions. Over the last few years, however, the area used for theproduction of certified seed has increased considerably and production nowsubstantially exceeds requirements. Production of field pea seed is negligibleat present but is expected to increase.Horticuhare (Tables 2, 5,11 and 27)24. The total cropped area devoted to horticulture in the United Kingdomfell slightly between 1974/75 and 1975/76 and is now estimated at 303,000hectares (748,000 acres).(a) Apples, The area of apple orchards (excluding cider apples) continuesto fall slightly and in 1975/76 is estimated at 34,700 hectares (85,700acres). Growing conditions in 1975 have been reasonably good fordessert apples, resulting in an increase in output and yield over1974/75. In contrast, the yield and output of culinary apples fellbecause of unfavourable weather conditions. Given more normal weather conditions, increased yields from recent plantings should lead to an increase in production of both dessert and culinary applesin 1976/77. Dessert apple prices for 1975/76 are about the same asthe previous year but the shortage of culinary apples has resulted ina substantial increase in price.(6) Pears. The slight decline in the area under pears (excluding perrypears) has continued and it is estimated that there will be 5,300hectares (13,000 acres) under this crop in 1975/76. Poor pollinationresulting from a very early flowering season has resulted in the lightestcrop for many years. Both yield and output are considerably lower than in 1974/75. In consequence, price levels nave been higher.r
(c) Caattflowers. The area under cauliflowers continued to decline slightlyfrom its peak in 1973/74 and is expected in 1975/76 to be some 15,500hectares (38,300 acres). Both yield and output are expected to be slightly lower than for 1974/75, although prices should be higher.(d) Tomatoes. The area devoted to tomato production is expected to decline in 1975/76 by some 6% over 1974/75 to about 930 hectares(2,300 acres). In 1975/76 yields are estimated to be better than in theprevious season, with about the same total output. Prices for 1975/76are expected to be substantially higher than for 1974/75.Hops (Tables 2, 5,12 and 27)25. The area of hops has been declining steadily in recent years and fellagain in 1975/76. This is mainly due to the improved utilisation of hops bybrewers and increased yields from new varieties. Unusually dry weather conditions, particularly in Kent, have resulted in significantly reduced yieldsand output for 1975/76.PART m-GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFans stradara (Table 3)26. The number of farms in the United Kingdom continues to fall. The totalnumber of holdings (272,000) and the number of full-time farms (170,000) in1975 are respectively some 10% and 8% lower than in 1970. The decline hasbeen most marked among the smaller full-time farms. Businesses capable ofproviding full-time work for at least one man are estimated to account for over96% of total agricultural output, although in Northern Ireland and wales the output of small part-time farms is rather more significant than in other partsof the United Kingdom. About one third of holdings have businesses capableof providing work for at least two men fie those of 600 standard man-days ormore) but they account for 81 % of total output, while large businesses (1,200standard man-days or more), though only about 15% of the total number,produce rather more than a half of total output.27. The average size of farms continues to increase. Full-time businessesaveraged 105 hectares (259 acres) (total area including rough grazings) in 1975compared with. 92 hectares (217 acres) in 1970. Individual enterprises are alsoexpanding, as the number of units declines and the trend to greater specialisationcontinues. Between 1970 and 1975 the average area of cereals has increased from 27 to 30 hectares (67 to 74 acres); the average dairy herd has risen from30 to 40 cows and the average beef breeding herd from 13 to 19 cows; theaverage ewe flock has increased from 138 to 163 breeding sheep and the averagepig breeding herd from 14 to 23 sows.28. In Great Britain 61% of the holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1975 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion of the totalarea held by owner-occupiers has increased from 52% in 1960/61 to 56% in1975. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers are owner-occupiers.latex of net prodact (Table 19)29. For 1974/75 the index is now put at 119 (average of 1968/69-1971/72^100), instead of 117 as previously forecast, but is estimated to fall to 102 in1975/76 owing mainly to the effects of the weather.
Labour productivity (Tables 4 and 19)30. The effect of the weather on output is also reflected in reduced labour productivity. The latest estimates indicate an average annual rate of increase in labour productivity (the volume of gross product per head) of about 41 % for theperiod 1964/65 to 1975/76 as a whole. The outflow of regular whole-time workerswas about 5% a year in the late 1960s and is currently running at just under2J% a year.Net income of the Industry (Tables 19, 21 and 24)31. Aggregate net income of the industry fell by 1 % in 1974/75 to  1,263million. It is expected to increase by about 71% to  1,357 million in 1975/76.Adjusted for normal weather, income is expected to increase by about the same percentage, from  1,267 million in 1974/75 to  1,383 million in 1975/76. Aftershowing an upward trend over the previous 10 years, aggregate net income in real terms fell by 17% in 1974/75 and a further fall is forecast for 1975/76. Thenumber of farms is falling by about 21 % a year and over the 9 years to 1973/74real income per full-time farm almost doubled. In 1974/75 it fell by some 16%and a further fall of about 10 % is expected in 1975/76, to a level about a thirdabove the average for 1968/69-1971/72.32. Samples of farm accounts show that in 1974/75 there were big differences in income movements between different -types of farm and the countries of theUnited Kingdom. Net income fell on dairy farms, except in Scotland, and sheep and cattle farms, while arable farming showed a further increase. Average netincomes on full-time farms of all types (excluding horticulture) fell by 10% inEngland, by 26 % in Northern Ireland and by 32 % in Wales but rose by 13 %in Scotland. In real terms average net income fell in all countries. Trends innet income per farm in 1975/76 are again expected to vary considerably betweentypes of farm. Lower cereal output and higher costs are likely to reduce incomeson cropping farms except where higher potato prices or better beet yields havehelped. Higher milk, cattle and calf prices in the second half of the year should increase dairy incomes, in spite of the need for extra purchases of feed in some areas. Higher fat and store cattle prices, particularly in the late autumn, areexpected to raise income in most hill and upland areas. Higher livestockvaluations account for a substantial part of these expected improvements in net income.Cost changes (Table 26)33. Cost increases since the last Review are assessed at  455 million for allproducts, the main items being  130 million on the cost of labour,  122 million on machinery costs and  85 million on miscellaneous costs. These figures take account of the wage increases effective in Scotland from 22 December 1975,in England and Wales from 20 January 1976 and in Northern Ireland from  February 1976. They do not allow for changes in the volume of resources,including labour, used by the industry. The cost table takes account of thefull year effect of all changes since the 1975 Review known by 31 December1975.
Grow capital formation (Table 23)34. A further increase in new investment is estimated to have occurred in1975. Total gross capital formation in landlord and tenant-type physical assetstogether is estimated to be  1,010 million in 1975. Of this,  415 million isestimated to be in plant, machinery and vehicles, an increase of 38 % over theamount invested in 1974, and  356 million in additions to stocks and work-in-progress. Total investment in buildings and works, the responsibility of land-lords, is expected to be  239 million. In volume terms new investment in 1975in plant, machinery and vehicles is expected to be about 7% higher than in1974 but new investment in buildings and works to be some 22 % lower. During1975 the average physical level of stocks and work-in-progress is expected to bebelow that of 1974.AgricnHnral land prices35. After rising sharply during 1972 and 1973, the price of agricultural land fell back slightly in the second half of 1974 and the first half of 1975.Recent information suggests that the average price may be stabilising, althoughfewer transactions are taking place.Farm rents (Table 22)36- The controls on agricultural rents which had been in force since 1972were removed on 28 May 1975. Since 5 November 1973 landlords had been permitted to collect only the rent applicable before 6 November 1972 plushalf the difference between that rent and any higher rent agreed. Rent increasespayable for new improvements by landlords were not affected. Preliminaryfigures for October 1975 show an increase in agricultural rents in England andWales of about 22% over 1974. Rents in Scotland rose by nearly 10% in theyear.Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 20)37. The average earnings of a full-time hired man in the United kingdom were  40-85 per week for the year ended 30 September 1975. In money termsthis is some 28% higher than in 1973/74 and in real terms the increase is about4J%. These higher earnings reflect the two-stage increases in the minimumordinary wage made by all three Agricultural Wages Boards, the first in thewinter of 1974/75 incorporating the consolidation of eleven threshold payments and the second stage effective in the summer of 1975. They exclude the latestincreases awarded by the Agricultural Wages Boards. Average earnings in the1975/76 farm year are expected to rise to about  47-50 per full-time man.PnbBc expeaditare (Table 25)38. In 1975/76 the estimated outturn for expenditure on United Kingdomprice guarantees, grants and subsidies (excluding the brucellosis incentivesand payments connected with the consumer subsidy on milk) is about 226 million. The comparable figure for 1974/75 was about  295 million.The decrease of about  69 million reflects mainly the non-recurring expenditurein 1974/75 on extra support for beef and pig producers, additional help forproducers in the hills and the subsidy for oil for horticulture.
39. Expenditure in the United Kingdom under the common marketorganisation of the European Community is estimated to rise by some 106 million to about  305 million in 1975/76. About  247 million is expectedto be financed by Community funds (FEOGA). Over half the expenditureon market regulation under the common agricultural policy is on monetarycompensatory amount import subsidies which help to keep down prices inthe UK and benefit consumers rather than producers. These import subsidies and expenditure on beef premiums are the main reasons for the increased expenditure on market regulation under the common agricultural policyexpected in 1975/76.
appendixStatistical TablesThe tables follow the pattern of those in last year*s White Paper. For the first time, however,all figures are expressed in metric terms. Where appropriate, a column giving imperial figuresfor 1973/76 has also been included. Statistics have not been collected in metric units. the metric units used are as follows:Area     hectareWeight   tonnekilogram (kg)Volume  litre.Some of the figures in this Appendix differ from those in previous Annual Review white papers because of later information, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statistical methods.
