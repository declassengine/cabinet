IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government(76) 3719 March 1976CABINETENLARGEMENT OF THE EECMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth AffairsINTRODUCTION1. When Cabinet discussed the Greek application for membership of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) on 5 February (CC(76) 4thConclusions, Minute 2) it was argued that there would be advantage in considering the whole question of the enlargement of the e.c., includingthe implications of Greek membership for considering later applications from such countries as Turkey, Spain and Portugal,    When and how theseapplications will be made - and the associated questions of how theCommunity will evolve over the next five years or so - remain highlyuncertain.    So I think that there are limits to how far we can take our study.But I think we need to face squarely the fact that the admission of greece would mark a decisive moment in the development of the Community; Itcould lead to the accession of other Member States and to a movement away from the relatively cohesive and integrated organisation which is theCommunity!e objective.    So I set out in mis paper some implications as ageneral introduction to tbe subject,TIMING2.        When, first of all, can we expect the Greeks in, if their negotiations are successful?   The e.c. Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) may beasked to approve a first negotiating mandate by the summer break at the endof July.    But effective negotiations will hardly start until the autumn.    our accession negotiations in 1970-72 took just over 18 months.    It is true thatthe Greek application will raise fewer problems.    But there will still be a range of complex and difficult points on which not only will the Greeksnegotiate toughly, but agreement will be difficult to achieve among the Nine.Greek accession will not get the same priority as the previous enlargementnegotiations because of many other urgent items on the agenda of the meetings of the Foreign Ministers of the Nine.   So unless the Greekbpursue tactics of blandly accepting all Community requirements I would1COPY NO81
expect the negotiations to take most if not all of 1977 and 1978.    And with a      ;!year for ratification this would mean Greek entry - still with a transitional period, but taking as we did a full part from the beginning in the Institutions     jof the Community - in the second half of 1979 or in 1980. \3.        What of the other candidates ?   Article 237 of the Treaty of Romeprovides that &quot;any European State may apply to become a member of the iCommunity&quot;,    hi recent years an additional qualification has been added byconsensus that candidates must share the democratic ideals of the jCommunity or be &quot;pluralist democracies&quot;.    There is room for argumentabout how these concepts should be defined, but all Member States would agree that candidates must have Governments based on free elections and properly elected Parliaments.    Over the next few years the only candidateswho seem likely to apply (and it is by no means certain that they willqualify) are Spain and Portugal.    Turkey, Norway, Sweden and evenSwitzerland, Malta and Cyprus are conceivable candidates in the longer run.SPAIN4,        Spain (population 35 million and a Gross Domestic Product (GDP)per head of $1, 750 almost on a level of that of Greece) is, it is hoped, about to resume negotiations for a trade agreement with the Community to take account of the accession of the three new Member States.    H concluded, thiswill set the Spanish economy on the road towards free trade with theCommunity.    But mis agreement will contain no provision for eventualSpanish membership.5.        Since Francois death Spanish Ministers have made it plain that their aim is to achieve membership.    This clearly depends on progress towardsreal democracy In Spain.    &amp; is a matter of judgment whether, and if sowhen, Spain could achieve a system of government which could reasonably be regarded as a pluralist democracy.    They are likely to have serious problems with the Communist Party as well as with the Francoist &quot;bunker&quot;,with the Catalan and Basque separatist movements, and with the problemsof establishing a working system of free political parties and trades unions.They themselves are hopeful that they may be In a position to apply for membership of the Community in two years&apos; time.    Even if all goes well,it would not be surprising if this timetable slipped,6.        Assuming that a working pluralist democracy is established, none ofthe other Member States would see any valid reason for refusing to entertain a Spanish application.    The Spanish economy is more soundlybased than that of Greece and more likely to withstand the strains of membership.    France and Germany would both be strongly in favour.There would be sound foreign policy reasons for wishing to help a democratic Spanish Government of the day to defend the new Spanishdemocracy and for ensuring that Spain was firmly anchored to western europe.    This is likely to be the strong United States view.    The politicalcosts abroad of a British veto would be high.    Nor should we forget theeffect on Gibraltar.
7,        On the most optimistic assumptions about Spanish progress towardsdemocracy. It seems unlikely that negotiations for entry could begin before1979, with a consequent likely date for membership of 1982 or 1983.Whether Spain will adhere to this optimistic timetable it is difficult atpresent to assess.    (Spain hopes to put in an application by 1978 and enterby 1980, but 1980 is hardly realistic for entry).    But unless there is visibleprogress towards free elections and all that goes with it, things will movemuch more slowly or even grind to a halt.PORTUGAL8.        Portugal (with a population of 9 million and a GDP per head office, 250) has a free trade agreement with the Community, amendment ofwhich is under negotiation.    The Portuguese Foreign Minister has said thatPortugal is not interested in full membership at the moment.    but important voices in the main democratic parties (the Socialist Party and the popular Democratic Party) seem likely to want to follow the Greek exampleif the April elections go well for them.    They are talking of getting In ahead of Spain.    After the turmoil of the past two years, the Portuguesesituation looks more hopeful.    By the summer there is a reasonable chance that a pluralist democracy may be established, albeit in hostile economic circumstances that may make it very hard for democracy to survive.    ThePortuguese economy, relatively weak before the end of the Right Wingdictatorship, has deteriorated further and is far from being strong enoughto thrive on full membership at the end of the decade.    If they are wise,the democratic Portuguese leaders will make haste slowly and we mustencourage them to do so, while nevertheless extending sufficientencouragement and help towards membership in the long run to giveembattled democracy the support and encouragement it will need.TURKEY9,        Turkey is a less likely candidate in the next few years.    It has an association agreement with the Community similar to that with Greece whichenvisages eventual full membership.    It provides for the achievement of afull Customs Union, though not until 1992, compared with 1984 for Greece.Turkey Is much larger than Greece (population 38 million but far poorer -GDP per head of $540).    Politically Turkey has maintained for some years a balance between democratic form and military influence on Governmentwhich has papered over the social, economic and political backwardness of much of the country.    Turkish Ministers accept that Turkey is not sufficiently advanced economically to proceed to full membership in thenear future.    But they will be conscious that Greek progress in that direc-tion will put them at a disadvantage; in the short term they will seekfinancial aid from the Community, improved access for their exports tothe Nine and involvement in the political consultation process to balanceGreek progress towards full member ship.    And they will not abandon their long-term claim of full membership.
OTHER CANDIDATES10.       Other candidates do not seem likely over the next five years or so.The Norwegians with their new oil prosperity will not wish to repeat thetraumatic experience of their referendum.    And it hardly seems likely thatthe European neturals (Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and Austria) will want to join in the next few years.   Austria is formally precluded from doing soby the terms of the State Treaty, and Finland is precluded in practice by thenature of its relationship with the Soviet Union.1L        To Bum up, there has been some tendency to exaggerate the likelyspeed with which the Community may be enlarged.    Greece is likely to joinat the end of the decade.    Spain might conceivably join shortly thereafter.Portugal might join two or more years later.    Turkey is unlikely to be in aposition to join before the late &apos;80s.    &amp;i the !80s Norway, Sweden and evenMalta or Cyprus might change their minds, but the likelihood at the momentdoes not seem great that any of them will apply in time to join before the mid-&apos;80B.EFFECTS12.       What would be the effect of this pattern of enlargement ?   I attach at annex A some indications of the size of United Kingdom trade, and that ofthe Eight with the candidate countries and the proportion these represent ofindustrial and agricultural production of the Nine.    And I attach at Annex Ba note by officials drawn up last autumn which analyses the implications of greek accession.    We shall in due course need to set similar studies in train on Spain and Portugal.    But in summary the implications ofenlargement seem to me to fall under four main headings.a.    POLITICAL13.       A rebuff to the Greeks would have endangered the stability of theKaramanlis Government and increased the threat of a Communist or military takeover, thus weakening the Southern Flank of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation and endangering the stability of the eastern mediterranean.    The admission of Greece should contribute to the oppositeresults.    On the other hand the future of democracy in Greece will still beat risk even if they are full members of the Community,   And a Communistor military takeover after entry would create very serious problems for theCommunity.    Could the other Member States freeze the membership of amember who left the democratic fold?   Much would depend on thecircumstances at the time and I do not think that we can come to a conclusion in advance.    (The same applies to existing members).   Greek membershipwill cause awkward political problems for the other Member States if by thattime Greco-Turkish relationshave not improved and if the Cyprus problemremains unsettled.    Greek membership will not add anything substantial tothe weight of the Nine In international affairs.
14.       The pros and cons of admitting or vetoing a democratic Spain pointstrongly, as for Greece, against a veto.    The same danger of a failure of democracy would be present.    On the other hand, Spanish relations withthird countries would not cause such problems and a democratic Spain would add considerably to the weight of the Nine in the Community&apos;s relations withcertain parts of the worlds    Much the same goes for Portugal, which would however add less political weight.b. ECONOMIC15.       The admission of One, possibly two or even three, relatively poor,substantially agricultural Mediterranean countries would have considerableeconomic disadvantages for the Community as a whole and particularly forus as one of its weaker members.    Our share of the Regional development fund and of the European Social Fund would be reduced.   And the newarrivals would be substantial claimants on Community agriculturalexpenditure which would be bound to Increase substantially,    Greekaccession alone could cost the Nine up to  150 million a year at 1975 prices(and the United Kingdom perhaps  25 million).   And Spain in particularcould be a major additional burden.    Thus our net contributions to theCommunity budget will increase.    And the possibility of our getting anythingsubstantial out of resource transfers from the richer to the poorer membersof the Community will be greatly diluted.    At the same time some of ourolder and more vulnerable industries, especially textiles, would facedamaging competition without the safeguards given by existing AssociationAgreements.    And we would face protectionist pressures - in the form of resistance to cuts In Community tariffs on the products of Mediterraneanagriculture,c. POLICY MAKING16.       Over a whole range of Community policies, existing and emergent,the new entrants would pursue interests different from ours.    In external trade they would join the more restrictive and Inward-looking members ofthe Community (In particular France and Italy)) in terms of agricultural policy they would join with the French and Italians In exacting ea high aprice as they could for the support of Southern European agriculture.    Theywould try to squeeze as much as they could out of Community regional and social expenditure; and this would be a drag on the development of community industrial policy and would make progress towards Economicand Monetary Union even less likely than it is now,d. NATURE AND MANAGEABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY17,       But what will be the effect on the nature and manageability of theCommunity of the admission of one and possibly three SouthernMediterranean countries?   Even now the Community has barely digestedthe three new members it took in 1973.    Would a Community of 10 and evenmore so 12 - with the Commission suitably enlarged to provide for Greek,
Spanish and Portuguese Commissioners and with three extra languages -have got past the point of unmanageability?   And to what extent would thecentre of gravity of the Community be shifted towards the south where thereare fundamentally different attitudes towards taxation and administration?18.       I think that we have to face the fact that there will be somesubstantial disadvantages both in the economic field and in terms ofmanageability Of the Community,    It will be a Community different from theone we joined and more difficult to manage.    It can, of course, be argued -particularly If the Community&apos;s functioning continues to improve - that new members joining one by one at intervals over the next six or seven years or so could be assimilated.    There will be a desirable side effect in the sense that the advent of between one and three new members over the next 10 years as different from the existing members as Greece, Portugal and Spain willreinforce the trend already evident away from a fully-fledged federation inEurope,   And we need, of course, to remember mat the disadvantages of have to on Greece or a democratic Spain or Portugal would be very serious.But we should be clear that whatever the justification on balance for the admission of these new members and despite the fact that there are somemitigating factors, the disadvantages both for the Community and for theUnited Kingdom of their admission will be marked.19.       Should we therefore veto or openly delay the Greek negotiations andthe possible accession negotiations for democratic Spain and Portugal later on.    As I have said already the political arguments against this seem to mecompelling.    There are certain things which we could do.    We need to insist on a full examination of all the detailed points of interest to us whichwill arise in the Greek accession negotiations and to ensure just as theFrench did in 1970-72 that full account is taken of our Interests.    And wecan be confident that other Member States will also see difficulties for themand will be doing the same.    Secondly, we need to set in train a study of the implications of the accession of Spain and Portugal on lines similar to theone we have done in relation to Greece,   And, thirdly, this general problem may come up with the other Foreign Ministers of the Nine at thenext very restricted Schloss Gymnich type meeting.    If so, my aim wouldbe to try and bring home to the French and Italians some of the economicdisadvantages attendant on the admission of Spain and Portugal and to mycolleagues generally the difficulties of manageability which several new members would cause.    But 1 would need to be careful not to appear to takethe lead in opposing the admission of new members.20.      Another possible course would be to alter the decision-makingmachinery of the Community so as to put powers of decision in the hands ofan inner group.    This could take the form of the &quot;directorate&quot; whichPresident Glscard has recently floated.    Or it could be a version of thetwo-tier idea originally put forward by Herr Brandt and taken up again inthe Tindemans Report,    I do not think that ideas of this kind would workeither.    For an inner decision-making group to consist of the major powers
in the Community would be unacceptable to the Bmaller countries.    For adirectorate to consist on a basis of rotation of certain of the majorcountries and some of the smaller ones would run up against the obviousobstacle that neither France, Germany nor we our belves could countenanceexclusion even for a period.    And if we sought to give second-tiermembership to some of the new members this also would be fiercelyresented and would not get general Community support for the practical reasons which I mentioned earlier that no-one would wish to damage theirown interests in these count ties by seeming to want to take the lead incondemning them to an inferior role.21.       A better course would be to intensify bilateral contacts at all levelsbetween ourselves, the Germans and the French.    The Germans and theFrench and the Germans and ourselves already have such contacts.    I amtaking steps to promote Anglo-French contacts of the same kind at official level and although it is more difficult to get on with the French than with theGermans I shall see what we can do to get it agreed that the french foreign Minister and I should meet bilaterally about twice a year and with similar arrangements between President Glscard and the Prime Minister.It would be an Illusion to imagine that, given our present economic difficulties we can be as important to the French and the Germans as the irrelations with each other.    But I think we can establish a better workingrelationship with the French if we put a bit of effort into it.    And this couldbe combined with some simplifications of working procedures.   Ways inwhich we could make the Community work better will be discussed duringthe consideration of the Tindemans Report which will, usefully from our point of view, probably be coming to the decision-taking stage during theBritish Presidency.CONCLUSION22.       The admission of new members will not on balance be to our advantage.    We can take some comfort from the fact that they will probablybe joining one by one and at intervals over several years, and from the factthat their accession will strengthen the trend against European federation.If we can establish a sound working relationship over the next three or fouryears with the French as well as with the Germans and we can take somesensible steps to improve and streamline the decision-making processes andif we can meanwhile push Community policies firmly on to lines whichbetter meet our requirements It may be that the Community would be able toassimilate the likely new members without its manageability getting out ofcontrol.   But we shall have to face the fact that the economic disadvantagesfor us will be substantial, and that it will be difficult to run the community in ways satisfactory to us,    I do not think that outright veto or delay wouldbe a practicable policy in terms of the admission of new members.  But I
think that we ought to set on foot now a study of the Implications of,Portuguese and Spanish accession and that I ought to -rcttoefhis question in confidence with my colleagues in the Community at the next SchlossGymnich Foreign Ministers meeting.L J foreign and Commonwealth Office19 March 19768

ANNEX BGREEK APPLICATION FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP:   practical implications FOR THE UNITED kingdom.    This paper assesses the practical implications for the United Kingdomof Greek membership of the Cccanunlty;   and indicates the objectives we should pursue and the interests we should aim to safeguard in forthcoming Communitywork on the Greek applications.I.     BACKGROUNDa.    The Greek Economy .2.     Sone basic facts on the Greek eoonony are sjamarised at Appendix A.   Themain points are -a. Greece has a GBP per head of $1,790 (1973 estimate) - a little underhalf the CoramuniTy average.   Compare Ireland, the poorest existing memberof the Conmunity, with a GDP per head of $2*130$   Spain with $1,750;Portugal with $1,250;   and Turkey with $540.b. In 1971 40 per cent of the Greek working population of 3.3 million were in agriculture - a high proportion as compared with other SouthernEuropean countries, except Turkey.   The industrial sector remainedrelatively snail, at some 17 per cent of total employment.c. Services (including tourism and shipping) and remittances fromworkers abroad are of major importance to the economy, but are vulnerable to economic developments outside the Greek Government*s control.d. Over 50 per cent of Greece^s visible import and export trade is withthe nine e.c. countries!   Germany and Italy are the two largest suppliers,with market shares of 17 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. . But Greeceaccounts for only 1 per cent of total e.c. exports, and only 0.4 per cent of total e.c. imports.e. The value of United Kingdom exports to Greece in 1974 was 105 million;   imports free Greece were worth about  68 million.5
b.    The e.c./Greeoe Agreement3.    The e.c./Greece Association Agreement (entered into force in 1962), wasspeoifically designed to prepare Greeoe for full membership of the Community inthe period up to 1984*   Under its provisions all Greek industrial goods and a wide range of agricultural products already receive duty-free entry into the six.   Since November 1974 a large proportion of the Six*B industrial and agricultural exports to Greece have also been duty-free.   By July 1977 the new member States will give and receive the sane treatment as the original member states.   The remaining Greek duties on the enlarged CoDraunity*s industrial goodswill be progressively reduced, and abolished by 1984, when full Customs union will be achieved.   After 1977* when the safeguard provisions at present availableto the three new Men be r States end, United Kingdom scope for taking action againstimports from Greeoe will in effect be United to the measures available under theSEC Treaty.4*    The Agreement also provides for the haroonisation by 19B4 of agriculturalpolicies between Greece and the Community, to enable Greece gradually to adoptarrangements on the lines of the CAP.   Little progress has been made in this area so far.o.    Prospects for the Greek Economy5-    The Greek economy grew rapidly in the 1960s and early 1970s.   There wasnonetheless a considerable net outflow of labour abroad, mainly to western europe and particularly to Germany where over 200,000 Greeks were estimated tobe working in 1974*   Substantial continuing deficits In overseas trade werepartly offset by workers&apos; remittances from abroad and by earnings from shipping and tourism.   In 1973-74 growth was checked first by economy measures to oounterinflationary pressures, then by political instability, the Cyprus crisis, anda deteriorating balance of payments.   Given the uncertain prospects for theinvisible earnings on which Greece is heavily dependent the balance of payments is likely to remain a major constraint.6.    The aim of successive Greek governments has been to change the economy byprogrammes of agricultural rationalisation and industrial development.   If thisis to be achieved, a considerable adjustment will be required.   the modernisation of agricultural production is likely to release a supply of relatively cheap labour into the manufacturing sector;   this could provide a6
stimulus but surplus labour will not be easily absorbed and the protection ofemployment in both industry and agriculture is likely to be a major continuingconcern of Greek govornoenta.   ite prooess of modernisation nay be enoouragedby the existing e.c./Greece agreement, and might be further aocelerated by full membership of the Connunity.   But it is unoertala whether the Greek eoonomy asit stands oould sustain the continuing impact, of integration with the Communitywithout special protective and support arrangements, although Greek ministers and Officials have expressed their confidence in their ability to meet theremaining commitments under the Association Agreement on time and even to accelerate them.II.   ECONOMIC BtPLICATICNS OF GREEK ACCESSIONa.    Trade and the Balance of Payments7.    Muoh of what would be involved in Greek membership of the Cam unity - inparticular free trade and the ham oni sat ion of agricultural policies - isalready provided for in the e.c./Greece Agreement, which has applied to theUnited Kingdom since 1 July 1975.   In the longer term, full membership nighttend to increase Greece&apos;a (already considerable) dependence on the   Gone unity of Nine as a trading partner.   But the direct effects on visible trade -including our own trade balance - would be small.   On the import side forexample, access for most of our food imports from Greece (Borne C25 millionworth of mainly Mediterranean produce) is already duty free.   It is likely that the effects on invisibles would be equally slight.   Greece, does notcompete significantly with the United Kingdom in the provision of financialarid other services in international markets (other than shipping, which is mentioned below) and in any case the direct impact of Community membership oninvisible trade - given the limited degree of harmonisation achieved in this field so far - is relatively modest.8.    On capital, movements, there is no risk of any significant balance ofpayments cost from Greece*s becoming a full member of the Community until weare in a position to meet our obligation to liberalise outward direot invest -ments to other Member States, and then only if Greece should beocoe much more attractive to United Kingdom investors.  Net United Kingflm outward direotInvestment in Greece totalled only  4*0* million in 1973;   net Inward invest-ments were even smaller.   In the longer tern, United K1&quot;giTi investment inV
Greece may increase as a result of the recent discoveries of minerals(including oil);   hut this is difficult to quantify and nay take placewhether or hot Greece joins the Contnunity.9.    In two sectors - textiles and shipping - Greek membership of the Communitymight (though this is uncertain) have some adverse impact on United kingdom interests.   DetailB are at Appendix B.10.   Greek membership of the CooDunity eould have a significant impact in thefield of commercial policy.   Prom the United Kingdom standpoint it might welladversely affect the balance of economic interests in the   Community as a whole.Following Greek accession, Greece, Italy and Prance could together be expeotedto form a &quot;Mediterranean bloc&quot; in view of their common interests in suchcommodities as wine, olive oil, tobacco and citrus;   this would strengthen the pressure within the Community towards greater protectionism in agriculture,and would make it more difficult to obtain the further improvements which weare seeking in access for food imports from third countries.   The special problem of agriculture apart, the Greeks might tend to side with those elements in the Community which are relatively uninterested in developing trade withthird countries, and would be more concerned with retaining proteoted marketswithin the Community (although they will continue to attach importance to their trade links with their Balkan neighbours).   Greek membership would thereforemake it more difficult to ensure that the Community follows a liberal andoutward looking approach in the GiTT multilateral trade negotiations and in commercial policy generally.b.    Agriculture11.   The Community is already committed, under the e.c./Greece agreement, todiscussions with Greece on the harmoniBation of agricultural policies.   Becauseof the backwardness of Greek agriculture, harmonisation will involve major improvements in the structure of holdings and Qreeoe has already sought grants from PEOGA of 1^0 mua for this purpose.   Under the Association Agreement theharmonisation process could extend over the period up to 1984 or even later;if Greece became a full member of the Community it is likely that a lengthytransitional period would still be required, but the pace of Greek adjustment to the CAP would almost certainly be accelerated with a consequential increasein the cost to Community funds and hence to the United Kingdom.8

Many of the agricultural canmoditleB of most interest to Greece - inparticular wine, fruit and vegetables and olive oil (see Appendix A, Table 5) -are also of importance to sensitive producer interests in Italy and France.Negotiations on the transitional arrangements governing Greek accession to theCommunity in these areas are likely to be difficult.   In general we can leave it to the other Member States directly concerned to make the running:   butthere is a real risk that Italy and France may demand compensation - in theform of increased subsidies from FEOGA, or of increased protection againstimports from third countries, or a mixture of both - for the damage theywould allege Greek membership would oause them.   Any such compensation wouldinvolve additional costs to Community funds or to United Kingdom consumers,and we should need to resist It, or if necessary, to argue that we wouldrequire compensating concessions on access for food importb or the internaloperation of the CAP to offset the costs we would face.13.   More generally, the strengthening of Mediterranean agricultural interestsinside the Community as a result of Greek membership would make it moredifficult for us to secure the improvements we are seeking in the operationof the CAP.   In particular it would be harder to contain CAP price levels andFEOGA expenditure, especially for Mediterranean commodities like wine andolive oil.   There would be a consequential cost - unquantifiable, but possiblysignificant - to united Kingdom consumers and to public expenditure, withoutcommensurate benefits for our own agricultural producers.o*    Financial Aspectsi.    The Community budget14*   Greece would be a substantial net recipient of funds from the community budget if she were to become a full member of the Community.   She would therefore impose a budgetary cost on the other Member States including theUnited Kingdom.   The dost Is &quot;difficult to quantify, and will itself depend onthe outcome of the accession negotiations with Greece;   but on the assumptionsoutlined in Appendix C full Greek membership in 1980 or soon after could cost the Nine up to C150 million or so a year and the United Kingdom perhaps 25 million a year (in 1975 prices).9
15.   Greece&apos;s gross budget contribution would probably be quite large in proportion to her economic weight In the Community.   In the longer term^full membership might tenrt to reduce Greek dependence on imports from out-Bide the Community.   But in the period up to I98O (and perhaps for some timethereafter) t she would be likely to pay heavy levy and duty payments on imports of beef and lamb, and third countries are likely to continue tpsupply a large proportion of her manufactured good.   This would mean paying the full c.t. on these imports.   In I960, Greece&apos;s gross contributions couldbe about 3 per oent of the Budget while her share in Community GBP wpulc&quot; be only some 2 per cent.16.   But Greeoe&apos;s budget receipts would probably be even larger.   There aretwo reasons.   The largest single item is likely to be payments from FEOGA,whioh would be subrtantial in view of Greece&apos;b large agricultural eeotor -perhaps up to  150 million a year by I98O.   Secondly, with a very lowstandard of living, Greece would be likely to reoeive substantial, payments from both.the Regional Fund and the Social Fond - perhaps totalling some 110 million by i960.   These reoeipts could together amount by 1980- to6 per oent or more of the budget.   Details of the calculations are at appendix C.17.   As a net recipient from the budget, Greece would not be eligible forreceipts from the Budget Correcting Meohanism.   But Greek membership would increase the size of the budget and thereby increase   the maximum Bize ofthe Correcting Meohaniem, whioh in turn could lead to slightly greaterUnited Kingdom reoelpts.ii.   The Social Fund and the Regional Fund .18.   The estimate of a.new budgetary oost to the united Kingdom of around 25 million as a result of Greek accession to the Community takes, aooountof the impact of Greek membership in two areas of Community expenditure -the Social Fund and the Regional Fond - in whioh we are at presentsignificant net benefiolaries.   Our net reoeipts from the Regional Fundare expected to amount to around  60 million over the three years 1975-771cur net allocations from the Soeial Fund in 1974 were over  13 million.In both areas there would be a risk, if Greece joined the Community, ofa reduction in our share of reoeipts and/or an inorease in our contributions
to help finanoe increased expenditure under the two Funds.   Even if wewere able to avoid a significant deterioration in our net position, Greekaccession would inorease the ooet of the Fond to donor oountries likeGermany, whose resistance to further expansion of Community expenditurein these areas would be strengthened.   So the prospects of a worthwhilenet return to the United Kingdom in the longer term would be greatlydiminished.   This in turn would reduce the scope for alleviating the adverse impact of the Community budget on the United Kingdom through thedevelopment of Community expenditure polioieB from whioh we could expect to benefit.19.   It will be in the interest of all the existing member states to minimise the cost of Greek aooession to the Community.   We however willhave a particular interest in pressing for the firmest possible safeguards for existing net beneficiaries from expenditure under the Social and regional Funds.   Speoifioally, it may be neoessary to resist pressure to treat Greece as generously as say, Ireland.   It is likely to be to our advantage to&apos; have the past-1977 shape of the Regional Fond (in particular the percentage *key* by whioh the reBouroes available ore distributed)settled in advance of the confirmation of Greek membership.20. A detailed assessment of the effeot of Greek membership on the social and Regional Funds iB at Appendix C.iii.   The European Investment Bank and the European MonetaryCo-operation Fund21.   The firBt financial protoool to the e.c./Greece Agreement provided forlending from the EIB to Greece in the period 1962-6*7.   A second financialprotocol is now under negotiation, which is likely to pre-empt a sub-stantial proportion of the limited funds available for lending to non-member states.22.   While Greece remains a non-member of the Community her demand forEIB loans oan be seen in the context of the Bank&apos;s capacity to lend to non-Members.   There is no competition with funds destined for theUnited. Kingdom.   If, however, Greeoe were to become a member, her demandfor project loans would oompete directly with our own.   Given that nofurther increase in the Bank,b capital base 1b currently in prospect,it is likely that some of the money at preBent ooming to us would be11
diverted to Greeoe.   The consequential lose ie difficult to estimate;hat the EXB is a useful source of loan finance (loans totalling 211 million have been granted to date) and it is for.consideration whether we should aim, in the context of the. Greek acoession negotiations,to, secure arrangements designed to ensure that the Bank will continue tohave adequate funds available for lending to the United Kingdom.23.   As a member of the Community, Greece would be entitled to participate in the short-term facilities administered by the European MonetaryCo-operation Fund, under which credit may be extended to members who axein balance of payments difficulties.   The United Kingdom would have toincrease its contribution to the Fund accordingly - perhaps by  5 million.d.; - Other Aspects24..   An assessment of the implications of Greek membership of the Comuunityin the fields of movement of labour, health and social security, transport,the environment, energy policy, EURATOK and ECSC 1b at Appendix B.   the impact in most of these areas would be marginal.   Greek accession would however be likely to bring forward the date at which free movement of labour(already provided for In the e.c./Greeoe Agreement) is achieved betweenOreeoe and the Community.   This could raise difficulties for us, particularly if It accelerated progress towards free movement of labour with Turkey.III.   INSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OP GREEK ACCESSION25.    The Institutional arrangements within the Community are weighted&quot;according to a rough population criterion.   The population.of Greeoe (9 million)seems likely to give it a weighting comparable to that of Belgium (10 million).Greek Membership would require adjustment to the Treaties to give Greeoe fullparticipation in the institutions on the same lines as those set out in theTreaty of Accession in 1972 (Part two, Title l).   The main changes would be -a.    The Assembly.   The number of seats allocated to Greeoe would depend on how at that time the Assembly Itself had developed, what itselse was and especially whether there was a uniform prooedure for the direct   elect ion of Members by universal suffrage in acoprdanoe with12
Article 138 of the e.c. Treaty.   At present Belgium has 14 eeatBout of 198 (7 per oent) hut this proportion would he likely to diminish if the AB8erably&apos;s present proposals for expansion (thepatijn Report) were accepted.b.    The Counoil.   The Rotation of the Presidency, and the weightingsfor qualified majority voting would need to be changed.o.    The Commission.   A Greek commissioner would be appointed, withthe opportunity for him to take his turn as Vice-President (assuming the present organisation of the Commission).d. The Court of Justice.   A Greek judge would be appointed.e. The Economic and Social Committee. The Membership would need to be increased, probably by a further 12 seats (4 in each group),* if Belgium is the pattern.f. ECSC Consultative Committee.   An increase of Membership wouldalso be necessary, but its precise size would depend on calculationsabout the size and strength of that seotor of Greek industry.26.   Greek Membership would unless the existing rules were changed, whichwould be very difficult to achieve, require an additional language to beused, with substantial but unforeseeable oonsequences for linguistic(translators and interpreters) and clerical/documentary staff in each ofthe Community institutions.   In addition, Greek officials would need tobe appointed to each of the institutions, though it is not likely thatthere would be an equivalent disturbance to that which faced the Communitywhen the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland acceded in 1973.   A fair sharefor Greeoe (comparable to Belgium) in the CommiBBion or the CouncilSecretariat would be about 5 per pent of the Senior (A) gradeB, and a comparable proportion among other grades.   The Commission has not yetmade   any study of the practical problems involved but the difficulty of bringing in Greek staff, who would of course have to be linguistioallyqualified, would partly depend on the financial climate at the time, the speed with which it was decided to bring them in and how far new postsoould be added to the existing complement without the need for compensatingreduction among nationals of other aeriber states.

In December 1974, the United &quot;j^don; intrcduced&quot;.restraints on inports of Greek cotton yarn.   After July 1977, when C-rcekindustrial  ocas will be duty free, the safeguard provisions available tothe new Member States will lapse, and we rill no longer be able to take such effective action.   However in 1974 Greek textiles represented only0.45* of the United Kin&amp;noa,a total textile imports although Greek cottonyarn formed 7fJ of total gotten yarn^.aports. ^ ^2.     SHIFPE&amp; AMD SHIBUILDIJfo(a) shipping at present there is no Community shipping policy and the EKC/Greeceagreement has no effect on shipping.

Althoughtwo thirds of the Greek torjiage is non-tanker, cc-rared. *.-dth half -theUiC tonnage, and the Greek fleet is also considerably older then ourown, the Greek registered fleet v/ould be the second largest in theCommunity, after the UK.

As thingsnow stand, we are the only country of the Nine which, in the short term,has the prospect of producing oil in any quantity.   In Greece, oil ar.igas have been found in commercial quantities offshore; contribute:.ercial &amp;rcploi-tation could begin in 1976.   The presence of another oil producer albeita scsll one in the Community may be of some assistance in getting the sort of ESC energy policy we should liko to see.   There could also te anoutlet in Greece for products of the UK&apos;s growing offshore supply industry&apos;4.     EUHATOM.&apos;.:eabership of the Communities includes menbership of Euratom.   Greecehas currently no nuclear power capability and already posesses electricityjlgenerating capacity in excess of demand.   There is a tentative plan to commission a first nuclear power station about 1985.   Greek membership of Suraton could provide outlets for the UK&apos;s nuclear construction and fuel - cycle industries but the impact would be snail.   Exchange ofmaterials, workers and technology subject only to Euratom safeguards coulslead to further nuclear proliferation, which would not be in United Kins1&apos;&quot;interests.5.     EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL JSOI^uTOTYGreece has no Association Agreement with the European Coal aniSteel Community but has applied for accession to all three Communities.UK trade A th Greece is comparatively snail.   Imports of finished products, mainly plates and sheet, amounted to 16,600 tonnes in 1973and to 1,500 tonnes in 1974.   Exports, mainly tinplate, plates and wirerod, were 58,000 tonnes in 1973 and 40,000 tonnes in 1974.   Steel importsfrom Greece into UK pay the full rate of duty, ie up to 8^ for SC3C proc&quot;uCUK exports to Greece are liable for duty varying between      and 24?* for most finished products.- The Greek steel industry is expanding.   Its current crude steelcapacity is about 1.5 million tonnes and it is reported that this figure is to be doubled by 1977.   Raw steel production in 1974 was reported tobe 850,000 tonnes, having increased from 450,000 tonnes in 1970.   Outputof rolled products is also increasing.   In general, it seems lively thatGreece*s accession to the ECSC would have little impact on the UK ironsteel industry.   In view of the planned expansion of the steel industry-la Greece, however, there could be some benefit to the UK in bringing       .Greece into the Treaty of Paris regime, in particular within the &apos;-rule&amp;*   In the long term some benefit to our steel exuorts could also be,dariv*4 from tariff reductions.   The expanding Greek industry will beccst19
 Ji additional drain on the contribute-unity&apos;s supplies of ferrous scrap,   &quot;reeco&quot;imports little from the  CISC at present because of the export controls tothird countries but the scale of the new dc-nand should ijot raise any si?:-significant m-oblects.6. .  m/uSPORT &apos;Sinco Greece has no land frontier with any e.c. country, her accession to the Cocmunity would bo unlikely to have any direct impact on the shape of the Cor2r.unity&apos;s transport policy or network.   On road haulr.::e, re atpresent benefit frota Greece&apos;s fairly liberal outlook (which has been con-firmed by the terns of a recent bilateral agreement).   There are scneindications that traffic between this country and Greece,&quot;which is mostly .carried by UK operators, is growing: according to figures published inGerr/any, goods carried from Greece to OC increased from 800 tons in 1972to 2,500 tons in 1973; and from UK to Greece from 800 tons in 1972 to4,800 tons in 1973.   However, the potential advantage is limited by theneed for transit across non-3EC countries such as Yugoslavia which havea relatively restrictive regime on international transport.   And, if Greecedoes join, the fact that she  nay on political grounds tend to align her-self with France, and that much of her trade is with Germany and Austria,nay lead her to adopt a-dess liberal outlook which would conflict withour interests.Ko particular advantages or disadvantages are foreseen in road a.3.s-P.n--&quot;G? transport and the impact for railwayjs is likely to be verymarginal.7.     SimpISSKT &quot;  &apos;It seems likely that environmental problems nay be worse in Greece,relative to the level of industrialisation, than in the ttine - wxcept perhaps in Italy.   This would not necessarily suggest a slowing of progressin the Comrrunity1 s environmental programme but might add to pressure fora system of aids which srould run counter to UK policy.8.    Ha/lLTH .AKD SOClAt SBGURI^Y   &apos; &apos;y he UK has no agreement on social security vith Greece.  Our present information is that* although Greece has a quite advanced, social securityscheme on paper, the scheme is badly administered,       have accordingly decided,.against initiating any aotion leading to the conclusion of abUatsgal.agreement. , .if Greece succeeded in her. application then taro Community social security^Eegulatipns (1408 and 574/72) would apply to her. ju3t as to theother Heobers.

The regulations also provided that member states will extend-free or low-cost iMdical&quot;, reatraftnt to visiting&apos; nationals ofother member states on the earae terms given to their own people.   On present information it is likely that Greece could aatisfy these requirements in

She will need rivicejprobably on how to do this and be given trne to achieve it.&apos;.7hcther the application of the social security requirements wouldhave a net cost or benefit for the UK will depend on the net flow of migration between the UK and Greece.

TBYgJEiT oy LABOURGreek membership of the Community would imply&quot;that her nationalswould be free to move throughout the Community in search of work, thoughit nay be that some period of transition to full freedom of movementcould be negotiated.   There is already an Association Agreement withGreeks under w!.ich freedom of movement of Greek workers i^ envisagedthough the date and manner of implementation have still to be decided.The numbers emigrating from Greece to the rest of the world havebeen falling from 92,000 ( 8,000 to Europe) in 1970 to 27, 000 (15,000to Europe) in 1973.   Part of the reason for this may be that unemployed*jin Greece has been concurrently falling.   The numbers entering the UKto work have also been falling but only a few hundreds are involved.In the 5 years 1970/74 about 3,100 Greeks entered thi3 couniry to work.Germany has been more of an attraction to Greek labour than the UnitedKingdom, ^It is hard to say how many Greeks would come to this country forwork if there were free ma oment.   The opening of our labour market to the Italians when we joined the Community did not result in any     xflood of Italians coming here.   It may be that if large r.um&quot;-ers were -0come here they could create social problems of the kind with which weare familiar in connection with other groups.

1.     THE C&amp;&quot;:UKITY. BUDGET AS A whole the assessment of the inplications of Creek membership for thebudget (paras 15-13 of the main paper) has been based on a crudeforecast of Greek contributions to and receipts from the budget in 1930 on the assumption that Greece is a full member of the eec and subject to the own resources system.   In practice, Greececould probably not become a fully integrated Corrjsunity memberby 1930.   But the analysis of 1930 facilitates the forecastingexercise without, it is hoped, blurring by too much the basicimplications of Greek membership.2.     The forecast is as follows:(Cm 1975 prices)	Greek receipts	Greek contributions	FEOGA	150	Industrial duties	50RDF	40	Agricultural	expansion	70	levies and duties	50OH refunds	.10	VAT	Total	&quot;270	-1	140Other budget expenditune (administration, aid etc)   30Note: calculations based on an exchange rate of  1=1.7 ua.3.     Details of the forecast of FEOGA expenditure are given in paras 9-12 below. ,r4.     The considerations underlying the forecast, of reoeipts fromthe Regional Fund (RDF) are outlined in paras 13-17 belew.   Itis estimated that Greece will receive 1855 of the Fund.   Biieshare assumes that Greece will receive the same RDF expenditureper head of the population, as Ireland does now.   Ireland receivesgenerous treatment from the PDF.   In practice, Greece mightnot do as well;  this would be a matter for negotiation.   Inthe long run however Greek accession seetaa- Likely, to increaseCommunity expenditure through the RDF; for the purposes of thepresent exerciser lSj  increase in total RDF expenditure has been22 &apos;  -C00 the DENii;
(confidential) fassumed.   Total RDP expenditure in 19S0 (including Greece) i3 estimated     :at about 400 mua (in constant prices).5.    The forecast of receipts from the Social Fund (expansion) is based on asimilar methodology to the PDF forecast - ie that Greece will be treatedas generously as Ireland.   Total Social Fund expenditure is expected to beincreased by Greek accession to a total of about 700 nua by 1980.     this assumption is probably over-gencrous.   The factors affecting current andfuture Community expenditure under the Social Fund are discussed inparagraphs 16-23 below.   However it should be noted in particular that theoperation of the Fund is due to be   reviewed in 1976&quot; and thus the exactshape and scale of the Fundrs activities by 198O are particularly difficultto predict.6**     Own resources (OR) refunds are 10 per cent of forecast levy andduty payments.   Other budget expenditure is forecast as a proportion ofthe increase in the size of the total budget.   (This is probably an over-estimate).7*     Industrial duties are forecast on the basis of an estimate of industrialimports from third countries in I98O and an industrial tariff rate ofabout 6 per cent (after allowance for the Tokyo Round of tariff cuts).   the forecast of agricultural levy and duty payments is discussed below(paragraph 12).8.    VAT payments in 198O are based on an estimate of the Greek share ofthe total Community VAT tranche and an estimate of the total size ofthe VAT call-up (derived from the budget renegotiation forecasts).2.     FSOGA expenditure.     The effects of Greek membership on Community expenditure and receiptsin the agricultural sector need to be considered under 3 headings -(i)   Increased expenditure due to internal market actions forexport subsidisation.(ii)   Reduced expenditure where, for instance, the Communitycurrently pays an export restitution on exports to Greece.(iii)   Increased levy and duty revenue.10.   It is difficult to produce more than extremely tentative estimatesat this stage, if only because of the poor data on Greek agricultureavailablcsto us.   Assumptions also have to be made about levels of import levies, export restitutions and internal Community subsidies.Taking the rates applicable in 1975/76 the effects of Greek membershipcan be summarised as adding in the order of 250 million ua to grossguarantee and guidance expenditure, to which should be offset thepossibility of increased &quot;own resources&quot; receipts and reduced expenditureon export subsidies currently paid on trade to Greece of the order&apos;*f 60 million ua, but possibly rising as high as 100 million ua.
11.     These calculations do not take any account of either any possible compensation demanded by France and/or Italy for allegeddamage, or of any extra guarantee payments for olive oil etcin respect of Italian or French production displaced by Greekproduction - both of which are unquantifiable at this stage.12.     The main elements in the estimate of 250 mua are as follows.(i)    Increased Guarantee Expenditure - The main iteas wouldbe tobacco (around 110 million ua/,&quot; olive oil (about100 million ua), durum wheat, citrus and other fresh andprocessed fruit and vegetables (around 10 million uaeach).(li)    Increasein Guidance Section - This is highly speculativeThere is little doubt that Green&quot;accession would increaseexpenditure ^under this head.   The gross figure of 250million uni s of account includes an arbitrary allowance of 10 million ua to increase the limit under the guidancesection.(iii)    Increase in Own Resources Income - This arisesmainly in the meat section -&quot;principally&quot; beef (some 50 to55 million ua which could rise to some 90 million ua if-the OECD forecast of a doubling of import requirementsby 1978 is realised).(iv)    Savings on Current Export Restitutions - The mainitem here is milk products     million ud).3.     REGIONAL JDSVELOFHEITT FUND13.    The extent to which the three; wet beneficiaries stand to gain from the present Fund (ie from 1975 to 1977) in termsof maximum gross receipts per head of population varies oon-siderably, as follows:Irish Republic       26    ua- Italy 9*5 *a/      - OK &apos; 6.6 ua14.    She Creek GBP/head is lower than Ireland^ *ad is pre-bably in line with the level in the I-Ieszogiorno. Jf the Greekshad to be tjpewted as generously as the irish Republic - onthe basis that the Greek population (8..769o)i&quot;^oc*.three times that of the Irish Republic (2,936a) r Greece would haveto have 18 per cent of the Fund,   It it $ early going to bedifficult to accommodate a Greek quota of 18 per cent withouta significant reduction in the present UK share of 28$.   Forexample, if all the existing national quotas were reduced by18^ to provide for a Greek quota (and the Irish and the Italiansmight well be able to avoid suffering suoh a reduction) theeffect would be to reduce&quot; pur &quot;share to 23$ which would make the
United Kingdom a net contributor to the RDF, on the assumptionthat our avorass contribution to the Community budget in 1978-79is 22-24 por cent.15.     The precise iapact of Greek accession to the Community onthe existing Member States1 shares of the Regional Fund wouldbe a matter for negotiation.   The Community night well be unwilling to concede the Greeks a share on the same scale asthe Irish for a population three times the sise; and greece would not have the saico leverage as Ireland had at the tine ofthe original decision on shares.   Account would also be taken of Greece&apos;s substantial net beneiits from the CAP and theSocial Fund.   Against this background, it is possible thatthe Creek share of the RDF might be held Within the range10 to 15 per cent, at least in the period immediately followingaccession.   Even on this relatively favourable assumption,however, the UK share of the Fund would be reduced to around24 or 25 per cent.16.     The UK&apos;s share of the RDF must significantly exceed its contribution for the Fund to be of value to us.   The prospectof achieving this lead with Greece as a member looks poor.   IfSpain, Portugal and Turkey were alaoto join it scene inevitable that the UK would become a net donor country.   Even if Greecewas treated rather less generously her accession must beexpected to limit our gain from the Fund.17*    ^he net donor countries will also lose by the accession of another net recipient.   This is likely to influence thoirapproach to the future of the Fund and may lead them to workhard to avoid any increase in the size of the Fund after 1977-As a result even if we continued to have a larger percentageshare of tho Fund than our percentage contribution to thebudget there would be a greatly diminished prospect of a worthwhile not return from the Fund.4.    - SOCIAL FUND18.     The European Social Fund exists to provide financialassistance for training and resettlement schemes which not onlyenable workers no. obtain and retain stable employment butalso help industry to keep pace vriLth the demands of technicalprogress.   It operates two main budgets:(a)    Under Article 4 it can intervene in areas specificallydetermined by the Council of Ministers.   The groups of-   Herkers who benefit by decisions already made are workers-iA or leaving tho textile industry, workers leavingagriculture to take up employment elsewhere, migrant- workers, disabled workers and young people.
(b)    Under Article 5 assistance from, the Fund1 is availablewhere employment difficulties impede the harmonious develop-ment of the Community especially in areas which are less developed or are suffering from a decline in majorindustries leading to a prolonged and serious imbalance inemployment.19.     The total budget of the Fund for 1974 was 260 mua (50 muaunder Article 4; 210 kus under Article 5)&apos;   Grants approved bythe Commission for Member States totalled 254*5 aiua of whichthe UK share of these allocations was almost 255S, compared witha contribution (for 1974) of 11$.20.    There are no fixed shares for Member States in the SocialFund.   Applications normally exceed the Funds available and al-locations arc made by &quot;the Coianission on the basis of a system -of priorities and with the advice of a Tripartite Committeeon which all Kcaber States are represented.21.    An initial hypothesis would be that if admitted to,the C on-muni ty, Greece would quite soon become a net benef iticary from   * *the Fund and thai to some extent the UK&apos;s ccopetitiva positionin securing allocations would be weakened.   This hypothesesis however subject to a number of oualifications. ijj^aistancefrom the Fund is granted only in strict oompiiahoa&apos; Isatfc theRegulations.   Applicants must satisfy the precise regairmenteof Article 5 or of the authorised schemes under Arti6le&quot;4..A preliminary attempt has been made to assess the likelihood of greece being able to meet the requirements 1-  .a*     Agriculture - &apos; -d-      -In 1971 twd-fifths of the Greek labour force was in agri-culture; only 171$ of total ^employaent was in theindustrial sector.   EC membership of the Comounity- resulted in industrial expansion Greece might thereforesoon be able to iaounV significant applications&apos;under theArticle 4 Agriculture Soheme.b.    lttgranti HorkersMigration is an&apos; important factor influencing the Greeklabour market over the longer term, although tto rate of migration and the number of migrants employed - par-ticularly in Germany, the main host country - havareoently decreased.   The Artiole 4 Migrant Scheme isstill fairly new and the policy of theConBission is not fully developed.   It is stated in their third annual report on the Fund-that olear priority will be given infuture to integrated procram&amp;es jwrried out jointly bythe Country of origin and the host Country.   If Greece-   i26
becomes a r.icribi-r of -the Coy-iimity there will obviously bea possibility of a joint Grsck-Ger:;;?Ji BchcMG reccivit:;: ahigher priority lh-rt liK sc!&apos;iC&quot;!0&apos;: on beh?,lf of third countrymigrant 3 -.;hich have ro far secured, for 113 the lion&apos;rj share ofthe none./ available under the seheTie.c.     R e-o t ru c.tur:&apos;i r &quot; G c r em o 3OECD reports &quot;a&quot;&quot;snoi-Trire&quot;oi&apos; skilled and semi-skilled labouran restricting the upswing of industrial development in greece.    This points to the possibility of Crsece benefitingfrom Structural Rc-adjustnent Schemes whether under theexisting Article 5 or under a new Article 4 Scheme whichthe Council is expected to authorise later this year;although the shortage in Greece of training infrastructureand training personnel night be a limiting factor.23,     It is        difficult to quantify the net benefit Greecenight be expiated to receive from the Social Fund.    Ibis is notsinply because of the familiar difficulties of forecastingtwo years or more ahead.    Tnere is no certain ly that if andwhen Greece ii; admitted to the Community the shape of the SocialFund and the assistance available from it will resemble at allclosely those that appertain today.    The working of the SocialFund is due to be reviewed by the Commission in 1976.    In commonno doubt with the- other &quot;ember Statt-.;: we shall want to surestchanges in tl-e objectives and procedures of the iund.    It isalso to be noted that schemes approved by the Council underArticle 4 3-rc usually introduced for a limited period only sothat for example the existing scheme for assistance to migrantworkers will lapse in June 1977*   Any. fresh schemes that maybe introduced will 01 course take account of the conditionsin the Community at that time.J
