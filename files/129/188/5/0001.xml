DOCUMENT K THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government(76) 3012 March 1976CABINETNATIONAL NEWSPAPER industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade. The Interim Report on the national newspaper industry by theRoyal Commission on the Press will be presented to Parliament and published on Wednesday 17 March 1976.    This urgent Report was requested by the Government in September 1975 with the support of managements and unions because of widespread fears that one or more national newspapersmight close while the Commission was pursuing its general remit.2.        The Commission see the reduction of costs by the introduction ofnew equipment and agreed reduction of manpower as the only way to earlyimprovement of the industry&apos;s financial position;  and they see currentjoint management/union discussions as a major opportunity fox promotingthis.   The Commission reject a general subsidy.   They consider mostcompanies could borrow from the private sector to finance these developments but recommend Government loans for any who cannot.They recommend the Government provide a measure of interest relief.3,        These recommendations have been discussed by a ministerial meeting under the Prime Ministers chairmanship when it was agreedthat the Government should broadly welcome the Commission^ approachbut avoid specific commitment.   I attach the text of a statement I proposeto make after Questions on 17 March.PSDepartment of Trade12 March 1976COPY NO81
DRAFT statement the Interim Report on the national newspaper industry bythe Royal Commission on the Press is laid before the Housaand published today.The Report appears at an important moment in Fleet Street.In recent months, management and Unions have been workingtogether to reach a comprehensive agreement on modernmanning levels and technology.   The Report considers thatthe rapid collective implementation of such an agreement is essential.   The Government recognises the importance ofsuch a co-ordinated approach.To achieve the breakthrough needed, very substantialexpenditure will be involved over a period of about fouryears.   It will mean major capital investment in newequipment and financing the costs of redundancies, followingconsequent demanning and some rationalisation of FleetStreet&apos;s floating labour force.   To this would have to beadded the cost of associated improved pension schemes.In exchange, there will be large offsetting savings.   TheRoyal Commission take the view that a general subsidy forthe Press is unnecessary and unjustified and can be avoidedby the introduction of such a scheme on the right terms.Nor do they believe that the industry would welcome subsidies on this basis.   The Gfovernment agree.The Royal Commission hazard outline figures for costs andsavings of  50 - 55 million (in respect of capital investment and demanning costs) and of  35 million per annum in respectof economies.   In fact - and I am sure the Commission wouldbe the first to agree - it is not possible to predict eitherfigure with confidence now.   Before anyone can get the
measure of what is involved it is essential to know fromthe joint Union/management team what are their agreedmanning levels and what are the specific compensatorypayments to be associated with them.   Although the intention is that these will be applied on a standard basis throughoutFleet Street, it will still be necessary for each house towork out their agreed consequentials in respect of their individual positions, which vary very widely.The key to the Royal Commission&apos;s proposals is that any individual house participating in this collective schemeshall be able, within a relatively short time, to financetheir costs out of their savings.   This means that a high proportion of them should be able to secure necessary loanfinance from the private sector.   They add that there maybe cases where a house could achieve these valuable off-setting economies in the medium term but meanwhile hasdifficulties in meeting the normal commercial requirements.The Royal Commission propose that such loans should be madeavailable from public sources.The Government recognise that Fleet Street now has anopportunity of taking bold collective action to deal withtheir central problem.   There are however a number ofimportant issues for decision; but, above all, in present financial circumstances, when the availability of public money must necessarily be very limited, it is imperativefor all concerned to have the measure of the figuresinvolved.   We shall therefore be inviting the Fleet Streetcommittee to tell us by the end of ^&quot;June^ what specificdernanning and compensation figures they are agreed upon;and by the end of /&quot;July^ we shall ask individual houses to submit similarly agreed figures of the consequentialsin terms of costs and savings for their own positions.   Once
supplied with such, basic arithmetic, the Government will consider urgently and constructively what role they could most usefully play.I am sure the House will wish to join me in thanking the RoyalCommission for the serious and constructive report they have submitted.-3-CONFIDENTIAL
