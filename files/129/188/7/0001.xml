DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT0 1C(76) 32 COPY NO    0115 March 1976CABINETPROGRESS REPORT ON THE CONTINGENCY RESERVENote by the Chancellor of the exchequer enclose for the attention of my colleagues a second progress report bythe Chief Secretary on the state of fee contingency reserve.    I am in full agreement with his comments and conclusions.D W treasury Chambers15 March 1976
(confidential)PUBLIC EXPENDITURE - THE CONTINGENCY RESERVESECOND PROGRESS report.     A first progress report on the state of the contingency reserve was circulated in February under C(76)l8,together with guidelines for future arrangements.    I now wishto present a second report and circulate herewith two tables.One deals with the situation for 1976-77; the other covers thewhole period to 1979-80.   In the paragraphs below I deal only with 1976-77 for which the contingency reserve included in thelast public expenditure White Paper is  700 million at 1975 survey prices or  875 million at 1976-77 outturn prices.   The figures which follow are all at 1976-77 outturn prices.2.     Table 1 shows that we had earlier given firm agreement toa claim of  132 million. There are further claims of  167 million which I deal with in more detail below and to which I now feel obliged to agree.   Altogether this would mean that  299 million of the reserve would now be committed.   Against the balance of 576 million there are already firm bids and other claims totalling 600-630 million; up to  54 million more than the provisionwe made in the White Paper published a month ago.3.     The claims which I propose should be allowed are:-Family income supplement ( 5 million)The DHSS has searched for savings to offset the costof a special uprating of FIS which SS committee had conditionallyagreed, but I accept that none have been found which theycould reasonably ask us to approve in present circumstances.I now propose that the condition of offsetting savingsbe waived.
(confidential)Welsh Housing ( 35 million)New building of council houses is an open-ended programme,and local authorities in Wales have decided to step up theirrate of building.    I have approved the inevitable addition to expenditure in 1976-77, but I should remind my colleagues that,so long as this programme remains open-ended - in Englandand Scotland as well as in Wales - we may have to accommodatefurther additions on this account.   While therefore I do not propose to reopen this policy at the present stage, we may be driven to re-consider it later on; and I have not approved the prospective increases in Wales for the later years.    The .Secretary of State for Wales has however been able to identifysavings to offset a further, largely consequential, additionin 1976-77 ( 25 million) on housing subsidies etc. But thishas exhausted the possibilities of offsetting savings in thatyear; and savings have not yet been identified on a similarscale for continuing prospective additions on subsidies etcin later years.Civil Aviation Authority ( 4 million)An   increase of  11 million has been requested in theprovision for grant-in-aid to the Civil Aviation Authority.I am agreeing to  4 million of this since offsetting savingscannot be found and the expenditure appears unavoidable. Theclaim for the balance of 17 million is still under consideration.1973.Coal Industry Act ( 13 million)The Secretary of State for Energy proposes to make orders on 17 March extending for two years to March 1978 his powers under the 1973 Coal Industry Act to make grants to help withthe costs of pit closures and to make payments to redundantminers.   I am prepared to agree in principle to this proposal,at a cost of  13 million in 1976-77 and a similar amount in1977-78; somewhat smaller but still substantial amounts areenvisaged for later- years.   There is a good economic case
(confidential)for smoothing the process of eliminating redundant capacity,but in principle the National Coal Board should make thenecessary payments from internal resources.    However., thepayments have been made with Government assistance since thel960^,moo1ification or withdrawal would require careful negotiation with both the NCB and the NUM.    I have concluded that anextension of the schemes for two years is unavoidable, butI think that a review should start now of the case for continuing Government assistance and the scale of payments,if any, after March 1978.    I have not, therefore, agreed tcthat part of the bid which assumes continuation of theschemes in their present form indefinitely.British Steel Corporation: Increase in stocks ( 60 million)The BSC sought a massive increase of around  300 million in its allocation for capital expenditure of various kinds,especially for stock building.    In discussion with theCorporation, it has been secured that most of this will bex   ... absorbed in the existing programme, but there remains a requirement for  60 million for increased stocks associatedWith thehigher level.of output which must be the Corporation&apos;a target as the economy revives.    I understand that thecase for these additional stocks is being considered by E.C.Subject to EICs agreement, I think we must accept the  60 million as an ineluctable   charge on the contingency reserve.   I am,however, extremely concerned about the number and size ofthe additional claims from the nationalised industries, including&apos;   an outstanding bid from the BSC for  42 million for a counter-&apos;cyclical stockpile.    Unless these are scrutinised with the utmostrigour, and reduced to the lowest possible level - not leastby causing the industries to absorb as much as they can oftheir extra claims - they could well wreck our public expenditure plans.
(CONFIDENTIAL)-Additional Staff Costs  ( 29 million)This is a provisional estimate of additional staff costs as compared with the figures in the public expenditure white paper.    The major part of this is for additional staff inDHSS and the Department of Employment as agreed in recentcorrespondence between the Lord Privy Seal and the PrimeMinister.Other Claims ( 13 million)This composite figure includes  5 million for continuation of the Price Commission, provisionally until July; a UKcontribution of  230,000 towards collating the results ofthe high temperature reactor development (Dragon);  0.8 million for the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation;  0.6 million for storage space for cereals;  1.7 million for the cost of thePeterhead Bay Harbour tanker jetty;  4.1 million on theEuropean fusion programme (JET) to which Ministers agreed atan EN Committee meeting on 13 February;  0.5 million on school building in Scotland in areas near North Sea Oil development;S.0.h million for providing additional accommodation for MP&apos;s.Police numbers ( 8 million)The Home Office have reported that they expect to recruitmore police officers within existing establishments, and thatcertain increases in establishment will be necessary.Cmnd 6393 (page 80) undertakes that provision will be madefor additional expenditure within authorised establishments.I am prepared to recommend acceptance of this extra expenditure,but I am concerned at the open-ended nature of this commitment on police manpower; even before the proposed increase, theprovision for police current expenditure in 1976-77 had alreadyrisen by some  30 million (at 1975 Survey Prices) compared withthe PESC Report.    I do not think that this commitment on policemanpower can remain open-ended without limit.
(CONFIDENTIAL)4.     I have dealt so far with a number of requirements on whichearly decisions are needed and from which there appears to be noescape.    I should like to mention two other issues which have notseemed to me to fall into that category.    Public investment of upto  20 million in the film industry over the next few years hasbeen suggested; I have reserved my position on this, and it islikely to come forward for further consideration collectively very shortly.   There is also the question of the newspapers, on whichI think we should all accept that no specific financial commitmentcan or should be accepted for the time being by the Government inrelation to the demanning and re-equipment scheme to be recommended in the Interim Report from the Royal Commission on 17 March.5.     After allowing for the claims on the contingency reserve whichWe have already approved or for which I now recommend approval,these further proposals together with other identifiable claims onthe contingency reserve would, if they all materialised, more thanaccount for the  576 million balance available for 1976-77 out ofthe original  875 million as I have already indicated.    Other thingsbeing equal, any excess over this balance would entail an additioneither to taxation or the borrowing requirement.6.     There is also an important political and presentational aspectto this.   Even before the appearance of the public expenditure white paper, the Expenditure Committee was exercising increasingly closesurveillance over our actual performance in this field and, in therecent proceedings of the Committee, I have come under strong pressure to report regularly on progress in managing the contingency reserve.It will be difficult not to go a long way towards meeting this request,which will bring our performance under even closer public scrutinyand make it all the more important to avoid being discredited by over-commitment soon after publication of the White Paper.    If anyserious prospect of that should materialise,! should s ee no alternative but to invite my colleagues to consider how to correct the sit uationby seeking savings in particular programmes.    It will be much better if we can avoid the need for that by the utmost restraint andselectivity in pressing further claims on the contingency reserve.
(confidential)Conclusions7.      I invite my colleagues to approve my proposals for accepting the claims on the contingency reserve which I have listed inparagraph.3 of this paper, on grounds of priority   or inevitabilityor a combination of the two, but to take note of the limited resources remaining in the contingency reserve to meet furtherclaims relating to the financial year 1976-77 which still liesahead.
