ANNEXBRITISH OBJECTIVES IN THE EUROPEAN community note by OfficialsIntroduction1.    Now that we have decided to remain in the European Community whatdo we want to make of it?    In the short term, of course, our attitude is oneof vigilant defence of our interests, seizing what opportunities we can to turnparticular policies and situations to our advantage and with public opinionopposed to closer integration in any federalist sense.    But what do we wantin the longer term?    The British do not like answering questions of this kind.Lord Salisbury once defined British foreign policy in terms of drifting gentlydownstream and fending off obstructions with a boat hook.     This approach wasnot without its advantages in the days of splendid isolation.    But our power isno longer splendid and we are no longer isolated.    We have joined eight otherson a journey to an unknown destination.    And the fact that our destination isshrouded with some uncertainty is no guarantee, as Christopher Columbusfound, that we shall not end up somewhere radically different from where westarted.    So we need to assess carefully the nature of the tides against whichwe shall have to contend, the direction in which we want to go and the steerwhich we shall want to give the boat.2.    All the more so, because, quite apart from the decisions which are takenweek by week in Brussels, and which in themselves shape bit by bit the evolution of the Community, there are issues of major importance to be dealtwith.    We are already involved in discussion of direct elections.    Theprocessing of the Greek application for membership - and possibly otherapplications - will raise some fundamental questions about the nature andmanageability of the Community.    The Tindemans Report will also meandiscussion of some important points.    In the first half of next year we shall havethe Presidency of the Community - and at the same time the United kingdom should have - for two (possibly four) years - the Presidency of the Commission.Much will be expected of us; we cannot sensibly proceed without a clear view onthe direction of advance which would best suit the United Kingdom interest.
So this paper -a. reviews the major sectors of Community activity with a view to taking stock of where we stand and then setting out our main objectives and how we should approach them; and b, relates these objectives to the extent that will be practicable and useful to a coherent strategy which would reflect our policy prioritieswithin the European Community and provide a basis on which to planour tactical handling of individual Community issues.To this end the paper considers in turn -a. what we want the Community for; before discussing how to promoteour interests it seems advisable to define them (paragraphs 5-6);b. our point of departure -i. where the Community has got to (paragraphs 8-9); and ii. our own economic situation and the constraints which thiswill impose on us over the next couple of years (paragraphs 10-c. our immediate aims sector by sector (paragraph 12);d. their tactical handling (paragraph 13);e. the considerations which we should have in mind in reviewing theseaims (paragraphs 14-19);f. the areaB where it would be in our interests to engage in further work (paragraphs 20-31);g. conclusions (paragraph 32).What do we want the Community for?We want the Community -a.    to provide ub with a power base  for external action.    We have morin the way of world wide interests than other Member States.    To theextent that we can persuade our Community partners to adopt a commonposition broadly in line with our interests the weight behind the thrust is
much greater than what we would have on our own.    Examples havebeen the Lome Convention when we brought the wealth of the community to bear on helping 46 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and commonpositions in the Seventh Session of the United Nations, the multilateral trade negotiations now in train, a common line in dealing with Americanprotectionism and a common stance as the Europe of the Nine on questionsof political co-operation.b. to domesticate the energies of Germany.    Within the Community we canprevent its domination by Germany and while reinforcing the France-Germanrapprochement prevent the dominance of a German French axis.    And an effective Community of which Britain is a part can provide the Germanswith a viable alternative to German reunification.c. to provide us with a large near rich and tariff free home market toenable us to enjoy economies of scale and to assist in the regenerationof British industry.    The Community collectively is our largest export market.    It is also our largest competitor.    Thus the Community does not guarantee anything except increased competition; but to the extent that wecan improve our competitive performance we shall be able to take advantageof it as the other Members have&quot; done.d. to provide ub with a safety net in case of real trouble.    The Communityhas almost as vested an interest in our survival and prosperity as a nation as we have ourselves.    And if it were really necessary the Communitycollectively and Member States individually would probably rally round -although on terms - with substantial money to see us through.e. as a rich large scale developing organisation which we can turn to our advantage in many different ways - eg on energy policy, in industrial policyand in agriculture - if we have a clear idea of our objectives and the skill and the willpower to reach them.f. to foster democratic stability and support for the Western Alliancein Europe.
6.    In other words the Community is a major factor in world politics and world economics.    As part of the Community we can move it in directions ofbenefit to us provided that we can hold our own successfully in an increasinglycompetitive situation.b.    Point of departure7.    Our point of departure for considering the evolution of the Communitymust be -a. the present state of the Community and the view taken of it by our partners particularly in relation to the Tindemans Report;b. our own economic position and prospects and the extent to which these will impose constraints on the policies we would wish to follow.1.    Present state of the Community8.    We have joined a Community which is a Customs Union and which has aCommon Agri cultural Policy.    Because of these uniform policies in termsof free circulation within its boundaries of industrial and (despite some curre,lhbarriers) agricultural goods and a common regime towards imports from thifcountries, the Community has had to develop an external commercial policy-This it has done with some success; although the Common Commercial PoH^tnot yet complete it has played a major and constructive part in two of the GAmultilateral trade negotiations and in launching a third.    It achieved a corm710^position among the Nine in the CSCE and in the Seventh Special Session of theUnited Nations in New York.    And parallel with these achievements theCommunity has made good progress with a co-ordination among its member9of foreign policy.9.    But in other - mainly internal - fields the progress made so far by theCommunity has ranged from the limited to the non-existent.    For example ^programme for progress towards EMU in 1980 decided in 1971-72 has had t04.
be abandoned.    Some objectives have been set in the field of industrial policy for reducing the obstacles to transactions between businessmen in member states, but progress has been slow in the abolition of technical barriers totrade and even slower in the harmonisation of company law.    After years ofdebate a Regional ftnd has been set up but the total involved is small in relationto current expenditure by Member States particularly the United Kingdom, andthere are some formidable obstacles in the way of it growing further.     some progress has been made in the field of social policy - a Social Fund has been set up and the United Kingdom has been successful in getting a satisfactoryshare.    But little progress has been made in environmental and transport policy .ii.   Our own economic position and prospects10.   TheBe are gloomy.    We are still running a very substantial trade deficitwith our Community partners.    Our balance of payments deficit in 1976 is currently expected to exceed  1.5 billion.    Unemployment is expected to riseto 1. 5 million by the end of the year.    The trade figures demonstrate that insubstantial areas of manufacturing we are not fully competitive.    Before theend of the decade the efforts now being put into industrial regeneration as wellas an increasing flow of North Sea oil should ease our position.    But for thenext couple of years our industrial situation will be one of convalescence.    Andwe cannot exclude the possibility that we might be forced to seek the concurrence of the Commission and our Community partners to further measures of importrestraint.11.   All this will impose on us certain constraints.    Externally  while it willcontinue to be in our long term interests to promote the pursuit by theCommunity of liberal trade policies we need to avoid any measures - eg in theGSP field - which would increase competition on the United Kingdom marketover the next couple of years.    Internally - within the Community - we need toensure that in the short term the barriers to economic activity which areremoved are ones which would benefit us and not expose us to dangerous extracompetition.    And generally we must bear in mind that we shall need the supportof our Community partners particularly in major financial business (eg borrowing)and that this merits caution in policies we may adopt in non-financial fields.5.
c.    Short term aims12.   Against the background described above what are our immediate aims?In summary they are aa follows -i. ExternalIn the external commercial relations  of the Community our basic aims a*eto maximise the opportunities for British exporters while avoiding over thenext couple of years as far as possible increased competition of anydangerous kind on the United Kingdom market.     Thus we want to complete jthe Mediterranean agreements by gaining access to the Spanish market assoon as practicable.    We should continue to take a prominent part in the multilateral trade negotiations now in train&apos;(the results of which in term8   Iof tariff reductions will not be implemented for some years) and we m&quot;8&apos;continue to do what we can to avoid a trade war with the Americans.    ^eneed to continue to steer the Community to a liberal policy towards the developing countries partly by improvements in the GSP (while ensuring that these are limited to commodities such as tobacco and certain procefood products which we do not produce ourselves) and partly by attempt *0increase aid to the non-associates.    And we need to continue and develop the political co-operation which has made a successful start.ii. CAP9**lFollowing a discussion in Cabinet on 11 March EQ is now pursuing a study of the machinery for deciding Community farm prices and also intends tomake a thorough assessment of the strategy which we should pursue in preparation for the CAP price fixing for 1977/78.6.
iii.   CFPThe likelihood of the general extension of fisheries limits to 200 miles means that the Common Fisheries Policy (which with some temporary nationalderogations gives equal access to the fleets of all Member States)needs tobe revised.    The Commission has made proposals based on a system ofquotas and a 12-mile belt reserved exclusively for the coastal state with the phasing out of other countries historic rights within the belt.    Our aim isto get agreement as soon as possible on a CFP based on something like theprinciples in the Commission^ proposals if possible with a wider coastalbelt:   this will not be easy to achieve because several other community countries have opposing interests, are quite happy to maximise the presenttreaty provisions and realise that those will weaken our negotiating position.iv-   Internal economic policies in the field of-regional policy a Regional Development Fund has been set upfor the years 1975-1977.    It will therefore not be until 1977 (when in anycase there will be a new Commission) that the continuation of the RDF will fall to be considered although ideas will be needed soon on the form itshould take.    We have long maintained that a developing regional policy -which would go some way to equalise differences between the richer andpoorer regions - should be an essential part of the evolution of the Community.The chances of increasing the RDF in 1978 onwards are considered later inparagraph 20 a.    In the meantime our short term aims are to ensure thatwe get our full share of the RDF for the current three years, that we avoidat the same time as far as possible Community interference in our regionalexpenditure and that we seek in the negotiations for Greek accession toprotect as far as possible our share of the RDF.    In the case of industrial policy we should expect the continuance of efforts to reduce barriers to business activity between Member States.     The general effect will be toharmonise company law  and we would hope that this would improve businessopportunities (eg by bringing the publication of company information up tothe United Kingdom level).    The elimination of non tariff barriers(eg technical barriers and public procurement) could also be beneficial andwe would support it when we are satisfied with the balance of advantage for7.CONFIDENTIAL
the United Kingdom.    In this general area there seems a case for moreexchanges among Member &quot;States (by means of an official committee) onthe industrial strategies pursued by different Governments.    We have taken the initiative on financial control ; we have discussed with the Germans inthe first instance how progress might best be achieved; and progress wasmade at the European Council on 1-2 December 1975.    Progress towards an energy policy  is likely to be slow but the Commission has now started to bring forward more promising ideas, and is also following up our suggestion that Community policies should be related to an analysis of thegaps revealed by consideration of the sum of Member States&apos; nationalprogrammes.    We have achieved acceptance in principle of a minimumsafeguard price for oil of $7 per barrel, and the mechanisms for implement111it in the Community are now under discussion.v.    Socinl and environmentalThe Community social action programme has made some progress duringits first two years and we have been successful in getting a satisfactory shar ^(24 per cent) in 1974 and slightly more in 1975 of the social fund .    this represents in financial terms a greater advantage than the Regional Fund.In so far as environmental and transport  policies are concerned thedevelopment of Community policies seem in the short term at least to otfermore difficulties (eg uniform emission standards for controlling pollution)than advantages.vi.    InstitutionsWe want to maintain the power of the Council of Ministers and to improve itsworking efficiency and that of the European Council.     The reduced role ofthe Commission suits us well.    In so far as the Assembly is concerned *eprepared to join with our Community partners in planning to fulfil theTreaty commitment to direct elections.    In the meantime we are opposed t(Jconsideration of any further increase in the powers of the Assembly in the context of the move to direct elections.8.
vii.   EMUWe are committed (in the communique of the December 1974 Paris Summit)to EMU as a goal.    But the goal is a distant one.    EMU implies aconvergence of economic performance, policies and national priorities(eg the inflation unemployment trade off) which does not exist among member states, a transfer of resources from richer to poorer Member States, anda transfer of national sovereignty to Brussels for which British - and,despite the rhetoric Continental - public opinion is  not yet ready.    It is alsounlikely to accept any rigidly defined two tier approach even though some twopace development roughly on the lines, suggested by Tindemans  may becomede facto a reality.    On the other hand, there may well be discussion of possible transfers of resources over the next few years which could easeprogress towards EMU.d.    Tactical handling of our short term aims13.   In the tactical handling of these alms some improved oversight of ourhandling of Community affairs has seemed desirable.    While the issues of any importance on which we take a stand are carefully presented to Ministers (throughEQ) the periodicity of discussions in Brussels is largely out of our control.    Forexample in October 1975 there were four occasions in one week when at variousMinisterial Councils we needed to take a strong (and fairly isolated) line in defence of our interests.    This is of course no argument for not taking a robustline in each case.    But since more was read into this juxtaposition of eventson the Continent (in terms of a sustained and orchestrated British anti-EECcampaign) than was justified by our intentions it is extremely useful that a regular high level review (under a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministerand in conjunction with Cabinet Office and UKREP) has been established once aweek of business in Brussels over the following week, the kind of publicity which our line in general might get (given the kind of meetings coming up) theneed (if any) for any further examination of our tactical line and the need forany special Press briefing.
e.    Review of our short term aims14.   So much for our short term aims.    But we undertook at the beginning oipaper to review them in the light of developments over the next eighteen months or so - in particular the United Kingdom Presidency in the first half of 1977 -and thus to see how in this medium to longer term perspective we could bestpromote the United Kingdom interest in the various sectors of Community activwhether by new initiatives or carefully planned development of existing policies and how we could relate these efforts to a coherent medium term strategy.15.   What in this review are the main considerations which we should take intoaccount?    These seem to be the following -a. Generally we need to bear constantly in mind our enfeebled economicstate (paragraph 10 above) and the need both to avoid where possible overthe next couple of years any increased competition which could be dangerouson the United Kingdom market and to preserve as much goodwill as we canamong our Community partners against the possibility that we might in further economic difficulties need their help.b. In the external relations of the Community we have a major interest.We have a very substantial stake in worldwide political relationships - andin external trade.    So when the Nine can reach a common position - either as the world&apos;8 biggest trading bloc in the MTNs - or to deal with protection^1measures in the United States - or in the Seventh Special Session of theUnited Nations - or as the Europe of the Nine on a question of politicalco-operation - the weight behind any common position acceptable to us(and these we have played a leading role in finding) is greater than what wewould have on our own.    And because of our worldwide role the better wecan play the game of getting the Community behind positions which we want to take up so we can benefit better than any of our Community partners.c. Internally we have a major interest in completing the process o removing barriers to trade within Europe which - followed perhaps one day  &apos;
llJiLlM 11alby worldwide free trade - has been the aim of successive British governments for the last 20 years.    Our trade balance has not done well as tariffs have come down.    But we are putting a major effort into restructuring our industryand as these efforts pay off so our trade balance should improve.    But inany case if we have supported the idea of a European Customs Union we arelogically bound to look at those technical barriers to trade which tend to undermine the effect of abolishing tariff barriers.    Some are in the field of company law - where if we have free trade it makes sense for businessmento invest within the Customs Union with the minimum restrictions.    Of coursewe shall need to watch carefully (in the light of a. above) the timing andthe nature of the barriers to be removed over the next year or so in orderto ensure that in our convalescent state we do not lose more than we gain.d. Economically given the higher growth rates which most other member States are likely to resume after the current recession, the dangerof industrial development concentrating in the centre of the Community andthe persistent surplus which some Member States are running even in thepresent recession our interest lies in redistribution to whatever extent is practicable between the richer and poorer members - and regions - of theCommunity provided however that the interests of Greece and the otherpoorer potential Members are not met in ways unduly damaging to us.e. Financially we have a major interest, as the Prime Minister hasmade plain, in seeking the application to Community expenditure of thesame system of rigorous  checks to avoid waste and rigorous scrutiny of future expenditure as we have in the United Kingdom.f. And common sense dictates that in following these various aims weshould avoid Euromania.    We do not for example want harmonisation for the sake of harmonisation (of Eurobeer and Eurobread) but only where this isnecessary to increase trading opportunities.    We do not want to givethe Commission increased powers for their own glorification but only when
it is necessary for a job in the interests of the Member States to be done.In the development of the Community therefore we should at all time askourselves whether the means are justified by the end.16.   So much for our main general interests (their application to particularsectors is dealt with in paragraphs 20-31 below).    In these cases we shallbe seeking continually to put across a United Kingdom view.    But there isone area where we shall be on the defensive.    This is the area of closerEuropean integration.17.   At the European Summit of December 1974 the Nine agreed that they were&quot;determined to make further progress&quot; in the direction of &quot;transforming thewhole complex of relations between the Member States in accordance with thedecision taken in Paris in October 1972&quot; and further that &quot;they consider thatthe time has come for the Nine to agree as soon as possible on an overall concep1of European Union&quot;.    Of course these are declarations of a very general kind.They leave the taming very much open.    And when our Continental partners tal^of integration there is a good deal of inbuilt rhetoric.18.   But behind the rhetoric there are certain pressures for closer integrationa. For our Community partners folk memories are different.    Ourswere formed not only by the unemployment throughout the 1930s (whichseveral of our European partners were for different reasons spared in fullmeasure) but by our isolated and successful stance in the war.    For ourContinental partners frontiers collapsed in 1940 - or in 1945 - like thewalls of Jericho.    So they attach less importance to tham and more to a growing unity than we do.b. Against this political background a Customs Union with a common agricultural Policy has a certain inbuilt dynamic towards closer integrati0&quot;&apos;Businessmen will slowly  perceive that the abolition of tariffs is only halfthe story when it comes to freeing trade.    They will press over the years for removal of technical barriers and the harmonisati on not only of publicpurchasing policies but also eventually of taxation.    They will in short v/a^1
to harmonise the conditions of competition.    And they will be joined by farmers who will argue that as long as parities are allowed to fluctuatewithin the Community the resultant MCAs will make a mockery of freecirculation of agricultural goods.    Of course when they realise the fullconsequences - in terms of sovereignty and fixed parities - they willflinch.    But the flinching is for today and not always for tomorrow.c.    The decisions of the European Court of Justice will have a growinginfluence.    These decisions will have a strong communautaire andsupra national flavour and will move the Community quietly but steadilyin the direction of further integration.    But it will, for good or ill,remain nn influence which it would be unwise to discount.19.   It follows that whether we like it or not there will be a build up of pressure in the Community towards some form of closer union.    The Tindemans Report,while cautious and pragmatic, reflects a desire for movement in the directionof European Union.    As the Federal German Chancellor reaffirmed in hismessage of 15 November to the Prime Minister &quot;The long term objective of theFederal Government^ European policy remains the establishment of a EuropeanFederation embracing a European Economic and Monetary Union&quot;.    Indeed itwould be dangerous to ignore this.    Herr Willy Brandt said on French televisionon 23 June 1975 &quot;If (our) hopes in Europe are disappointed one will have toreckon in future with Germans who, more clearly than we could or would wish to,have the will to unite themselves under one and the same roof in one State&quot;.Precisely what pressures at what points in time we shall be exposed to we donot know.    It now appears that as Sir Michael Palliser conjectured in one of hisfinal despatches from Brussels it could take the form of the debate about EMUresuming in earnest in the light of the Tindemans Report.    But what is clear isthat a great deal will be said on those lines by our partners.    And unless wecarefully work out a position and tactics which can deal with pressures of thiskind we shall constantly be - and be seen to be - on the defensive.
f.    Areas of policy which need further study20.  In the light of these factors - mostly United Kingdom interests which weshall want to push but one field where we shall be under pressure - what areasof policy should we select for further work - not necessarily to devise dazsUnginitiatives but to make sure that our interests are satisfactorily advanced?    Thetwo areas where Community policy has been furthest developed are external relations and the CAP.    In the case of external relations we are already heavttYinvolved; indeed the major differences which United Kingdom entry ha8 made ovCthe last 3 years is a more outward looking attitude on the part of the Community&apos;we shall need naturally to continue to play the major role we have assumed.    ^question arises however on the area where the common commercial policy is n0tComplete.    There could be advantage for us in working towards a common policy on trade with the Eastern bloc (where the combined bargaining power of. the Community could be to the advantage of its individual members).    A com&quot;10policy towards Japan on the other hand has proved more difficult to work out.But this area as a whole seems one which merits further study.    In relation to**** CAP para 12(11) explained that two studies were in hand, one related to themachinery for deciding Community farm prices and one related to the strategywhich we should pursue in preparation for the CAP price fixing for 1977/78.And work is also in hand (para 12(111) above) on the Common FisheriesPolicy (CFP.
21.   The area on the other hand in which least progress has been made inCommunity development, is on the internal economic side.   And here 4 furtherareas seem to merit further study -a.   Regional policy since the RDF has now been established for 3 years what follows will come upfor decisive digcussion in 1977 - at the time of our Presidency.    on current policies must affect the future prospects of the Fund and somebasic thinking will have to be done in the near future about the basis ofthe RDF.    While we have a strong interest in containing Communityexpenditure, we also have a major interest in a Regional Fund which would go some way to equalising the differences between the poorer and peripheralregions of the Community and the more prosperous centre - always providedthat it could make certain of our own share of receipts.    How great thepossibilities will be in practice of securing any major redistribution of community resources on these lines is open to some doubt.    The accession of greece - possibly followed by other poor Mediterranean countries - would belikely to reduce our bet advantage.    And the Germans have shown a markedunwillingness to disburse money for regional expenditure - which they tend to regard as charity for the poor and undeserving.    We could of course make a determined attempt to get criteria accepted which would yield us asatisfactory percentage share.    But this will not be easy.    So the prOBpectsfor any major gains to the United Kingdom from an expanded RDF after 1977do not seem great.    And we should also have to weigh the amount of interference in our own regional expenditure which a bigger RDF would imply.All this points to some basic thinking in time for us to join in a debate whichwill soon begin during the period of our Presidency and the new Commission -
in the first half of 1977, and policy in the meanwhile designed to keep our optionsopen.    (Some of the same considerations may also apply to the Social fund which may have an equally important redistributive effect).b.    Industrial policy as pointed out in paragraph 12 iv. progress on this front has been slow.    Buttwo areas deserve further study.    The first relates to the need to work towards an agreed industrial strategy, particularly in relation to specific sectors, withinthe Community.    A good deal needs to be done on comparing the industrialstrategy which we are now developing with the industrial strategy of other member States and establishing that as far as possible our efforts - in an increasingly integrated single European market - mesh in together.    In thesecond place we need to consider whether in our current attempts to removeobstacles to business activity between Member States we have got the mix of measures right.    Are we correct in placing the practical emphasis onharmonisation of company law and the abolition of non-tariff barriers.    or would it make more sense to give a&apos;higher rating to harmonising such factors as the base of company law taxation and exchange control.    An opportunity forprogress along these lines will be offered by discussions in the Committee of senior officials from Member States which is now envisaged in the industrial policy field.    But we need to have ideas of our own to put forward and the areassketched out above could form the basis for a useful United Kingdom initiative&apos;C.    Financial ControlFollowing the European Council in Rome on 1 and 2 December 1975 a good dealof further work will be necessary to follow up the Prime Minister&apos;8 initiativeon closer financial control in the Community,4*    EnergyWe have already taken one initiative in tbe energy field in the proposal for-^Community policy to be developed on the basis of an analysis of nationalprogrammes.    In the context of the CIEC  some progress is being made inthe establishment of a Community energy policy.
22.   This - apart from social and environmental policies which seem at present to offer little scope - leaves institutions, arms production and EMU.    Oninstitutions Ministers have endorsed a provisional approach to the issue of direct elections on which we hope that the European Council will agree totake decisions during 1976.    For the rest, we should be opposed at present toany further increase in the powers of the Assembly (additional to the extrabudgetary powers recently acquired) and have no plans ourselves for institutionaldevelopment although we shall naturally need to be ready to react to the ideasin the Tindemans Report.Arms Production23.   Arms production is an area of activity closely connected with industrial policy.    An effective European response to American proposals for a &quot;two-waystreet&quot; in arms procurement will require better co-ordination and probablysome reorganisation of the European industries concerned.    Any action taken inregard to the aircraft industry, for example, would have important consequences for military aircraft and other hardware.24.   We and our colleagues in the Eurogroup are trying to organise theEuropean end of the &quot;two-way street&quot; and have invited the French Government(who do not belong to the Eurogroup) to co-operate under ad hoc arrangements.There are likely to be some pressures for this work to be carried out by. the nine or for the Nine to have some roleiu.it.     The somewhat vague proposals in the Tindemans Report appear unlikely to make much progress.25.  As far as wecan see at present, it seems unlikely that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will wish to take any initiatives with the Nine or in the community in this field.    But we shall need to be ready to respond to new situations orinitiatives by others as required.    It will be desirable, from the point of,viewof the reactions of other members of the Community, to take the line that weshall be prepared to examine all proposals including those of Tindemans1 forco-operation on their merits.    This whole area of activity will be kept underreview.17.CONFIDENTIAL
EMU and related matters26.   EMU deserves separate consideration not least because of the proposals put forward by Sir Michael Palliser in one of his last despatches from Brussels-This despatch recommends that we should work out our own distinct andcoherent philosophy on EMU based on the redistributive  functions of theCommunity Budget.    &quot;To what extent EMU is a realistic goal has yet to be demonstrated.    By continuing to stall we can no doubt postpone its achievement.But to say no more than that we do not like.it, or do not believe in it, is ineffect to opt out out of the decision.    The better approach, I submit, will be to start impressing on our partners and the Commission what pre-conditions would need to be satisfied if we were to join in a resumed move towards EMU-To do this with any hope of carrying conviction, we shall need a properly worked out position.......   It should certainly be in the United Kingdom&apos;s interest tosee far greater transfers within Europe to the less prosperous areas - mainly -Ireland, Southern Italy and ourselves - and such chances as we might have of achieving agreement on some such policies (in relation in particular to the regional Fund and the Social Fund) would depend on their presentation as anessential part, if not a pre-condition, of an economic and monetary unionof which we, for once, were partisans. &quot;27.    There is a good deal of force in the contention that with discussion of EM^quite likely to resume with the additional impetus given by the Tindemans repo&apos;1it would be better if we had a tactical position which was not simply a defensiveone.    But there are three major difficulties in following through this suggestion&apos;The first is that the Germans would be unlikely to be willing to disbursesubstantial sums for regional and social purposes - since, as pointed out aboveithey tend to hold that these are simply a form of charity which the federal republic can ill afford.    Secondly any move on our part to join the snake wouldnot be a practicable proposition until our inflation rate had dropped to the levelof our main Community partners; even then any such move would raise substa11^political difficulties here.    Thirdly, any major and permanent move which we might offer in the direction of EMU - thus hoping to gild the pill for the Gerrna&quot;8with promises of integration - would imply a major cession of sovereignty(since this is what EMU is all about) for which public opinion in this country - ot1 ;1 r
indeed elsewhere in the Community - hardly seems ready.28.   The importance of the point in the preceding paragraph about our takingif possible a tactical initiative and not simply reacting to pressures fromothers is such that it is worth considering whether some variant of the approach suggested might be more attractive.    A passible line of advance is indicated by two considerations.    The first is that - as the Tindemans reportrecognises - one of the major problems for the Community is the growingdivergence in economic performance between its major members.    (Someillustrations of this growing divergence are set out in Annex A.)    The second is that there has been come recognition in the Community recently that inthe interests of economic convergence and cohesion transfers of resourcesbetween richer and poorer members could be envisaged.    In his message of13 November 1975 to the Prime Minister Herr^ Schmirt went as far as envisaging&quot;further assistance for Member States with balance of payments problems in theform of medium term Community credit granted on the condition that certaineconomic policy measures be taken&quot;.    And the Tindemans Report proposes that Member States lagging in progress towards EMU should &quot;receive from theother states any aid and assistance that can be given them to enable themto catch the others up&quot;.29.  Against this background we could point to the growing divergence in&apos;economic performance between Member States as a major problem for theCommunity.    We recognised that the first priority for the Member States trying to catch up was to put their own economic house in order.    And we were makingstrenuous - and not unsuccessful attempts to this end.    Our incomes policy had so far proved a success; the rate of inflation was falling rapidly; and balance ofpayments was Improving; and in order to deal with our industrial structuralproblems we had devised a new industrial strategy.    But in the interim period before North Sea oil came fully on stream our efforts at industrial restructuringwould be under some strain.    This posed a threat not only to the developmentbut to the cohesion of the Community.    So this was not just a United Kingdomproblem; it was a Community problem.19. ,CONFIDENTIAL
30.   And this therefore called for a Community solution.    One possibility would be to translate the references made both by Herr Schmidt and by theTindemans Report to resources transfers between richer and poorer member states into a Community scheme designed to improve industrial investment and performance in Member States with a below average GDP per head and rateof growth.    A broad outline of such a scheme is set out in Annex B togetherwith some of the risks which an initiative on these lines would entail.    It is open to argument whether such a scheme should have a higher priority than other action directed to solving our present industrial problems, or indeedwhether it might not to some extent distract attention here from the effortsrequired of us to cope with them.    And it is of course far from certain thatthe richer members of the Community would find a scheme on these linesacceptable without at any rate a chance for an undue degree of intervention in the economic policies of the beneficiaries. &apos; But of course if an initiativeon these lines were refused we should have the tactical advantage of being ableto say that we had made constructive proposals on a Community basis fortacMistg,difficulties fundamental to the development of the Community.    And ifthesa: were not accepted it would not in our view be realistic to envisage anyfurther advance towards EMU; there would be little point in arguing about thenature of the roof when the foundations had not been laid,31.   Should we take an initiative on these lines?    Quite apart from the risks *etout in Annex B it seems likely (an impression reinforced by the visit to theUnited Kingdom on 6/7 February of the Federal German Chancellor) that theGerman Government would not find it politically practicable before theirelections on October 3 of this year -to agree to any substantial new Community -eaqaenditure.    So we could take the,following line.    Over the next six months of so-while avoiding any specific proposals and while stressing the need for,M*wiber States to put their own house in order we might try discreetly torJfl^fffh-Community discussion on economic matters (eg unemployment)t^jM^i.the thejne of resource transfers between Member States in theinterests of lagging industrial performance, reducing unemployment andptcnrMting economic convergence.    We could then assess after the Germanelacttona and againM the,backgi!Ou*d of whatever pressures there might then  f:
CONF&quot;be for moves to EMU the prospects for a specific initiative on the linessketched out above.Conclusionsa. Our short term aims are on the right lines.    Externally this meanscontinuing to support liberal trade and aid policies (while remainingvigilant about unfair or low cost competition) and continuing to developpolitical co-operation.    Internally we would press on with eliminatingnon-tariff barriers within the Community and concerting industrialpolicies.    We would try to develop the RDF, improve the CAP and laythe foundations of a common energy policy.b. In improving our jactical handling   the weekly review under thechairmanship of the Minister of State (FCO^ of our tactical line and press briefing in the light of business in Brussels is of some importance.c. Looking to the medium and longer term - and particularly ourPresidency in the first half of 1977 the main sectors of Communitypolicy where it would be useful to set work In train - additional towhat is in hand already are -i.    external commercial policyii.    CAPiii.    Common Fisheries Policyiv.    regional policyv.    industrial policyvi.  financial controlvii.    energy policyviii,    EMUd. In addition it seems worth bearing in mind the possibility of linkingthe further development of the Community with a redistributive Communityeffort to help industrial development in those Member States with below
average GDP and growth.    We should try discreetly to steer Communitydiscussion of economic matters towards this theme and assess after theGerman elections in the autumn the possibility of a specific initiative onthese lines.

ANNEX possible FORM OF RESOURCE TRANSFERS to aid INDUSTRIAL development the Community could aet up a new fund (called perhaps the European IndustrialDevelopment Fund) to which the countries in the Community with above averagerates of growth would contribute and which in turn would be made available interms of special cheap loans to the deficit members, not to finance consumption,but to cushion the balance-of-payments effects of an attempt to deal with industrialstructural problems by large scale new investment.    The Member States whichqualified for receipts under the fund under a few simple guidelines (eg growth ratesbelow the average) would draw up outline programmes which could then be approved within the appropriate Community institution.    The programmes would set out in some detail the measures of industrial assistance envisaged - eg ascheme for a particular industry involving restructuring, modernisation and assistance from public funds.    Community money would then be provided, inthe form of cheap loans, from the fund direct to the individual firms concernedin the programme, after consultation with the government concerned.    In all this we should need to be clear, at least in our own minds that concentration in the plan on industrial restructuring should not maBk the need for more effective measures to remedy our underlying weaknesses, notably Bteps to dealwith excessive manning and difficulties in labour relations.2.    Three risks could be involved by an initiative of this kind.    The first wouldrelate to the method of financing.-    If the fund suggested were to be financedthrough the Community budget we would be contributing ourselves on a scalelikely to be approaching 20 per cent by the time such a proposal could be got offthe ground.    And for a significant net benefit to arise for the United Kingdom wewould need to be confident both that we should receive a substantial share of thedisbursements - not much less than one third - and that there would be a largegross flow of funds.    But financing through the Community budget would runagainst the sense of our proposal..  This would have in mind that while the fund would be on a Community basis contributions would come from those member states with above average rates of growth (and possibly balance of paymentssurpluses).    So to the extent that our proposal were accepted this risk would hardly arise.
3.     The second risk would relate to the relationship between our proposal andother claims which we would expect to have on the Germans for financial supportover the next 18 months or so.     These include renewal of the An^lo/GermanOffset Agreement (on a basis we hope markedly more favourable to us) possiblerecourse to the IMF and perhaps the OECD support fi   d, increase in theGovernment subscribed capital of the European Investment Bank and increases inthe Regional Development Fund.    We would need to avoid prejudicing by aproposal which seemed like an extra claim on German resources the operationsset out above.    On the other hand if we were to present our proposal in theEMU context designed to promote the  convergence and cohesion of the Communitynot merely to help us and some other less prosperous Member States with ourown problems we should be able largely to avoid this risk.4.    The third would be the risk that assistance from the richer countries would only be at the cost of an unacceptable degree of intervention in the economic policies of the beneficiary countries.    This would be a matter for negotiation;agreement might well be difficult.    But while the donor countries would doubtles3want some say in return for loans we would have some effective allies in other member States in the formulation of any plan concerning the Community as a who!6&apos;5.    There is one further practical point.    Experience of the EIB&apos;s lendingto the United Kingdom, in particular that intended to be channelled to small firmsthrough the FFI, has shown that there is a considerable degree of reluctance to accept forein currency borrowing for physical investment in the United Kingdom(large firms may be able to marry such liabilities against foreign currency claim8of one kind or another).    Insofar as the proposed IDF operated through lendingto firms - as opposed to grants - there would be pressure, in order to make anysuch claim effective, for the exchange risk to be assumed in one way or anotherby Her Majesty&apos;s Government-  to do so would involve a change in present polici**requiring most careful consideration.
6.    Apart from these risks would other Member States be likely to accept aproposal on these lines?    This is far from certain.   The budgetary difficultiesof the Germans are well known and this for them is an election year.    The french would doubtless be difficult.    And many would argue that they saw no point inspending their money to make the United Kingdom more competitive.    But thereare some arguments in its favour.    The Germans have long argued that they are opposed to providing money simply to subsidise others in the Community; onthe other hand, they would be more inclined to pay for measures which pavedthe way for genuine integration.   And the very fact of our having decided toremain in the Community gives us a certain bargaining power.    The germans will not want to be saddled for the next decade with a major and growingproblem on their hands in the shape of a United Kingdom whose economicperformance was slipping continuously behind the rest of the Community and whichwas therefore steadily unwilling to contemplate any further moves towards closerintegration.   And if they could see that they were providing money not simply tomake life easier for some of our poorer regions or for the United Kingdom as awhole but as part of a carefully planned industrial strategy to level out thedivergence between our economic performance and those of our major Communitypartners, they might be more willing to join in.   In fact in his message of15 November 1975 to the Prime Minister Herr Schmidt went as far as envisaging&quot;further assistance for Member States with balance of payments problems in theform of medium term Community credit granted on the condition that certaineconomic policy measures be taken&quot; and the Tindemans Report proposes that member States which are unable to progress towards EMU should &quot;receive fromthe other states any aid and assistance that can be given them to enable them tocatch the others up&quot;.7.    If such a scheme were considered it would need to be made clear - in thiscountry as well as to our partners - that external finance from our industrialregeneration was no substitute for putting our own house in order.    The germans would need to be persuaded that this was in hand and that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere determined, and had adequate national support, to see the task through.
This responsibility must lie with Her Majesty&apos;s Government; but common advantcould accrue to the Community as a whole if national efforts could be supplemented!on the lines envisaged, and if the richer members could be satisfied that their money would be well spent, thus permitting economic convergence within theCommunity and further progress on the lines envisaged by Tindemans.^       \Jtv.^:i--.-y.-r.   .:27.JNFtDENTIALt
