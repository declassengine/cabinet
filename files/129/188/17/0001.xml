First Report from the Select Committee on theParliamentary Commissioner for AdministrationSession 1974-75Observations by the GovernmentINTRODUCTORY1. In their First Report for tbe 1974-75 Session, the Select Committee makea number of comments and recommendations, to which this White Papercontains the Governmenfs response.ACCESS BY PRISONERS TO TYPEWRITERS2. In paragraphs 7 and 8 of their Report, the Select Committee express theirdisappointment that a review by the Home Office of increasing access of prisoners to typewriters bad not then been completed. The Home Office review is nowcomplete and fresh instructions have been issued to governors of prisons.3. The new instructions delegate authority to governors to allow a prisonerto use an official typewriter, already available at an establishment, in connectionwith academic studies, for typing literary work, and legal documents where a prisoner is conducting his own appeal or defence. Governors have been givendiscretion to decide, within the limits set by the need to provide supervision andto ensure security of their establishment, where an official machine will be madeavailable. Provision has also been made for governors to seek permission fromRegional Directors for authority in exceptional cases to allow a prisoner to buyor have sent in a personal machine.4. The Committee asked that special consideration should be given to thepossibility of greater use of typewriters in open prisons. Although the newinstructions apply to all prisons, because of the less restrictive regime people in open prisons are likely to benefit most from the relaxation of the rules.LIVING-AWAY-FROM-HOME ALLOWANCES5. In paragraph 9 of their Report the Select Committee say they hope the promised progress report on the inter-departmental consultations about thevariations in living-away-from-home allowances will not be long delayed.The review has now been completed, and a copy of the report was sent by theDepartment of Employment and the Home Office to the Committee. The reportconcludes that such differences as do exist between the various schemes arejustifiable, and that there is no scope for further standardisation at present.All Departments concerned, however, have now begun a review of the literaturerelated to the schemes for which they are responsible to ensure that eligibilityconditions are adequately described.HANDLING OF PRISONERS APPLICATION CONCERNINGCITIZENSHIP6. In paragraph 16 of their Report the Committee record that there is a difference in judgement between the Principal Officer of the Home Office and
the Parliamentary Commissioner as to whether there was maladministration inthe Department&apos;s dealings with a prisoner. The Committee consider that therewas insufficient liaison between the Divisions of the Home Office concerned and hope that the Department will emphasise to their officials the importance of seeking to ensure, where necessary, that there is no misapprehension in the minds of persons who seek to renounce citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies.7. It is the established practice in the Home Office Nationality Division, whenit is obvious that a person is tinder a misapprehension, to explain the results which would flow from the registration of his declaration of renunciation of citizenship and to obtain confirmation that he wishes it to be registered, before proceeding. The instructions to staff have been strengthened and now require that if there is any suggestion that a person making a declaration of renunciationmay be under a misapprehension, or if he is, or has recently been, in communi-cation with another Division of the Office, the declaration is to be. registeredonly with the approval of a senior official.S. The attention of the appropriate staff in the Home Office has been drawn to the need to ensure that any necessary consultation with other Divisions takes place should a petitioner refer to an intention to renounce his citizenship of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies, or take some similar action.COMPENSATION FOR DELAY IN PAYMENTS OR REPAYMENTS9. The Committee refer in paragraph 21 to some cases where they considerspecial arrangements for compensation should apply. Statutory arrangementsfor compensation would not be appropriate in many cases, because, for example,payments are discretionary and it is not possible to define a date when they faddue. Circumstances will vary so much from case to case that general rulesdescribing *undue delay&apos; would not be possible. From time to time departmentalerrors or omissions occur which call for compensation, but these are exceptional.The departments concerned will therefore consider individual cases on their merits, bearing in mind the Committee&apos;s views.DELAY IN HEARING OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS10. In paragraph 48 of their Report the Committee urge the Home Office to devise a system whereby enquiries made by Members would not delay action on immigration appeals, and suggest that judicious copying of papers might afford a solution. It is a common occurence for members to take up a case after anappeal has been lodged, and it would be a costly and laborious task to copy thefile papers in all such cases. But a procedure has now been introduced to enablethe Appeals Section to recall files for copying, after they have been withdrawnfor action to be taken on representations made by Members, if it is apparantthat the preparation of the explanatory statement may otherwise be undulydelayed. Moreover, the backlog of work in the Appeals Section has now been largely eliminated, and in some cases it should be possible to complete anddespatch the explanatory statement before the file is released to enable the member&apos;s letter to be answered.SERVICEMEN WHO HAVE PURCHASED THEIR DISCHARGE11. The Employment Services Agency now responsible, under the Manpower
Services Commission, for the administration of the Employment TransferScheme.12. The concern of the Select Committee, expressed in paragraph 55 of theReport, that a serviceman who has purchased his discharge after being refusedre-engagement is equated with a civilian who changes his job voluntarily, isbeing borne in mind in the review which is being carried out by the Employ-ment Services Agency and the Ministry of Defence of the applicability of theEmployment Transfer Scheme to those leaving HM Forces. The review has reached an advance stage.COMMISSIONER FOR LOCAL ADMINISTRATION IN SCOTLAND13. In paragraph 60 of their Report, the Select Committee express dis*appointment that Part II of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975 providesonly for the appointment of a single Commissioner for Local administration in Scotland, and not for a Commission of which the Parliamentary commissioner would be an ex officio member.14. The main consideration which the Government had in mind in proposing a single Commissioner (a question which, as the Select Committee note, was discussed during the Committee Stage of the Bill) was that of the likely workload.Before the introduction of the Bill, extensive consultations had been carried outwith local authority associations and other interested bodies in Scotland, none of whom considered that the work was likely to be beyond the capacity of asingle Commissioner with adequate supporting staff. The Government appreciate the point made by the Select Committee that the creation of a Commission, ofwhich the Parliamentary Commissioner would be a member, could be regardedas analogous to the arrangement made for Wales in the Local Government Act1974; but, bearing in mind that Part II of the 1975 Act makes explicit provisionfor consultation and the exchange of information between the Scottish Commi-ssioner and the Parliamentary and Health Service Commissioner, they did notthink that this would in itself be sufficient justification for providing for thecreation of a Commission rather than a single office of Commissioner.15. During debate on the Bill in Scottish Standing Committee, the Govern-ment gave an assurance that if at any time in the future the amount of workappeared too great for a single Commissioner to handle, they would be readyto consider the introduction of new legislation, which could also take intoaccount any desirable changes in other provisions of the Act which might bebrought to light by experience of the operation of complaints machinery.Prinwd intadandfor Her Mi)etty&apos;i SUtknury Office byMcConiiiodilB Printeri Ltd., London.Dd 131767  K14  3/76ISBN 0 10 164420 5
