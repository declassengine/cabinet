THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government(76) 39 COPY NO22 March 1976CABINETTHE QUEEN&apos;S SILVER JUBILEE 1977: JUBILEE MEDALSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The Ministerial Committee on The Queen. W Silver Jubilee, of whichI am Chairman, have been considering the question of Jubilee medals.The Secretary of State for Defence has asked that this matter should bebrought before Cabinet.2.        It has in the past been the practice for Royal occasions of this sortto be marked by the issue of a medal, for award to public servants; butthe majority of the Ministerial Committee believe that it would not be rightto follow this precedent next year.    The chief constraint is that of coat:at July 1975 prices, the estimated cost would be  6 per medal plus25 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT), and in the current economic climatewe would not regard the very substantial expenditure involved asjustified.   We have borne in mind The queen s express wish that thereshould be no undue expenditure on her Jubilee celebrations.    Moreover,the selection of recipients would be a difficult and invidious task.3.        We thought it right, however, to consider whether it would be feasible to have a medal for distribution to certain specified groups withinthe public service; we had in mind particularly the uniformed services,for whom medals have a special significance.    The Secretary of State for defence, in particular, felt strongly that a medal should be awarded to the armed forces, who have received a medal on every similar Royal occasionsince 1887.    They have a close link with the Crown, and will be involvedin the Jubilee celebrations in a variety of ways.    On the basis of precedent,medals would be awarded to 3 per cent of the forces (about 11* 000) and thecost, at July 1975 prices, would be  67, 500 plus 25 per cent VAT.4.        The Official Committee on the Silver Jubilee were therefore askedto consider the matter further.    The report of the Chairman is attached.Briefly, the Official Committee concluded that:1
a. If there were to be a medal at all then both the armed forces and the police must be eligible to receive it.    This would causeresentment among other uniformed Services who would feel thatthey had an equally strong claim because of the value of their services to the community, often at considerable risk to themselves,b. This could be divisive and to avoid resentment the medalwould have to be distributed widely.    The cost would be at least 250, 000 and public opinion would probably not support this orderof expenditure on public servants at the present time,c. It would be difficult to identify criteria for distributionwithin the selected Services which did not in themselves give scope for discontent.    The Official Committee accordingly recommendedthat no Jubilee Medal should be issued in 1977, and the majority ofthe Ministerial Committee endorsed that view.5.        The Secretary of State for Defence, however, felt that there remained a strong argument for continuing the tradition of granting aJubilee Medal to the armed services.    In his view this is especially thecase today when the Serviceman&apos;s opportunities for earning a medal are so limited.    Moreover:a. He foresees no difficulty in confining the Services1allocation of a medal to the numbers described in paragraph 3;nor does he believe that there would be any insurmountabledifficulty in determining eligibility, taking account of length ofservice and merit, with particular emphasis on non-commissionedpersonnel.b. He does not accept officials&apos; judgment that it would be impracticable to maintain the distinction made in paragraph 3 of theofficial paper between the claims of the armed services and the policeon the one hand and those of other public servants on the other.c. The Official Committee have in his view made too much of thesupposed difficulties of finding criteria for awarding medals.    Toadopt the attitude that one man&apos;s medal is another mants disappointmentis to argue against awards of any sort,conclusion.        1 invite my colleagues to endorse the view of the majority of the ministerial Committee that there should be no Jubilee Medal.R H j home Office22 March 19762
SILVER JUBILEEREPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE1.     At the meeting of the Ministerial Committee on 25 November,Ministers asked that further consideration should be given by officials to the question of Jubilee medals and to the possibility of a Jubileeaward for industry. -, \iiJubilee medals2.     On 25 November, Ministers decided that there should be no medalfor distribution to civilians, and that the balance of advantageappeared to be against issuing one for the uniformed services.   It was,however, agreed that before a final decision was taken on a servicesmedal officials should consider further its possible distribution;advise Ministers on the feasibility of identifying a defensibledividing line between services which should be eligible and those whichshould not; and, on the basis of likely criteria for distribution,provide an estimate of the number of medals likely to be required.   our conclusions are set out in detail in Annex A.3.     Briefly, we have no doubt that, if there were to be a medal at allboth the armed forces and the police must be eligible to receive it.The question therefore becomes whether it would be desirable and possible to stop with them.   There are a number of other services - wecite the fire and prison services, lifeboatiaen , coastguards, ambulanceand nursing staff and various voluntary organisations as examples -which would undoubtedly feel that they ought to be eligible and which -at least in their own eyes - would have some grounds for resentment ifexcluded.   While it would be possible to draw a theoretical dividingline between these and similar services on the one hand, and the armed forces and police on the other (on the grounds partly of the latter*sstatus as direct servants or officers of the Crown, and partly of the degree of public recognition), the distinction would not in practice bean easy one to sustain.   It would be particularly invidious to make
this distinction in Northern Ireland or indeed any selective allocation of medals.4.     The choice before Ministers is therefore, in our view, between amedal for distribution on a fairly wide scale, or none at all: it wouldnot be feasible to limit it to the one or two services for whot   it woulparticularly be intended.   Moreover, it would be difficult to : dentifycriteria for distribution within the selected services which would not .in themselves give scope for discontent.   As the figures in paragraph 7of Annex A indicate, the costs of the sort of distribution which would Jseem to be required would be substantial, and, if Ministers decide         against issuing a services medal, it will be on the grounds of cost tha&quot;&quot;the decision will need to be presented and defended.   But, while the    pgeneral view of the Official Committee is that the balance of advantagejlies against issuing a medal, the Ministry of Defence remain strongly   ^of the opinion that the tradition of marking royal occaions in this way**should be maintained; and there are signs of expectation developingamong some services that there will again be a Jubilee medal.Whatever decision Ministers reach on this question, there would be advantage in making it known as soon as possible. ^Awards for industry.     Ministers also asked officials to consider the possibility ofmarking the Jubilee by a special award for industry.   Our conclusions are set out in the note at Annex B.6.     The major difficulty would lie in avoiding duplication with the    vexisting Queen*s Award Scheme - a problem noted by Ministers on 25November.   Last year a committee under the chairmanship of the Duke of edinburgh, reviewing the present Queen*s Awards, rejected thepossibility of recognising qualities other than those honoured underthe existing scheme on the grounds of administrative difficulty and expense. These considerations would also apply to any Jubilee award fo&apos;industry which sought to go outside the scope of The Queen1s Award.)
7.     As an alternative, we also looked at the possibility of creating a &quot;Silver Jubilee&quot; grade within The Queen&apos;s Award Scheme; but, for thereasons set out in Annex B, we do not recommend such an innovation.While the idea of a Jubilee award for industry is an attractive one,therefore, we do not believe that there would be scope for any newaward scheme in 1977.ARTHUR PETERSONcQtaneofflAtjcmmmmMS)
ANNEX AJUBILEE MEDALS1. Following the discussion at SJ on 25 November, the official committee have been giving further consideration to the possibledistribution of a services Jubilee medal.Which Services?2.     If there were to be a Jubilee medal at all, we have no doubt thatthe armed forces should be eligible to receive it.   As Ministers notedon 25 November medals have particular significance for the forces and   jj in present circumstances the opportunities for servicemen to earn a       medal in the course of their duties are becoming increasingly remote.We are equally of the opinion that the police must be included in any   *paward scheme.   They will inevitably have a very considerable burden      &apos;^placed on them by the Jubilee celebrations; they have, in any case, a   ^very close connection with the Crown both constitutionally and in the   *.protective duties they provide to The Queen and members of the Royal     JJFamily; and a medal would have great significance for them, as it would--for the armed forces.   Furthermore, the public are very much aware of   )the role played by the police in recent times in combatting terrorism   Jand, in our view, public opinion would expect them to be included along with the armed forces in any medal distribution.3.     The question therefore becomes whether, if there were to be amedal, it would be possible to stop at the armed forces and the police,or whether there are other services which ought - even if their cla msare less immediately obvious - to be included. t    f- J* - *4.     There are a number of services which would undoubtedly feel tha&quot;:they ought to be eligible and would, at least in their own eyes andpossibly in others1 too, have some grounds for resentment if they wereomitted.   For example, the fire service, lifeboatmen and coastguards
all serve the community in circumstances which involve some risks totheir own safety.   The prison service have an exacting and oftenthankless task, for which they receive too little recognition. ^Ambulancemen, nursing staff and various voluntary organisations will beon duty at Jubilee events; and give valued service to the community at other times and in other circumstances.5.     While, in the view of the Committee, it would be possible to draw a theoretical dividing line between these and similar services on theone hand, and the armed forces and the police on the other (on the        ,^grounds partly of the latters&apos; status as direct servants or officers of- the Crown, and partly of the degree of public recognition), the *mdistinction would still not be an easy one to sustain.   There couldcertainly be no guarantee that it would be accepted by members of those**services excluded from the award scheme.   There is also the ?*possibility that some civilians - whom it has already been decided to  exclude - would resent the award of a services medal. Against the wpleasure which the award of a medal would undoubtedly give its ^recipients, therefore, must be weighed its potentially divisive effects^But if one were tempted to go beyond the armed forces and the police itjwould become even more difficult to differentiate without causinginvidious comparisons and heart-burning.    In the view of the majorityof the Committee, it would not be feasible to limit distribution to thevery few services for which the medal would be particularly intended;and the real choice lies between a medal for distribution over a much wider range or none-at all.Distribution within the services *6. We have also considered the question of suitable criteria for distribution, as a first step towards an assessment of the numberslikely to be involved.   Our starting point has been that the criteria
should give due recognition to the status of the award, while at thesame time giving as little scope as possible for resentment among those not selected.   The provisional views of MOD are that the selection of recipients might be based on a combination of merit and length of service.   The Police Department of the Home Office have pointed out that any criteria used in respect of the police would need to be discussed with the Police Federation, but they have suggestedthat the use of merit as a criterion could give rise to difficulty.The more objective the criteria, the less divisive the distribution islikely to be.   One of the most attractive schemes in theory would be     Jto award the medal to all those who have served The Queen throughout      the 25 years of Her reign: but for both the police and the armed forces^this would mean a disproportionately large percentage going to the        ^senior ranks, and would* therefore, in our view be unacceptable.   The   Jlength of service criterion would need to be qualified by some form of ^sliding scale, with a suitable proportion reserved for each rank, and, &quot;*therefore, the basic simplicity and attractiveness of a straightforward^25 years service criterion would be lost.   Even with a proportion Treserved for each rank, distribution based on length of service would   *not be without disadvantage, for it could result in the medals going in^large part to those regarded by their colleagues as &quot;old sweats&quot;, whichwould hardly be in keeping with the intended status of the award.   Butat least the distribution within each service would be less open to criticism than one based on less objective criteria.7.     On the basis of precedent, MOD have estimated that medals would be awarded to about 3% of the armed services; this would require some        S&quot;10,500 medals, plus about 750 for reservists.   The cost, at July 1975   &apos;prices of  6 per medal, would be  67,500 * 25% VAT.   A similarpercentage for the police would involve a further 3,000 medals, but intheir case 3% would not provide sufficient latitude for satisfactorydistribution, bearing in mind the need to reserve a suitable
proportion not only for each rank, but for each force.   A more realistic figure would be 57a, involving some 5,000 medals, at a costof  30,000 + VAT.    To extend the award to the other services listed in para A above would involve, on a 3% distribution, nearly 16,000 furthermedals, at an additional cost of  96,000 + VAT (or, with a 5%distribution, some 26,500 medals at an additional cost of  159,000 +VAT - see details in Appendix I).   We have not attempted to cost theextension of the scheme to any other services which might feel thatthey had a claim.Commonwealth ReactionsJ8.     Ministers asked that, in giving further consideration to medals,officials should take into account whatever assessment could be madeof likely Commonwealth reactions.   We have not thought it right to consult the Commonwealth at this stage, but the FCO have advised as to^what they would expect the Commonwealth views to be.   They suggest that-Jif it is ultimately decided to have a medal in the United Kingdom, afew Commonwealth countries might wish to join the scheme, but not in    ^sufficient numbers to make any significant contribution towards the costs.    If there is to be no United Kingdom medal, it seems unlikely    Jthat Commonwealth countries would issue one on their own initiative,although the possibility cannot be ruled out.   On this basisCommonwealth reactions seem unlikely to affect significantly thebalance of advantage as regards the issue of a medal in the UnitedKingdom.
SILVER J0BIL2S AY/ARD FOR industry at the meeting of the Ministerial Committee on 25 November 1975, officials were asked to examine what possibility there might be of creating some formof Silver Jubilee Award for Industry.       lYe have considered two possibilities;either a once for all special award purely to mark the occasion of the silver jubilee or the creation of a Silver Jubilee grade within the present schemefor the Queen&apos;s Awards for Export and Technology.A once for all AwardThis proposal, as any proposal for sons addition to the existing scheme, -nustbe looked at in the light of the review of the 3ueen&apos;s Awards undertaken in1975 by a committee under the chairmanship of HRH The Duke of Edinburgh.   Anyspecial Silver Jubilee Award would have, by definition, to recognise some special qualities which are not recognised by the existing scheme.       Thepossibility of recognising other qualities, eg significant contributions tothe protection of the environment or in the productivity field, were considered       Iby the Review Committee but rejected on the grounds that they would be immensely   &quot;jjcomplicated and expensive to judge and administer.     There seems no argument [that was not considered by the Committee which would justify departing from mbtheir findings in relation to some Silver Jubilee Award.    Y/e therefore considered^as an alternative, the possibility of introducing a feature into the existing scheme linked to the Silver Jubilee. ^A Silver Jubilee class for the 3ueen&apos; 3 Awards for Export and Technology UlWhilst the Review Committee rejected proposals for extending the qualities which   *^might be recognised by the Award, they did believe that there was a potentialneed to accord special recognition to companies who &quot;attained exceptional successunder the scheme&quot;.     The Committee also considered the arrangements for the j3*presentation of the ^ueen&apos;s Award, an aspect which might be linked to recognitionof exceptional success.     Yihilst the Committee thought that present arrangements   &quot;Xfor presentation of Awards, usually by Her Majesty&apos;s Lord? Lieutenant, workedconsideration should be given to additional ways to mark the achievement of all      \Award winners and that some particular arrangements might be made for winners whohad been granted an Award either for export achievement or for technologicalachievement or both in 5 separate years.     The general point has been met bythe Queen&apos;s decision personally to recognise Award winners by giving an annuslreception at Buckingham Palace to which will be invited 3 representatives froaeach successful firm.     A decision on some way of singling out the speciallysuccessful has yet to be taken.A permanent Silver Jubilee class for the Queen&apos;s Awards for Export and Technologywould be a possibility though this was not what we believe the Review Cofcrrittei h-Jiin mind.     Rather than a superior or additional Award they had been thinking tl ta 5 time winner might be honoured through the Queen or the Duke of Sdinburghthemselves making the presentation, perhaps on the Award winner&apos;s own premises. f\i.The Review Committee did look at the possibility of having 2 classes of the Awa iin the opposite direction, ie some second order for indirect exporters.     They * *rejected the idea because they thought any form of second class Award would be unlikely to be well received and because it would be inherently difficult to administer.
The following considerations affect any decision to institute a Silver Jubileeclass of the Queen&apos;s Awards *     The Queen&apos;a Award take3 the form of an emblemcast in metal which will in future incorporate an E or a T according to whetherthe Award is for exports or technology.     Producing these is already causingsome problems on the manufacturing side.      If it were suggested that aSilver Jubilee emblem would be in some way distinctive calling for a newdesign this would inevitably be costly.      It would seem more appropriate touse the same symbol as at present but to add wording to that which is presentlyengraved upon it to indicate that the Award was a Silver Jubilee Award.     If,in addition to creating a special class, it were decided that this class wouldbe presented personally by the Sovereign or her consort, then a suitableaddition would be needed.These practical considerations apart, it is also relevant that there are alreadytwo Award winners who would qualify were the standard set at the gaining of 5Awards.     In addition, there are 18 units with If Awards, one or two of which( might be successful in 1976, and a further 30 with 3 Awards.     It is conceivable that in time the numbers of winners of 5 Awards would be an appreciableproportion of the annual number of Awards made (at present approximately 100),We need also to bear in mind that it tends to be the largest firms and organisator units within them who secure repeat Awards.     For example, the 2 groups whowould presently qualify are members of ICI and G-laxo.       There- has been some criticism that the present scheme is for the big rather than the small which isnot dispersed by the fact that it is not well founded.       However, it is thegreat companies upon which the UK has to rely for the bulk of exports.     Thelarge groups are the large employers and Awards to them are therefore Awardswhich reflect well on large sectors of the working population.Any recommendation to the Queen affecting the Queen&apos;s Awards would have tocome from the Prime Minister&apos;a Advisory Committee on the Queen&apos;s Awards whichnext meets on 16 March.     The issue for decision therefore, i3 whether thePrime Minister&apos;s Advisory Committee on the Queen1s Awards should be asked toconsider a Silver Jubilee class for these Awards.     In Department of Trade eyeathe balance of the argument so far looks against rather than for.     This readingis soaewhat reinforced by what follows on a possible link between Council ofIndustrial Design awards, Queen&apos;s Awards and a Silver Jubilee Award.A link with Design Council awardsRather than following the suggestion of the Duke of Edinburgh&apos;s Review Committeethat a number of repeat Awards should lead to special recognition, a possibilitymight be specially to recognise firms who had won both export and Design Councilawards.     Maybe the entitlement would be limited      firms who had both kinds ofaward but had won the Queen&apos;s Award on a number of occasions.     Some 100 firaishave gained Design Awards since the -Jueen&apos;a Award scheme was introduced 10 yearsago.     Of these a good proportion have been successful in both schemes.     a difficulty in linking the award of any Silver Jubilee class to winners of boththe queen s Awards and the Design awards is that invisible exporters who make a &apos;*major contribution to the balance of payments are unlikely to gain Design awardsand that the sane may apply to a number of manufacturing industries who a.&apos;e        timportant exporters, for instance, those exporting food and drink.     This apart,any scheme for recognising repeat Award winners, whether in conjunction withDesign awards or not, would putinvisible exporters at a disadvantage.     They hivonly been able to qualify for the Queen&apos;s Award in the past 5 years and are unlikely to qualify for awards for technological achievement.
