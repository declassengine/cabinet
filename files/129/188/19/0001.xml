DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTrC(76) 44 COPY NO       u ^23 March 1976CABINETDIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs. At its meeting on 12 February the Cabinet agreed to the publicationof a Green Paper which would be discussed by the Parliamentary LabourParty (PLP) and then debated in Parliament.     Following that the cabinet were to have the opportunity to discuss the line to be taken at the EuropeanCouncil on 1-2 April.2. The Home Secretary and I held discussions with the PLP on  March.     This meeting,  which was not very well attended, went quietly.It has not in the event proved possible to arrange for debate in the commons before bringing the question back to Cabinet.    Debates are now set for29 March in both Houses.     The meeting at Chequers on 26 Marchtherefore presents an opportunity for Government spokesmen in the debates to be given guidance by Cabinet on the attitude which they shouldtake.    The Prime Minister and I will of course be able to take account ofany points raised during the discussion at Chequers and during the debates when we are at the European Council.    The degree ofParliamentary interest can be seen from the two Early Day Motions byMr Wellbeloved and by Mr John Davies which have already been put down.3. The main document before the European Council will be a reportdrawn up by the Presidency on the work done since the European council meeting in December, which draws attention to the main political problems requiring decision (R/588/1/76).    Also on the table will be areport by the Working Group to which is attached the latest text of the draft agreement as negotiated in the Council,  a text which still contains a largenumber of disagreed points (R/354/2/76), and various proposals concerningthe size of the Assembly and distribution of seats (those circulated so farare summarised in T/165/1/76).    Copies of these three documents are attached.    It will be seen that United Kingdom participation in this work has been on the explicit understanding that United Kingdom ministers would subsequently wish to examine the results in the light of the consultations taking place in the United Kingdom,1
4. One major and several relatively minor issues remain to be settled.We expect the Luxembourg Presidency to try to make as much progressas possible on 1-2 April, especially on the major issue of the question of seats.     They may well also want to tackle anything else which might provecontentious such as the exact date in May 1978, and the way the UnitedKingdom derogation is treated.    However my own view, following the talks which I had with the French Foreign Minister on Thursday 18 March,is that it is improbable that there will be firm agreement at the EuropeanCouncil.    It seems more likely that the European Council will refer workon the subject back to Foreign Ministers, so that they can try to resolveoutstanding differences, but it looks as though a further meeting of theEuropean Council, in July, will be needed before decisions can be taken.I set out below the line which I propose that we take on the issues likelyto be discussed at the European Council.SEATS5. The basic guidelines arc those set out in paragraphs 18 and 19 ofthe Green Paper:  ie while recognising the need to ensure a certain levelof minimum representation for the smaller Member States, in particularLuxembourg, we should aim for a solution which tends as far as possiblein the direction of relating the number of seats allotted to each country toits population.    (The latter principle is known as &quot;proportionality&quot;),    inpractice it will be very difficult indeed to get any Member State to agreeto a smaller number of seats than in the existing Assembly of 198 members.Given this fact, the larger the total size of the new Assembly, the easier itis likely to be in practice to get greater proportionality and thus increasethe relative representation of the larger Member States.    An assembly inthe range of 350 to 450 would seem acceptable if this facilitated asatisfactory pattern of representation.    But we should not want it to bekigger than this, on grounds of cost and efficiency, not to mention thepossibility that Community membership may be enlarged in years aheadto include other Member States who would need to be represented in theAssembly.fc. It remains to be seen how ready the other Member States will be tosettle the question of seats.    The French have taken a very firm stand onthe principle of proportionality.    To judge from my talk withM Sauvagnargues this gives them real difficulties and they will certainlyfight hard to improve on the Assembly&apos;s proposed distribution.    It is notpossible to tell where their position will finally stick.    At the other endof the spectrum, the Irish have been holding out to retain a share of theseats as close as possible to the extremely favourable deal which theyobtained under the Treaty of Accession.    If the Irish remain obdurate,agreement will be impossible, but they may in the end be unwilling to incur the odium involved if the other smaller Member States do not support them.    If the opportunity offers of a compromise which is a clearimprovement as regards proportionality over the propoals put forward by
the European Assemoly, we should need to consider it carefully.    Wecannot reasonably hope to achieve parity for Scotland with Denmark orWales with Ireland, but we ought to be able to avoid as glaring a disparityas the Assembly proposals would produce.ELECTION DATE 19787. The Presidency may well try to reach agreement on the date to be specified in the Agreement for the first election in May 1978,    (It is not necessary to settle the precise date for future elections since it isproposed that a procedure for settling a date within a two-month periodaround the key date should then apply).    The 1978 date will be important for us if we do decide to go for the introduction of direct elections in theUnited Kingdom in that year.    1 attach at Annex a note by Home Officeofficials covering the domestic aspects of the choice of date in rather more detail.UNITED KINGDOM DEROGATION8. It was agreed by the European Council in Rome in December lastyear that any country which was unable to hold direct elections on the agreed date in May or June 1978 should be able to continue appointing its representatives from amongst the members of its national Parliaments.This relates to the special position of the United Kingdom and Denmark.Certain legal and drafting problems remain.     There seems no need forthe Cabinet to consider these technical issues.    The important point forus is that the United Kingdom should be entitled to continue nominatingrepresentatives to the Assembly for an additional year or two, should wenot be able to introduce direct elections by 1978.conclusion. I recommend that the Cabinet should endorse what is proposed inparagraphs 5-8 abo*&apos;C as the line to be taken by the Prime Minister and myself at the European Council on 1-2 April, on the main issues which we expect the Presidency to try to settle.10.        I do not expect that the discussion will get to the stage at which finalcommitments about a text might be asked for but, if they were, I recommendthat it should be made clear that no such commitments could be made without further reference to Cabinet.L J foreign and Commonwealth Office23 March 19763CONRDf- N t i A
ANNEXatCTION DATE 1978Paragraph 20 of the Green Paper on Direct Elections to the European AssemblyBaid that the Government would see advantage in holding the European Assemblyelections in May at the same time as        local authority elections if this canconveniently be arranged.    In 1978 local government elections are due inScotland on Tuesday 2 Hay, and in England and Wales on Thursday 4 May.    Thesecond of these dates coincides with Ascension Day, and it is probable that the archbishop of Canterbury will suggest that it would be appropriate to change the date for local government elections in England and Wales (because pollinginvolves the closure of schools in many areas).   Whit Sunday (which is a holidayweekend in six Member States) falls on 1Jfc May and the Spring Holiday weekendfalls on 27-29 May.2.   Most of the other Member States want direct elections to the european assembly to take place in the second half of May.    In view of the circumstancesarising in 1978 in the United Kingdom, the second half of May might also be convenient for direct elections here.    It would be important that there Fhould besufficient flexibility on either side of the appointed day to enable the UnitedKingdom to hold direct elections on the day of the week that we choose.   Itwill, in any case, be necessary to consult the local authority associations andthe organisations concerned with electoral matters about the practicability of holding direct elections to the European Assembly at the same time as localauthority elections.
APPENDIXEUROPEAN COMMUNITIESBrussels, 9 March 1976R/588/1/76 (Ass 169) rev 1The CouncilNotefrom the ChairSubject: Election of members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage- Report to the European council at its last meeting the European Council asked theCouncil to continue examination of the problems arising and tosubmit a report which would enable the Convention on theelections to the European Parliament to be finalized at thenext European Council.During the discussions held on the matter in the Council,the United Kingdom delegation said that it intended toparticipate fully in the proceedings but made it clear thatthe United Kingdom ministers would subsequently examine theresults in the light of the consultations which were to takeplace in the United Kingdom.R/588 e/76 (ASS 189) ott/SWraub rev 1EEC/EURATOSi/ECSC*   &apos;   9 / *   *   4
Recent discussions have enabled substantial progress to bemade in preparing the draft Convention, the latest text ofwhich is set out in R/351/3/76 (ASS 119) rev. 3.However, a number of general points and questions of ma^orimportance are outstanding.   These are being submitted to theEuropean Council.1. Designation of the European parliament the draft Convention adopted by the European Parliamentuses the tern &quot;European Parliament&quot; in all the languages.In a letter dated 5 February 1976 /&quot;R/355/76 (ASS 120)J7and at the meeting between a delegation from the parliament and the Council on 2 March 1976, the President of theEuropean Parliament insisted that this term be used.Seven delegations agreed to the term &quot;european parliament&quot;.    One delegation insisted that the term &quot;Assembly&quot;appearing in the Treaties be retained.    One delegation hasnot yet adopted a position.If it proves impossible to agree unanimously on oneterm,  one of the following possibilities could be considered:- continue the current practice, whereby the term 15Assembly&quot;is used in French and &quot;European Parliament&quot; in the otherlanguages,
- state, the first time the &quot;Assembly&quot; is referred to inthe Convention, that it will hereafter be referred toas the &quot;European Parliament&quot;.2. Allocation of seatsThere are three possible systems for allocatingseats:(a) maintaining the allocation provided for in the treaties either as it stands or after applicationof a multiplying factor;(b) making the allocation strictly proportionate tothe number of inhabitants in each country;(c) a system of proportional allocation of seatsaccording to population segments, proportionallymore seats being allocated for the first segmentsthan for subsequent ones.The solution proposed by the European parliament is based on this system.    At its meeting with the Council,the European Parliament delegation stated that, withoutholding strictly to the system which it had proposed,  theEuropean Parliament would very much like certain criteriato be observed, i.e.:- the new allocation of seats should not entail areduction in the present number of seats for anyMember State;
- the least-populated States should be assured of adequate representation;- for the sake of the efficiency of the European parliament and in order to take account of the possibility of newStates&apos; acceding to the Communities in the future, thenumber of members should not be too high.Other solutions have also been submitted for considerationby the Council.Members of the European Council will find in the annex to T/165/1/76 (ASS) rev.  1  a table summarizing the various possibilities.3. Date of elections(a) At its meeting on 1 and 2 December 1975 the EuropeanCouncil agreed that the election of members of theEuropean Parliament would take place on a single date.The question arose whether this expression should be interpreted:- strictly, in which case voting could take place onlyon one and the same day;- flexibly,  in which case voting could take placeover a short period so as to comply with nationalcustoms.
R/508 e/lC (ASS 189) ott/SMSAaSome delegations expressed a clear preference forthe first alternative.Other delegations preferred the second alternativewhich would allow them to follow their national practices(elections on a Thursday or other weekday, elections ona Sunday or elections starting on c. Sunday and continuingon Monday, two ballots).    With this in mind, two possibilities were proposed:- the election would be held over three days (Saturday,Sunday and Monday for example) it being understoodthat in Member States which had ^ two-ballot system,the date of the first ballot would coincide with thatof the election in the other Member States which hada single ballot;-- the date of the election would be fixed for a Thursday,and the ballot could be held on any one of the fourpreceding or four following days.    This would give anine-day period,  enough to cover all possibilities,including a two-ballot system.(b) The date on which the results would be declared and published would depend on the arrangements chosen forthe date of the election itself:- if the elections were held on one and the same day,there would bo no problem: the count would take place and the results would be made public immediately afterpolling closed;
- - ij -- ii&apos; the elections were held over three days, thecount and publication of the results would not take place until polling closed in the KosherState which vo\;ed last;-- if the election could be held either four days before or four days after the date set- the provisional results would be announced, assoon as the count had been completed,= the official :&quot;finally results would be declaredon the same date in all Member States.4. Implementing provisions of the convention in its draft Coir-option the European Parliamentproposed an article on the adoption of implementingprovisions.    Some delegations expressed doubts about theneed, for this article.If,  as most delegations wished, the principle ofmaintaining this article were adopted,  there would bea choice of two procedures for adopting the implementingprovisions, vie:R/588 e/7u (ASS 189) ott/SMS/ha* 9 * / *
(a) The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal fromthe European Parliament and after consulting theCommission,  would adopt the measures in agreementwith the European Parliament.(b) The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal fromthe European Parliament and after consulting theCommission, would adopt the measures after havingsought agreement with the European Parliament in aconciliation committee bringing together the Counciland representatives of the European Parliament,The iiuropo an Parliament delegation said that itconsidered it important that these measures be adoptedby joint agreement between the two Institutions.    Itpointed out that in either case the Council oust actunanimously, and that it was improbable that unanimitycould be reached failing agreement between the Counciland the European Parliament,^s Problems raised by the statements made by the UnitedKingdom and Danish Prime ministers at the European Council.In order to take account of the statements made by theUnited Kingdom and Danish Prime Ministers at the EuropeanCouncil meeting in Rome,  transitional derogations from thegeneral rules laid down in the Convention should bo contemplate.
The German delegation suggested that such derogationsshould be the subject either of unilateral statements by both the Governments concerned,  or of two protocols,  one ofwhich would cover the Danish problem,  the other tho UnitedKingdom problem; the derogations resulting from these twoprotocols would be of limited duration.    The German delegationexpressed its preference for unilateral statements.The French delegation,  which the other delegation:--, wereprepared to support;  expressed the desire that the derogationscontemplated should, be of a general nature and of limitedduration.At its meeting with the Council,  the European Parliamentdelegation said that it would prefer a protocol clearly limitinthe scope and duration of any derogations.The text for the Protocol set out on the right-hand column of the Annex to this document was proposed by the Chair.    .r&quot;ostdel e gat ions could -&quot;-ccopt this text as a basis for discussion.The Unitod Kingdom could also accept this text as a basis for discussion provided that the following were deleted:- the first phrase between square brackets which makes specific reference to the statements made by the United Kingdom and denmark;- the words in square brackets in the second paragraphstipulating a given pcrioi.R/538 c/76  (ASS 18y) ott/T&apos;3/Ja* a   t / * &quot; *
The Danish delegation, observing that the text propoby the Chair did not appease the misgivings of the danish government, proposed the text in the left-hand column, totake account of the Danish standpoint.

1B -Designation of the Lurop:;rin parliament the Working Party v;ondercd whether the term &quot;Assembly&quot;or the term. &quot;Harepcc:n parliament&quot; should be used in thevarious language versions of the act.The Prcneh delegation requested that the term &quot;Assembly&quot;appearing in the Treaties be retained.i..ost other delegations were prepared to agree to the term &quot;European Parliament&quot;,The United Kingdom delegation proposed, that the firstreference to the European Parliament should read:  &quot;theAssembly, hereinafter called the European Parliament&quot;.The President of the European Parliament sent thePrcsiuont of the Council a letter on this subject, whichwas circulated under reference R/355/76 (ASS 120).2* Allocation of seats (Article 2)(a) The Working Party discussed this problem but was unableto reach any conclusion likely to gain unanimousapproval.(b) Article 2 (2) of the European Parliament *s draft   ^-provided^5for a procedure for possible changes in the number ofmembers of the European Parliament, making referenceto Article 14 of the draft.
vli.-. -vorkiny party felt that the incli;cion of such -   provisionv&apos;;j r: ;3ir;ible but that the criteria end procedure  for such ;e!;ioshould be -jpecified in the p;iri:igraph itself (rather than by reference to article  14).    the ultimata solution would alsoaepend on the formula adopted for determining the number and -i.he-i location of &quot;eats (a fixed allocation system or an allocationsystem which permitted adjustment to take account of populationchanges&apos;.^-   u-o of elecliona  (article 9)At  its meeting on 1  and 2 December  1975 the European Coun-j 1&apos;i-&apos;reed that the election of members of the L,aropean Parliament waul.,take place on a single date.    &apos;i&apos;he question arose of whether thisexpression should oe interpreted:- strictly, m which case voting could take place only on one an,&apos;t.te sxoio jd ;v ;- liexioiy, in w-nch case vo-ijig could take place over a s^iort poric.so as to comply with national customs.One delegation expressed a clear preference for the iir;v.ai ternativc.&quot;;Ost other delegations preferred tae second ;;l.ern Uivn ,  .V.TU ;would ? however,  -i;ive rise to the foilotviivr pro clems:- some J.iomoor States wished to hold t. cir elections or. a -&apos;.-,ur.&apos; . a&quot;or another weeA-usaO/, whereas o-herL3 wmt-jd to holu  i,oe;r; on     A.,.-v354/ 2 e/76 (ASS US1) rev. 2 ton/jV/^ih .../...- one  yc::,oer State wanted i. to be possiDie for elections  to ;;ot\on a Aun.n,y and contirue on the l^T-iiil J

IiT^iGmenting provisions of the Convention (Article  M)The European Parliament&apos;s draft lays down a procedure which,according to  i;he European Parliament&apos;s comments, is c-ascd on article of -$he e.c. Treaty and which provides for a jointdecision by  - ic European Parliament and the Council if it appearsthat further measures are required to implement direct elections tothe European Parliament.Certain delegations first of all wondered whether it was advi-sable to include such an Article.In any case, most delegations felt that such an Article should only concern the implementing measures of the Convention, to the exclusion of any other amendment of a more general nature.Two alternatives wore put forward as regards procedure:- the first, supported by most delegations, was that these measures should be adopted by the Council with the approval of the european parliament;- P-,   second,  supported by the French and United Kingdom delegations,i on the conciliation procedure.&quot;J * Perm and scooe of the act&quot;(Article 17)A number of questions were raised in this connection:(a) Form and legal basis of the actMost delegations expressed a preference for a Council decision
followed by ratification by the Member States in accordance withthe formula adopted for the Decision on own resources.    Thiscmcis^on should be based on Article 138(3) of the Treatyestablishing the e.c. (&quot;*).These delegations&apos; considered that Article 138(3) provided anadequate legal basis, even though the draft under discussion wasonly a first step towards the establishment of a completely uniformelectoral procedure.Two delegations, on the other hand, showed a clear preferenceTor a conventional international instrument (Treaty or Convention)which would ae based simultaneously on Articles 138(3)  (  ) and235(2) of the Treaty establishing the e.c..In their view, this was imperative for reasons of legalcertainty in the event of any disputes as to the adequacy of thedecree of uniformity envisaged for the electoral procedure.o) Jurisdiction of the Court of JusticeThe Working Party also discussed whether and under what conditthe Court 01 Justice would have jurisdiction with regard tointerpretation and application of the act to be adopted.&apos;) and on Article 21(3) of the Treaty establishing the ECSC and article 108(3) of the Treaty establishing the EAEC.) ana on Article 96 of the Treaty establishing the ECoC and article 204 of the Treaty establishing the EAECaV354/2 e/76TAS3 119) rev, 2 ton/JP/gj
It appeared that if a decision, similar to the one on &quot;own resources&quot; and based on Article 138 were adopted, which could be interpreted as a measure in implementation of the Treaty, theCourt would automatically have jurisdiction and would exercise allthe powers conferred upon it by the Treaty.In the case of a Treaty or a Convention, a provision wouldprobably have to ba inoludad expressly endowing the Court withthe requisite powers.The problem was raised here of the Court&apos;s jurisdictionvis-a-vis the implementation by the authorities of the member states of the national provisions to which the Conventionrefers.  0)&apos;c) Drafting techniqueThe question was also raised of whether or not the draftingtechnique should be such as to allow the new provisions to be incorporated in the existing Treaties.C ) See the note from the Legal Department in H/362/76 (JUR 13)(ASS 121)

The German delegationindicated a preference for unilateral declarations.The French delegation, which other delegations could support,expressed the desire that the derogations contemplated should beof a general nature and of limited duration.Tne text for the Protocol set out in the right-hand column ofthe Annex to this document was proposed by the Chair.   ILpstdelegations were prepared to accept this text as a basis fordiscussion.lTne United Kingdom could also accept this text as a basis fordiscussion provided that the following were deleted:- the first phrase between square brackets which raade specific reference to the statements made by the United Kingdom and denmark;- the words in square &quot;brackets in the second paragraphstipulating a given period.
The Danish delegation, observing that the text proposedby the Chair did not meet the requirements of the danish government, proposed the text in the left-hand column, as aDanish standpoint.    Provided this text were accepted by theother delegations, it could agree to the text proposed by thoChair concerning the United Kingdom,H. - Part 2Comments on the other Articles(a) preambleThe Working Party studied the problem of tlu   preamble,but felt it could not comment on the matter until i;he formand legal basis of the act haci h- - decided on.   Tuc french delegation, however, expressed the wish that the tworecitals proposed by the European Parliament should be deleted.(b) Article most delegations were able to accept the wording ofthis Article as it appears on page 2 of the Annex.The delegation of the Federal Republic of Germanysuggested the addition of the words in square brackets.(c) Article 7Arcicle 7 of the European Parliaments draft Conventionprovides that &quot;the European Parliament shall draw up aproposal for a uniform electoral procedure by 198Q at thelatest&quot;.
The question arises of whether or not the European Parliamcrshould he given a deadline for drawing up a draft Convention ona uniform electoral procedure.(d) Article 8The forking Party considered that the conditions for the admission of political parties to the elections would be governed by national provisions in each LPamber State, and that since such provisions were referred tc in the preceding Article,Article 8 as proposed by the European Parliament was superfluousand could be deleted,(e) Article 10The problem was raised of whether, if it proved necessaryto change the date of later elections, this should be done inagreement with the European Parliament or after consulting itBSeveral delegations could accept the formula whereby this change would be effected in agreement with the European ParliamenOthers preferred the formula whereby it would be for theCouncil, after consulting the European Parliament, to change thedate, in view of the fact that- - normally speaking fixing an election date was a matter forthe Executive,- there v;ould be a risk of deadlock if the Council and theEuropean Parliament disagreed.
(f) Article 13As the 7/orking Party -felt; that the provisions of Article 10and Article 13 of the European Parliamentra draft should b-included in the same Article, it deleted Article 13 m thy formproposed by the European Parliament.(s) Article  ,5In Article 15(1)  the European Parliament proposes that article 135(3) of the Treaty establishirr; the e.c. and the thirdparagraphs of the corresponding Articles in the other Treatiesbe rescinded.The ,,&apos;orking Party took the view that Article 13&amp;(? &apos; of the eec Treat-.- and the corresponding A^r  1&apos; &quot; of the EC3C and EA-CTreaties could provide a sufficient legal basis for revising the future Convention on elections to the European parliament by direct universal suffrage until such time as the ultimate aim of standardizing the electoral procedure had been achieved,and that therefore Article 138(3) of the E1X Treaty should boretained.The Working Party consequently proposed the deletion ofArticle 15(1).Article 10 of the draft lays down that the EuropeanParliaments first; annual session should begin on the firstTuesday following an interval of one month from the date of theelections,R/354/2 e/76 (AS3 VI9) rev. 2 ton/JP/gj .../...
This provision contrasts with Article 1 39 of the Treatyestablishing the e.c., which lays down that the European Parliamentshall meet, without requiring to be convened, on the secondTuesday in :.&apos;.&quot;arch.The question therefore arises&apos;of whether this provisionof Article 139 should be rescinded.Furthermore, Article 10 of the Convention settles only theproblem of the first annual session and not that of the foursubsequent annual sessions.    The question   is therefore whether to maintain the present system (meeting , without requiring to be convened, on the second Tuesday in Ilarch.) or to make the rulefor the year of election applicable to subseo/uent years(Article 10(4)).    The forking Party felt that the european parliament&apos;s opinion on the matter could be obtained before adecision is made.R/354/2e/76 (ASS 119) rev.  2 toVJF/ac
