DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(76) 288 March 1976A POST ENTRY UNION SHOP IN THE CIVIL service memorandum by the Lord Privy seal.        My memorandum C(76) 10 described the serious issues which theclosed shop principle raises for the Civil Service.    These were set outfully in the Annex to that paper which recorded the considered views ofPermanent Secretaries and I commend these again to the attention of mycolleagues.    I suggested that in the face of strong though far from unitedStaff Side pressures (see Annex) and against the background of our ownindustrial relations legislation, the best course would be to refer theproblem to a Committee of Enquiry.    This recommendation was not accepted by Cabinet and there wore divided views about the acceptabilityof introducing the closed shop principle into the Civil Service.2.        In our discussion it was recognised that the question of a post-entry union shop in the Civil Service raised unique issues going to the heart of public administration and of the tradition and reputation of theCivil Service for impartiality and loyalty to the Government of the day.It was suggested, on the other hand, that it was open to the government as an employer to negotiate on the union shop proposal but taking accountof the exceptions and modifications which would be required in the case ofthe Civil Service.    Nevertheless, many colleagues felt that there was no evidence of weakness in the union organisation which a union shop mightremedy, and there were strong arguments, related to political impartialityand conflicting loyalties, for resisting demands for a union shop.3.        The problem was remitted for further consideration to a group ofMinisters.   Since the individual staff associations are for from united inwanting to embrace the principle of a closed shop but are of one mind aboutthe need to solve the very real problem of &quot;free riders&quot; (who cost them 1.3 million anually in lost subscriptions), I suggested that we shouldreject tho closed shop but offer non-committal talks with the national staff Side (NSS) on how best to eliminate Ffree riders&quot;.    Again there wasno agreement.    A majority felt that talks about the &quot;free rider&quot; problem should be offered; but it was argued that it would be wrong to rule outacceptance of the closed shop from the outset.copy NO        iCABINET
4. The Secretary of State for Employment and I were accordinglyinvited to try to agree on the nature of the proposed talks with the staff side and to report to Cabinet.5.        There are essentially only three courses open to us.    We canreject any form of coercive agreement and offer to consider with the NSSmeasures to promote maximum membership by persuasion.    This wouldbe inconsistent with the Governments general attitude towards unionmembership agreements (as distinct from its view as employer) and itwould be difficult to demonstrate convincingly to those who favour some form of closed shop in principle that a union membership agreement with suitable safeguards or exclusions would not satisfy the special conoid era-tions which arise in the Civil Service.    Moreover, this course would not adequately solve the very genuine problem of the &quot;free rider&quot; and would therefore be strongly opposed by the NSS.6.        Secondly, we could consider a closed shop agreement involvingcompulsory membership of a union for at least some civil servants but with a number of safeguards.    These might include exempting those insenior or sensitive jobs and those who were expelled or resigned from a union on a point of principle, and perhaps a once-for-all general exemption for existing civil servants.    Such an arrangement would certainly be controversial, would go farther than is necessary to deal with the &quot;freerider&quot; piroblem and probably farther than the Staff Side want to go.    Iwould etiosifjly oppose such a solution.7.        Thirdly, we could contemplate some kind of agreement which wouldnot enforce membership but would oblige non-members to pay the equivalent of their subscriptions tc the appropriate union (or perhapsalternatively to an agreed charity).    Such an agreement could also, if need be, exclude specific grades or individuals, or differentiate betweennew and existing civil servants.    It would be possible to have an arrange-ment of this kind which would not fall within the legal definition of a&quot;union membership agreement&quot; and which would have the effect of giving an employee in any given grade a free choice between membership of a union or payment in lieu, with the sanction that if he refused to pay, andwas not a union member, he would be dismissed.    In such circumstances,there might be a finding of unfair dismissal by an industrial tribunal,and the possibility of a compensation claim against the Government.However it would be possible to make essentially the same provisions inthe form of a &quot;union membership agreement&quot; under the legislation, andthus avoid this liability.    This would of course be a form of closed shopand in my view therefore some thing to be avoided if possible.    But Iwould not wish to rule out in advance the possibility of a &quot;union member-ship agreement&quot;.8.        An agreement on these lines would be fully effective against&quot;free riders&quot;; but since union membership would not effectively be acondition of continued employment and particularly if there were othersafeguards as well, the problems of politicisation and conflicting loyaltieswould be largely removed.    On the other hand such an agreement would2
no doubt still be controversial, cspecially if it took the form of a &quot;unionmembership agreement&quot; under the legislation.    Moreover, as the annex to C(76) 10 points out, it may be difficult, once an agreement of this kindhas been entered into, to resist the gradual erosion of the safeguards.9.        However, I do not consider it necessary at this stage for us todecide whether or not we should try to tackle the problem of &quot;free riders&quot;under a formal &quot;union membership agreement&quot; or in some other way.I hope however mat we can agree at the outset that we will not contemplate any arrangement which gives the civil servant no alternative but to be amember of a union against the sanction of dismissal.10.       I therefore recommend that we should reply to the informalapproaches of the National Staff Side about a Post Entxy Union shop by saying that the closed or union shop raises special problems for the CivilService and that in particular the Government could not agree to compulsory union membership.    On the other hand the Governmentsympathises with the Staff Sidess concern about the financial aspects ofthe &quot;free riders&quot; problem and is therefore ready to set up a working party at official level to investigate with the Staff Side, but without commitment on either side, the various ways of solving or minimising this problem.    The Government will then, in the light of this investigation and any consultation with other interested parties it considers necessary,put proposals to the Staff Side.11.      We must face the fact that whatever we do on this issue is likelyto create public controversy.    In my view, therefore, it is essentialthat the Opposition should be informed of our proposed response to theNational Staff Side before we make it.    We shall, of course, need toconsider this aspect again before final decisions are made after theproposed Working Party has reported.12.       We must aim to put our proposals for a Working Party to theStaff Side well before their annual conferences, ie as early in April aspossible, if we are to avoid an unnecessary risk of confrontation on this issue.    An early decision is therefore necessary.13.       The Secretary of State for Employment has been consulted andbroadly agrees with the recommendation in paragraph 10 subject to astrong reservation on the reference there to compulsory union member-ship.    He maintains that it would be inconsistent with the Government&apos;attitude to the closed shop to rule out from the beginning any particular form that the arrangement might take in the case of its own employees.In particular, he would not wish to reject at the outset a position which inhis view could be accompanied by adequate safeguards of the kinddescribed in paragraph 6 above and which he would see as affording an acceptable outcome if it came to the point.    Moreover, such an initialrejection would be likely to have the tactically undesirable effect offocussing the discussions on the issue of the closed shop rather than onthat of free riders.    The Secretary of State nonetheless agrees that we3
should seek in the discussions to reach agreement on an arrangement which gives a civil servant an alternative to compulsory union membership; andthat we could indicate to the Staff Side at the outset the dangers that we see in any other arrangement.    But for the above reasons ho would not wish togo beyond that.14,      My own view is strongly that if we do not begin by excludingcompulsory membership we may mislead the Staff Side, prejudice an acceptable outcome and provoke unnecessary controversy.    I invite mycolleagues to agree to the proposed Working Party on the basis suggestedin paragraph 10, including the exclusion at the outset of compulsory unionmembership, and to inform the Opposition before our proposal is put to theNational Staff Side,civil Service Department8 March 19764
annex the Rational Staff Side have no formal position on the closed shop.     They have made an informal approach to seek views onthe possibility of negotiating a framework agreement withinwhich each trade union would be free to negotiate its ownspecific and detailed agreement.     In informal discussions,the National Staff Side say that they are concerned with the elimination of &quot;free riders&quot;.2.     A very rough indication of what &quot;free riders&quot; cost theCivil Service unions 1st -UNION                  NON-MEMBERS			SUBS     LOSS OF REVENUE		No.		  pa	  paCSU	5,000	18	11	55,000CPSA	46,000	20	12	522,000SCS PDA *	33,000	28	18 ) 12 )	495,000IPCS	U,000	15	18 (average)	210,000IRSP	neg		8 (average)	-TOTAL 98,000 1,282,0003.     The policies of individual unions vary;   and in some cases,the leadership probably has a different objective from themore militant elements.     At one extreme the CPSA, representingthe Clerical, Typing and Machine Operating grades has aConference resolution calling for a completely closed shop withdismissal of non-members;   but it is likely that the leadershipwould be content with a less far-reaching arrangement.     At theother extreme, it is unlikely that the IPCS or PDA, representingbetween them the top ranks of the Civil Service and the professional, Technical and Scientific groups, would seekagreements of their own, although they are associated with thedesire for a national framework agreement;   and are of courseopposed to &quot;free riders&quot;.      Somewhere in between is the Society1
of Civil Servants (representing middle management) which ha*some important elements in favour of a olosed shop but whofl*membership is almost certainly on balance against it.4.     It is likely therefore that an arrangement to eliminate&quot;free riders&quot; would be negotiable with the Rational Staff Siand would then provide the basis for individual agreements the trade unions wanting them.5.     The CPSA will be looking for proof of progress on this issue before their Conference which starts on 3 May 1976 jfailing this, there may be demonstrations of disappointmentfrom some elements.2
