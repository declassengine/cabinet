(48) 1352Qth May, 1948CABINETWAGE CLAIMS IN THE PUBLIC SECTORMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at the meeting of the Economic Policy Committee on 3rd May (E.P.C. (48)17th Meeting, Minute 2), the Prime Minister suggested that there should bea further discussion on some subsequent occasion on the line which the Ministryof Labour should take when there is a breakdown in negotiations over anapplication for a wage increase by public employees.It may be useful if I set out my views on the arguments for and againsta tighter control over wages in the public sector than in the private sector.2. There is, I think, no doubt that in the past wide movements on wages have resulted from increases granted in the public sector and there is real danger of similar movements being similarly started in the future. There isconsiderable force in the argument that if the Government expect the policyof the White Paper to be observed generally throughout industry they oughtto ensure that it is observed in the sphere which they can control or, at least,strongly influence especially as movements in that sphere are particularly likelyto spread outside it. It is therefore most important that everything possible should be done to secure that the principles of the White Paper are observed in the public sector.3. This is not, however, to say that we must resort to a machinery for wage determination different from that applying over the field of employmentgenerally. The policy of the White Paper is to seek voluntary restraint fromwage increases, apart from the exceptional cases which the White Paper admits.It is difficult to see how in equity we can rely on voluntary restraint in theprivate sector and impose some more formal restraint on the public sector. Thefact that a sanction in the form of refusal of price increases is available insome parts of the private sector but is in the main inapplicable in the public sector is hardly in itself a sufficient ground for difference of approach to a wage increase demand.4. If we agree that the same principles must apply in the two sectors,then the importance of the public sector makes it the more necessary that weshould see that all the employing bodies are fully seized of the White Paperprinciples. Here we ought to make the fullest use of the closeness of ourcontacts with those bodies to secure that we are kept fully informed of allwage claims which are presented, and of the progress of negotiations on them,and are made aware of the line which the employers propose to take. Somethinghas already been done in this direction by bringing the White Paper formally to the notice of public sector employers. But we must do more, and I suggestthat the Ministry of Labour should now take formal steps, in collaboration withthe Departments concerned, to institute a regular procedure for watching theprogress of claims in the public sector from their inception.5. There is one further point which applies both to the public and theprivate sector. When a claim has been discussed and a reply given, it may bethat the workers will apply for arbitration. If this happens, it seems to me mostimportant that the Government should refrain from any step which could be35425L
