(1+8) 78 of 7th March I gave my colleagues a brief account of the results of the informal talks on germany which went into recess on 6th March.      These talks were resumedon 20th April after certain questions had been further consideredduring the recess by Working Parties in Berlin, under &quot;thedirection of the three Military Governors.      The Benelux Delegationas before,  has taken part in the discussions except on those items which are the concern of the Occupying Powers.      The Canadian,Australian and South African Representatives in Berlin were also given the opportunity of expressing their views on certain matters.The Commonwealth Governments are being kept currently and fully informed of the developments of the talks in London.2. The main object of the    talks is to produce agreedrecommendations over the whole field of discussion which will besubmitted to the Governments represented for approval.3. The main discussions have centred on the followingsubj ects: -(a) Political organisation-.(b) International Control of the Ruhr.(c) Security against Germany.An outline of the provisional agreements reached on these threematters is contained in Annex &apos;A&apos;.      There has throughout the talks been an implied but clear understanding that,  if theFrench would come some way to meet our and the United Statesviews on the political organisation, we and the United states would try to give the French satisfaction on the International-,control of the Ruhr and security against Germany.      On the two latter points general agreement has now been reached, but therehas been a fundamental divergence of view on the question ofPolitical Organisation.
II.___French-Memorandum of 20th may i+. This divergence, of view was &quot;brought to a head when,on 20th May, the French Government addressed a memorandum toHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government,  acopy of which is attached (Annex  &apos;B&apos;).      Very &quot;briefly,  in that memorandum they suggest that the three Governments should now put into force only the Ruhr agreement and currency reform.The conference proposals for political reorganisation should,however, not be notified to the Germans on 15th -June, as originally intended, but in the autumn.      This,  in fact,  wouldmean delaying the whole programme for nearly a year because ofthe difficulty of holding elections in the winter.      They alsosuggest that the proposals themselves should &quot;be fundamentallyrevised in that the Constituent Assembly instead of &quot;being an elected body should consist of representatives chosen from theLaender Parliaments.      In their memorandum the French state thatthe ground on which they wish to postpone the time-table is thatthe establishment of a Constituent Assembly in Western germany would be provocative to the Russians and might lead them to take military action in Berlin or Western Germany with which theWestern Powers could not cope.      The ground on which they opposeour proposals for an elected body is that they fear that GermanNationalism is on the upgrade and that elections would be dangerous.5* The French attitude is due to several factors.      Inaddition to the congenital fear of a rehabilitated Germany, thereis a consciousness of military weakness and a reluctance to provoke the Soviet Government.      Secondly the recent Moscowexchanges have helped to undermine confidence in the stability of American policy.      Finally and mast important,  the whole problem raises serious internal difficulties for the FrenchGovernment.      M. Bidault has promised to take no decisive step inGermany without the approval of Parliament and in consequence any proposals emerging from the London talks must be debated in theChamber.      Here he is certain to &quot;be opposed by the Communists onthe ground that he is affronting Russia and by the Goullists onthe ground that he is imperilling French security.      Nor can herely on the whole hearted approval of any section of theGovernment supporters.      The issue is certain to be close and itis natural that the French Government do not view the prospectwith enthusiasm.6. The United States Delegation took strong exception tothe French memorandum and the attitude of the French Government.They were disposed at first to break off negotiations and inviteHis Majesty&apos;s Government to concert the necessary measures of constitutional reform in the bizonal area,  leaving it to theFrench to join later if they felt so disposed.      In particular the americans felt that the French were concerned only to clinchthose items of the agreement on which they had receivedconcessions, namely the International Control of the Ruhr and security against Germany, whilst postponing the execution ofthe political proposals to which the United States government attach capital importance.      Calmer counsels have, however,prevailed and the talks are still proceeding in the hope of finding a way out of the deadlock.      In the meantime after careful consideration I decided to send a personal letter toM.  Bidault stating in friendly but firm terms ray objections tothe new French proposals.   -  I have asked him to reconsider theproposals in the light of these objections.       I have pointed outthat I am anxious that the three Western Occupying powers should go forward in agreement in their German policy, but that there, isa&quot; strong feeling that if the French will not agree to the proposed
169programme,  we and the Americans should proceed, alone in thebizonal area.      I have asked him not to force me to make thisdecision.      I have spoken in similar terras to the french ambassador.      I have not yet received a reply from M. Bidou.lt.R ecomm endat i on s7. I recommend that:-(a);   We should tell the French that we cannot agree to anypostponement of the proposed timetable which would havethe effect of delaying until next year theestablishment of a Constituent Assembly.      Thus, ifit would really help the French,  I would agree to putoff the notification to the Germans from 15th June to,say,  1st July and the convocation of the ConstituentAssembly from 1st September to 1st October.(b) Without giving way on the principle of elections, we should accept an American compromise proposal wherebyit would be left to the Land. Parliaments to decide whether the elections to the Constituent assembly should be by the people of each Land or by the parliament in each Land.(c) Provided satisfactory agreement is reached on thequestion of elections and the timetable,  therecommendations contained in the papers which havebeen drafted during the talks should be approved.(d) If in the last resort it is not possible to obtainthe agreement of the French Delegation on the questionsof elections and the timetable (with, such concessionsas are referred to above),  or if our jointrecommendations are rejected by the French government after the debate in the Chamber, I should be authorisedto inform the United States Government that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are  prepared in  principle to go ahead with the United States Government on lines to beagreed in the bizonal area.      In this event theposition would be fully explained to the French and awarm invitation issued to them to join in as soon asthey found it possible to do so.      The United states ambassador has suggested,  and I agree,  that we should give the French Delegation timely warning that thiswill be our attitude.Gen era1 Cons i dera ti ons8. It seems to me essential,  and the United StatesGovernment strongly holds the same view, that steps should betaken this year to form a German Government and that a definiteprogramme should be laid down for the Germans with, the least possible delay.      The grounds on which it is undesirable to give way on this issue may be briefly stated as follows(a)    We are committed to the political and economicreorganisation of Western Germany.      When the lostConference of Foreign Ministers broke down in Decemberit became clear that no agreement on Germany could bereached with&apos; the Russians and I told the House ofCommons in my speech of 22nd January that in thesecircumstances the Western Powers must proceed withoutdelay to do what was necessary in Western Germany.      Irepeated this assurance at the Scarborough Conference.
170(b) The Germans hove been led &quot;by Press reports and. bydeduction from official statements to believe that aGovernment of Western Germany will shortly beestablished.      They are anxiously waiting for a lead and a clear programme.      If no action is taken thereis certain to be a political and economicdeterioration in Western Germany.      And if theGermans apprehend that the delay is due to fear of a russian reaction,  the result will certainly be thedemoralisation of our friends and an access of strength to Communism.      The danger of a Russo-German combination represents the most seriousthreat to our security.(c) The Russians would also be quick: to deduce that ourreluctance to proceed sprang from a sense of weakness.      They would accordingly be tempted tobelieve that they could safely increase pressure on the Western Allies in Berlin and elsewhere.(d) Our relations with the Americans;, on whom we oredependent in Germany, will deteriorate;    and theywill have ground for complaint that we should havewarned them sooner and that we were not reallyprepared to go ahead with the political reorganisation of Western Germany.9. I hove considered the problem of Russian reactions to an early announcement of the political programme.      On thispoint the French Delegation have explained that in a year&apos;atime there will be a better chance that the combined military strength of the Western Powers and of the United States inEurope will be sufficient to Justify the risk of Russianreactions to the political programme for &quot;Western Germany being put into effect.      The French have not,  however,  suggested any similar postponement of the announcement of the proposed plans for an international control in the Ruhr, for combining thetrade of the French Zone with that of the bizonal area in theJoint Export-Import Agency, or for currency reform in western germany,   (though they hove proposed some delay in  putting this last measure into force).10. The three Military Governors were accordingly askedto report on the probable reaction of the Russians in Germanyto the announcement of decisions reached in London,  and also onthe reaction of the Germans to a possible postponement of thepolitical programme.      They were also asked to soy what countermeasures could be taken to deal with possible Soviet reactions.The British and United States Military Governors hove drawn upon agreed report which is attached at Annex &apos;C&apos;.      I agree withtheir conclusions.      The French Military Governor has drawn upa separate report which disagrees in some respects with theAnglo-United States report and odds very little to thearguments contained in the memorandum of the French Government.My opinion on this question is that the possibility of suchreactions cannot be excluded, but that it is more likely to be caused by the Russians learning about the international controlof the Ruhr from which they are excluded and the benelux countries are brought in than from an announcement of thepolitical programme.      Moreover,  if the Russians know that theWestern Powers are afraid of them and are holding up their programme in Germany on that account, they will, as stated above,be in a very, strong position to intensify the pressure upon theWestern Powers in Berlin.
17111. I recognise that it is clearly desirable to make everyeffort to carry the French with us.      The French Government areapt to invoke internal difficulties as an excuse for rejectingany unpalatable proposal.      But in the present case M, Bidault isundeniably in a difficult parliamentary position and a defeat inthe Chamber would hove serious consequences.      Moreover it isimportant to maintain the unity of the Western Powers and inparticular to avoid any divergence between the signatories ofthe Five Power Treaty.12. I hove therefore considered carefully whether withoutsacrificing the essential establishment of a Constituent Assemblythis year it is possible to devise any concessions on the electoral issue and the timetable.      The United States Delegation,who now also favour an attempt at conciliation,  hove informallyand without commitment,  suggested a compromise whereby it would beleft to the Parliaments to decide whether the elections to theConstituent Assembly in each Land shall be by the people of eachLand or by the Parliament in each Land,-,  not necessarily fromamongst the members of the Land Parliament itself.      In either case the object of the elections would be to reflect fairly thepoliticol complexion in each Land.      This proposal is obviouslyon unsatisfactory compromise and could only be accepted on the clear understanding that if the Germans decided in favour ofelections or if the Constituent Assembly drafts a constitutionproviding for a directly elected House, the French will acceptthe decision without further demur.      In view, however,   of thoimportance of doing everything possible to ease M. Bidault&apos;position and the fact that the Americans are prepared to putforward a compromise, I consider that their proposal should besympathetically considered and that something on these lines should in the last resort be accepted if the French are disposed to agree to it.13. I hove also given careful thought to tho question ofthe timetable.      In view of the present hitch in the negotiations/i .ns,it is possible that we shall net be in a position to make theproposed notification to the Germane on 15th June.      In consequenceit seems to me that we might make a virtue of necessity and agreeto a short postponement of the notification to the Germans and ofthe convocation of the Constituent Assembly.      This would onlyrepresent a small concession to the French, but the french ambassador states that in the present situation in the FrenchCabinet any readiness to meet the French is bound to have  afavourable psychological effect.      I consider therefore that weshould be well- advised to agree to a  short deferment  of the time-table,  on the clear understanding that this does net involvepostponing the convocation of the Constituent Assembly until nextyear.If,  despite these concessions,  the French are stillunable to agree,  I feel that for the reasons stated above thereis no alternative but to accept the American invitation to proceed in Bisonia without the French.      In that event,   steps would betaken to  endow the present Economic Council at Frankfurt with the requisite political&apos; powers and we?- should be prepared at any moment to reopen negotiations with France regarding&apos; the fusion of theFrench Zone with Bizonia,  the constitution for Western Germany andthe establishment of an international control in the Ruhr.      The.circumstance that we had previously made every effort to compromisewould attenuate,  If it did not dispel,  ill-feeling on the part   -of the French.E. B.Foreign Office,  8.W.I. - -29th May,  I9V8.
-    172ANNEX &apos;A!PROVISIONAL AGREEMENTS REACHED ON MAIN ITEMSOP DISCUSSIONInternational Control of the Ruhr1. It has now &quot;been agreed that an international control will &quot;be established in the Ruhr before a provisionalGerman Government is set up.    This represents a compromise between the views of the United States Delegation, whoconsider that international control is superfluous at thisstage, and those of the French, who would prefer a more far-reaching systems   At any rate so far as the period of allied occupation and control in Germany is concerned,   the agreement is a facade since the international authority will in facthave very few functions and the real power will continue torest with the Military Governors a    The fact however that agreement has been reached on the establishment of control for the Ruhr is all-important to French publicopinion.2. The Americans have finally dropped their demand that we should agree here and now that the United StatesGovernment,  in order to protect their financial interest,should,  in case of dispute and in the lost resort,  havethe decisive voice *    They ore now willing that this point should bo settled later,   if and when the occasion, should arise *3. The main points of the latest conference document on the Ruhr ore as follows:-(a) An International Authority consisting ofrepresentatives of the United Kingdom,  United States,France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany,will be set up for the Ruhr to make the division of coal,coke and steel as between German consumption and export.(b) If no international body is set up,  after the occupying powers have handed over supreme authority,  toensure the maintenance of German disarmament,  this functionwill be taken over by the Authority.(c) The Military Governors will implement thedecisions as to allocation to the extent consistent with existing or future agreements relating to the provision offinancial assistance to Germany between two or more of the occupying Powers, and in. accordance with existing agreement(such as: the Moscow and Berlin sliding scales)  as to coal and coke allocation.(d) After supreme authority is handed over by the occupying Powers the German authorities will be responsiblefor ensuring that the Authority&apos;s decisions are carried out.The Allied Governments concerned will be responsible for any necessary enforcement measures.Evolution of -the Political andEc o n orn 1 o&quot; Q r g a ni s a t i oiTo f Ge hi la nyU. With the exception of the point referred to inparagraph 5 below,  and the disagreement as to the timetable,referred to in the main paper,  agreement has been reachedupon a pPan for a method and timetable for the establishment
173of a    rovlsional German Government in the three WesternZ one s *5, Briefly the plan. Is as follows.   Not later than15th June the three Military Governors will authorise theMinisters President in the three Western zones to prepare the convocation of a constituent Assembly to take placeby the 1st Septembers  and to make proposals for there-organisation of the present inter-Land boundaries inwhich there ore certain anomalies *    One point of disagree-ment between the Delegations arises over the method ofchoosing the members of this Constituent Assembly.    TheUnited Kingdom and United States Delegations  consider thatthe members of the Assembly should bo directly elected bypopular vote in each Land;  in order that the constitution which they produce will have the necessary standing inGerman public opinion.    The French have so far been opposedto election,  and they insist that the members should be nominated by the Parliaments of each Lands    This problem is discussed in paragraphs h. and 12 of the main memorandum.6. The proposals made by the Ministers President ferchanges in the inter-Land boundaries will be presented to the Military Governors and.,  if not disapproved by them,submitted for- approval by popular vote in the affectedareas before the Constituent Assembly is established.There has been sane discussion about the interpretation ofthis phrase &quot;affected areas&quot;.    The critical issue is whether,  on a proposal to split an existing Land into two,the people in both, parts should vote,  or only the people in the area which can be said to be seceding.    It applies particularly to the case of the present Land North Rhine-Westphalia, which both the Americans and the French consider-to be too large and powerful and would like to see split.If the people in North Rhino only were allowed to vote,  theywould almost certainly decide in favour of a split.     Anagreement was finally reached which represents a faircompromise between the Delegations.7&apos; The Constituent Assembly -will proceed to draft a constitution in close consultation with representatives ofthe Western Occupying Powers.      The maximum amount of freedomwill be left to the Germans to chouse their own typo of govermental structure.      There a re, however, certain minimum requirements, agreed in advance by the Powers concerned, whichmust be safeguarded in the Constitution.      These principlesare contained in a letter of advice which will be sent to themilitary Governors and will guide too consultations betweenAllied and Germain representatives daring the drafting stage.In addition I shall instruct the British Military governor to make sure that provision is made in the Constitution forthe electoral procedure and. machinery to be a matter for theLand governments and. not the Federal government.8. Simultaneously with the drafting of theConstitution, Allied and German representatives will alsoconsult together on a new definition of the -relationship between Military Government and the new German Governmentto be established under - the Constitution,  and: of the limitations to be placed upon the powers of each.    Therehas recently been steady pressure of public opinion in favourof such a definition, which has come to be known as an occupation Statute.    Its object is to show clearly the fieldsin which the new German Government will be free to run itsown affairs,  and the fields to within which the occupying powers agree to limit the exercise of their supreme authority.
174In this matter the Military Governors will ha guided &quot;by afurther letter of advice.9o The draft Constitution will he submitted to theMilitary Governors-    Unless it conflicts fundamentally with,the principles set out in the relevant letter of advices  theMilitary Governors,will approve its submission for ratification by    the German people by public.referendum.      Concurrently hewelections (if these are provided for in the draft Constitution)will take place for the formation of a Provisional Governmentbased on the Constitution.10, At the same time as the Military Governors announce their approval for the submission of the Constitution to tinepeople,  they will publish an Occupation Statute drafted in thelight of the consultations referred to in paragraph 8 above,and make it clear that the German people must accept theConstitution within the framework of this Occupation Statute.In this way it is thought possible to get the implicitacceptance of the terms of the Statute by the German peoplewithout incurring the disadvantages of trying to make it adirect contract between the German Government and the Allies.Security against. Germany11* Early in the talks the French Delegation made it clearthat their agreement to any recommendations which would emergewould   depend, on the satisfaction of their basic requirementsconcerning security against Germany.      The subjects on which agreement was essential were disarmament and demilitarisation,control of the Ruhr,  control of industry (by means of prohibitedand restricted industries) the organisation of a system of inspection,  the maintenance of Allied occupation,  and theconclusion of a treaty providing for consultation and guarantee in the event of a threat of renewed German rearmament.12. The United States Delegation has been unexpectedlyforthcoming particularly in a period of electoral campaign,and provisional agreement has now been, reached over a wide field.   The following is a brief summai-y of the main points:-(a) United States forces will remain in Germany until thepeace is secured in Europe.      (This is a repetition of the pledge given by President Truman, iii his speech on 17th March) j(b) The occupation will last for a long period,  and thereshall be no withdrawal of occupation forces without prior consulation with the other Western Occupying Powers;(a)    The Governments concerned, will consult if any of themconsider that there is a danger of the resurgence of german military power;(d)   &quot;A. Military Security Board is to be set up immediately to dsstst. the Military Governors in ensuring the maintenanceof di-earmoraent and demilitarisation.     This will last as longas the Occupying Powers retain supreme authority in Germany.
175annex fb&apos;text op memorandum of 20th may addressed by frenchgovernment to h is ma jesty&apos;s government&quot;&quot; a hp unitedstates governmentThe prospects&quot; opened up by the plans under discussion at the Tripartite Conference in London on Germany cause seriousapprehensions to the French Government and that is why they desire, without even waiting for the end of the talks, to draw the most serious attention of the United States and UnitedKingdom Governments to this problem.      The clearly definedobject of the  present discussions is to organise Western germany in such a way that she may be able by her economic recoveryand adequate political ro-organisotion to revive without againbecoming aggressive and to resist any penetration from the East.The French Government is in entire agreement on this subject,but the measures contemplated seem to them dangerous in certain respects both from the point of view of Germany and from thatof Russia.1. From the point of view of Germany the FrenchGovernraont accept the principle of convoking a constituentassembly to prepare the establishment of a Federal organisation in Western Germany.      They consider desirable,  as they have often stated,  an organisation capable of integrating western germany with Western Europe.      But the clearer the goal,  themore do the measures foe1 attaining it require discussion.      Therhythm of decisions must be carefully calculated.      The Anglo-American authorities in Germany have hitherto considered thatthere wee reason to furnish Western Germany rapidly with political institutions  in order to obviate the risk of Suingovertaken in this field by Russian initiatives.      There is noreason to believe with certainty that the Russian authoritiespropose to take such initiatives.      It seems mere likely thatthey will react if the case arises and also,  if the case arises,will exploit the mistakes of tho Western Powers.      There istherefore in the view of the French Government, no urgency,the possibility thus being offered to work towards the realisation of the best conditions for the success of the policy we intend to follow and not to precipitate a movement beforealso fcn ./wing as precisely as possible where it leads.      In thisrespect,  it is essential to have the declared consent and support of the Western Germans.      From all the reports receivedby tho French Government, it emerges that they ore veryreticent about the immediate constitution of a Government atFrankfurt.      They are haunted by the idea of dividing Germanyand by the fear of assuming responsibility for this in the eyes of German opinion.      The French Government consider moreoverthat the  election  of members of the Constituent Assembly by direct universal suffrage,  apart from being contradictory to thevery principles of the federal system in view, may bringsurprises as regards the distribution of political forces.A fairly profound political evolution is indeed beginning toappesr in&quot;Germany.      Nationalism,  if not National Socialism,is on the way to revive.      The recent municipal elections inHesse   ire a striking proof.      The London proposals in theirpresent form involve five appeals to the ballot-box in the space of less than a year.
2. Vis-a-vis the Soviet Union,  the French government do not seek to coll in question the present division of Germany,which is an inevitable consequence of the profound divergenceswhich exist between the Occupying Powers.      They considerindeed that,  on the hypothesis of a rapprochement between theSoviet Union and the Western Powers, nothing could bo more dangerous than the re-establishment of an effectivequadripartite regime which,  like the central administrationsprovided for in the Potsdam Agreement, would risk the whole ofGermany being placed under Soviet influence.      But to pursueresolutely the organisation of Western Germany does not implytaking measures capable of being interpreted by the SovietGovernment as constituting a threat to themselves.      Suchwould be the case,&apos; in the view of the French Government,  ifimmediately after the London Tripartite Conference, the decision were announced to convoke a Constituent Assembly charged with - -preparing the creation of a Government.      it is difficult to saywith certainty what the Soviet reaction would be, but it isprobable that it would bo likely, both in Berlin and elsewhere.It would be all the more so in that Moscow might wel]  interpret the decisions as being the prelude to the constitution of aGerman military force.      Even if Russian reactions were notextreme, Soviet action in Germany would be much facilitated.The demagogic campaign fur German unity would take a new turn,because the initiative taken by the Western powers would exposethem to the accusation of having themselves definitely dividedthe country,  and because the constitution in Frankfurt of a&quot;Western German Government would afford Berlin&apos;s power ofattraction an opportunity to exercise itself on the whole ofGermany.      The French Government consequently consider afterripe reflection,  that the programme now under examination shouldbe modified in the following sense.(a) A certain number of measures proposed should be announced and put into force at  once.      The most importantare monetary reform,  the pooling of foreign trade and the revision of the German land frontiers.      For this last purpose.,the Conference of Minister-Presidents, which must be givenconsistent and lasting shape,  should be assembled on the datelaid down in the report on political organisation to examinethe frontiers of the different Laender and to decide on the modifications to be  proposed to the Gommanders-in-Chief.(b) The announcement and application of the other measures,in particular the convocation o. a Constituent Assembly,  shouldbe postponed.      The agreements approved by the three Governmentsfollowing on the London Conference should not be called inquestion,  they should be elaborated and perfected., but we shouldwait for example until the outumr. before notifying them to theGermans.As regards the actual substance of these measures,  theFrench Government draw attention to the following two points;(a) The manner of designating the members of theConstituent Assembly should be rec msidered, regard beinghod to the considerations set  out above.(b) If a Federal Government of Western Germany is set up,it is essential to emphasise with all solemnity that theintention of the three powers is not to modify in the slightestdegree its present status as regards disarmament anddemilitarisation.      That is an  essential    precaution to betaken with regard to Germany herself and in the face of Sovietreactions.      The London  conversations hove so far made no progress in this respect.
ANNEX  &apos;C&apos;REPORT BY THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOMMSITAR^^YJRNORSPurpose of the report. The Military Governors have been asked to report on theprobable reaction of the Russians in Germany to the announcementof decisions reached in London,  and also on the reaction of theGermans to a possible postponement of the political programme.They wore also asked to say what counter measures eould betoken to deal with possible Soviet reactions.Soviet Reactions2. The United States and United Kingdom Military Governorsore agreed that,  among the various measures discussed and proposed in London,  the following ore likely to draw Sovietreaction,  in the order in which they are given:-(a)    A meeting of Foreign Ministers to discuss germany in the absence of the Soviet.(b)    The announcement of on international control organisation for the RUHR,  including the benelux countries, but excluding the Soviet.(e)    The establishment of a German Government,  particularly if it claimed to be the government for all Germany.(d) Separate financial reform for the Western Zones,particularly if it were extended to the western sectors of BERLIN.3. The form which Soviet reaction might take is considered to be -(i)    Intensification of pressure to compel the western allies to leave Berlin.(ii)    Increased political agitation and industrialsabotage in Western Germany.(iii)    Military measures leading to war.a,. The Soviet will also react by taking correspondingmeasures in their zone and in BERLIN,  i.e.  they will set up 0German Government and a separate currency.5. The United States ond United Kingdom Military Governorsare agreed that Soviet action under paragraph 3  (i) above islikely to take place without any further provocation, but wouldcertainly be accelerated by any one of the steps,   paragraph 2  (a)(d) above, whenever they are token.6- The United States and United Kingdom Military Governorsore agreed that a decision by the Soviet to make war on theWestern Allies might be influenced, but will not be exclusivelydetermined,  by what happens in Germany.      They do not considerthat 0 short  postponement of the announcement of the Londondecisions, nor the announcement 01  these decisions by stagesinstead of ail together,  would affect the Soviet decision in this
178regard,  except that such postponement might well he interpreted as an indication of western weakness and thus in fact lead&apos;to an intensification of pressure.7. The United States and United Kingdom Military Governorsagree that the form in which the London decisions arecommunicated to the Soviet and to the world at large is very important.      As regards the Soviet it is desirable that the presentation should respect correct procedures and bo as littleprovocative as possible.      As regards the world at large,including Germany itself, it is essential that the western allies should demonstrate their desire for ultimate Germanunity and for ultimate agreement with the Soviet.      they suggest that the communique be transmitted to the soviet ambassador in London in sufficient time for transmission tohis Government prior to public release.      They suggest further that he be advised that his Government will be further informedToy the respective Governments when these Governments have considered the recommendations of the Conference,  so that theSoviet Government may determine if it desires its zone ofGermany to be included in the provisions.      They suggest that further information other than that contained in the communiquebo withheld from the Germans until the; Military Governors meetw i 1; h t he Mini s t o r-P re si dent s.German Reactions8. The United States and United Kingdom Military Governorsare agreed that the arrangements which have been made for theGerman administration of the Bizonal area are inadequate to assure the successful participation of the Bizonal area in theEuropean Recovery Plan.      Moreover,  the Germans regard these arrangements as transitory and even the measure of support whichthey give them at present will progressively deteriorate until an announcement is made regarding the establishment of a GermanGovernment to take the  place of present  arrangements.      a postponement of this announcement may,  therefore,   produce chaosin the Bizonal area.      They further consider that every delay inthe grant of governmental authority to the Germans in the Bizonalarea increases the danger of Communist infiltration by prolonging the general feeling of apathy and depression.      Many Germans will feel that it is hopeless to base hopes for their future upon such indecisive powers and that they will do better to throw intheir lot with the one power which knows its mind and has the courage to declare its intentions.9. The United States and United Kingdom Military Governorsagree that a majority of Gorman opinion in the Western zonesdesires the establishment of a German Government,  even though atpresent it must of necessity exclude the Eastern zone and BERLIN.10. The United States and United Kingdom Military Govern rshave v&apos;0 fresh proposals to make regarding counter-measures todeal %: th Soviet reactions.      The three military governors havealready agreed on such measures as can be taken with the resources available to them.
