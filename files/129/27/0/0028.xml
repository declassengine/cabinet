CM)  1U3 OOPY NO.12TB JUNE s   iqu8CABINET .PENSIONS FOR THE WIDOWS. ORPHANS AND dependants of, CIVIL SERVANTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will have seen the memorandum onthis question (L.P. (I4.8) J4.9) which the Lord President&apos;sCommittee thought that the Cabinet should consider.      (Acopy of the memorandum annexed to L.P.(/L)8) h9 is attached).It- may be convenient if I indicate my conclusions on thetwo points (retrospective application and extension of benefits to dependants)  to which I have been, giving further thought.2.      Retrospect-ion.      To confine the benefits of the schemeto Civil Servants on the active list at a current date would,In my view, create too many hard cases.      On the other hand-unlimited retrospection would give rise not- only to administrative difficulties but to a severe practical problem.To secure the benefits of the scheme a man who has retiredmust repay one-third of the lump sum paid  to him on retirementmd If the possibility of entering the scheme is given tothose who retired a considerable time ago,   the administrative difficulties of collecting the lump sum and of dealing with applications to forego  the repayment or to post-pone it willbe Increased.5. I suggest,  therefore,  that the option to enter thescheme should cover both those in the Service, i.e.  those not yet formally retired when the Bill is introduced and thosewho,  having been established Civil Servants but- having retiredbefore the introduction of the Bill, were in Civil Serviceemployment at any time between V.E. day and its introduction.If.. The financial effect of this measure of retrospect-ioncannot be estimated with any reasonable precision.      It isimpossible to guess how many of those eligible will choose toenter the scheme, or the average cost when they do.      But theannual cost- at- its peak,  and it will only last for a few years,could not conceivably reach a. total which would make it aserious factor in deciding the right course to take.      Ishould emphasise that the ultimate overall cost of the scheme will not in any way be effected by this measure ofretrospect-ion,  the only effect of which will be to cause thecurve of the additional cost of superannuation resulting fromthe scheme to rise earlier than would otherwise be the case.In the immediate future the Exchequer would benefit- in viewof the additional part lump sums that would be repaid.5.     Extension of the scheme to dependants.    The scheme putforward in the Annex to L.P.Th8) h9 was of benefit solely to
married men in the Civil Service and I feel sure that thispoint   would not be overlooked by the advocates of equal pay,v/ho would say that by this measure the discrepancy in the&quot;treatment of the two sexes was being still further increased.My first inclination was to suggest that married women shouldbe treated exactly in the same way as married men.      This wouldmean,  of course, that all future married women in the CivilService would automatically be obliged to come under the schemeand,  as a result, to have their lump sums on retirement reducedby one-third for the benefit of their widowers whether or notthe latter were dependent on their earnings.     Prom soundingswhich I have taken I have no doubt that such a course would be firmly opposed by the general body of women in the CivilService.k* On the other hand it would be reasonable to admitmarried women to the scheme on the same terms as married menbut only in respect of husbands dependent on their earnings.That, however, would only cover a very small number of womenCivil Servants and having introduced the concept that it is reasonable to provide for dependants,  I feel that we might aswell extend this provision to cover the case of single persons responsible for the support of a dependent relative.7* I  propose,&apos; therefore,  that single persons of eithersex (since, clearly, we cannot differentiate in favour of thespinsters alone) should be allowed to nominate a dependentrelative to receive the same benefits proposed for widows.      Onlyrelatives in close blood relationship would be admitted anddependency would have to be proved.A tentative scheme has been drafted but as this hasto provide for a number of contingencies,  it is too complicatedto submit to my colleagues at this stage.      I hope, however, thatthey will approve the idea in principle.      They will, of course,have a further opportunity to discuss the detailed provisionswhen they see the draft Bill and the draft Regulations made there under.3. The cost of this extension of the.scheme to coverdependants cannot be estimated since there is no means ofguessing how many Civil Servants will wish to participate.      Butin all probability the number who will opt in will be small andthe cost is likely to be almost negligible.9. Application to the Foreign Service;    The foreign secretary has indicated his hope that the scheme will be approved and has added that,  in his view,  it is very desirablethat it should also be applied in the Foreign Service.      I neednot say that I should,  of course, wish the scheme to cover theForeign as well as the Home Service and this will be made plainin the Bill.10. The scheme as a whole is,  in my view,  a much neededattempt to remedy a defect in our present system.      The CivilService is definitely a worse employer in this respect than aconsiderable body of other&quot;employers. .   Admittedly, someof the jther public services have similar defects in theirsystems.      On such service,  the National Health Service,  hasintroduced a widows&apos;  scheme and I do not think that the CivilService should continue to lag behind.      I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will aoprove my plans in principle, including rayintention in regard to retrospection and the extension of thescheme&apos;&apos;to cover dependants.Treasury Chambers,  8.W.1.12th June,  19U8.
THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT- ANNEXPensions for the Widows and Orphans of Civil Servants and anImprovement in the Pensions of Those Retired through Ill-Healthafter Short service. A Civil Servant on retirement, whether on grounds of age or ill-health,gets (i) a pension of one-eightieth of his salary at retirement for each year ofservice (subject to a limit of one-half of salary);(ii) a lump sum of three-eightieths of salary on retirement for each year of service (subject to a limit of eighteen months&apos; salary).2.   There is no provision for widows or dependants, except that (i) a lump sum of one year&apos;s salary (or rather more in the case of those with over about 27 years&apos; service) is paid to the estate of a man who dies in harness;(ii) the lump sum referred to in 1 (ii) can be used by a pensioner if he sodecides to make some such provision for his wife;(iii) a Civil Servant on retirement after reaching the age of 60 can, if hepasses a medical test, allocate one-third of his pension to provide apension for his wife.3. Proposals for Widows and Orphans. This paper sets out a scheme toprovide the following pensions for the widows and orphans of Civil Servantswho die while in the Service or after retirement: (i) The widow of a pensioner to receive one-third of her late husband&apos;pension.(ii) The widow of a Civil Servant dying in harness to receive the followingproportionate pension : (a) If he dies before completing 10 years&apos; service nil.(&amp;) If he dies after completing 10, but before completing 20 years&apos;service one-third of his accrued pension which will be fixed on the assumption that he completed 20 years&apos; service,* i.e., the widow will always get at least one-twelfth of her husband&apos;ssalary. The widow&apos;s pension will be subject to a cash minimum of  26 a year if one-twelfth of salary produces less.(c) If he dies after completing 20 years&apos; service one-third of hisaccrued pension.(iii) Orphaned motherless children (as defined for Income Tax purposes) toreceive the following proportion of the pension which the mother wouldhave got had she lived : First child : one-half the mother&apos;s pension.Second child : one-quarter the mother&apos;s pension.Third child : one-quarter the mother&apos;s pension.No additional pension would be paid for children in excess ofthree.(iv) A widow left with children (as defined for Income Tax purposes) toreceive an addition of one-quarter of her pension for each such childup to a maximum of four.The widow of a Civil Servant v. ho dies whilst still in the service would continue to receive also a lump sum payment as in 1 (ii), but theamount of this would be reduced (see paragraph 5).Examples of the benefits payable under this scheme are set out in Appendix I.* The minimum pension will be subject to a proviso that the pension (whether in issue orused as the basis of calculation for the widow&apos;s pension) will not exceed one-eightieth x thenumber of years of continuous service which the individual:dual could have completed by age 65 had he continued to serve until that age.35410 b
4 It is also part of the scheme to increase the pensions and lump sums to civil Servants retired on ill-health grounds after only short sermce.-No change is proposed for those who have done less than 10 or more than 20 5-ears service.Those who have done less than 10 years&apos; service will continue to receive nopension. Those who have done more than 20 years&apos; service will continue toreceive pension and lump sum based on their years of service. It is proposedhowever that those who have served more than 10 but less than 20 years shouldreceive pension and lump sum of the amount which they would have receivedif they had completed 20 years&apos; serviced5. Consequential adjustments in existing superannuation benefits for thosecoming under the scheme. In return for the additional benefits proposed inparagraphs 3 and 4, the lump sums paid under the existing code to pensioners,including those retired on ill-health grounds, and to widows would be reducedby one-third.   In future, therefore t(i) a pensioner on retirement would get two-eightieths of his salary foreach year&apos;s service with a maximum of 12 months&apos; salary;t (ii) the death gratuity paid to the widow would be reduced to two-eightiethsof salary for each year&apos;s service or nine months&apos; salary, whichever isthe greater;t(iii) those retired on ill-health grounds would get, in addition to pension,a lump sum of two-eightieths of salary for each year&apos;s service or nine months&apos; salary, whichever is the greater.6. Cost of these proposals. The institution of widows&apos; pensions, includingbenefits for children and the guarantee of a minimum, pension and lump sum tothose retired on account of ill-health before completing 20 years of service,will increase the cost of Civil Service pensions. But the cost of thosepensions will simultaneously be reduced by the proposed reduction in theexisting lump sum payments to pensioners and the death gratuities to widows.It is proposed that the new scheme should be applied compulsorily to new entrantswho marry, but that existing Civil Servants should have the option of retainingtheir existing rights or coming under the new scheme. It would not, of course,apply retrospectively to existing pensioners or widows. In the earlier years theresult (assuming that existing Civil Servants opt to come in under the new scheme in reasonable numbers) will be to reduce overall the cost of Civil Service pensions,since the effect of the reduction in the lump sum payments will be greater thanthe additional benefits proposed. Eventually, as the number of widows on the pension roll increases and ultimately reaches relative stability, there will be an overall increase in the cost of Civil Service pensions by about 15 per cent, of thetotal cost of pensions and lump sum paid to men.On the present size and salary levels of the established Civil Service the costin a generation would reach some  3-25 million.!7. Why the widows&apos; scheme is necessary. The present arrangementssummarised in paragraph 2 have two severe defects : (i) Pensioners. The man who survives to retire in sufficiently good health to pass the doctor can make reasonably good provision for his wifeby allocating part of his pension to her. But the man who retiresin broken health cannot allocate. Knowing that he is likely to die soonand that his wife is likely to survive him, he has the added miseryof knowing that his pension will cease at his death and his widowwill have no income other than that which can be provided from thesmall capital sum which he receives on retirement.(ii) Deaths in harness. The widow of the man who dies during his working life is, as a rule, even worse off. She also gets no pension, and the lump sum paid as death gratuity is as small as one year&apos;s pay in allcases where service does not exceed 27 years; even in long-service cases it cannot exceed 18 months&apos;salary. 0If such a widow has young children or for other reasons cannotgo out to work, she must depend on any Life Insurance her husbandhas been able to afford, and after that on the Social Service system* See footnote to page 1.t The maximum of forty-eightieths (U., 12 months&apos; pay) applies to all of these paymentst    Vw-l^I *ha\;vhlle the slzeA of the Civil Service will fall in the future, the &quot;proportionof established staff will increase.   As a result the figure of cost might in time rise above 8-25 million, towards an outside maximum of  4-5 million. aDove
supplemented by private charity. The calls of the Civil ServiceBenevolent Fund which the Fund can only meet to a very liaaaiteiextent shows that serious hardship is caused by the absence off awidows&apos; scheme.As will be shown later (see also Appendix II) other comparableemployments (the Coal Board, and the other public boards if they ffollowits example, private industry, and the Armed Forces so far as^Gmeeisare concerned) provide widows&apos; pensions for the widows off their employees. The pensions provided give more adequate protection thanthe lump sums and allocation arrangements in the Civil Sendee code.In many cases the provision made is more generous by a considerable extent. It is submitted, therefore, that the Civil Sendee (and thelocal government and teaching service, who would clearly have to adapttheir schemes to come in line with the Civil Service scheme) lags behindoutside practice and that something should be done to remedy thisdiscrepancy.8. It may be asked : Why have a Civil Service scheme for widows -amdorphans when widows, and orphans are now looked after under the natim/alscheme fThe answer to this question is that the national scheme provides a hareminimum sufficient, but no more, to keep a widow or orphan from public assistance.Something beyond this is due to Civil Servants. Virtually every large employerof black-coated workers in the country thinks it right to have a scheme whichwill provide for the widows of its employees a supplementary pension over and above that provided in the national scheme. Subject in certain cases to overridingmaxima, the great majority of these schemes base the provision for widows andchildren on the husband&apos;&quot;s earnings at the time of his death. Flat rate pensions for widows or children are less common.9. Why not a contributory scheme ?It may be suggested that if the aim is to bring the Civil Service in line withoutside employments then the Civil Service should introduce a contributory sehemnewhich is the kind of scheme adopted by most outside employers.Quite apart from the difficulties of grafting a contributory scheme on to thenon-contributory scheme for retirement pensions which has formed the basis off theCivil Service code since its inception, we know that the Staff Side are adamantlyopposed to any contributory scheme. They say that on their existing pay CivilServants cannot afford any further deductions. Their obligation to pay their national Insurance contribution (without any corresponding benefit apart from national Health benefit) will be quite hard enough. Any further tax could onlybe met by corresponding increases in pay.10. Should the children&apos;s benefits be proportionate to the father&apos;s salary or should they be at flat rate ?It is suggested that they ought to be on the proportionate basis. The basisof our approach is that the provision made should be such as to prevent too suddena drop of standards in the way of life of the deceased&apos;s family. This can onlybe assured by a proportionate award and not by a fiat rate.11. What is the need for providing (as proposed in paragraph 4) a minimumpension for those retired before they have completed 20 years&apos; service fThe people who suffer most under the existing system are those retired on ill-health grounds before they have completed 20 years&apos; service. A man who has done 12 years&apos; service gets 12/80ths of his salary which, in the nature of things,will not be very great at this point in his career. Thus, a clerk suffering from some grave illness who has retired on a salary of  400 will get a pittance off  60a year on which to keep himself and his family.It is relevant that the new National Health Service Pension scheme inelndesthis minimum provision for those who retire on ill-health before completing20 years&apos; service.12. Will there be any repercussions on other pension schemes in the pmMiteservicesfIf the scheme proposed is approved there would undoubtedly be repereussions.The local government and teachers&apos; superannuation schemes also make no provision35440 b 2
for widows and, in both eases, there will be a demand for comparable arrangements to be made. Both schemes are contributory and it may be that the staffs concerned will claim that they could not pay any increase in the employees&apos; contribution,to make provision for widows. It is impossible to estimate with accuracy what might be the additional cost involved if comparable benefits were introduced inthese services, but a rough indication is given by the fact that these servicestogether contain about two and a half times as many men as the Civil Service.Even ii mo part of the cost of similar benefits in these services were to be borneby the employees, it would of course fall in part on the rates and not wholly onthe Exchequer.There would also be demands from the staff employed in the National health service scheme for their widows&apos; pension scheme to be brought in line with theCivil Service scheme. The National Health Service Staff scheme has no widow&apos;sTmrnrmTwn of  26 (as proposed in paragraph 3 (ii) (6)) and no chiidren&apos;s benefits.Moreover, the lump sums paid on retirement or death are calculated at one-eightieth per year of service instead of the  ?z?0-eightieths proposed for the CivilService. The National Health Service Staff scheme is contributory. It is calcu-laied that to add these benefits would be equivalent to an addition to the combinedcontributions of employers and employees of a further 1 per cent, of salary.The Armed Forces will point out that the Civil Service widow will in anumber of cases get more than the widow of the corresponding rank in theForces. The disparity will not be very great and, in any case, the widow in the armed Forces has the advantage that the same pension is given to her irrespective of the length of her husband&apos;&quot; s service. In the Civil Service it is true that thosewho die in receipt of comparatively high salaries after comparatively long service will do better than their opposite numbers in the Forces; but those who die earlywith a few years&apos; service and a low salary will do worse. The other repercussionin the Armed Forces will come from the other ranks who at present have no pensionassured to them at all. It is clearly impracticable to assess how far it will bepossible to resist demands for improvements and what the cost of concessionsmight be if they had to be made. At the very worst, if we had to apply the wholeof the Civil Service scheme principles to the Armed Forces the cost would be some  2-5 million to  3 million.It is relevant to the question of adding this further expenditure to that already incurred on pensions for these Services, that the pensions of all new entrants to them are being reduced by the amount of the National insurance pension.^ In the case of the Civil Service the result will be a saving which willaccrue wholly to the Exchequer. It will not, of course, begin to accrue for manyyears, but it is expected to amount ultimately to something of the order of  10million.APPENDIX IExAiiPLEs of Benefits under the Proposed scheme a.

(v) Permanent Secretary retires on lump sum of  3,500 and pension of  1,750and dies leaving widow.Widow gets pension of  583 per annum.APPENDIX IIComparison with other Comparable EmploymentsLocal Government and Teachers.-In local government the widow gets thereturn of her husband&apos;s contributions to his retirement pension with compoundinterest thereon.   The widow of a teacher who dies, after more than five years service gets one year&apos;s salary.Clearly both these professions would have to come into line with any new scheme for the Civil Service. At the moment their schemes are equally unsatis-factory.The Armed Forces. The Armed Forces provide widows&apos; pensions on twoscales : (a) where the man&apos;s death is attributable to his service;(b) where it is not so attributable.The true comparison lies with the latter. Widows&apos; pensions are given on a flat rate irrespective of the length of service and whether the man is still servingor has gone into retirement on half-pay. The amounts at present range from 30 a year for a Warrant Officer, Class I, rising to  100 a year for a Coloneland  225 for a full General. These amounts are likely to be increased so thatthe Warrant Officer&apos;s widow would get  55 and the full General^ widow  300a year. These pensions are supplemented by flat-rate grants in respect of childrenranging from  10 to  16 amounts which are likely to be increased to the scale 18 to  24. It should be noted that no non-attributable pensions are given toother ranks.The Coal Board. The Coal Board has a voluntary contributory schemewhich secures a widow one-quarter of her husband&apos;s pension or one-quarter ofhis accrued pension, whilst a flat rate of  50 a year is paid for each child under 18.Private Industry. There are still a certain number of non-contributoryschemes which assure small flat-rate pensions to the widows of employees ranging from  50 to  90 a year. Others are nominally contributory involving annualpremiums of from 1 gn. to 4 gns. a year and these secure flat-rate pensions for widows ranging from  125 to  150 a year. The majority of schemes arecontributory and the average result is to secure a pension of something likeone-quarter of salary at death if still in service or one-quarter of pension ifretired. But in nearly all these cases a maximum is set to the amount of pension payable and this is fixed pretty low, an average maximum being some  200 a year.Other industrial schemes involve ingenious adaptation of whole life policies and produce a widow&apos;s pension for the junior employee about equal to his actualsalary, and for the most senior and highly paid employees a much smaller pro-portion of his salary.   A maximum of  1,000 pension is fixed
