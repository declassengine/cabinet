S E..C RET COPY NO.-&quot;-    iCP. 0+8)  U+21+th June., 191+8*CABINETELECTORAL SYSTEMS IN WESTERN germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs when my colleagues discussed my memorandum (C. P. (1+8)  131+)on the progress of the informal talks on Germany which haverecently taken place in London I undertook (CM. (1+8) 31+th conclusions, Minute 2) to circulate a  paper on the possibility of ensuring the adoption of an electoral system in Western germany which would not lead to the excessive fragmentation of politicalparti es.2. I now circulate for the information of my colleagues amemorandum on this subject  prepared by the Research Departmentof the Foreign Office.3. This memorandum makes two main points clear, namely:-(a) That electoral laws and machinery are a matter for theindividual Parliaments of the Laender (States) and thatit is therefore neither desirable nor possible toensure that one particular system is adopted throughoutWestern Germany.      I consider this to be an essential feature of our policy of encouraging politicaldecentralisation in Germany.(b) That the electoral systems of oil but one of the Laenderin the Western Zones alreaa.;.- include safeguards againstsplinter parties, and that in this respect the british zone is considerably in advance of the others.I am therefore satisfied that under present conditions no further action is required by the British authorities in this respect.E.B.Foreign Office,  S.W.-11+th June,  191+8.,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S&quot; GOVERNMENT)
annex memorandum on the Electoral Systems in theWestern Zones of germany the fall of the Weimar Republic was due to far deepercauses than the electoral system.      There were however threeserious weaknesses in the Weimar electoral system and we have tried to avoid these in rebuilding the British Zone.2c. First and by far the most important of these weaknesseswas the absence of safeguard against splinter parties. This madea two-party or a three-party system impossible.3* Secondly,  the constituencies were far too large toallow personal contact between the member and his constituent.Each electoral area averaged nearly 2,000,000 inhabitants.    Also,voters could not express a preference for individuals but had to&apos;accept the lists drawn up by parties.h. Thirdly, and in part because of the&apos;second vi/eakness,each party developed a machine more highly centralised than anything we know in Great Britain. This machine developedauthoritarian habits, and tended to crush the individualityof the deputy or the member.5. The Weimar electoral system was already being criticised by democrats before Hitler came to power.      Since the fall of the nazis, Germans in- all three Western Zones have been anxious to correct at least some of the Weimar weaknesses.      Reform has gone furthest in the British Zone, and least far in the french zone.6. Electoral laws have now been drawn up by each individual Land (state)  in the three Zones.      They represent a variety of combinations between the two basic systems of directindividual election and proportional representation.      In caseswhere elements of both systems are present,  the first system is generally referred to as the &quot;Diet List11 and the second asthe &quot;Reserve List&quot;*      The    electoral laws and machinery are within the competence of the individual Laender and there islised electoral system.7, The Appendix gives a tabular comparison of the positionin the three Western Zones,  excluding the cities of Hamburg and bremen.      The system in the Russian Zone is not described indetail.      It is very like that of Weimar except thatconstituencies tend to be somewhat smaller,  and Communistpressure is making candidates and voters eligible at a youngerage.      Electoral machinery in. the Soviet Zone,  and indeed thewhole facade of government,  is unimportant compared with the mechanism of communist totalitarian pressure.8. Safeguards against splinter parties have been adoptedby all-three Laender (States) in the British Zone,  all threein the United States Zone,  and two out of the three Laender inthe French Zone.      The usual method is to exclude fromrepresentation any party which fails to secure a certainpercentage (5% or 10%) of all the votes cast in the State orin a certain area of it.      Alternatively,  a party may^be .excluded from receiving seats on the Reserve List if it fails uosecure a single seat by direct election in a constituency.This second method has-eliminated two small parties in Schleswig-Holstein and left a Landtag (Diet) with two large and one small
party*      The other two Laender in the British Zone have morelenient provisions.      In the United States Zone, Bavaria hasimposed a 10% qualifying limit and thus excluded the Communistsfrom representation although another small party has managed to qualify.      The two largest parties,  the Christian Democrats andthe Social Democrats, who between them command about 73L/0 of the votes cast in Western Germany, are unlikely to weaken in theirattitude to splinter parties.9* It is above all in the British Zone that personalcontact &quot;between the constituent and the candidate has been increased.      Throughout the British Zone,  constituencies havebeen reduced to about the size of British constituencies.      About60% of seats are allotted by direct election of a single candidateIn the constituencies, there being no &quot;party list&quot; to which thevoter must rigidly subscribe.      The remaining members are elected on Reserve Lists at Land level.      Constituencies are reasonablysmall also in two out of the three United States Zone Laender,and in one of the three French Zone Laender.      Fixed listshowever are still the rule in the United States and French Zonebaender, except in Bavaria where one-member constituencies arethe rule.10. The third weakness of the Weimar system was that itfavoured an authoritarian party machine.      The Social DemocratParty is again showing a strong tendency in this direction andthe other parties raigat do so if they were not hampered by internal discord.      It is unlikely that the tendency can bemuch reduced by operating on the electoral system, but post-warinnovations have worked in the right direction.&apos;     The greater the number of candidates elected by direct majority,   thegreater Is the influence of the individual member against his .party machine.      In the British Zone the proportion of such members is new 60%, compared with zero before 1933.      In theother Western Zones direct majority election does not exist,&quot;out certain Laender have something very like it,  and all threeUnited States Zone Laender and one of the three French ZoneLaender show a great advance on Weimar in this respect.11. With regard to the principle of proportional representation, Schleswig-Holstein has an electoral system whichhas yielded a Diet in which the majority party (Social Democrats)has secured a far greater proportion of seats than of votes.The system itself would not necessarily always have such a result.In all the ether eight Laender of the Western Zones the representation of the parties in the Diet accords more or lesswith the proportion of votes received.      The accord is complete in Lower Saxony, but the majority part./ in North Rhine-Westphalia,the Christian Democrats,  have benefited slightly by their success in the direct elections.12. Only in the British Zone has strong influence beenexerted en the Germans to amend their traditional views on the electoral system, which were in the main based on the principleof proportional representation.      Even there,  the pressureconcentrated only on one point, namely,  the strength of the element of direct majority election, and on this German views were far from unanimous.      Since the elections in the British andthe united States Zones, the two great parties have been able to observe the benefits of direct majority election,  and powerfulvoices have been raised on both sides,  in both the Zones,  infavour of a greater measure of direct majority election than atpresent- prevails.Research Department,,Foreign Office.Jun e, IQhS.

The leadingcandidate is not necessarilyelected because, first,candidates may stand in morethan one constituency and,secondly, the local successof a splinter party may beswept away.Hesse: 6 candidates areelected for each 15 constituencies-uencies.     The votes receivedby each party throughout theState are first added and onthe basis of this there is calculated the total numberof seats to be allotted to each party.     A Reserve Listat Land level exists, in casea successful party has not put up enough candidates in the constituencies.     The totalsare not necessarily thosewhich would result from pureP.R.(i) Rhineland-Palatinate:   Thereare 5 constituencies, formed by the Regierungsbezirtce,which elect respectively y\.,8, 13, 13 and 35 members,making 100 in all.     As inHesse, the total votesreceived by each Partythroughout the State arefirst added, in order todecide the allocation of seats.     It is then calculatedhow many seats must be allotted to each party ineach constituency.     there seems no provision for aReserve List at Land level,but parties are allowed tosubmit in the- constituenciestwice as many names as thereare seats available.(ii) So Baden:    60 members areelected on the P.R. system.Some accounts say that thewhole Land constitutes onedistrict, others that thereare 12 constituencies.Voting is for fixed lists.

This hasexcluded from the Diet the communists, the FreeDemocrat Party and the Con-servative Party who gotrespectively h,*5%, h-9c/o and3.1% of votes at the April19h7 election.(ii) N. Rhine-Westphalia: no party can gain a seat on theReserve List unless it hassecured 5% of all votes in theLand.    The relative mildness ofthis provision permitted theCentre Party, which had securedonly 2 seats by direct election,to acquire on additional 18 onthe Reserve List.    The FreeDemocratic Party (Liberal) gained12 seats on the Reserve Listwithout having a single seat by direct election:    in Schleswig-Holstein they would have beenwiped out.(iii) Lower Saxony: Some provision as N. Rhine-Westphalia, but thecondition is allowed to-lapse ifthe party secures one seat by direct election.    In April 19h7this leniency had as a resultthat the Communists secured 5%of scats while in Scfileswig-Holstein with a hardly lowerproportion of votes they received no seat at all.(b) All Laender: No party can .secure any seats unless itreceives at least a certainproportion of votes cast,either in the Land as a wholeor in a certain area.(i) Bavaria: A party must secureat least 10% of the votes in atleast one electoral area (wohl-kreis? of which there are 5, corn-pared with 180 constituencies).This provision has excluded the communists, who got 5.6f0 of allvotes, from the Diet, but has given the Free Democrat Party(Liberal);, which got 5*h% of allvotes, 5% of seats in the Diet.(ii) Hesse: A party must secureat least 5% of all votes in.  the State.    This has not excluded any existing party.(iii) Wuer11emberg-Baden: A partymust secure at least 5% of allvotes in the State.
