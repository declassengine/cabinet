(48) 14510^ June, 1948CABINETIRON AND STEEL bill memorandum by the Minister of supply at the meeting of the Cabinet on 7th June (CM. (48) 36th Conclusions,Minute 4) I was invited to submit a further paper setting out the arguments fornationalising the iron and steel industry. My colleagues will appreciate thatin my previous paper (CP. (48) 123) I was mainly concerned with explaining the principal features of the Bill which the Cabinet had authorised me to prepare.It did not appear to me that I was called upon to state the arguments in favourof the Cabinefs decision, of October last year, to nationalise the industry. I did,however, feel it desirable, in order to prevent our propaganda starting off onthe wrong foot, to mention that our case primarily rests on the need for taking this important basic industry out of the realm of private profit-making into public ownership rather than on grounds of any present inefficiency in theindustry&apos;s management. There is, on the other hand, no doubt that if theindustry in pre-war years had been willing and able to pursue a progressivepolicy of expansion and modernisation, it would to-day be in a better positionto deal with the production problems that beset it and to lower the costs ofmanufacture.2. It seems to me that broadly the grounds on which we can justify our decision to nationalise this industry now (apart from the many firm pledges whichhave been given) are these : (a) Iron and steel are basic commodities on which the whole prosperity of1 our country depends. The industry has developed into a great poweragglomeration whose leaders wield an immense influence over the welfare of the nation. They are governed as they are bound tobe) *more by the profit motive than by the public interest. Duringthe whole or the pre-war period they indulged in the usual big businessdevices of cartel arrangements, restrictive practices and similar measures designed to safeguard their capital. It would be whollywrong to leave the future of this industry in the same private handsas controlled it before the war. .(6) The profits earned by the industry during the war and post-war years have, it is true, enabled it to accumulate funds and credit which maybe sufficient for the immediate post-war expansion programme; and,largely in order to give the Government no ground for nationalisation,it has been ready to submit itself to a wide measure of government control on such matters as the increased output drive, location ofnew plants, limitation of dividends, and the operation of the allocationschemes. But we are, in fact, dependent in all these matters on thegood will of Steel House. Any sudden change of fortune in theindustry would put the country&apos;s interests entirely at its mercy.35477
(c) Although the industry may be able to finance its present expansion scheme,it is doubtful whether it will be willing, or able, to finance the further expansion schemes which will be necessary to provide for ourselves and the Colonies the steel required in the next ten or twenty years.The steel owners are bound in the interests of their shareholders to refrain from taking risks and it is therefore unlikely that they will want to expand capacity beyond the point where they can be certain of selling their products profitably, particularly as new plant forthis industry is exceedingly costly. Even if the industry were preparedto finance further expansions, it could only do so on condition thatit remained a monopoly, protected by the State against competitionat home or from abroad a condition which we could not accept.Moreover the application of such a large proportion of our national resources to a single industry cannot properly be left to privateinitiative.   The responsibility must rest on the State.(d) Under single public ownership there will be infinitely better prospects of effecting rationalisation, elimination of wasteful competition and proper industrial planning than under the present diversified private ownership. It is obvious that as long as plants remain private pro-perty rationalisation must be at the mercy of the whims and prejudicesof the individual owners and it is impossible to force on them agreater measure of social planning than they choose to accept.(e) During the war. when the survival of the country was at stake, the ironand steel industry was necessarily subjected to a comprehensivecontrol. We are now entering a long period of equally strenuousstruggle for survival in which it is just as necessary that this industry should be wholly responsive to the national interests.It has been urged that, for this purpose, a control system wrouldbe as effective as ownership. But permanent control would involve- continuous conflicts between the State and the private owners. Itwould subject the control machinery to constant stresses and strainswhich, at best, could only result in compromises and a serious impair-ment of the whole structure. Moreover, the controllers would haveto depend on the advice of directors and managements whose firstloyalty would be to private shareholders and not the country. Further,no control system can force private interests to spend money it doesnot want to spend. There were many examples of this during thewar when it was found that statutory controllers were unable to securethe necessary production and the State was finally forced to buy outthe private interests.(/) Once the need for nationalisation is accepted, it is plainly desirable, from every point of view, that the change-over should take&apos;place as quickly as possible. Although the fear of nationalisation may temporarilymake an industry amenable to Government influence, it is, neverthe-less, unhealthy that its personnel should remain for long in a stateof uncertainty. Moreover, it is easier and will create less disturbanceto effect the change-over at a time when the industry is prosperousthan at a time when it is involved in economic difficulties.3. Attractive as it appears at first sight to state our case in a White Paperissued before the Second Reading, I hold the view that it would be a tacticalmistake to do so. Our arguments are, of necessity, highly controversial, particu-larly those concerning the pre-war history of the industry where we are at aspecial disadvantage. While we know our case is sound, the leaders of theindustry alone possess the full evidence and could no doubt put up a plausiblereply to our indictment. The time gap between the issue of the White paper and the Second Reading would be devoted to an attack by the Opposition on theWhite Paper, and, when we came to debate the Bill in the House, we would find ourselves on the defensive.Moreover, it seems to me that the purpose of a White Paper is to lay factsor broad statements of Government policy before Parliament and the public. Inthis case we would be setting out arguments. This would not only be tacticallyunwise, but would create a dangerous precedent. I propose to make a fullsummary of the contents of the Bill in the Explanatory and Financial Memoran-dum, attached to it, and to take all steps available, such as discussion at the PartyMeeting and a conference with the Lobby correspondents on the day the Bill
is issued, to ensure as far as possible that our ease, in broad terms, is fullystated to our supporters and the public.4. In conclusion I would remind the Cabinet of the summary of points on the Bill to which I sought their authority in paragraph 39 of CP. (48) 123.These are (a) Scheme C 85 companies.(b) Firms outside the schedule not to have an option to be acquired.(c) Wide powers for the Corporation.(d) Representative bodies to be informed of the outline as embodying fixedGovernment policy.G.
