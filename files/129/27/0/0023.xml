ANNEX AAssociation of the Benelux Countries in Policy regarding GermanyReply of the Lnited States, United Kingdom and French Delegation to theRepresentatives of the Benelux Countries, as approved at the Meeting on 6th March, 1948. .The representatives of the Benelux Governments have asked about their future participation in inter-Allied discussions relating to Germany.2. The United States, United Kingdom and French Governments, in reply,wish to state that it is their intention to invite the representatives of the BeneluxGovernments to take part in a similar way in any joint discussions on germany which may be held in similar circumstances to the present meeting. In addition,they will keep this question under review and take opportunity to exchange viewson developments and prospects through the ordinary channels.3. The United States, United Kingdom and French Governments continueto recognise, as they have hitherto done, the just claims of the Benelux Govern-ments to be associated with future four-Power deliberations on the preparation ofthe German Peace Treaty. They will, as far as lies within their power, further, this claim at the appropriate time, having in mind particularly the claims of othercountries for similar association.4. The Benelux Governments have asked to be consulted on matters affectingthe government of Western Germany and the implementation of important decisions. The United States, United Kingdom and French Governments realise the importance for the Benelux countries of such matters as may affect the vital interests of the Benelux countries, and they therefore are prepared to consider a form of consultation that in a practical way might meet their wishes. The UnitedStates, United Kingdom and French Governments, however, do not feel that theycan commit themselves to consult the Benelux Governments before taking action,irrespective of its nature, which they may regard as necessary for the properadministration of their zones. As, however, the United States, United Kingdomand French Governments recognise the interest of the Benelux Governments to bewell informed on these matters, they have asked their Military Governors to make arrangements for a close association with the Benelux representatives in Germany.ANNEX  BProposal for Close Association Between the Military Governors and theRepresentatives of the Benelux Countries in germany in order to give effect to the recommendations of the London discussions ofFebruary-March 1948 respecting a close association between the military governors of the United Kingdom, United States and French Zones and therepresentatives of the Benelux countries in Germany, the following report of a working Party is submitted : 1.. With respect to discussions now being held in Berlin, it was agreed thatthe reports and/or recommendations of the three Military Governors would bemade available to the Benelux representatives at the conclusion of the meetings on those subjects which are of direct interest to them. This will enable the benelux Governments to be adequately informed of the results of the Berlindiscussions before the talks are resumed in London in April of this year.Furthermore, it is noted that the Benelux representatives have expressed theirviews upon the subjects considered by this working party and those relating tothe future political organisation of Western Germany and to the question of safe-guarding the rights of foreign owners of the coal and steel interests in the Ruhr.2. With respect to continuing this co-operation in the future, it was agreedthat for the Bizonal area items pending before the Bipartite Board (of interestto the Benelux countries) would so far as possible be communicated to theirrepresentatives before the meeting of the Board. The Benelux countries wouldthen be able to submit their comments on such items and these could normally be35451 b 2
considered by the Board in the course of its meeting. Furthermore, the representa-tives of the Benelux countries would be immediately informed of decisions takenby the Bipartite Board and would be given the minutes for those items which arenot exclusively of interest to the Board.3. An arrangement similar to that outlined in paragraph 2 above will beput into effect with respect to the French Zone under which. information respect-ing both impending developments and decisions will be communicated to therepresentatives of the Benelux countries.4. With respect to information provided in Frankfurt and Baden-Baden,it is recognised that this should be done through the consular representation ofthe Benelux countries established in those cities.5. For the purpose of assuring a regular contact and for providingbackground information, both on developments in the Bipartite Board and in theFrench Zone, meetings will be held at stated intervals between the respectivePolitical Advisers of the three Military Governments on the one hand and therepresentatives of Benelux countries on the other. Each Political Adviser wouldalso, upon request, arrange for interviews between representatives of the benelux countries and other officials of the respective Military Governments, both in Berlin,Frankfurt and Baden-Baden.12th April, 1948.ANNEX CInternational Control of the RuhrWhereas international security and general economic recovery require :that the resources of the Ruhr shall not in the future be used for the purposeof aggression, but shall be used in the interests of peace;that access to the coal, coke and steel of the Ruhr, which was previouslysubject to the exclusive control of Germany, be in the future guaranteed without discrimination to the countries of Europe co-operating in the common economicgood;Whereas it is desirable for the political and economic welhbeing of thesecountries and a democratic Germany that there be close association of their economic life;Whereas it is important that trade between the countries mentioned in thepreceding paragraph should be facilitated by lowering trade barriers and by anyother means,The Governments of the United States, United Kingdom and France, afterconsultation with the Governments of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg,have agreed as follows : 1. An international control shall be set up in the Ruhr and exercised by anInternational Authority for the Ruhr (hereinafter called the international authority); the International Authority shall be organised forthwith and shallbegin to exercise its functions at a time to be determined by the contracting governments, and, in any case, before the establishment of a provisional GermanGovernment.2.

5. The  unctions of the International Authority shall, subject to existing or future international agreements among the contracting Governmentsconcerning the allocation of coal, coke and steel, be as follows: (a) Subject to the provisions of Article 8 below, to make the division of coal,coke and steel from the Ruhr as between German consumption and export, in order to ensure adequate access to supplies of these products,taking into account the essential needs of Germany.(b) To ensure that the German authorities do not institute, carry out orpermit artificial measures or discriminatory practices which woulddistort the movement of Ruhr coal, coke and steel in international trade,except for measures of protection approved by the international authority.(c) To exercise, in the circumstances envisaged in Article 10 (&amp;) below, thepowers described in Article 9 (5) below.(d) During the period in which the Occupying Powers concerned exercisesupreme authority (which period is hereinafter called &quot; the ControlPeriod&quot;) to bring to the attention of the occupation authorities concerned measures which would ensure, and thereafter itself to ensure,safeguard and protection for coal, coke and steel enterprises in the ruhr involving foreign interests, within the framework of existing or future agreements between the Allied Governments represented onthe Authority.6. (a) The findings of the International Authority under the provisions ofArticle 5 (a) shall be consistent with the programmes of the C.E.E.C. for the recovery of the participating countries.(&amp;) During the Control Period, or until such earlier time as may be agreedupon by the contracting Governments, the findings of the International authority under the provisions of Article 5 (a) will be transmitted to the Military Governorsfor implementation. The Military Governors will proceed with the implement a-tion of these findings : (1) to the extent consistent with any agreements relative to the provision of financial assistance to Germany which are now or may come in effect between any two or more of the Contracting Governments; and (2) inaccordance with the terms of any existing international agreement among the contracting Governments, or extension thereof, with respect to the allocation ofcoal and coke.7.   The International Authority shall have the right (a) to receive regular reports on production, distribution and consumption ofRuhr coal, coke and steel;(b) to demand additional reports on these subjects whenever necessary;(c) to verify the information at its disposal by enquiries on the spot and by -subpoena and examination of witnesses;(d) to call for information about supplies of coal, coke and steel from sourcesother than the Ruhr.8.

If no such international body is set up, these powers shallbe transferred to the Authority but shall be exercised only by the Allied repre-sentatives on the Authority.11. Should the German Government not carry out the decisions of theInternational Authority, the latter may, by a majority vote of the Allied repre-sentatives, find that the German Government is in default on its obligations and recommend, to the occupation authorities during the Control Period, and there-after to the Allied Governments represented on the Authority, the applicationof the necessary enforcement measures, provided, however, that before suchenforcement measures are applied the German Government shall be given areasonable opportunity for a hearing. At the expiry of the Control Period,these enforcement measures shall be applied in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Settlement or any international agreement to which theAllied Governments represented on the Authority are parties.12.

ANNEX EProtection of Foreign Interests1. The Conference recommends that the principle of non-discrimination^against foreign interests in Germany be reaffirmed and that each Governmentshould promptly study the problem of safeguarding foreign interests in orderthat there may be subsequently established as close to 1st September, 1948, aspossible an inter-governmental group to review the question and make recommen-dations to their Governments.2. The Conference agrees that the use of the term &quot; foreign interests &quot; in-paragraph 1 above shall not be held to imply that reciprocity of treatment fromthe foreign countries concerned is not required.3. The Conference recommends that the three Military Governors shouldafford the representatives of the Benelux countries, to the extent consistent withthe maintenance of secrecy regarding monetary reform, opportunity to express their views before any decisions are taken affecting their property interests inGermany.ANNEX FPolitical organisation. The three Military Governors will, not later than 15th June, 1948, calla joint meeting of the Ministers President of the States of their respective zones.2. This meeting will be instructed to examine the boundaries of the severalStates in order to determine, what modifications might be proposed to the military governors. Any such modification will take account of traditional patterns, and avoid, to the extent feasible, the creation of States which are either too large ortoo small in comparison with the other States. The recommendations of theMinisters President, if not disapproved by the Military Governors, will be sub-mitted for approval by the people of the affected areas not later than the choice ofmembers of the Constituent Assembly.3. The meeting of the Ministers President will also be. informed that theyare authorised to convene a Constituent Assembly to be held not later than 1stSeptember, 1948, in order to prepare a Constitution to be ratified by the partici-pating States, to communicate this fact to the various States and to make thenecessary arrangements.4. The delegates to this Constituent Assembly will be chosen in each of theexisting States under such procedure and regulations as shall be adopted by thelegislative body of each of these States.5. The number of delegates from each State will be in the proportion thatits population is to the total population of the participating States. The totalnumber of delegates will be determined by dividing the total population at thelast census by 750,000 or some similar figure as may be recommended by theMinisters President and approved by the Military Governors.6. The Constituent Assembly will draft a democratic Constitution whichwill establish for the participating States a governmental structure of federaltype which is best adapted to the eventual re-establishment of German unity atpresent disrupted, and which will protect the rights of the participating States,provide adequate central authority, and contain guarantees of individual rightsand freedom.7. If the Constitution as prepared by the Constituent. Assembly does not conflict with these general principles the Military Governors will authorise its- submission for ratification. The Constituent Assembly will thereupon be dissolved.The ratification will take place by each participating State by means of a referendum requiring a simple majority of the voters in each State under suchrules and procedure as it may adopt. When the Constitution has been ratified by two-thirds of the States, it will come into force and be binding upon all States.Thereafter, any amendment to the Constitution must be ratified by a like majorityof the States.
8. The Ministers President of the existing States will, prior to the com-pletion of the work of the Constituent Assembly take the necessary steps for theelection of the Assemblies of those States, the boundaries of which have been modified, so that these Assemblies and those of the States, the boundaries ofwhich have not been modified, will be in a position to determine the electoralprocedures and regulations for the ratification of the Constitution as statedin paragraph 7 above.9. Within thirty days following the coming into force of the Constitution,institutions will be established as determined by the Constitution.10. Prior to the convening of the Constituent Assembly, there shall bea determination of the control and administrative powers which the occupyingauthorities intend to retain as regards both the proposed Government of the participating States and the Governments of the States themselves.ANNEX GReorganisation of the Lander(Appendix to Annex F)In connection with the words &quot; affected areas &quot; in paragraph 2 of Annex F,the following method has been agreed for dealing with specific proposals whichmay be put forward by the Ministers President regarding North Rhine/Westphalia : (a) A recommendation to divide the present Land into two Lander, namely,North Rhine and&apos; Westphalia, with boundaries as they were beforethe junction was affected.Method of VotingAll voters in the present Land to be asked to vote for or against.this proposal. If the voters in either one of the two parts, namely,North Rhine and Westphalia, should show a majority in favour ofthe proposed division, that division will take place provided thatthe combined vote in the two parts in favour of division representsat least 33J per cent, of total votes cast.(&amp;) Splitting off that part of North Rhine which lies west of the Rhineand joining it to South Rhine.Method of VotingThe people in the area to be split off to vote.(i) for or against separation from the Land to which they atpresent belong;(ii) for or against junction with South Rhine,(c) Addition of South Rhine to present Land North Rhine/Westphalia.   Tobe vetoed by Military Governors unless other regroupings result in thecreation of comparably large Lander.Note.--Any material increase in the size of Bavaria would constitute a case of this sort.ANNEX HLetter of Advice to Military Governors regarding German Constitution1. The Governments of the three Occupying Powers recognise that thereare several ways in which the decentralised Federal Government provided in annex F can be obtained, and that it is impossible to determine if the Constitutionsatisfies the requirements of a decentralised Federal Organisation until it hasbeen examined in its whole context.However, the three Governments believe that a desirable governmentalstructure for Germany should, to the maximum extent possible, provide : (a) For a bicameral legislative system in which one of the houses mustrepresent the individual States and must have sufficient power tosafeguard the interests of the States.
(b) That the executive must only have those powers which are definitelyprescribed by the Constitution and that emergency powers, if any,of the executive must be so limited as to require prompt legislative or judicial review.(c) That the powers of the Federal Government shall be limited to thoseexpressly enumerated in the Constitution and in any case shall not include education, cultural and religious affairs, Local Governmentand Public Health (except, in this last case, to secure such co-ordination as is essential to safeguard the health of the people inthe several States); that its powers in the field of public welfare belimited to those necessary for the co-ordination of social security measures; that its powers in the police field be limited to thoseapproved during the period of the occupation by the occupying powers* and thereafter as defined by international agreement.(d) That the powers of the Federal Government in the field of public financeshall be limited to the disposal of monies including the raising ofrevenues, for purposes for which it is responsible; that the federal government may set rates and legislate on the general principles of assessment with regard to other taxes for which uniformity is essen-tial, the collection and utilisation of such taxes being left to theindividual States; and that it may appropriate funds only for purposes for which it is responsible under the Constitution.(e) That the Constitution should provide for an independent judiciary to review federal legislation, to review the exercise of federal executive power, to adjudicate conflicts between Federal and Land authorities as well as between Land authorities and to protect the civil rightsand freedom of the individual.(/) That the powers of the Federal Government to establish federal agenciesfor the execution and administration of its responsibilities should be clearly defined and should be limited to those fields in which it isclear that State implementation is impractical.2. The Military Governors are charged with the examination of the Consti-tution in terms of these guiding instructions bearing in mind that the purposeof such examination is to test the provisions of the Constitution as a whole to determine whether they guarantee a federal type of Government.* The following understanding was reached on this subject: The Military Governors must decide in detail what powers the Federal Government shouldhave as regards police.When the German Constituent Assembly presents its proposals for the Constitution, theMilitary Governors will disapprove the grant of any powers regarding police exceeding thosewhich they have accepted by agreement among themselves as being necessary.Letter of Advice to Military Governors regarding Powers ofCivil and Military governments.   With reference to paragraph 10 of Annex F :The Governments of the three Occupying Powers recognise that the establish-ment of a constitutional German Government will necessitate a definition of the relationship between this Government and the Allied authorities. The military governors will accordingly grant legislative executive and judicial power to german governments and reserve to themselves such powers as are necessary toensure the fulfilment of the basic purpose of the occupation. Such powers arethose necessary to enable the Military Governors to : (a) Conduct or direct Germany&apos;s foreign relations until such time as shemay be permitted unrestricted foreign relations;(b) Exercise the minimum control over German foreign trade, and overinternal policies and measures which could adversely affect foreign trade, necessary to ensure respect by the German authorities forobligations entered into by the Occupying Powers in regard toGermany and the proper use of funds made available to Germany;ANNEX  T35451 c
(d) Protect the prestige and ensure the security of the Occupation forces and the satisfaction of their requirements within defined limits agreedupon between the Military Governors;(e) Ensure the observance of the Constitutions which they have approved.2. The Military Governors shall resume their exercise of their full powers in an emergency threatening security, and if necessary to secure compliance withthe Constitutions or with the Occupation Statute.3. The Military Governors shall exercise the above-mentioned controlsaccording to the following procedure :(a) Any amendment to the Constitutions shall be submitted to the approval ofthe Military Governors.(6) In the fields mentioned in Article I (a) to (e), the German authoritiesshall comply with the decisions or directions of the military governors.(c) Whenever not otherwise provided, in particular for implementation ofparagraph (b) above, all laws and regulations from the german authorities shall come into force automatically within 21 days, unlessdisapproved by the Military Governors, after a majority vote, when-ever Federal Government is concerned.(d) When the Military Governors have received the recommendations of theMinisters President regarding the revision of the State boundaries,and before approving the submission of these recommendations to thepeople of the affected areas, they (Military Governors) will agree upon an organisation of Military Government in the States.4. The Military Governors shall have a special responsibility to observe,advise and assist the Federal and State Governments in regard to thedemocratisation of political life, social relations and education. This shall not imply any restriction of the legislative, executive and judicial competenceaccorded to such Governments in these matters.5. The Military Governors are hereby authorised to transmit to theMinisters President the broad principles embodied in the foregoing for their observations. They will then communicate these broad principles, modified asthey may then agree, to the Constituent Assembly as a guide to that body in its work of preparing the Constitution and will receive from it the observations whichit may wish to put forward. When the Military Governors announce their approval for the submission of the Constitution to the States, they will publishsimultaneously an Occupation Statute, incorporating these principles as finallymodified by them, in order that the people of the States may understand that thevaccept the Constitution within the framework of this Occupation Statute.ANNEX JTrizonal Export/Import PolicyIt is agreed that the external trade of the French Zone shall, withoutprejudice to the observance of existing agreements and contracts to which theFrench Zone or the Combined Zone are party, be conducted through J.E.I.A.,in accordance with the general rules of the J.E.I.A. Charter, with effect from 1st August, 1948. The Military Government of the French Zone will be associatedwith the management of J.E.I.A., with its board of directors and, for thispurpose only, the Bipartite Board, in such a way as may be agreed between thethree Military Governors before that date.Discussions shall be opened forthwith among the three Governments with aview to reaching agreement on the financial and economic issues of French partici-pation in J.E.I.A.United Kingdom reservationThe United Kingdom Delegation accepted the foregoing subject to the under-standing that it would not be required to assume obligations to provide capitalor to convert currencies additional to those which His Majesty&apos;s Government had accepted in the revised Fusion Agreement.
French reservationNothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as committing the FrenchGovernment to assume an obligation to make any contribution in national or foreign currencies from its own resources to J.E.I.A.United States reservationNothing in this Agreement is to be interpreted as adding to the share of theUnited States Government in the cost of maintaining the occupation of Germany.ANNEX KProvisional Territorial ArrangementsA Working Party shall be set up consisting of representatives of the UnitedStates, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.The Working Party shall conclude its report and recommendations as soon aspossible and in any case in sufficient time to allow the Governments concerned to reach decisions on these recommendations before 1st September, 1948.The Working Party shall make a preliminary study of any proposals whichmay be put forward for the adjustment of the present western frontiers ofGermany and shall only examine and report on those proposals which involve no appreciable loss to the German economy and which, being of a minor characteronly, can be regarded as desirable to eliminate local anomalies and improvecommunications.It is understood that the recommendations of the Working Party shall be confined to provisional readjustments which shall be subject to confirmationor modification by the terms of the final settlement with Germany and that such recommendations shall not be regarded as commitments on Governments^ either as regards provisional acceptance or support at the final settlement.The Working Party shall in addition examine and report on the boundaries of the Saar.Any decisions reached by the Governments on the basis of the working party&apos;s recommendations shall be provisionally implemented without delay.The establishment of this Working Party shall be without prejudice to therights of the Governments concerned to raise their economic and territorial claimsat a later date and at any rate before the final settlement with Germany.The existence and terms of reference of this Working Party shall remainsecret.ANNEX  LSecurityThe United States, French, Benelux and United Kingdom Delegations agreedto submit the following report to their Governments :General Provisions(1)   Military OccupationIt was agreed that the occupation of Germany should continue for a long period of time.
