BELGIAN TANKSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in the course of the disposal of surplus stores and equipment in Belgium,the British Disposals Commission (under the Ministry of Supply) in Brusselssold as scrap between May and August, 1946, under a series of contracts, some,700 tanks of British, Canadian and United States (Lend/Lease) origin, to aM. Victor Van Loo of 13 Ankerrui, Antwerp, trading also under the name&quot;Belgian Overseas Trading Corporation,&quot; of the same address. The pricepaid was Belgian francs 440 per ton. Of the tanks 276 (amounting to 9.000 tons)were of American origin, and Belgian francs 3,960,000 have been paid to theUnited States Government, less 15 per cent, for expenses.2. Normally the Ministry of Supply did not accept surplus stores of a lethalnature from the Services until after demilitarisation, if they were to be disposedof overseas, but in this instance, by arrangement with the B.A.O.R. (who wereexperiencing man-power difficulties) the British Disposals Commission providedfor the contractor himself to cut the tanks up.3. The tanks were in two vehicle parks near Antwerp, where M. Van Looset up a break-down organisation. In the earlier stages the British DisposalsCommission had a representative watching the operations, but man-powereconomies led to his withdrawal in March 1947. The British Disposals Commis-sion completely closed down during August 1947 and most of the staff, includingthe Chief Disposals Officer, being temporary employees, left the Ministry:service.4. As these tanks were sold as scrap, it was not necessary to obtain priorAmerican consent (as provided under the Military Holdings Agreement) : the sales contracts contained clauses providing for demilitarisation by the purchaser.5. The first indication that the contracts for break-down were not being fully observed was received in London at the end of September 1947. Apartfrom tanks converted into tractors, others in a serviceable condition had beenexported to Argentina and further such exports were intended. This news musthave reached the State Department at the same time, for early in October theUnited States Embassy asked the Foreign Office for full particulars of the sale and whether the contract would permit the enforcement of any demilitarisationclause.6. When the matter was discussed at the Foreign Office with representativesof the other ministries concerned, considerable doubt was expressed as to the praticability of enforcing in the Belgian courts observance of the demilitarisationclauses, and it was thought that the only effective approach would be through diplomatic channels, on the assumption that the Belgian Government would not support acts which were not only a flagrant breach of the spirit of the contracts,but also a cause of annoyance to the United States Government. It was understoodthat the Belgian Government would be ready to put a stop to the traffic byHIS   DOCUMENT  IS   THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAj STY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT     1Printed for the Cabinet.

7 Unfortunately the Belgian Government would only agree to requisitionabout 100 of the best tanks. They made no secret of the fact that they wererelying on the export of the tanks to the Argentine to get gram in return.8 The position in regard to the sale of the tanks to M. Van Loo was explained to the United States Embassy at the end of December. The embassywere told orally that we very much regretted that more effective safeguards hadnot been provided against the sale of tanks in working condition; that theMinistry of Supply were asking M. Van Loo for an explanation of his failure to fulfil the demilitarisation requirements and for an assurance that the remainingtanks were being demilitarised; and that the Foreign Office were ready to instructHis Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Brussels to co-operate with the United States embassy in any further action which the United States Government might wish takenthere.9. The efforts of the Ministry of Supply to press the contractor to stopfurther exports met with as little success as the representations of the twoembassies to the Belgian Government. Written representations to the contractorfailed to produce any satisfactory result and when a senior official of the Ministryvisited Belgium and made personal representations to the contractor at thebeginning of March 1948 the latter replied that he was under strong pressure fromhis Government to convert the tanks for agricultural purposes and to export themto South America so that the Belgian Government could be assured of an adequatebread supply.10. No further communication was received from the United States Gov-ernment until March 1948, when the United States Embassy in London asked that steps should be taken to ensure that no lease-lend tanks should be exported from belgium to any destination without United States approval unless they had first been rendered unfit for military use. It was emphasised that the State Depart-ment were not prejudging the desirability of any further shipment to theArgentine which might be proposed, but thought it important that United Stateswar equipment should not be available for transfer from one country to anotherwithout United States consent.11. The financial side of the transaction was taken up at the same time withthe United Kingdom Treasury Delegation at Washington. They were told thatthe United States Government realised that the situation arose out of a failure of execution on the part of the buyer and not conscious failure of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to meet the provisions of the Military Holdings Agreement, and hadno desire to assert an unreasonable claim on account of a transaction from whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government did not receive any substantial benefit; they, neverthe-less, felt that an unscrupulous buyer should not be permitted to profit at theexpense as well as the embarrassment of the United States Government. it seemed to them that His Majesty&apos;s Government had a valid claim for breach of contract against the Belgian vendee, amounting at least to most of the differencebetween the price of the tanks as scrap and as operable vehicles, and in their viewany sum collected should be turned over to the United States Government, as theactual injured party. This would be quite separate from any action which mightbe taken in respect of the tanks still in Belgium. The communication referred torumours that the number of tanks involved amounted to 1,500, and that thepurchase price paid to M. Van Loo was 40,000 pesos, or roughly $10,000 per tank,and the Treasury Delegation have reported that the Americans have in fact nowincluded on the debit side of the lease-lend accounts a tentative item of $15 million in respect of these tanks.12. The Treasury have pointed out to the Treasury Delegation in Washing-ton that the total number of American tanks sold to M. Van Loo was 276, so thatthe American tentative figure of $15 million is in any case wrong; assuming thatall the American tanks were resold and that M. Van Loo in fact was paid$10,000 per tank, the figure could only be $2,760,000.13. In explaining the circumstances of the case to the United StatesGovernment, the Treasury Delegation have pointed out that the proceeds receivedby the Ministry of Supply have already been paid over to the United Statesgovernment and they have expressed the hope that the claim tentatively enteredby the United States Government would be withdrawn. -
14. Meanwhile, further representations had been made in Brussels by thetwo Embassies to secure that the Belgian Government would prevent the exportof further tanks except by agreement with the United States Government. Atthe beginning of April M. Spaak told His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that the matterdisturbed him since the Belgian Government were obtaining important advantagesfrom the Argentine Government in return for the export of these tanks; he didnot believe that the tanks could possibly be used for any nefarious purpose, andhe thought that the United States Government&apos;s anxiety about them wasexaggerated. Since then M. Spaak has been in Washington, where he haspresumably discussed the matter further with the United States Government.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and his United States colleague in Brussels willcontinue to make representations to ensure that the Belgian Government will put as top to further exports of tanks except by agreement with the United StatesGovernment.15.   The Departments concerned are meanwhile being asked to consider: (i) Whether any satisfaction can be given to the United States government if they press their claim in respect of the tanks resold from Belgium;and(ii) Whether any additional safeguards should be introduced to provide against a recurrence of regrettable incidents of this sort.E.
