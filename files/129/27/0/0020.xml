DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  britannic  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT&apos;     1 Q1-Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1948 .    * ** *SECRET Copy No. 30CP. (48) 1404th June, 1948CABINETWAGE CLAIMS BY EMPLOYEES OF SOCIALISED industries and LOCAL authorities memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service was invited by the Cabinet on 15th April (CM. (48) 28th Conclusions,Minute 4) to reconsider the proposals made in CP. (48) 106 for obtaining informa-tion about prospective or actual claims for higher remuneration made by the employees of socialised industries and local authorities.2. In agreement with the other Departments concerned, I am making arrangements direct with the boards of socialised industries with a view to obtaining information of any such claims at as early a stage as possible.3. So far as local authorities are concerned there will be no difficulty inobtaining information as to proposals for changes in national scales of remunera-tion; such scales apply to all services and employees of local authorities exceptsome of the higher grades. The Home Office and the Scottish Office can provide information respecting the Police and Fire Services, and the Ministry ofEducation and the Scottish Office information respecting teachers. remuneration and conditions of employment for these services are settled nationally and theDepartments concerned are closely informed of developments. Agreements asto wages and conditions of most other local authority employees are also negotiatedon a national scale, e.g., on the Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Professional,Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales) -Joint Industrial Counciland the Local Authorities Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers) England andWales) Joint Industrial Council and similar Councils for Scotland. My liaison officers already obtain early information about such national claims and negotiations.4. Local authorities generally pay on the national scales and conditions.They are not, however, bound by the agreements reached on the Joint industrial councils and, except in the case of police and fire services, there is nothing to prevent a local authority paying wages or observing terms and conditions forits own employees above those agreed on the appropriate Council. A few localauthorities in fact have paid wages above the agreed rates and a greater numberobserve conditions more favourable than those agreed, and their action hasencouraged claims for general increases. A recent example is Coventry wherethe action of the local authority in paying their transport workers above the agreed rates created a difficult position in a number of other towns in the midlands and was followed by a claim for increased rates on a national basis. Difficulty isalso being caused by the action of a number of local authorities in paying ratesabove or observing conditions more favourable than those provided for by national aggreement in the building industry.There are about 1,500 local authorities in England and Wales employinglabour and 231 in Scotland (exclusive of District Councils, most of whom havepart-time employees). The Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland consider that an attempt to obtain advance information about paymentsabove the agreed rates by a direct approach to all these local authorities mightwell lead to difficulty. They feel that it might put it in the minds of theauthorities that the Government are in fact contemplating the possibility of35454
authorities paying more than standard rates and further that any informationof this kind might be a positive embarrassment unless the. Government areprepared to take drastic steps to secure conformity such as the withholding of exchequer grant for the whole of a service where the employees are engagedin a grant-aided service or the refusal to sanction loans where sanction isrequired. This would in their view be a difficult course to take because theauthorities who are paying excess rates will also certainly argue that they are doing so for increased output a very awkward argument to rebut. I agreewith the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State that it would be extremelydifficult to prevent local authorities acting in this way, but such departures fromthe terms of collective agreements disregard the considerations set out in theWhite Paper (Cmd. 7321) and are most serious obstacles to obtaining stability of wages and conditions of employment in a wide range of important industries and services. For this reason I suggest that the possibility of action being takento prevent local authorities doing this should be most carefully considered. entirely agree, however, with the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statethat in all the circumstances it would not be desirable at present at any rate to approach all the local authorities concerned in England, Wales and Scotland,ana that we should rely on the information obtained through ordinaryDepartmental channels.5.   The Ministers of Education and Transport agree with this view.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S. W. 1,4th June, 1948.
