THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1948The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of...............^*...f*....................TOP SECRET Copy No.CP. (4.8) 1392nd June, 1948CABINETIRON  AND   STEEL  bill memorandum by the Lord Privy seal i have studied with great care the Memorandum of the Minister of supply on this subject (CP. (48) 123) and have followed very closely the reports of theproceedings before the Socialisation of Industries Committee, and would wishto pay tribute to the resourcefulness and labour that the Minister has devotedto his study of this difficult subject. I would, however, ask my colleaguesvery seriously to consider our plan of proceedings on this subject because I thinkthat the plan of the Bill as it stands and the timing and method proposed willfairly certainly lead to a great many difficulties that might otherwise be avoided.2. In putting in this paper I am sure I need not remind my colleagues that I have no objection as such to large-scale national acquisition where thecase is made out. For example, I myself, for many years past, have recommended the national ownership of all land.. 3. It is clear that in a case like this there must first be abundant justifica-tion for what is proposed. Secondly, the method should be wisely chosen, and,thirdly, the. time should be appropriate.4. We have, of course, the recognised pledges that have been given andthat are quoted by the Minister, but they do not relieve us from the necessity of exercising great care and wisdom as to how we give effect to them.5. As to the justification for the present proposals at the present time, itwill, I think, be exceedingly difficult to make a case, and I notice that in para-graph 21 the Minister considers that it might be embarrassing to attempt it ina White Paper. Our opponents would certainly regard as a confession of weaknessany failure to adduce adequate reasons for them, and, quite frankly, it is difficultto see the case for them as things stand. In the case of coal, electricity and gas,the case for national ownership and control in some appropriate form has beenabundantly displayed for many years, but in this case, so far as I know, thereare only two outstanding considerations. First, the country requires, to beanything like self-supporting, to have an output of steel much greater than thatat present realised, and, second, until the war period, for many years past theindustry had seemed to be content to carry on without planning for substantialadvances.6. There are many tributes to the present efficiency of the machinery ofthe industry by the Minister, and in paragraph 22 he frankly says : &quot; There isno question in this industry of inefficiency or of disinclination or inability tocarry through essential modernisation.&quot; In the face of a statement like that one is bound to question the wisdom of what is proposed now. It would cripple our national restoration effort if there were to be any set-back in the production ofsteel.35444
7. Further, as to the more immediate financial consequences of acquisition,it appears from paragraph 24 that the best that could be hoped for is a reductionin the controlled price of steel by from 1 to 2 per cent, or an increase in the earnings of the workers of from 4s. 6d. to 7s. Qd. a week. If this were the best that could be said, it would not be very good, but we have to remember that it is accompanied by the fact that we are subsidising the industry at present to theextent of at Jeast  22^ million a year, or, if we exclude the subsidy in respectof imported steel, of about  14 million. The transfer of the cost of this subsidy to the industry would involve the political embarrassment of another deficitnationalised industry and would make it in practice difficult to attain even theslender advantages referred to above.8. The Minister anticipates that if the Bill were introduced as it is weshould be deprived of the active help of members of the Iron and Steel Board,who are at present influential in promoting development. As for the companiesthemselves, the Minister says in paragraph 37, even of the companies formingthe core of the industry, that &quot; It is beyond my power to guarantee that the livingspirit of those companies will be retained.&quot; It would manifestly be all the moreunwise to saddle the scheme with any more small companies or subsidiarymanufacturing activities than could possibly be avoided.Timing9. The question of timing is also very important. Even if the Bill were passed next session we could not expect it to come into operation, if we makeeven a modest allowance for inescapable delays, before well into 1950 and we shallbe having a General Election at tne time when the transitional difficulties are atthe peak. We should, in fact, have all the electoral disadvantages of the proposal with none of the advantages.10. If any early scheme is required, what I think we should aim for is anadequate marrying of State control over policy to the efficiency and willingness tomodernise to which the Minister pays tribute. We cannot afford, I suggest, to losesight of the dangers at the present time from the introduction of the misgivingsand uncertainties that the Bill as proposed would undoubtedly create and whichare referred to in many places in the Ministers paper.11. It will be remembered that last year the Lord President conducted somenegotiations with the Iron and Steel Federation which held out a promise of a compromise that would give us the essentials of national control with a fairmeasure of agreement. I would therefore urge my colleagues, in view of theundeniable difficulties and possible economic dangers that would accompany theintroduction of the Bill as proposed, that we should first authorise the lord president and the Minister to reopen the negotiations to see if a scheme cannotbe arranged that will give us the necessary degree of national control and directionwithout involving us in the difficulties I apprehend. -12. If my colleagues cannot agree even with this course, which I would strongly urge, then I certainly think that wisdom points to our making the scopeof our proposals coincide as nearly as possible with the essential activities of theindustry as indicated in Scheme D.13. In Scheme C there are 102 subsidiary companies outside the industry as against 63 in Scheme D and it appears that under Scheme C no less than21 per cent, of those employed are engaged in industries &apos;&apos; other than iron andsteel&quot; (paragraph 19). Among the more important companies falling withinScheme C, as is shown in Appendix I, something like 80 per cent, and 90 per cent,respectively of the employees of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds (No. 32) andJoseph Sankey and Sons (No. 45), are so engaged and I find it difficult to believethat it is good sense to saddle ourselves with the difficulties attaching to suchacquisition. It will be much harder to &apos;&apos; hive off &apos;5 the extraneous activities ofthe smaller concerns, where all activities are likely to be well scrambled.Conclusions14. It is undeniable, I think, in view of the hard work that has been putinto this subject with all good will by a number of able men during the last twoyears, that the pledge was given without adequate consideration as to what it
I &apos; 3involved. However, there it is, and we have to consider what can be done. Thereare these possibilities :-jit&apos;&apos;(1) If we can be excused from redeeming the pledge, this Parliament, on theunderstanding that a well thought-out Bill is introduced at thebeginning of the next, if we are successful, there would at least be abetter chance of getting a scheme of this kind into working order andhaving time to display its advantages during the life of the Parliament.(2) If the pledge is too binding and some step must be taken, then it is clear to me that the line of advance, seeing the present constructive moodof the industry and the agencies that exist, is that we should aim atthe negotiations which were carried on with substantial promise ofsuccess last year by the Lord President being renewed and a schemebeing produced based upon them. This is the course that I would, inthat event, strongly recommend.(3) If this is not acceptable, then clearly we ought to aim at Scheme D ratherthan Scheme C because we should avoid thereby being embarrassed by taking over, or having to make terms with, a large number of manu-facturirig units which are really not iron and steel production at all.A.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W.1,2nd June, 1948.
