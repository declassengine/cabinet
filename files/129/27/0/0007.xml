At the request of the Lord President&apos;s Committee(L.P.(a,8)  8th Meeting, Conclusion 2), I submit for theconsideration of the Cabinet a memorandum on the defenceaspects of the retention by the War Office of the StanfordPractical Training Area.2* It is reasonably certain that in any future emergencywe shall have less time to train troops for battle than&quot;wehad in the last war,  and it follows that the Army,  in peace-time, must be brought to the highest possible standard of efficiency.The plan for the Army is that it should be aNational Army eonsi s ting of:-The Regular Army (for overseas commitments andtraining of the National Servicemen and Territorial Army)The Territorial Army.The primary function of the National Army is thedefence of the United Kingdom.    If that defence is to besecurely based,  the highest standard of preparedness andtraining is vital for the National Array, and Stanford isrequired as a Practical Training Area,  that is, for the battletraining described in the following paragraph.3. During the war it was considered vital to accustomthe soldier to the sensations and noises of battle in thecourse of his training.    This was achieved by exercises inwhich all arms took part, using live ammunition and includingtanks and artillery with aircraft co-operating.    The resultsof this battle training were so excellent,  contributing directly to minimising casualties in actual operations, that it has beenincorjiorated into the peace-time training of the Army and hasreceived the approval of the Defence Committee (D.0.(h7) 13thMeeting, Minute k).    The fact that, in modern conditions oftraining for war, areas must be set apart for training with liveammunition has also been specifically referred to in paragraph 11of the White Paper on the Needs of the Armed Forces for Landfor Training and other purposes (Cmd.72?8).[!S^^H^^LS-S^2SS]L2--5^ britannic majesty1s government)s s c R e tc&amp;JLUZ) 127 copy no. 3Q2h,TK MAY. 1948cabinetwar department practical training area at stanford:    defence aspectsMemorandum, by the Minister of Defence
4*  i Before 1939 the soldier carried out minor fieldlining exercises, but large-scale co-operation with other armsusing live ammunition, did not take place.   This new and mostimportant type of training, involving infantry, artillery and tanks,  requires a large tract of land to allow firing atrealistic distances to provide sufficient space to deployand manoeuvre and to ensure an adequate safety zone all round the firing and impact areas.   An area of between 25,000 and30,000 acres is required to carry out a full scale operation.In some areas unsuitability of terrain, and the need to avoidundue interference with farms or villages, has resulted inthe acceptance of a certain lowering of the standard.5* In the opinion of the Chief of the Imperial Genera]Staff it is essential there should be one Practical TrainingArea in each Command.    The areas selected are as follows:-STANFORD - Eastern CommandFYLINGDALES - Northern CommandSTCBS - Scottish CommandIMBER - Southern CommandTrawsfynnyd - Western Command6* These five Practical Training Areas - one in eachCommand - are necessary for the following reasons:-(a) The annual training programme of the TerritorialArmy cannot Toe completed unless the units from each Commandare trained in their own. Practical Training Area:    the numberof units to be trained and the period within which trainingmust be completed necessitate the facilities of all fivePractical Training Areas.    The loss of any one of the proposedAreas would mean that the troops scheduled to be trained atthat Practical Training Area could not he fitted into thegeneral training programme.(b) The period of Annual Camp for each of the TerritorialArmy units using these areas is at present restricted to eight days.    It is therefore essential that the minimum time be spent on travelling to and from the area.    To move units from,locations at great distances from the Practical Training Area&quot;would raise costly administrative problems of movement,  ofmen, guns,  tanks, transport and stores by road or rail,  andwould result in loss of time and in formations being untrained.7. Stanford is by far the most suitable area yetselected for battle training as it is superior in itsvariety of terrain,  general shape,  dimensions and climatic-conditions to the other Practical Training Areas.   Fylingdalosis uninteresting, undulating moorland without features.    Stobscontains a large area of boggy ground and is restricted in.use by the presence of a catchment area.    Trawsfynnyd, -with similar limitations, also suffers from very poor visibilityin bad. weather and,  in addition,  the ground is steep and includes many ravines which severely limit cross-countrymovement by vehicles.    Imber is fully used by the School of infantry in their day to day work and jointly used by theMinistry of Supply for experimental work in ballistics and,in consequence,&apos;the training facilities for the practicaltraining of the Territorial Army in the Southern Command area will be restricted for a number of years.&apos; The Stanford area was originally selected in 19*1-3in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheriesbecause it was,  on the whole,  an area of low agriculturalvalue.   A number of camps have been built to serve the training
area and a special railway siding has &quot;been constructed to handle tanks and other heavy vehicles.   If the area is nowto he handed back it will cost anything up to  300,000 overa period of years to reinstate the land.8* If Stanford is denied to the Array there is no alternative area to take its place within Eastern Command,(or for that matter in England and Wales), withoutdispossessing villages and fawns;    and. this, for the reasons give in paragraph 6, means that those Territorial Armytroops who are dependent on Stanford for their annualtraining will miss this vital battle training.   The resultwill be that these formations will be only partially trained and far below the standard of other Territorial Army units.The units and formations which are affected are as follows;-hh (Homo Counties) Division consisting bf:-h-7 Infantry Brigade133 Infantry Brigade131 Infantry Brigade161 Independent Infantry Brigade Group162 Independent Infantry Brigade Group16 Airborne Divisionh Parachute Brigade,  consistingof two Parachute Battalions and oneSpecial Air Service Battalion.This table does not include the various supporting arms in eastern Command who will be denied co-operation with the/infantry mentioned above, and any Regular troops that may be stationed in the Command.   The units and formations referredto above total approximately 30,000 men.    It is planned thattraining will take place at Stanford almost continuouslythroughout the year.9. The loss of Stanford will thus mean that annuallya considerable proportion of the Army will be unable to carryout a vital part of its training.    I suggest to my colleagues that we should not agree to a course of action which will have such disastrous consequences.A.V.A..Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.,20th May,  19h3.
