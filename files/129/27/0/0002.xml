HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S .GOVERNMENT)S E	C R	E TCP	.(48)	1227TH	MAY.	1948COPY NO. 2oCABINET3ATENT LAW reform memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI ask the agre assent of the Cabinet to the drafting of a Bill for the amendment&apos; of the Patents and Designs Acts,for introduction during the 1948-49 Session.2. The object of the proposed Bill, except for thematters referred&apos; to below,  is to carry out the recommendations for the amendment of the Patents and Designs Law contained inthe Second Interim and Final Reports (Cmd. 6789 and Cmd. 7206)of the Committee appointed by the President of the Board ofTrade in April, 1944* of which Mr. Kenneth Swan, K.C., wasthe Chairman.   The recommendations made in the Committee&apos;first Report were given effect by the patents and Designs Act,1946.3* The Second Report,  dated April, 1946, containsimportant recommendations relating to the initiation, conductand determination of legal proceedings arising under the Acts.,including the constitution of the appropriate tribunals ^and.for the alteration of the provisions of the Acts relating to-^hc abuse of monopoly rights in a patent.    In the final report,  dated September, 1947,  there ajn a &quot;i^sjgge number of recommendations for amendments of the law designed to simplifyand cheapen the procedure for obtaining protection,  and fordefining the rights conferred by patents and designs.4. The reports have been well received in interestedquarters and I regard it as important in the public interest,as well as in the interests of inventors and designers andof the home and export trade of industrial users of inventionsand designs,  that legislation to implement the Committee&apos;srecommendations should be introduced next session.5* In their Second Interim Report (paragraphs 72 - 81)a majority of the Committee recommended that the Comptrollershould be given power to reject applications for patents onthe grounds of lack of subject-matter, i.e% that the allegedinvention lacks inventive merit and involves nothing more thanthe application of elementary common knowledge.    Two legalmembers of the Committee dissented strongly from thisrecommendation.   After consultation with the Lord Chancellor,who has ascertained that the Judges are opposed to therecommendation,  and with his agreement,  I propose not to implement this majority recommendation.
6. In their Second Interim Report (paragraph 108) theCommittee suggested that it was desirable that two Judgespossessing technical or scientific qualifications andpreferably with previous experience in patent litigationshould be appointed to deal with patent actions.   On thisrecommendation the Lord Chancellor is prepared, subject tothe necessary legislative authority, to appoint one suchJudge on condition that he is excluded from dealing withcertain classes of chancery work and that there should beavailable someone who has the required scientific quali-fications and is considered by the Lord Chancellor &quot;&quot;suitablefor appointment to the High Court both for patent work andfor other work.   It is therefore proposed to make provisionfor the appointment of one additional puisne Judge&apos; of theHigh Court primarily for patent actions.7* The Second Report makes recommendations for theamendment of Section 27 of the Acts so as to /provide abettor remedy against misuse of the patent rights or forsecuring a more extended use thereof,    (Paragraphs&quot; 5I4. - 65).These recornmendations have been criticised on the ground thatan application must be made to the Comptroller in each ease,and, that there may be cases where a patent is beingrostrietivoly or insufficiently used,  and further use isdesirable in the public interest, but either no one can be interested to take up the invention, or no one is preparedor willing to apply to the Comptroller for a licence.    Itis therefore proposed to go beyond the recommendation ofthe Committee and to provide that a Government Departmentmay be an applicant for a licence under the Section, evenwhore it contemplates that the actual manufacture shall beundertaken by another person.    In cases where an application is made&apos; by a Government Department consequent upon a reportof the Monopoly Commission which will be set up on thepassage into law of the Monopoly (Enquiry and Control) Billit is further proposed that the report of the commission that, restrictive or insufficient use of the patent is beingmade and that it is in the public interest or in the interestsof a particular trade or industry that a further use of thepatent should be &quot;made,  shall be conclusive as to these facts in the proceedings.    It is thought that in view of our inter-national obligations this is as far as we can go.    It isprobable, however,  that this proposal will be strongly criticised in some quarters.8. In paragraph 28 of the Final Report,  it is recommendethat disputes between employers and employee inventors as tothe ownership of the inventions should be submitted to the comptroller for determination, with the consent of both partiessubject to appeal to the Patents Appeal Tribunal.    It isthought,  however, preferable to give either party the right tosubmit the matter to the Comptroller, and to omit the require-ment that the consent of the other party should be obtained.9, The proposed Bill would be suitable for introduction in the House of Lords.    In view of the representative characterof the Committee and the unanimity of its recommendations,the Bill will be largely non-controversial,  and (except in thecase of the additional proposal referred to in paragraph 7which may arouse some opposition) any proposals for amendmentcould be satisfactorily doalt with at the Committee stages.10. A summary of the more important amendments to beincluded in the Bill is given in the appended Annex.H .W .Board of Trade, S.W.I.,7th May, 191+8,
12ANNEXThe principal proposed amendments of the lav/ arc: -1. To extend the present provisions in regard to compulsory licences to provide for the grant of licenceswhore a more extended use of a patent could Toe made,  evenif no actual abuse of patent rights has taken place(Second Report, paragraphs 55 - 6k).2.

Amendments in the provisions relating to Crown userof patented inventions to make permanent the powers conferredin regard to patents by emergency legislation;    and to enablean exclusive licensee or other person who as the result of Crown user loses the whole or part of the benefit of his agreement as regards the use of a patented invention to apply for a proportionate share in any compensation paid by the Crown(Final Report, paragraphs 65 - 91).8. Provision to be made for a person who desires to manufacture an article to obtain a declaratory judgment thatsuch manufacture would not constitute an infringement of apatent (Final Report, paragraphs 139 - lko),9. Registration of designs in respect of articles,instead of by classes of articles (Final Report, paragraph 29k) *In addition,  recommendations are made for a largenumber of amendments of a technical character,  of varyingimportance.
