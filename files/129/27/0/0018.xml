Jt$$**ri***&apos;. *iTOP SECRET CopyCP. (1+8)  1381+th June,  191+8.CABINETTALKS ON GERMANY:__RESUMED session memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Three-Power Conference on Germany ended on 1st june and agreed recommendations have been submitted to Governments.I shall be circulating separately to my colleagues for their information the Report of the Conference to Governments, togetherwith its annexes.It is of importance that His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe United States Government should be in a position to informthe French Government of their acceptance of the recommendationsof the Conference before the opening of the debate in the FrenchChamber.In accordance therefore with the conclusions reachedbjr the Cabinet when we last dascussed this matter (CM. (I+8) 31+th conclusions, Minute 2) I have approved the report submitted bythe Conference and will shortly so inform the other Governmentsconcerned.When the Cabinet considered my earlier memorandum(CP. (1+8) 131+) they drew attention to three    points.On the first I am in touch with the United states authorities and hope to confirm that I have been able to reach a clear understanding with them that,  if the French Governmentultimately fail to associate themselves with the constitutional proposals,  His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment will be free to revert to a system of direct elections.Secondly,  I am circulating separately a paper setting^^^out the electoral systems at present in force in the three western Zones of Germany.Thirdly,  I was asked to consider whether theConstituent Assembly should be debarred fro.a discussing the revision of the inter-Land boundaries.      The present plan providesfor these to be settled before the Constituent Assembly meets,and this is in accordance with the French point of view.Earlier in the talks we and the Americans proposed that any necessary revision of Land boundaries should be effected by theConstituent Assembly, but in the end we accepted the French view on this point as part of the negotiation.      It is unlikely that,as any changes in State boundaries will have been approved by-popular vote,  the Constituent Assembly will wish to interferewith them;    but if there&apos; should be any tendency to do this, theMilitary Governors will no doubt be able to discourage it.      Itwill,  of course, be open to the Constituent Assembly to include inthe Constitution provisions to govern changes in State boundariesin the future.?oreign Office,  S.W. 1. E,B*lith June,  19h,8.
