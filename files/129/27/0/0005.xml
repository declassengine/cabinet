Man-power the number in civil employment has increased since last autumn and reached in March its highest total since the end of the war. The rise has beenin the number of men employed; in recent months the number of women employedhas fallen (Table 2).2. The coalmining industry is still finding it difficult to recruitworkers in sufficient numbers. During April more men entered than left the industry and there was a net increase of 700 in the numbers of wage-earners on colliery books; the number on colliery books was 724,100 at15th May.3. Table 3 also shows what success other under-manned industries havehad in getting workers. More persons have entered the cotton industry andthe figures for the last five weeks have been as follows : Net increase in employment in cotton spinningWeek ended : April 101724May    1. 8+ 550+ 390-f 290+ 160+ 280) II. Production4.   The Index of Total Industrial Production (1946 = 100) is provisionallyestimated at 119 for March 1948 compared with 125 for February 1948 and 99 for march 1947.   The figures are adjusted for the number of days (excluding35385 b
Sundays) in each month but not for holidays. The slight drop in the Indexbetween February and March is explained by the loss of production caused bythe Easter holidays at the end of March.Coal5. The output of deep-mined coal during each of the four weeks ended22nd May was below the target set for these weeks. Production of opencast coalcontinues to be well above the target.6. In the first 20 weeks of 1948 total production of deep-mined and opencastcoal amounted to 80-8 million tons or 1 per cent, above the target of 80-1 million tons for this period. Output of opencast coal was 1,065,000 tons above the target for these 20 weeks, and the output of deep-mined coal was 317,000 tonsbelow the target.Total production of deep-mined and opencast coalWeekly, average 1948 january february march*April.....Week ended May   8      .....15      .....22      .....(!) 211 million tons in 1948.* Average of five weeks.7. Deliveries of coal for bunkers and for export abroad rose to 349,000 tonsiin the week ended 8th May.8. In spite of the increase during recent months in the labour force ofthe coal industry the &apos;&apos; effective &apos;&apos; employment at the coal face has remainedalmost unchanged since October 1947. Absenteeism is greater than in october and November of 1947 and the average output per man shift worked has show no further improvement.

The output of steel ingots and castings reached a record level of 300,000tons in the week ended 8th May.10. Production of pig-iron in the first week of May reached a new record of 184,000 tons. There was little change during the month in stocks of pig-ironand scrap.Textiles11. Output of cotton yarn (including waste yarns) has been maintained for four weeks at over 18 million lbs. a week.     Production of rayon yarn and
staple fibre recovered in March to 19- 7 million lbs. but was still less than the out-put in October 1947. Production of textile fabrics in the first quarter of 1948was only slightly greater than in the last quarter of 1947.Textile production	Cotton yarn (including cotton waste yarn) - Mn. lbs-t1)	Rayon yarn and staple fibre Mh. lbs.(2)	Woven cotton and rayon fabrics Mn. linear yards(J)	Worsted yarn&apos; Mn. lbs.(2)	Woven wool fabrics Mn. linear yards (2)1937       ......	26-1	12-3	79-3	18-7	1946      ......	14-25	14-9	38-0	12-1	18-61947 October    ...	16-12*	20-i	43-7*	15-8	23-9November ...	16-56	18-3	47-2	14-2	21-0December ...	15-06	19-2	41-7	14-0	20-21948 January   ...	16-34*	19-6	43-0*	15-6	23-0February ...	17-36	18-8	46-8	14-2	22-2March	16-59	19-7	45-3	15-0	20-5Week ended 					April 10   ...	17-84				17   ...	18-06				24   ...	18-05				May 1	18-07				8	18.14				(*) Weekly average.(2) Monthly average or calendar month.* Average of five weeks.Motor vehicles12. The rate of production of passenger cars for the export market roseagain from 4,786 a week in March to 5,102 a week in April the highest level sofar achieved. Production for the home market fell to 1,475 a week in April.Production of commercial vehicles for export declined in April.Coal mining machinery13. Deliveries of conveyors for home use continue to increase. The numberof cutters for home use rose to 103 in April.III.-External Trade14. The value of our imports rose in April to a record level of  186 million and the adverse visible balance of trade increased again to  54-5 million.15. The rise in the value of imports was due mainly to increased expendi-ture on raw materials in particular, raw cotton, wool, iron ore, oils and oilseeds. This investment in raw materials cannot be reflected in greater exportsuntil later in the year. Imports of food, drink and tobacco were lower than inMarch.16. The value of British exports also rose in April to  126 million or  5-4 million more than in March. The volume of these exports is provisionally esti-mated to be 132 per cent, of 1938.17. Exports of textiles rose from  22-3 million in March to  24-9 million in April. Table 10 shows that, in spite of this rise they are still well below the targets set for the end of the year. Exports of metal goods are being maintained at a high level and for a number of commodities in this group the average levelof exports in March and April was greater than the end-1948 targets.18. Most of the rise in the value of our imports in March was accounted forI by increased imports from the sterling area. These rose from  50-2 million inFebruary to  73 - 0 million in March. Imports from the Western Hemisphere havebeen about  60 million a month since November 1947. British exports to theWestern Hemisphere rose in March to  23-3 million the highest level so farachieved.35385 - o
IY. Bilateral Negotiations19. Since my last report agreement has been reached with Spain, Norway,the Bizone and Brazil.20. In the case of Spain, payments for the period to April 1949 will be governed by the existing monetary agreement, the margins established in that agreement for sales of currency being sufficient to cover the swing of tradeand thus avoid settlements in gold by either party. The United Kingdom will secure essential supplies of potash, iron ore, pyrites and other foodstuffs and rawmaterials; in return, Spain will receive coal, essential engineering equipment anda wide range of United Kingdom products. The total payments for the year are estimated at  40 million on either side.21. With Norway, a supplementary monetary agreement was reachedformally limiting mutual currency holdings to  5 million; but the agreed minuterecords that in any event Norway will not ask for gold in 1948, and that theUnited Kingdom will not ask for gold in the same period so long as Norwayholds blocked sterling balances. Estimates of trade between the United Kingdomand Norway were also reviewed, and indications were given of the quantities of essential supplies (notably coal, steel and cotton yarn) which w-ould be available forexport to Norway, and of the availability of essential imports (notably timber, pulpand canned fish) for the United Kingdom. There will be a further review of thegeneral payments position not later than December 1948.22. Trade between the sterling area and the Combined Zones of germany has been discussed with the Joint Export/Import Agency. The agreed minuterecords a probable pattern of trade, under which the Combined Zones will receive,inter alia, essential raw materials (notably wool and rubber), and will send usmuch-needed scrap and timber in return. The agreed aim of the discussions was to achieve balanced trade at the highest possible level.23. An agreement with Brazil on Trade and Payments has been signed inRio de J aneiro. Ail payments between Brazil and the sterling area will continueto be made in sterling and safeguards have been provided to ensure a reasonableequilibrium in the current volume of such payments. Brazil will leave the trans-transferable account area and her current sterling transactions with countries outsidethe sterling area will be regulated by agreement between Rio, London and the other parties concerned. Arrangements were made for the continued use of BraziFsaccumulated sterling balances of some  50 million for certain capital payments,notably repatriation of Brazilian sterling debt and purchase of British-ownedutilities : and releases from the balances to current account of  10 million up to1951 were agreed. Trade exchanges in 1948 at record levels are contemplate under the agreement: total sterling payments between Brazil and the sterling-area may aggregate in 1948 over  100 million of which some  10 million will bein respect of visible trade between the United Kingdom and Brazil. The main items in the Brazilian exports will be food-stuffs (some  10 million, mainly rice)and raw materials (some  20 million, mainly raw cotton, hides and timber).British exports of essentials (coal 500,000 tons, alkalis 37,000 tons, petroleum products  7 million worth, cement 100,000 tons and smaller quantities of tinplateand tin) are covered by assurances that His Majesty&apos;s Government will facilitatesupply : the most important British exports by value, however, will be vehicles and ships, machinery and textiles, respectively estimated as totalling some  9million,  8 million and  3^ million. The negotiations have been arduous and difficult and have occupied nearly four months.24. In the discussions with Sweden, agreement has been reached on certain points arising on the current financial arrangements; in particular, neither party will claim gold from the other until further notice. The trade position was alsoreviewed, but it was found that further detailed study was required on both sides;the talks will be resumed as soon as this has been completed.25.   It is hoped that an overall payments agreement, under which trade &apos;with Japan will be in convertible sterling, will shortly be completed.   In themeantime, the present interim arrangements have been extended until 31st May.26.   Financial discussions with Burma have begun and will begin shortlywith India and Pakistan, Trans Jordan, Iraq, Chile and Peru.
Y. PricesWholesale Prices27. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices (1938=100) rose further in April from 214-2 to 216-2. The effect Nof the increases in raw cotton prices which took place in March was reflected in the April index for cotton, whichrose by 13-6 per cent. The average price of Egyptian raw cotton was 23 per cent,higher, and the corresponding average yarn price 12 per cent, higher than inMarch.Retail Prices28. In spite of reductions in the group indices for rent and rates, fuel and light, household durable goods and miscellaneous goods, the index of retail prices for all items rose from 106 at 16th March to 108 at 13th April. This was due mainly to the effect of the recent increases in the duties on alcoholic drink andon tobacco, which raised the index for this group from 104 to 111.YI. Wage Rates and Earnings29. The index of weekly wage rates for all industries combined(June 1947 = 100) was unchanged in April at 105. The index of wage rates inthe textile industries advanced again by one point to 107 in April.30. During April settlements were reached in claims for increased wages,reduced hours of work or holidays with pay affecting 585,400i workers. the resulting increase in the weekly wage bill is estimated at  152,000. The mostimportant wage increases affected workers in the wool, gas, iron and steel andfurniture industries and in retail distribution and local authority employment.No new claims of outstanding importance were presented during the month. Theclaims for increased wages in the engineering and shipbuilding industries are still under discussion.31. The latest Earnings Enquiry of the Ministry of Labour shows that theaverage weekly earnings of adult men in October 1947 amounted to 128s. Id.or 86 per cent, greater than in October 1938. The average number of hours worked by men has fallen from 47-6 to 46-6 over the same period, so that averagehourly earnings were 90 per cent, greater than in October 1938. Average hourlyearnings of women have risen by 124 per cent, and those of girls by 150 per cent.YIL Balance of Payments32. The net drain on reserves has again been low during the past few weeks;particularly in the week ending 15th May, during which we received $25 million from South Africa in reimbursement of dollars paid out on her behalf in January.Further large sums from the same source are expected in the near future, whichshould help materially to offset the normal drain in gold and dollars.33. Figures for the first half of the current quarter (1st April to 15th May)show that, while the net deficit in Canadian dollars at $57 million was somewhat less than half the forecast of $130 million for the whole quarter, the net deficit in gold and United States dollars, which amounted to $46 million, was only about one-eighth of the estimated loss. The causes of this very favourable result are numerous. Though United Kingdom expenditure on imports has been up toexpectations, receipts from various sources have been higher. Diamond saleshave been especially large. More important is the substantial decline in the net expenditure of countries in the rest of the Sterling Area. This is due not somuch to the Colonies, whose normal surplus has. in fact, been seasonally lower,as to the sterling Dominions (India, Australia and New Zealand), whose drawingson the central reserves have been cut remarkably. South Africa, too, took lessthan was expected, and though, in consequence, the amounts she will repay willbe correspondingly lower later on, the effect is to reduce our loss now.34. Apart from the South African development, this low rate of drawingcan hardly be expected to continue. India&apos;s expenditure has been far less than she was entitled to incur under our agreement and she has already begun to makerenewed and heavy demands, though still within the agreed limits. Similarlyother countries are likely to take more in future. In addition to this, our liability to convert into dollars surplus sterling held by the Joint Export and Import
Agency in Germany will probably cost us over $30 million in the current quarter.On the whole, therefore, the net drain will probably be higher in future than ithas been recently. Even if this should prove true, however, the total net drainoh reserves in the present quarter will almost certainly be much less than wasforecast earlier and in all probability less than half the net drain of  147 million in the first quarter. This would produce a total for the half year lower than theestimate of  222 million put forward in the Economic Survey last February.Total net drain on reserves^1)1947-First halfJulyAugust   .,SeptemberOctober   ..NovemberDecember  million467133156936759481948-January ...FebruaryMarchAprilMay : first half57i4347206(*) Including drawings on United States and Canadian &quot;credits and the International monetary fund. y
