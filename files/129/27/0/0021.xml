SECRET COPY NO.   j QCP. (Lj.8)  11+18th June,  19U8.CABINETWAGE CLAIMS IN THE PUBLIC  SECTORMemorandum by the Minister1 of Labour and National service at the meeting of the Economic Policy Committee on 3rd May (E.P.0.(1+8) 17th Meeting, Minute 2) the Prime minister suggested that there should be a further discussion on somesubsequent occasion on the general policy which my department should follow when there is a breakdown in wage negotiationswhere public employees are concerned.      This subject was also discussed at the meeting of the Production Committee on 28th May(P.0.(1+8) 11th Meeting, Minute 2).2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in his memorandum(CP. (1+8) 135) draws attention to the great importance of wagemovements in this sector particularly in their effect on wages in the private sector.      I fully endorse his view that if weare to expect private industry to give its voluntary support tothe principles of the White Paper it is incumbent on theGovernment to take all steps open to it to ensure that,.to theextent that it can exercise legitimate control,  these principlesare observed in the public sector.      I have already circulated a memorandum (CP. (1+8) 11+0) setting out my views on the questionof keeping ourselves informed of wage claims and progress of negotiations in this sector.3. It is important that in considering the&apos;question of disputes that may arise in the public sector there should be a proper appreciation of the different considerations affecting thevarious types of employments involved.There are broadly three sub-divisions of the public sector:-(i)    Direct Government employment;(ii)    Socialised Industry;    and(iii)    Local Authority Employment.1+. As regards Government employment, the machinery fordealing with claims is well established and gives rise to nodifficulty.      There is adequate provision for arbitration inthe event of disagreement and it is only in the rare case, suchas resulted in the recent strike of Ministry of Works employees,that there is any need for my Department to intervene.5. As regards socialised industries, the paramountconsideration must be to encourage and develop the system of voluntary joint machinery - embodied in the various socialisationActs.      Each Act contains provision for the establishment ofTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)
Imachinery for joint negotiation and arbitration, and where such machinery has been established, the need for reference to myDepartment should not arise whilst that machinery is availableIand has not been fully utilised. .   I could not contemplate any policy which would encourage one side or the other to report a dispute to me for compulsory arbitration in such circumstances.It is essential that nothing should be done that might impair the authority of that machinery,  or weaken the sense ofresponsibility which both sides should carry for the maintenanceof good relations in the industry.!    &apos;   6. In the field of local authority employment, it isnecessary to distinguish between the trading and non-trading services.      In the former, the position of the authority cannotbe considered separately from that of the private employersengaged in the industry concerned.      There is an inter-changeability of labour, the two classes of employers are in competition with each other or engaged in similar work, andusually they are parties to the same machinery.      Accordingly,in my view it is impossible to treat employment in this field assolely in the public sector.7. As regards the non-trading services,  there ore anumber of Joint Industrial Councils and the machinery of negotiation of each is now well established.      Since the war,the occasions when there has been a breakdown in negotiationhave been few and any reference to my Department has in generalbeen for the purpose of securing compulsory arbitration.      Thegeneral practice in each such case has been to obtain the observations of the other side, and to refer the matter to theNational Arbitration Tribunal.      (Some misunderstanding has been caused about a recent case where it has been thought that this practice was not followed.      I find on examination that in factaction was postponed at the request of the employers and asettlement was reached without intervention by my Deportment.)8. It is in respect of this last type of employment thata general policy can be stated based both on past experience and practice and on future requirements.      Where one side of a localauthority Notional Joint Industrial Council for a non-tradingservice reports under the Conditions of Employment and national arbitration Order that a breakdown in negotiations has occurred,the dispute should be referred to the national arbitration tribunal subject to the observations of the other side.      It is\       necessary to obtain such observations in order that I may besatisfied that a dispute as defined in the Order does in factexist,  and that the terms of any such dispute have been fully  .and accurately reported.      Experience of the working of theseJoint Industrial Councils shows that it can generally be assumed that the established machinery has been fully utilised before areport is made and that,  save in exceptional cases,  a referenceto arbitration would be a proper course.      I must, however, reserve-my position where exceptional circumstances show themselves.The Order places definite responsibilities on me in this matter which I am bound to discharge.9. Any local dispute that might arise would of coursestill need to be dealt with as heretofore.      The circumstancesmust be fully investigated and every effort made to ensure thatconstitutional machinery is used to secure a settlement.10.. I should make it clear that failing a report under theOrder from one or other of .the parties,  I am prohibited by lawfrom referring a case to-arbitration save with the consent of both parties, whether public or private employment is involved.      Wherea joint request for voluntary arbitration is made to me       is thepractice of my Deportment to make all the necessary arrangements&quot;Without delay.Gr A   I.ministry of Labour and National Service,S.W.1.8th June,  1&apos;9h8.
