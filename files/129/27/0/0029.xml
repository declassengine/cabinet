J -    236(THIS IGCTMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.p.a:) ikcj11TH JUNE.  1QL6CABINETTHE POLITICAL SITUATION IN BURMAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs_  , Since the events described in my memorandum(C,P.(h8) 103) of 8th April, 19I48, on the strike situation in burma, the position has seriously deteriorated.     The left-wingparties which united to attain independence are falling apart,and it Is not impossible that- the present comparativelymoderate Government may fail to hold the country together.2. A recent statement by Thakin Nu,  the Prime Minister,that he intends to resign on 20th July and devote himself tothe leadership of the An.ti-Fascist People &apos; s Freedom League(A.i?-.P.F.ii.),  the coalition at present in power, is no surprisethough it had been hoped that he might,  in view of theCommunist threat,  stay in office until the elections inMarch, 1.9k3*      But he has accompanied it by a statement ofpolicy/ completely at variance with the moderate line which hehas hitherto pursued, and which his firm attitude to the communists over the recent strikes made us hope representedhis real sentiments.     He proposes the development of relationswith Soviet Russia and the countries of Eastern Europe,   the nationalisation of &quot;monopolising capitalist undertakings&quot;  (thequestion of compensation to be considered only afternationalisation), state monopoly of oil foreign trade,  thetransfer to Burma of the Burma Currency Board (now in London),&quot;the refusal of any foreign aid of a kind which will compromisethe political,  economic and the strategic independence of burma&quot; (which obviously calls in question the future of theBritish Service Mission),  the &quot;democratization&quot; of the Army,the administration and the Frontier Areas (which may imply anattack on British-trained civil servants),  the abolition ofprivate ownership of land, and the formation of a &quot;league forthe propagation of Marxist doctrine ....  to read, discuss andpropagate the writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, MaoTse-tung, Tito, Dirnltrov and other apostles of Marxism&quot;.3. This quasi-Communist manifesto apparently represents a desperate attempt to save the coalition by putting forward a programme sufficiently drastic to appeal to the extreme leftand particularly to the P.Y.A.  (the political heirs of AungSon&apos;s &quot;private army&quot;, on whose semi-military support and influence with the Army the Government greatly relies).      Butit is reported that the P.Y.A. hove rejected the programme andare contemplating a direct understanding with the Communists.If that happens,   the loyalty of the Army will be affected,  andthere may be almost- complete confusion, for the Communists, whohave few or no really capable leaders, would not be able totake over effective power.COPY NO.1 0
ko It seems likely that at best a split in the P.Y.A.will result, the extremists joining the Communists and the others remaining loyal to the A.F.P.F.L.      But in any ease theGovernment will be seriously weakened.      And,  in the absenceof a strong man to take charge,  the natural tendency of thepolitically-minded Burmese to internecine fighting and intrigue wiI fear, continue unrestrained to the ultimate benefit of the communists, who, if they can obtain from Moscow the trainingwhich they at present lack,  ought te be able to set up a Communiststate before long.5. In the meantime, the British-owned Irrawaddy FlotillaCompany end one-third, of the British timber interests wereexpropriated on 1st June.      Despite the Agreement and the Exchangeof Notes of 17th October,  19U7, which implied that developmentsaffecting British interests should be subject to discussion between the Burmese Government and ourselves, no serious attempt was made to reach prior agreement on the conditions for compensation or for the take-over of these two concerns.6. In view of these developments I have suggested to theMinister of Defence that we should consult our Ambassador on the wisdom of supplying arms to Burma until the position is clearer.This vie have hitherto encouraged with a view to assisting the burmese Government to stand up to the Communists.      I am also considering whether we should not review our support of Burma inthe international field.      We have sponsored, her membership of theUnited Nations and. have supported her application for membership of various international &quot;bodies.      We also represent her interestabroad in a number of countries where she has no representative ofher own.      She is now up for membership of the Par eastern commission;    and we have hitherto canvassed the other members forher admission.      I am now asking H.M.  Ambassador in Washington todiscuss with friendly Towers on the Commission the desirabilityof going slow in this matter.E.B.AForeign Office,  S.W.1.1tth June,  19U8.
