JoiHIS  DOCUMENT IS - THE PROPERTY OP   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1948CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (48) 12420th May, 1948CABINETUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON FREEDOM OF INFORMATION,GENEVA, 23rd MARCH TO 21st APRIL, 1948Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsBackground1. The resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the United nations on 14th December, 1946, laid down that the Conference on Freedom of information should be convened &quot; to formulate the views on the rights, obligations and practices which should be included in the concept of freedom of information.&quot;About forty delegations attended the conference.2. The object of the United Kingdom Delegation was not only to state in clear terms our conception of freedom of the press but also to find out whichcountries were willing to implement the fundamental ideas about freedom ofinformation. The delegation presented a draft convention to this end. We soughtalso to ensure, as far as possible, that no resolutions should be passed urginggovernmental interference with the press and to support any resolutions whichmight encourage professional action to maintain and improve professionalstandards. The United States, French and Indian Delegations also presenteddraft resolutions dealing with various aspects of the problem. The objective ofthe Soviet Delegation and of their satellites was to secure the passage of a unanimous resolution condemning warmongering. Having achieved this they appear to have had little interest in opposing the conventions put forward byother Powers, although they seem to have no intention of implementing any ofthem.3. Three draft conventions and a number of resolutions were produced forremission to the Economic and Social Council. The Governments taking part inthe conference have been invited to submit to the Economic and Social council by 5th July their comments on the draft conventions. The Council will give themfull consideration at their next meeting and it is intended that they shall besubmitted for signature at the next General Assembly.recommendations. It is recommended that the Cabinet take note of the conventions adoptedby the Conference on Freedom of Information, subject to such amendments asmay be made at the official level. The texts of the conventions are contained in annex A. The Cabinet are further asked to give their approval to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment informing the Secretariat of the Economic and Social Council, inaccordance with the procedure outlined in paragraph 3 above, of their agreementwith the principles contained in the convention. The Cabinet are also askedto take note of the principal resolutions adopted by the Conference (Annexes C,D and E).ArgumentProgress of Negotiations5. The chief attack of the Soviet on the British and the United States presswas directed against monopoly ownership, against the use of the press by itsproprietors for propagating^mefr own views and against the spreading of falseand distorted reports and ^ormongering.   In reply we made no claim that our35363 \ j b
press was perfect and instanced the (apopifitment of the Royal Commission asevidenced, of our willingness to investigate-any monopolistic tendencies in control.By the close of the Conference it was widely accepted that the two views wereirreconcilable, the Slav bloc maintaining that freedom of the press must be controlled with a view to eliminating Fascist doctrines and warmongering, andto ensuring that it expressed the voice of the people as mouthed by the Governmentand the democracies interpreting freedom of the press as carrying substantiallyits own correctives against abuse through the availability of a diversity of news and views.6. The United Kingdom Delegation attempted to keep the committees ona practical and realistic plane, to discourage the urging of governmental inter-ference or legislation, and to prefer the encouragement of professional actioninstead of recommending governmental action. In this the United Kingdomsucceeded. Practically no resolution was passed to which we could take seriousexception. Among the resolutions sponsored and carried by our delegation wasone inviting Governments to investigate in their own way monopolistic presstendencies, and another remitting to the Sub-Commission the problem of Govern-ment Information Services.Co-operation with Other Delegations7. The conference was noteworthy for the successful co-operation which theUnited Kingdom Delegation established with representatives of the Western demo-cracies (including Scandinavia), the British Commonwealth and the United States.Delegations of the signatories of the Brussels Treaty held joint meetings and each delegation made considerable sacrifices of detail in order to co-operate on principle. Commonwealth meetings were also held regularly and frequent dis-cussions took placei with the American Delegation. The Slavs would not respond to offers of discussion.Composition of the United Kingdom Delegation8. I should like to stress that the success of the conference was largely dueto the efforts of the United Kingdom Delegation. The Minister of State seemedto capture the initiative in the early stages and after his departure at the endof the first week the delegation was most skilfully and successfully led bvMr. Ernest Davies, M.P. JA chievements of the Conference9.   The principal decisions of the Conference are as follows : I. A Draft Convention on the Gathering and International transmission of News.   (Annex A 1)This was the convention put forward by the United States and covers the gathering and international transmission of news. It is designed to be acceptable to the American press, and the United States Delegation con-sidered that it would have no difficulty in securing senatorial approval.\l.-Draft Convention concerning the Institution of an International Rightof Correction.   (Annex A 2)This was sponsored by the French Delegation and requires governments to provide facilities for the issue of denials, through normal channels of thenational press, by any other contracting State which may consider itself tohave been falsely represented.III. -A Draft Convention on Freedom of Information (Annex A 3)The United Kingdom Delegation presented this. It formulates thefundamental principles of freedom of information. An attempt to make an amendment which would have applied the convention automatically to allnon-self-governing territories was narrowly defeated by 16 votes to 15. Itwill therefore be necessary to take further steps to explain to all States con-cerned the constitutional position of the non-self-governing territories or theclause may yet be amended, thus making our signature of our own conventionvery difficult if not impossible.
IV. A Draft Declaration on the Draft Covenant on Human Rights(Annex B)This document makes comments on those passages of the Draft Covenanton Human Rights at present before the Economic and Social Council which deal with freedom of information. The United Kingdom limiting clause(Article 17), listing the permissive legitimate restrictions to be clearly defined by law, was opposed by the United States, who favoured an open blanketclause, the legal effect of which would have been to make an unlimited range of restrictions on freedom permissible. The reasons for the United Statesopposition to listing restrictions is that restrictions on freedom of informa-tion actually in force under Federal and State Laws are, in fact, toonumerous to list conveniently, even if they could all be ascertained in advance.They fear that an incomplete list would result in a flood of law suits againstthe Government, because legislation not covered by the list&apos; would becomeinvalid under the United States Constitution. Many of the restrictions whichthe United States Delegation had in mind are apparently of a slight or tech-nical nature, but it is possible that there are others of a more serious nature,connected with the racial problem, to which they did not wish to refer in public. The American contention that the present list of restrictions cannotbe considered exhaustive or final has some validity, and the Conferenceindeed decided to draw the attention of the Human Rights Commission tothe problem. Ultimately, the United States voted with the Soviet blockagainst Article 17, and they will clearly be unwilling to adhere to the Con-vention in its present term.V. Resolutions on Warmongering and False and Distorted Reports(Annex C 1 and 2)Briefly, these resolutions endorse the General Assembly resolutions onthe same subject, condemn all false and distorted reports and express theview that only a free press can result in the counteracting of propaganda andaggression. The resolution at Annex C 2 provides for the implementation ofthat at C 1.VI. Other General Resolutions (Annex D 1 and 2)The remaining resolutions are concerned with generalities (most ofwhich are already covered by the Conventions listed above) or with technical matters.   Two in the former category are attached in Annex D.VII. A Resolution on the Establishment of Continuing Machinery(Annex E)Agreement was reached on a draft resolution to continue the Sub-Committee on Freedom of Information for three years and to enlarge its terms of reference. These terms are now fairly wide, and considerable work has been transmitted to the sub-commission.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,20th May, 1948.&amp;35363
