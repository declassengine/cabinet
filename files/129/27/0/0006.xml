1JLJ.C,, RET COPY NO. J^O21st May,  1914-8.cabinet war DEPARTMENT PROPOSALS FOR A PRACTICAL TRAINING area at STANFORD &quot; &quot;Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country PlanningAt the request of the Lord President*s Committee(L.P. (h,8) 8th Meeting, Minute 2)  I submit for decision by theCabinet the question whether the Stanford training area shouldbe retained by the War Department as a practical training area or should be returned to the inhabitants in accordance with the pledge given to them during the war.      The Minister of defence will be submitting to the Cabinet at the request of the lord presidents Committee a memorandum on the defence aspects of thequestion.      I must, however, myself refer briefly to that matter.2. The Stanford area is one of five (Stanford (Norfolk),Fylingdales (Yorkshire), Trowsfynydd (Merionethshire) andImber (Wiltshire) in England and Wales, and Stobs in Scotland),proposed for practical training,  i.e.  the use of live ammunitionby all arras in combination.      This form of training has been declared by the Government to be essential (Cmd. 7278).      It is common ground that if the Stanford area is rejected no alternative can be found in the Eastern Command.      To reject theStanford area would, therefore result in serious deficiency ofmilitary training in that Command.      If, in addition, any other of the proposed practical training areas were rejected, militarytraining generally would be gravely prejudiced.      Unless therefore the conclusions of the Cabinet as set out in the White Paper(Cmd. 7278) in regard to total training needs were wrong in a major degree, the implications of a decision to reject theStanford proposals would be that the Government would be driven to accept the proposals for the other practical training areas,however great the difficulties might be.      The alternative wouldbe to imperil security.      It is therefore desirable that I should state the general nature of the difficulties with which mycolleagues will be faced when these other cases come to bedecided.3. The proposed Pylingdales practical training area isin one of the areas proposed by the Hobhouse Committee(Cmd.  7121)  as a National Park.      It is a.n area of marked naturalbeauty,  and is of importance for the recreation of large centres of population in the West Riding and Teeside from which numbersof holiday makers go to Scarborough and Whitby.      There is strong feeling on the part of Scarborough Town Council,- the Whitby U.D.C.,the Whitby R.D.C. , and the amenity societies - particularly theStanding Committee on National Parks - against the war department proposals.      So far as amenity is concerned,  thepiS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
injury is undoubtedly substantially greater than in the caseof the Stanford area which is recommended by the HothouseCommittee as a Conservation Area.      Although the objections onthe grounds of amenity are perhaps rather exaggerated,  there is little doubt that the Government will have to face a considerableoutcry if the proposals for the Fylingdoles area are approved.h* . I do not myself think that a strong case could be made onamenity grounds against the proposals for the Trawsfynydd area,a large part of which is War Department freehold.      But there is some chance of objection because of the strong and uncompromisingopposition on the port of Welsh interests to Service Departmentproposals generally on the ground that a much higher proportionof land would &quot;be taken for training in Wales in comparison withother parts of Great Britain.      Play would be made with the factthat this area also is in a proposed National park.5. As to Imber, my Deportment have net been officiallyinformed of the War Deportment proposals, but I understand that apractical training area is proposed which involves the exclusion from the village of persons who were War Department tenants until19U3*      On such information as I have I doubt whether there couldbe any well-founded objection to the&apos; proposals in themselves.But my colleagues will be aware that there has been a sustainedallegation in the Press of broken promises.     -The War Office haveofficially denied that any pledge was given by them to theinhabitants, but many statements have been made indicating a firmbelief on the part of those concerned that they would be allowedto go bock to their homes when the war was over.6. The Home Secretary is,  at the request of the lord president&apos;s Committee, submitting to the Cabinet a memorandum onthe nature of the pledge given at Stanford and he will doubtlessin that memorandum explain the circumstances in which the pledgewas given.      It is therefore enough for me to invite carefulconsideration to Sir Geoffrey Whiskard!s summing up andrecommendations in his report on a public local inquiry heldinto the Stanford proposals.      (The relevant passages of his report ore given in the Annex.      The full text is attached toL.P. (hS) hli).      He recommends in most emphatic terms that theWar Department proposals for a practical training area should be abandoned because of the pledge given to people evacuated from their homes that they would be allowed to return at the end of the war;although, but for that pledge,  he would, with considerablehesitation and doubt,  have come to the conclusion that the area should be retained by the military authorities.7. I hove referred above to the implications in respectof military training of a decision to reject the Stanford proposals by reason of the pledge given.      Another repercussion of adecision on that ground would be the effect on the tank gunneryproposals at Purbeck.      It will be seen from the report of thepublic local inquiry that promises were made in that case and Ifind it difficult to draw any distinction,  as regards the pledge given, between the Purbeck case and the Stanford case.8. I do not see how,  in these circumstances,  if theStanford proposals are abandoned because of the pledge given,  adifferent course could be taken on the Purbeek proposals.      Toabandon the latter immediately would,  however,  leave the Arraywithout any tank gunnery school.      There is a strong case againstthe Purbeck proposals on industrial,  amenity,  and scientificgrounds and for this reason it will in any event be necessaryto consider them very carefully as a long-term proposal;    but
it would &quot;be unfortunate if we were driven to abandon the ;-.rec.immediately by a decision on the Stanford case arrived at withoutsufficient regard to the repercussions on the Purbeck case.9* The decision on the question whether in the last resortthe Government should, whatever the effect on security,  honourthe pledge given or refuse to honour it is manifestly one of theravest difficulty.      Sir Geoffrey V/hiskard says &quot;if&apos;once theythe inhabitants) are led to believe that a democratic BritishGovernment can give a solemn pledge, and then, merely (us itseems to them) because it is convenient to do so, disregard it,they will go far towards losing faith in democratic government as such.&quot;      If it were the fact that only a question&quot;of convenience to Government were involved, then the issue would besimple,  for there could then be no doubt that the Governmentshould, -without hesitation,  honour its pledge unconditionally.It is,   however,  not merely a question of convenience.      Had anemergency actually developed it would be seen by all to be amatter of the direst national necessity.      In absence of adeclared emergency it may not be a matter of dire necessity, but,in the present troubled state of the world,  something very muchmore serious than convenience is at stake.10. My own feeling therefore is that, before a decision istaken to abandon the Stanford area,  the gravity of the issueshould be put frankly to those concerned,  through the informalorganisation which has boon formed to leek after their interests,in the hope (although I am informed that it cannot be a strongone) that the majority of these concerned would be patriotic enoughto absolve the Government from their pledge.      The reasons why no alternative area can be found,  the disturbance of people in another area even if a suitable alternative could be f a .;nd,  andthe dangers to national security if the area were given up withouton alternative,  could all be put to these concerned, together withthe consideration of self-interest  (which might have more weight),that there would be a greater risk of future disturbance in theStanford area if an emergency developed again than in some otherarea in which alternative accommodation might be found.11. This course might be criticised on the ground that,  if in fact national security is at stake,  the Government are not justified in leaving the matter at the mercy of the judgment - and perhaps the obstinacy - of a small number of inhabitants in aparticular area.      At the other extreme it might be said that theGovernment,  even though the majority of the inhabitants affectedagreed to absolve them from the pledge,  would not be justified inbreaking it as regards others.      My inclination is towards themiddle course.      I feel that the risk to security is not s- clear and immediate as to justify rejection of the pledge if themajority of those concerned,  despite explanations,  still demand that the promise to restore them to their homes should be honoured,but that/if the majority were satisfied on the lines I havesuggested,  the Government would be justified in disregarding thedissent of the minority.      As I have pointed out, Sir GeoffreyWhiskard bases his recommendations very largely on his assumpti .;that it would seem to those concerned that the Government ;voredisregarding the pledge merely as a matter of convenience.    Thiswould no longer be true if the majority of those concerned were satisfied that the Government were justified by weighty reasons of the most serious national import.      I should perhaps-add thai;it seems to me that it would, be useless to enter into such negotiations as I have in mind unless it would be possible fir the
Government to find satisfactory accommodation for those concerned - a matter,  I understands on which there is agood deal of doubt;    and that in any case if the effortI suggest fails to satisfy the majority of those concerned that it is for the general good that the pledge given should not be honoured,  then,  in my view, forthe reasons given by Sir Geoffrey Whiskard, the pledgeshould be honoured.L.Ministry of Town and Country Planning,8.

ANNEX ^^&apos;^2AlS^22 lJ^M&apos;^E^^LB:i9^i^ Pr-proposals forthe Stanford Area(Pull text of the Report is given in the Annex toL. P- (1+8) kh)Summing-up and recommendations i appreciate,  Sir,  that you appointed me solely forthe purpose of hearing representations and not of making recommendations thereon.      Nevertheless I venture to append thefollowing recommendations to this Report in the hope that theymay possibly be of assistance to you in reaching a decision.On the basic assumption that if this area were to be released another area of approximately equal size would have tobe taken elsewhere within the Eastern Command,  and disregardingfor the moment the question of the pledge,  I should have recommended, though with: considerable hesitation and doubt,that the area should be retained by the military authorities.It is true that the greater pert of the land within the area isalmost certainly of substantially greater agricultural value than was supposed to be the case when the area was firstrequisitioned;    but this greater value is not as yet fullyproved over a  period of years,  arid moreover, with the changes in agricultural practice which have token place in recent years,  itis quite possible that the same might be equally true of anyother area,  selected partly on the ground that it was of lowagricultural value, which might be taken in substitution forthis area.      It is true that,  leaving aside for the momentconsiderations arising out of the pledge,  great social hardshipwould be caused by retention of the area;    but this would equallybe caused by the occupation of any  other similar area.      It istrue that the peculiar character of the area,  the heart ofBrec Island, would be adversely affected by its retention as aBattle Training Area;    but it seems clear that adequate safeguards can be provided for the special interests of science,archaeology and natural history,  and, moreover,  that thecharacter of the area would be oven more strongly affected bythe much more intensive cultivation which would take place ifit were to be returned to its former owners and occupiers.Finally it is true that heavy costs,  over and above the costs of acquisition, would be incurred by the retention of the area.Compensation would presumably be payable in respect ofM.R.  Driers factory and of other buildings and works carriedout since the war,  insofar as,  though the use of these buildings and works in the Assembly Areas will not be completely prevented,the advantages which they were reasonably expected to producewill certaily be materially diminished.      Further, if thearea is retained,  it.will,  in my view, be essential to raisethe standard of both diversion routes to Class II level,  at an approximate cost of nearly a quarter of a million pounds,   and,in addition,  to provide bridges over the three level crossingson the Watton-Thetford diversion.      But I imagine that comparableincidental costs,  over and above the cost of actual acquisition,would be likely to be incurred whatever area were selected.
On a balance of these considerations, and leaving aside the question of the Pledge,  I should,  as I hove stated,recommend that the area should be retained.But the Pledge cannot be left aside.      On thecontrary it is, in my view, the most important of all the considerations which arise.I have no doubt that a pledge, in an unusually solemnform, was given by those whom the inhabitants might  properlysuppose were authorised to give such a pledge, with the utmostpublicity, and on several occasions;    and that this pledgewas,  with every apparent justification,   adopted as their ownby Lord Walsingham and other persons of influence in the locality, whose personal faith is thereby,  in their opinion and in the opinion of those whom they influenced, involved.I have no doubt that it was on the strength  of those pledgesthat the inhabitants of the Battle Area vacated their houses and land,  and that the inhabitants of the Assembly Areassubmitted to very great inconvenience and damage, with acomparatively good grace and as a patriotic duty.      And I haveno doubt that it was in complete reliance on these pledges thatworks have been undertaken and plans put in hand which will be largely,   if not wholly,  frustrated if the area is retained.I appreciate that,   as the White Paper says,  &quot;if an area in respect of which a pledge was given were surrenderedand a new area taken up,  one result would be the eviction  ofthe residents in the new area for the benefit of thoseoriginally displaced&quot;.      This is no doubt true:    but,  as sir Walter Monckton pointed out, no pledge has been or will begiven to the inhabitants of the new area, whereas pledges ofthe must  precise and solemn kind have been given to theinhabitants of this area.      That,  to my mind,  is a considerationto which the greatest possible weight should be given.Ycu should not be in doubt,  Sir,  that if the  pledgewhich has been given in respect of this area is now broken,  alltrust in the publicly pledged faith,   and in the ordinaryhonesty,  of Government - of any Government - will be destroyednot only in this area but throughout a great part of Norfolkand Suffolk,  and for a very long time.      These are o simple andalow-minded people,  tenaciously attached to the soil, where ahigh proportion  of families hove been settled for hundreds ofyears,  of long memories and slow to relinquish either a trust or&apos; a mistrust,  once it has been firmly implanted.      If once theyi arc led to believe that a democratic British Government can giveI a solemn pledge, and then, merely (as it seems to them) because it is convenient to do so,  disregard it,  they will go fartowards losing faith in democratic government as such.      That- is not a result which,  in my view,   any Government should lightlyincur.I therefore strongly recommend that the pledge,publicly    and solemnly given and unquestioningly accepted,should be kept,  and that the Battle Area,  the Assembly Areas andthe Gun Sites should be released by the military authorities.
