INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENTWashington, 6th March, 1948PreambleThe Governments on whose behalf this Agreement has been signed,Recognising that there is now a serious shortage of wheat, and that laterthere may be a serious surplus;Believing that the high prices resulting from the present shortage andthe low prices which would result from a future surplus are harmful to their interests, whether they are producers or consumers of wheat; andConcluding therefore that their interests, and the general interest of allcountries in economic expansion, require that they should co-operate to bringorder into the international wheat market,Have agreed as follows: Article IObjectivesThe objectives of this Agreement are to assure supplies of wheat toimporting countries and to assure markets to exporting countries at equitableand stable prices.Article IIRights and Obligations of Importing and Exporting countries.

which desire to guarantee additional purchases. The redistribution to such countries shall be pro rata to their existing guaranteed purchases, unless theCouncil should otherwise decide by a simple majority of the exporting andimporting countries voting separately. Should the additional purchaseswhich contracting importing countries desire to guarantee be less than the guaranteed purchases of the countries referred to in (a), (b), (c), and (d) above,the Council shall reduce pro rata the figures in Annex II to Article II by theamount necessary to make the total of them equal to the total of the figures in Annex I to Article II.h 4.

Should an exporting and an importing countrybetween which no transactions have hitherto taken place fail to agree on the currency in which payment should be made, the Council shall decide the issue.Article VAdjustment of Obligations1. Any contracting Government which fears that it may be preventedcircumstances, such as a short crop in the case of an exporting country or such as the necessity to safeguard its balance of payments or monetaryreserves in the case of an importing country, from carrying out its obligations and other responsibilities under this Agreement shall report the matter tothe Council.2. Where the above provisions with respect to the balance of payments and monetary reserves are invoked the Council shall seek and take into account,together with all relevant facts, the opinion of the International monetary fund as to the existence and the extent of the necessity referred to inparagraph 1 of this Article.3. The Council shall discuss the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1above with the country concerned and if the Council finds that such country&apos;srepresentations are well founded it shall so rule, and if no other mutuallyacceptable remedy can be found the Council shall, in the first instance, if thereporting country is an importing country, invite the other importing countries and, if the reporting country is an exporting country, invite the other exporting countries, to assume the obligations which cannot be fulfilled. If the difficultycannot be solved in this way, the Council shall invite the exporting countries,if the reporting country is an importing country, or- the importing countries,if the reporting country is an exporting country, to consider whether any oneor more of them can assist the reporting country to fulfil its obligations or,failing that, accept a reduction in its or their guaranteed quantities for thecurrent crop-year corresponding to the obligations which cannot be fulfilled.4. If the reporting country cannot be assisted by the procedure set out inparagraph 3 of this Article and it is apparent to the Council that it will not carry out its obligations, the following procedure shall be adopted. If thereporting country is an exporting country, the Council shall forthwith reducethe total of the guaranteed purchases in Annex I to Article II for the currentcrop-year to an amount equal to the total of the guaranteed sales which willremain in Annex II to Article II for the current crop-year after account hasbeen taken of the prospective failure of one of the exporting countries tocarry out its obligations. If the reporting country is an importing country,the Council shall reduce the total of the guaranteed sales in Annex II to article II for the current crop-year to an amount equal to the total of the guaranteed purchases which will remain in Annex I to Article II for the currentcrop-year after account has been taken of the prospective failure of oneof the importing countries to carry out its obligations. In adjusting individualquantities in Annex II to Article II for this purpose each figure in the Annexshall be reduced by the same proportion, unless the exporting countries concerned agree otherwise.5. If the Council finds that the reporting country&apos;s representations are well founded, that country shall not be deemed to have committed a breach of this Agreement whether it is relieved of its obligations by the procedureset out in paragraph 3 of this Article or recourse is had to the procedure setout in paragraph 4 of this Article. If the Council finds that the reportingcountry&apos;s representations are not well founded it shall so advise that country
and request it to carry out its obligations. Should any contracrhigGsT-snnsEfisn;subsequently allege that the country concerned has noi caused esst hsobligations the Council shall apply the procedure prescribed in Tazs^Esa 3of Article XIII.6. If, in order to meet a critical need which has arisen or threaEsss terarise, a contracting Government should appeal to the Council lor asasiaacein obtaining supplies of wheat in addition to its guaranteed -gaaaSiy, HeCouncil may, by two-thirds of the votes held by the Governments -of impsniBs;countries and by two-thirds of the votes held by the Governments oiesssrd.-countries, reduce the guaranteed import quantities of tie other cHstsaafdg-importing countries for the current crop-year, on a.pro rma basis, fey an ssiyiEstsufficient to provide the quantity of wheat which the Conncfl delssanines to benecessary to relieve the emergency created by the critical need, provided idarthe Council agrees that such emergency cannot be met in any other mHssas-.Article VIPrices1.
