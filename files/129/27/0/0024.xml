Previous estimate of prospects for 1948. In the review which I madelast July of the prospects of United Kingdom dry cargo shipping over the next two or three years (L.P. (47) 102 Revise) I indicated that one of the important factors affecting the short-term position was our obligation to return the UnitedStates wartime built ships then on bareboat charter. Having regard to this obligation, and assuming no serious deterioration in turn-round, I estimated thatwe could provide for imports into the United Kingdom of about 38 million tonsof food and raw materials (excluding oil) during 1948 in the ships under our control and with the assistance of about 1 - 75 million tons deadweight of foreign ships continuously in our employment. At the same time we should be ableto provide about 4 million tons deadweight of ocean-going shipping for employ-ment on foreign currency earning cross trades and to meet the other commitments for which His Majesty&apos;s Government has shipping responsibility.2. New factors. Since my previous review new factors have arisen. First,the European Recovery Programme has been launched on the dual basis of mutualself-help among the Western European countries and United States assistance.It is too early yet to judge the full impact of the European Recovery Programmeeither on the availability of cargo or on the mercantile marines of the partici-pating countries, but there are certain disturbing provisions in the economic co-operation Act which may, unless wisely and liberally interpreted, have seriousadverse repercussions on our shipping prospects. These are discussed in detail in paragraphs 7 and 8 below.3. Secondly, there is the increasing need to go further afield for our supplies in order to save dollars by substituting non-dollar food and materials for suppliesformerly obtained from North America. This substitution usually involves longershipping hauls, e.g., the carriage of large quantities of cereals from Australiainstead of from Canada. Further reference to the effect of these australian wheat shipments is made in paragraph 9 below.4. Current United Kingdom import programmes. Our latest estimate ofthe probable dry cargo imports into the United Kingdom in 1948, after taking into account European Recovery Programme developments, is 41-7 million tons.Actual imports during the first four months of the year were 13-2 million tons and the total for the first half year is estimated at about 20 million tons.Owing to seasonal considerations, imports during the first six months of theyear are always below one half of the annual programme. With the assistanceof foreign charters, adequate shipping is available to cover the import programme and supplies are being lifted promptly as they are ready for shipment.The total shipping under foreign flags employed for United kingdom imports, and in the other programmes for which His Majesty&apos;s Government has accepted a measure of responsibility, is at present running at the equivalent ofabout 2 million deadweight tons in continuous employment. Fortunately, theamount of dollar tonnage which it has been necessary to charter to cover theincreased import programme has been below expectations owing to the greateravailability for our service of foreign ships willing to accept sterling or other non-dollar currency. Details of our foreign chartering during the last few monthsare given in paragraph 6.35466SECRETCP. (48) 1449th June, 1948
5. Other programmes for which His Majesty&apos;s Government has assumedshipping responsibility. The principal programmes, apart from United kingdom imports, for which we have undertaken a measure of shipping responsibilityare: . (a) Imports to other parts of the Commonwealth and assistance with coa,stalmovement in&quot; British territories overseas. These include the carriage of rice from Burma, Siam, Egypt and Brazil to India, Ceylon and malaya; wheat from Australia to India, Ceylon, Malaya and otherEar Eastern countries; phosphates from North Africa and the PacificIslands, to South Africa, Australia and New Zealand; coal from SouthAfrica to bunker stations in various parts of the world, and coastalmovements in India and Australia and between Australia and NewZealand. This help, including that afforded by the regular linerservices in the cross trades, is at present equivalent to about-75 million tons of shipping in continuous employment.(b) Imports (principally grain) from North America and from theMediterranean (principally phosphates and pyrites) to western germany. Under the Germany Fusion Agreement we are committed to provide a monthly average of twelve bulk carriers of about 10,000tons each to transport cereals from North America to the CombinedZone of Germany. We are also committed to give what help wecan in lifting the annual programme of 357,000 tons of phosphatesand the short-term programme of 29,000 tons of pyrites from theMediterranean. The assistance we have given over January to Aprilthis year to the Combined Zone (apart from the regular liner services)has been equal to about 300,000 tons deadweight of shipping in con-tinuous employment. In addition, though we have no specific obliga-tion, we have rendered shipping services to the other countries inEurope participating in the European Recovery Programme equivalentto about 350,000 tons deadweight of shipping in continuous employ -ment (excluding parcels in regular ocean-going liners).6. Foreign chartering. During the four months January to April, 1948,foreign shipping has been in our employment to the following extent: Equivalent tonnage incontinuous employment&apos;000 tons deadweightNon-dollar tonnageOn Time Charter............... 225On Voyage Charter     ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 900On Liner berth ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 275Total    .................. 1,400Dollar tonnageOn Voyage Charter :(i) Canadian ships    ......      ...      - - -      - - - 100(ii) United States ships        ............ 225(iii) Other dollar ships        ......       ...       ... .10On liner berth.........      ...               ... 265Total dollar tonnage ...       ...       ...       ... 600Total of all flags        .........       2,000During the first few months of the year we also had the use of the followingdollar shipping on bareboat charter from Canada and the United States but-operating under the United Kingdom flag, viz. : .&apos;000 tons deadweight(i) Canadian ships     ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 900(ii) United States ships (&apos;&quot; Sams &quot;)......... 450Total      ... .........      ....       1,350
It is expected that the amount of foreign shipping in our employment inthe second half of the year will rise to about 2-75 million tons. The post ofthe dollar tonnage which we shall have to employ will also tend to rise because ofthe necessity to replace, in part, by voyage charters the dollar tonnage whichuntil recently we have had on bareboat charter.7. Redelivery of the &quot; Sams.&quot;-At 1st January, 1948, we had forty&quot;Sams &quot; on bareboat charter from the United States Government. Under theoriginal agreement these were due for redelivery by 31st March, 1948. We were,however, led to believe that in consequence of the arrangements which the UnitedStates Government were hoping to make for chartering ships on bareboat terms to certain European countries under the European Eecovery Programme weshould be able to retain the forty &quot; Sams &quot; for such time as we required them.Unfortunately, Congress deleted the provision permitting bareboat charteringfrom the Economic Co-operation Act. This left the United States Governmentwith no option but to insist on compliance with the terms of the original agreementrequiring us to redeliver our forty &quot;Sam&quot; ships at once. Most of the ships have already been redelivered and the remainder will be redelivered as theycomplete their present commitments and in any event by about 30th June, 1948.It is of interest to mention, in view of the attitude adopted by Congress inthis matter, that there is at present very little employment for these redeliveredships under the United States flag and many of them are being laid up as theyare returned.An obvious consequence of the redelivery of these &quot;Sam&quot; ships and the elimination of the bareboat provision from the European Recovery Programmelegislation is that the dollar expenditure on shipping of the participating countries, including the United Kingdom, will be increased and the overall dollarposition of the participating countries made so much the worse. As the totaldollar provision, under the first year&apos;s appropriation at least, is likely to be much less than the needs of the participating countries the necessity to use more dollars for shipping services will inevitably mean less dollars for commodities.On the other hand, from the point of view of our long-term shipping interests,it is reassuring to know that there is now no risk that ships bareboat-charteredunder the European Recovery Programme might become permanent accretions atlittle or no cost to the fleets of France, Italy, Greece, or Germany. It is alsosignificant that, with the deletion of the bareboat provisions from the economic co-operation Act, the earlier United States criticism of the United Kingdomshipbuilding programme has ceased.8. Requirement to carry at least half of the European Recovery Programmecommodities &quot;procured in United States flag ships. Contrary to the views of theUnited States Government, a provision was inserted by Congress in the economic co-operation Act requiring the Administrator to &quot; take such steps as may benecessary to assure, so far as is practicable, that at least 50per centum of the grosstonnage of commodities, procured within the United States out of funds madeavailable under this title and transported abroad on ocean vessels, is so transportedon United States flag vessels to the extent such vessels are available at marketrates.&quot;Besides being contrary to the policy of the United States Government andto some of their international obligations, this provision is discriminatory and, ifrigidly applied, may seriously affect United Kingdom shipping interests. Unfor-unfortunately, it is not the first time that shipping clauses of this character have been inserted in United States legislation where aid under public funds is being givento foreign countries. The United States Government, acting through theEconomic Co-operation Administrator, now have the duty of interpreting andadministering the provision as best they can, having regard on the one hand tothe expressed wishes of Congress and on the other to their international commit-ments and policy.Provided the Administrator interprets the clause in a broad manner and iscontent that at least half of the total European Recovery Programme suppliesprocured in the United States is carried to the participating countries in UnitedStates ships and does not attempt to relate the provision to individual commodities or to each country separately, no undue difficulty is likely to arise, atleast up to July 1949. We calculate that during the year July 1948 to June 1949about 900 ships in all will be required to carry European Recovery Programmecargoes from the United States, and of these about 500 will be American ships.But although overall it may be possible to satisfy the condition imposed by-Congress, it will entail a great deal of unnecessary arrangement and adjustment
of the uses to which United States shipping taken up by the participating countries is put. The United Kingdom, for example, used very little United Statestramp tonnage in trades from the United States to the United Kingdom. Usuallywe take up United States ships to help us with our programmes from Canada andoccasionally from the Plate and Australia.Discussions with the United States officials concerned have elicited that itis the intention of the Administrator, at least at the outset, to ask the participating countries, acting through the Maritime Transport Committee of the organisation for European Economic Co-operation, to undertake the responsibility of satisfyinghim that the spirit and intention of the clause is being observed. From the UnitedKingdom point of view this is the most reasonable course we can expect and weshall continue to watch the position and to endeavour, through the maritime transport Committee, to preserve a common approach to the problem by theEuropean Maritime countries.9. Effect on oar shipping resources of Australian wheat shipments. Formany years practically no supplies of Australian wheat came to the UnitedKingdom. The exceptionally good Australian harvest in 1947, coupled with ourshortage of dollars, has resulted in a sharp increase in the requirement for shipping to bring grain from Australia to this country. Over most of 1948 about25 ships a month will be required for this purpose. Many of these will have tomake long ballast voyages some from the United Kingdom to their loadingports in Australia. This exceptionally long haul is imposing a severe strain onour bulk-carrying shipping capacity. It takes nearly three times as long to fetchgrain from Australia as from the eastern seaboard of Canada. But for this requirement, our voyage chartering of dollar shipping in 1948 would have beenreduced to very small proportions. The saving in dollars effected by the purchaseof Australian wheat has therefore been offset to some extent by the extra dollarshipping cost.10. Conclusions. It is now estimated that for 1948 we shall require the.equivalent of about 2-4 million tons deadweight of foreign ships in continuousemployment over the year (i.e., 2 million tons in the first six months and 2-75million tons in the second six months) as against the previous estimate of1-75 million tons. The latter estimate was, however, made in relation to a united Kingdom import programme of 38 million tons, whereas the present import programme is 41-7 million tons. We foresee no special difficulty in obtaining this amount of foreign tonnage, and in so far as such tonnage can only be obtained for dollars, we anticipate that it will be possible to cover the cost under theEuropean Recovery Programme. In this connection our claim for european recovery Programme financing for the quarter July to September, 1948 includes12 million dollars for freights on dry cargo ships and we shall shortly be considering the figure to be included for this purpose in the programme for theperiod July, 1948 to June, 1949.It is, however, important, that our dependence on dollar chartering shouldbe kept as low as possible in view of the inadequacy of European recovery programme aid to cover our full needs and the fact that European recovery programme shipping finance can be obtained only at the expense of the dollarswhich would otherwise be available for commodities.For this reason every effort must be made, through improved turn round and otherwise, to obtain the most efficient use of our existing resources and encourage-ment should be given to owners to strengthen and modernise their fleets as quickly as possible. I will deal with these wider aspects of the matter in a more compre-hensive review of our shipping position and prospects which I hope to circulateshortly. Meantime my purpose in this memorandum is to keep my colleaguesinformed of certain features of the Economic Co-operation Act in relation to our shipping.Ministry of Transport. W. 1.9th June, 1948A.
