JjjJHIS  DOCUMENT IS   THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT   0 printed for the Cabinet.   May 1948CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. Q QCP. (48) 13126th May, 1948CABINETSOCIAL SERVICES IN WESTERN europe note by Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith the Report of the Official Committee on Social services in Western Europe, set up by decision of the Cabinet on 22nd February(CM. 48 (16) Conclusions Minute 2). The Committee have made a rapid survey of the extensive field covered by their terms of reference, and have put forwardcertain definite proposals relating to subjects on which useful results might beachieved by increased co-operation in Western Europe.2. These proposals appear to me well designed to secure early and solidprogress and if they commend themselves generally to my colleagues, I would propose to embody them in a suitable memorandum, based upon the Committee&apos;sReport, for submission to the Consultative Council established under ArticleVII of the Brussels Treaty. I am anxious that the machinery under the treaty should be used as soon as possible for promoting joint study and co-operation on important social questions and I therefore share the desire of the official committee that we should take the initiative in this matter.3. I think that the Committee and their Chairman, Sir G. Myrddin-Evans,are to be heartily congratulated on having prepared so comprehensive and valuable a report.E.

Pickford, Ministry of Labour and National Service.A summary of the Committee&apos;s principal conclusions is contained in paragraph 26of the Report.2. The Committee had scarcely begun their work when the Brussels treaty was concluded between the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the netherlands and Luxembourg.  Articles II and III of that Treaty read as follows :  &quot;Article II :-&quot; The High Contracting Parties will make every effort in common, bothby direct consultation and in specialised agencies, to promote the attainment of a higher standard of living by their peoples and to develop on corres-ponding lines the social and other related services pf their countries.&quot; The High Contracting Parties will consult with the object of achieving the earliest possible application of recommendations of immediatepractical interest, relating to social matters, adopted with their approval in the specialised agencies.&quot; They will endeavour to conclude as soon as possible conventions with each other in the sphere of social security.&quot;Article III :-The High Contracting Parties will make every effort in common to lead their peoples towards a better understanding of the principles whichform the basis of their common civilisation and to promote cultural exchangesby conventions between themselves or by other means.&quot;3. On 17th April the Foreign Ministers of the five Powers parties to the brussels Treaty, meeting in Paris, decided to establish permanent machinery for making effective the provisions of the Treaty on the following lines :-(i) a permanent Consultative Council  composed  of  the  five  foreign ministers, meeting at least once every three months;(ii) a permanent organ of the Council (known as the Permanent Commis-.....    slon)&apos; assisted by a secretariat, and meeting at least once a month-(iii) periodical meetings of Ministers or competent experts to deal witheconomic, social and cultural questions, and arising out of them theappointment of special committees as may be necessary.T&quot;ese develoPments have an important bearing on the enquiry whichthe Committee were instructed to make. In the first place it is implicit inArticle II of the Brussels Treaty that one of the main objectives of co-operation
between the Five Powers should be the development towards uniform standards of social services in their respective countries. In the second place the arrange-ments described in paragraph 3 above provide ready made machinery by which an approach to this objective can be initiated.5. In view of the first of these considerations the Committee have not thought it necessary to set down the arguments in favour of working towardsuniform standards of social services. They have proceeded on the assumptionthat that principle may be regarded as accepted in relation not only to the fiveStates which are parties to the Brussels Treaty, but to all the States of western europe. They have, however, felt it necessary to consider the meaning to begiven to the. phrase &quot; uniform standards of social services.&quot;6. There can be no present prospect of persuading the different countries concerned to adopt identical schemes in the field of the social services. Diver-gencies between the various existing schemes divergencies which are related to differing national circumstances and needs, customs and characteristics, history and thought -are so wide and in some cases so fundamental as to preclude atpresent the possibility, even if this were desirable, of achieving uniformity inthe details of such schemes. Moreover, the experience of the United StatesFederal Government in its relations with the States in the matter of social insurance suggests that a proposal for establishing identical schemes could only hope to succeed if it were accompanied by financial inducements, and in thepresent instance it can be presumed that none of the countries concerned wouldbe willing to offer financial inducements to the other countries for this purpose.This does not mean that as a long-term policy we should not aim at the adoptionof similar schemes for all the countries concerned. But it appears to the Com-mittee that the more practicable line of approach is to work towards broadequality of treatment in the field of social services. This means that the social services should be based on the same fundamental principles and, in the words of the Treaty of Brussels, should be developed on corresponding lines so that,for example, in the field of social insurance and health broadly similar services should be provided, and in the field of education broadly equivalent opportunitiesmade available. It is in this sense that the Committee have interpreted the phrase &quot; uniform standards of social services,&quot; and if the problem is approachedon this basis they feel that some solid advance might be achieved.7. Even on this somewhat limited front, however, progress is unlikely tobe easy or rapid and practicable methods of achieving it can only be determinedafter discussions with the other countries concerned. For this reason and also because in the case of the &quot; Brussels&quot; Powers machinery for such discussionsalready exists or will shortly come into being, the Committee consider that ingeneral it would be wise in the first instance to confine discussions to those powers with perhaps the addition of Italy. The other Western european countries could be brought in later, beginning probably with the scandinavian countries.8. The Committee think that it is important for this country to keep wellin the forefront in this matter. The Permanent Commission set up under the brussels Treaty has already decided to ask the participating Governments toput forward their suggestions for subjects to be studied under Articles II and iii of the Treaty, and for methods of handling them. To encourage a genuineexchange of ideas on this, and to try to keep the approach as practical as we can,we should put in our suggestions to the Permanent Commission as soon aspossible.9. In the course of their enquiry the Committee have obtained and examine ithe information readily available relating to the social services of a numberof the countries of Western Europe. A broad outline of the social services ofthe five &quot;Brussels&quot; States and Italy is contained in the Appendix to thisEeport.* This statement discloses wide divergencies between the social servicesof the various countries concerned, but for reasons already indicated the Committeehave not thought it necessary to make a detailed comparison of the various schemesitem by item. It is, in any case, doubtful whether this would be profitable sincecomparisons based upon the existence or absence of individual services, upon* Information relating to certain other Western European countries has been obtained, but is not attached in view of the Committee&apos;s recommendation that discussion should be confinedin the first place to the &quot; Brussels &quot; countries and Italy.35403 b 2
rates of benefit or even upon national expenditure on social services^ are boundto some extent to be misleading. But apart from this, an approach to the problemof encouraging corresponding developments of the services which depended oncomparisons of this nature would cause controversial discussion calculated toretard rather than expedite progress. It would not, for example facilitatematters if we took up directly with the French an omission from their social security Scheme which is outstanding in British eyes, i.e a State unemploymentinsurance scheme. The French could reply that they considered family allowancesmore important and would claim that British levels are, in this particular instance,below theirs.10 The Committee have accordingly approached the schemes in broad out-line for the purpose of making a start at identifying those subjects the study ofwhich can be expected to produce useful results in the way of increased co-operation in the social service field. Such increased co-operation would itself con-tribute towards the levelling up of social services in Western Europe, and mightwell form a basis, at a later date, for something more substantial. The Committeehave, from this point of view, considered each of the three main groups social security, health and education and their conclusions may be stated as follows.Social Security11. The social security schemes in the five countries adhering to the brussels treaty and in Italy vary considerably and there is no likelihood that they couldbe made uniform easily or quickly. The most useful course at present might wellbe to concentrate on the negotiation of reciprocal arrangements, in accordancewith the terms of paragraph 3 of Article II of the Brussels Treaty &quot; They (i.e.,the High Contracting Parties) will endeavour to conclude as soon as possible con-ventions with each other in the sphere of social security.&quot; This country hasalready gained useful experience in this field through discussions with NorthernIreland, Eire and the Dominions generally which in two cases have resulted inagreements. Discussions have been begun with the French Government on apossible basis for a reciprocal agreement and in their turn the French havenegotiated reciprocal agreements with Belgium and Italy. It looks, therefore,as though there is scope here for the conclusion of bilateral agreements betweenthe several countries concerned. The object of these agreements is to forge links between dissimilar systems. They are not directly a means of bringing aboutuniformity between the national social security schemes, nor of creating services where none has existed hitherto. Broadly speaking they would be designed toenable qualifications obtained in one country to qualify for benefit in the territory of the other party to the reciprocal agreement. The agreements might also includearrangements for one country to act as an &quot; agent &quot; for another in the adminis-tration of certain benefits abroad.12.   Clearly the negotiation of reciprocal agreements in the field of social security cannot be regarded as a substitute for securing uniform standards.   Infact, full reciprocity can only exist when substantially uniform standards are in being.  While reciprocal agreements of the type contemplated will not necessarilylead to the establishment of uniform standards, they do constitute a step forward and would in addition provide an opportunity for pooling ideas and exchanginginformation over a wider field.   They might in this way create opportunities foradvances to be made in due course over a wider front.   In the view of the Com-mittee, therefore, every effort should be made to press on with the negotiation ofsuch agreements as soon as possible, subject to the prior claims of the work of bringing into force the new social security schemes in this country.   While theagreements are clearly matters for bilateral negotiation it is the Committee&apos;s viewthat they are matters of concern to all the parties to the Brussels Treaty and thatthe Consultative Council should be kept informed of the general progress made in negotiating agreements or conventions of the kind contemplated in Article ii of the Treaty.   It is important that any progress reports on this subject madeto the Consultative Council should be submitted jointly by the two parties concerned.Health services13.   At present the health services of Western Europe are unequal in quality and scope and the provision of health services can hardly be considered separately* Information is being collected relating to comparative national expenditure on social services in the Brussels &quot; countries. The information is not yet complete and it has not been found possible to include a comprehensive statement in this Report. It was the Committee&apos;s view thatthe submission of the Report should not be delayed on this account
from the technical standards of those services. Improvement in technical stan-dards is largely a long-term matter. It depends in particular on the standardsot training and these vary to a wide degree. Any contributions which the UnitedKingdom can make to the improvement of technical standards in Europe will inthe long run contribute to the development of health services on correspondinglines. One possibility worthy of study is the interchange of medical and adminis-trative personnel at the various levels. British hospital training has a world-widereputation, and arrangements on a substantial scale both for the interchange of trained nurses, including Sister Tutors, and for the training in this country of student nurses would, at the present time, seem both practical and of mutualbenefit.14. Again, British progress in the field of rehabilitation of the disabled isnoteworthy and the experience of the United Kingdom may well repay study. Wecould probably learn something, too, from the study of the developments in this field in the other &quot; Brussels &quot; countries.15. More generally, the introduction in this country of a comprehensivehealth service will be watched with interest by the other countries, and by giving to them, through the organisation set up under the Brussels Treaty, information about the scheme, its history and development, it may well be possible to maintain and strengthen that interest.Education16. In the field of education it seems to the Committee that the objective to aim at is not uniformity in the organisation or the standards of educational in-struction, which would in any case be impracticable, but as large a measure aspossible of equality in the provision of educational facilities and in the oppor-tunities for education. In general, taking into account the divergencies due to national customs, characteristics and economic requirements, it would seem that from this point of view a fair measure of uniformity has already been achieved inthe various fields, including that of higher education. Where there are deficienciesthey are in many cases balanced by a corresponding emphasis in some other pro-vision, e.g., a lower school leaving age may to some extent be balanced by schemesof full time pre-employment training.17. Recently efforts have been made to strengthen the educational tiesbetween tl;&apos; country and other European countries by the conclusion of a seriesof bilateral &quot; cultural &quot; conventions. Such conventions have been concluded or are in progress of negotiation with Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Norway,Italy and Czechoslovakia. Similar conventions are in operation between belgium and the Netherlands and between Belgium and France. These conventions pro-vide among other things for the interchange of teachers and pupils, and of in-formation. The Committee regard the establishment of these particular relation-ships as of the first importance in the task of securing the fullest collaboration between the educational systems of Western Europe in general and of the partiesto the Brussels Treaty in particular, and consider that all possible steps should betaken to extend the scope and increase the effectiveness of the existing arrange-ments relating to educational matters. The extent of the relations already established between the &apos;&apos; Brussels &apos;&apos; Powers suggests that it may be desirable to study the possibility of making a five-Power agreement dealing with educationalmatters in greater detail than in our present bilateral cultural conventions. TheCommittee understand that the Netherlands representative has already mentionedin the Permanent Commission the idea of a five-Power cultural convention. Thiswould raise cultural questions outside the Committee&apos;s terms of reference, but a five-Power agreement for the regular exchange of ideas on educational servicesand developments might have useful results in promoting progress towardscommon standards.18. In the view of the Committee the school meals service and the provisionof milk to schoolchildren is a case in point. In one form or another the partiesto the Brussels Treaty each have some arrangements for feeding schoolchildren.The system in this country is the most fully developed and it seems to the Com-mittee that an account of the organisation here and of the results so far achievedmight usefully be given to the Consultative Council through its Permanent Corn-mission. Similarly, with the school leaving age. Here, the question is bound up with the age of admission to employment and it should be possible to initiatea discussion with particular reference to the International Labour Convention on
the subject of the age of admission to employment the attitude of this countryto which is at present being reconsidered in the light of the raising of the school leaving age.War Pensions19 The Committee have also given some consideration to the subject of warpensions in the countries in question. While the subject may not fall into thesame category as those already dealt with, either as regards its nature or as re-gards the possibilities of collaboration with other countries, nevertheless it is ofconsiderable importance as a social service in this country. Currently over amillion pensions are being distributed and, since the problems which arise are not peculiar to this country, it might be useful at an appropriate time to have an ex-change of views within the machinery of the Brussels Treaty. Certainly thereare features of the British system which are not paralleled in other countries andit may well be that the pooling of ideas will result in mutual advantages.20. The Committee feel that on the above lines much useful progress mightbe made. But a further and most promising line of approach is suggested by theterms of paragraph 2 of Article II of the Treaty of Brussels &quot; The High Contracting Parties will consult with the object of achieving the earliest possible application of recommendations of immediate practicalinterest, relating to social matters, adopted with their approval in the specialised agencies.&quot;21. Although other Specialised Agencies, for example the World health organisation and U.N.E.S.C.O., may be somewhat concerned now and will certainly be much concerned in future, the Specialised Agency principally affectedby this suggestion at present would be the I.L.O. In much of its work the I.L.O.proceeds by the adoption of Conventions and Recommendations in the field of social service, and it has already gone some way towards establishing, on paperat least, an international code. Those Conventions and Recommendations areto a considerable extent concerned with principles which could be of general application rather than with detailed schemes, the application of which to a wide range of countries at different stages of social development would give rise togreat difficulties. Also the I.L.O. Conventions and Recommendations do attempt,not always successfully it must be admitted, to strike a reasonable balance betweenwhat is ideal and what is practicable. They thus appear to provide a promising-field for joint examination and consultation. For example, the Conventionsrelating to the Age of Admission to Employment, which have already been mentioned, and the Conventions relating to Social Insurance would repay earlyexamination, while, looking to the near future, the same is true of the projectedinternational regulations relating to Employment Service Organisation andVocational Guidance, the former of which are likely to be adopted at this year&apos;conference and the latter at the 1949 Conference. The above are quoted only asexamples of the wide field covered by the I.L.O. on which, it appears to the Com-mittee, it would be profitable for the parties to the Brussels Treaty to exchangeviews. Accordingly, the Committee recommend that the Consultative council should be asked to arrange, through its Permanent Commission, for an examina-tion of the various I.L.O. Conventions and Recommendations with a view to considering and if possible determining the extent to which the countries concerned could give practical application to the provisions of these instruments.The Committee feel that this examination need not be confined, as appears to b^suggested m the Treaty of Brussels, to those Conventions and recommendations to which at the time of their adoption the countries concerned gave their assentIt may be that difficulties which at the time prevented countries from voting forthe adoption of a particular Convention or Recommendation will now be foundto have disappeared or at any rate to have lost much of their validitv And itseems to the Committee that if the examination which they propose should resultm the more general implementation by the countries concerned of the provisionsof the various Conventions and Recommendations this might have a profoundeffect upon the attitude of other States members of the I.L.0 and might haveresults more far-reaching than the immediate purpose of the examination.22 It must be admitted that such an examination would be a task of con-siderable magnitude, and careful consideration needs to be given to the procedure for carrying it out.   It is important that progress should not be bogged down a Pneral fatUre aild ^&quot;^ly the Committee f elf that theButish Government, in making to the Consultative Council the suggestion for
such an examination, should indicate certain specific sectors of the field, such,for example, as those mentioned in the preceding paragraph, on which a startmight be made. Moreover, the Committee suggest that in order to make as rapid progress as possible it might be desirable to entrust the examination to a numberof working parties which could perhaps be conducting their examinations ofdifferent aspects of the subject simultaneously.23. On the more general question of the machinery for ensuring co-operationbetween the &quot; Brussels &quot; Powers in the social field, the Committee would emphasise the desirability of deciding first the subjects to be tackled beforeestablishing any permanent committee for social questions. The field covers sowide a range of subjects that no single committee could tackle them all in detail with expert knowledge. Once the subjects for early study are identified andgrouped it would be possible for the Consultative Council and its permanent commision to decide how progress can best be made either by a meeting ofMinisters or by an ad hoc meeting of specialists, or by a combination of both.24. There is one further consideration to which the Committee would draw attention. It seems important that the joint consideration to be given underArticle II to Conventions and Recommendations already adopted by the specialised Agencies should extend also to consideration of projected inter-national regulations on social matters which are to come before future Conferencesof the Agencies. This would involve discussions between the Powers inadvance of and no doubt during Conferences. While favouring this course, theCommittee think it right to draw attention to the need for maintaining the fullestco-operation with the Commonwealth and ensuring that our close relationship with the Commonwealth delegation is in no way prejudiced.25. In making these various proposals the Committee are aware that theyare not likely to result in the immediate future in the establishment of uniformity in the social services of that part of Western Europe to which the Committeehave directed particular attention. In some cases, the proposals amount to littlemore than an exchange of ideas and experiences, in others to the extension anddevelopment of methods of co-operation and collaboration already in existence.It seems probable that the ultimate objective will best be furthered by cautiousand seemingly slow progress in the early stages. The matters dealt with aretechnical and detailed. In their history and development they go to the heart of national characteristics and national resources. That being so it will be better to establish agreement on particular and specific matters and to move on stageby stage, rather than to attempt to transform at virtually a single stroke theresults of many years of differing development and progress. Such an attemptcould not succeed and it is preferable to concentrate tne available man-power (andthis is small) on more limited objectives which offer the chance of useful results in the general direction of uniform standards. It is on these grounds that theCommittee make the suggestions contained in this Report, thinking that they offer the best hope of present progress and ultimate success.Principal Conclusions26.-.(1) It is implicit in Article II of the Treaty of Brussels that one of its main objectives is the development towards uniform standards of social services in the respective countries.(2) The Committee have proceeded on the assumption that this principle is accepted for all the States of Western Europe.(3) It is not at present practicable to establish identical social service schemes.(4) ixeal progress can be made in the near future by working for broadequality of treatment in the various services and their development alongcorresponding lines.(5) Discussions should take place on that basis beginning with the&quot; Brussels &quot; Powers and later extending to the other Western European nations.(6) Immediate progress can best be made by concentrating on specific subjects and, where appropriate, considering them under the machinery established underthe Brussels Treaty.(7) The United Kingdom should give a lead in putting forward to the Per-menant Commission subjects for discussion.   These might include  (a) the question of negotiating reciprocal agreements in the field of social security (paragraphs 11 and 12).(6) the development of the interchange of medical staffs and administrative officers engaged in the health services, including the interchange of
trained nurses and the training in this country of student nurses (para-graph 13).(c) the study of the various rehabilitation services (paragraph 14).(d) the study of the British comprehensive health service (paragraph 15).(e) the extension of the scope and increase of the effectiveness of the existing arrangements relating to educational matters (paragraph 17).(/) the possibility of five-Power agreements in educational matters, e.g., in-terchange of teachers and students and exchange of information (para-graph 17).(g) the examination of the level of the school leaving age, in connection withthe possible application of the Industrial Labour Conventions on theAge of Admission to Employment (paragraph 18).(h) the study of school meals and school milk services (paragraph 18).(?) the study of war pensions schemes, their scope and administration (para-graph 19).(8) The Permanent Commission should be invited to make arrangements inaccordance with Article II of the Treaty, for a systematic examination of the conventions and Recommendations of the I.L.O. and other Specialised Agenciesin the field of social services. The Committee have indicated certain subjects onwhich a start might be made.(9) There should also be consultation between the &quot; Brussels &quot; Powers on similar Conventions and Recommendations as they come before future Conferences.(10) It is not necessary or desirable at this stage to establish a permanentorgan under the Treaty for dealing with social questions as a whole.Signed, on behalf of the Committee,G. MYRDDIN-EVANS.18th May, 1948.APPENDIXThis Appendix contains an outline of provisions relating to social services in Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy. Theinformation relating to each country is divided into two main parts : A social security (compulsory insurance, workmen&apos;s compensation, non-contributory pensions and family allowances); and B Education. Within those parts theinformation is grouped under corresponding heads to enable the position on aparticular subject in each of the various countries to be readily ascertained.GREAT BRITAINA-Social security . Scope1. Employment injury. All persons employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship, except family or casual employees and those in occupationswhich the Minister excepts to prevent anomalies.2. Old age, death, maternity. All persons between school leaving andpensionable ages compulsorily insured for retirement, death and maternitybenefits, excepting that self-employed and non-employed persons not receiving anannual income of more than  104 may apply for exemption. Married womengenerally have the option of not paying contributions but qualifying by virtue oftheir husband&apos;s contributions, or of paying contributions and qualifying in theirown right.3. Sickness. All employed and self-employed persons between school leavingand pensionable ages, with exceptions and options noted under (2), are coni-pulsorily insured against sickness.4. Unemployment.

No allowance is payable in respectof a child receiving an orphan&apos;s pension.6. Medical care. All persons are entitled to medical care services underthe National Health Service without regard to age, employment status, or means.II. BenefitsMedical CareThe National Health Service Act provides for general medical and dentalservices, hospital and specialist services, pharmaceutical services, supplementaryophthalmic services, appliances, home nursing, child welfare, vaccination, &amp;c.Services to begin on 5th July, 1948. No insurance test or means test is prescribedas a&apos; condition for receipt of services.Cash BenefitsA. Temporary incapacity. Employment injury. &quot; Injury benefit&quot; is payable at the rate of 45s.per week, plus 16s. for adult dependant and Is. Qd. for first child, duringincapacity lasting up to 26 weeks. No minimum contribution requirement, butbenefit subject to 3-day waiting period unless incapacity lasts not less than12 days within period ending not later than 26 weeks after accident.2. Sickness. Benefit payable at rate of 26s. per week for single person ormarried man, plus 16s. for adult dependant and 7s. 6d. for a first child; and 16s.for gainfully occupied married woman. Duration of benefit unlimited if 156 con-tributions have been paid; otherwise, benefit payable up to 52 weeks if 26 con-tributions paid and 50 paid or credited on last contribution year (if latter condi-tion not fully met, reduced benefits may be provided). Three-day waiting periodrequired at beginning of sickness, but benefit paid for this if incapacity lasts 12days within following 13 weeks.3. Maternity. Lump sum maternity grant of  4 payable to woman contrhbutor or wife of insured man, if 26 contributions paid between entry into insur-ance and confinement and 26 contributions paid or credited during last contributionyear.

Attendance allowance of 20s. per week payable for 4 weeks to non-working women, subject to same conditions as for maternity grant.B. Permanent incapacity. Employment injury. Insured person suffering total or partial loss of physical or mental faculty after end of 26-week &quot; injury benefit &quot; period receives&quot; disablement benefit &quot; at a rate from 9s. to 45s. per week, according to assesseddegree of disablement (lump sum payment if latter below 20 per cent.); this maybe increased for adult dependant by 16s. and for a first child by 7s. 6d. An &quot; un-employabiliiy supplement &quot; of 20s. per week is payable to victim unable to earnmore than  52 annually, and a &quot; special hardship allowance &quot; of 11s. 3d. may bepaid to other victims incapable of following their regular occupation. A &quot; con-stant attendance allowance &quot; of 20s. per week (more in exceptional cases) is pay-able to victims needing attendance and not receiving in-patient hospitalisation.2. Invalidity. Sickness benefit under A 2 payable for an unlimited period,if 156 contributions have been paid.C-Old AgeA retirement pension of 26s. per week, plus 16s. for a wife and 7s. 6d. for a first child, is payable to men at age 65 and to women at age 60. A total of 156 con-tributions must have been paid between entry into insurance and pensionable age,with a yearly average of at least 50 contributions paid or credited (if latter con-dition not fully met pension at a reduced rate may be paid). Retirement isrequired unless pensioner is 5 years above pensionable age, and, except in latter case, benefit is reduced by Is. for each shilling above 20 earned in a week. Em-ployees and self-employed persons may defer their pension, continue to contribute,35403 c
and thus increase their pension rate by Is. a week for every 2o contributions afterattainment of pensionable age; this also increases basic pension of the wile. W iteof pensioner entitled to separate pension by virtue of her husband s insurancewhen she becomes 60; she may, however, claim a pension on the basis of her owninsurance whether or not her husband has retired. A widow receiving a widow&apos;benefit immediately prior to age 60 qualifies for retirement pension by virtue ofher deceased husband&apos;s insurance.D. Death1. Employment injury. Widows of all victims receive 36s. per week for first 13 weeks after death. Thereafter, 30s. per week is paid to all widows eithercaring for a child, over 50 when husband dies or when child reaches school leaving age, or incapable of self-support. Widows in all other circumstances receive 20s.per week. Widows&apos; pensions cease upon remarriage, but a gratuity of one year&apos;pension is paid in that case. Widowers incapable of self-support whom the deceased wife had maintained receive 30s. per week. A supplement of 7s. Gd. isadded to pensions in respect of a first child. A pension of 20s. per week for oneparent and of 30s. for two is payable for life to surviving parents whom the insured worker had wholly or mainly maintained before his death; in cases of substantial maintenance, a gratuity of up to  78 may be paid to surviving parentsin lieu of pension. If neither a widow nor parents are pensionable, paymentsmay be made under certain circumstances to one adult relative of the deceased.2. Death from other causes. A widow&apos;s allowance of 36s. is payable to allwidows for the first 13 weeks of widowhood. A widowed mother&apos;s allowance of 33s. 6d. is payable thereafter to widows having dependent children, the allowance being reduced by weekly earnings in excess of 30s. If the widow is over 40 when the mother&apos;s allowance terminates and if not less than 10 years have elapsed since her marriage, she receives a widow &apos;s pension of 26s. per week,also reduced by weekly earnings above 30s.
