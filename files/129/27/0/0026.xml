(48) 125).2. The economic situation of the United Kingdom is very precarious andis likely to remain so for several years at least. We are still trying to do morethan our resources allow, and the strain is shown mainly in our balance ofpayments, and also in our unbalanced internal position.3. We are only maintaining our standards of consumption and of employ-ment with United States help; we do not know yet how much help we will getor the conditions on which it will be given: and we are very uncertain about how long the help will last. Although exports are now well above the 1938 level,the continued rise in the cost of imports is adding to the difficulty of cominginto balance.4. Internally we have still to man the essential industries and to increase productivity as fast as possible.5. We have already taken measures to work towards a balance both athome and abroad, by expanding exports, restricting hard currency imports, and developing new sources of production overseas. It may well be that further measures of these kinds will be necessary. Internally, we are beginning to correct the inflationary situation and are using all the means we can think ofto secure increases in productivity..6. All these measures will take time to produce their full effects. Someof them will lead to unpleasant consequences and we cannot expect that therewill not be occasional shortcomings or failures. It is essential that we should adhere consistently and firmly to the lines we have laid down for ourselves, andshould not be unduly perturbed, either by temporary setbacks, or by the emergence of the problems of adj ustment which are the consequences of our own policy.R. S. treasury Chambers,14th June, 1948.FORTNIGHTLY ECONOMIC report . Man-power the number of persons in civil employment continues to rise and at theend of April was only 5,000 short of 19 million 1 million more than in June1939. The number of men employed rose again in April and the number ofwomen, which had been falling since November 1947, also rose&quot; in - April by12,000 (Table 1).35479 b
2. Total, man-power in building and civil engineering rose again in april to 1,365,000 and is now back to the level of October 1947.Undermanned industries3. Table 2 shows what progress was made in April in securing more man-power for certain under-manned industries.4. The number of men on the colliery books has fallen back to 723,800 at29th May, compared with 723,900 at the beginning of the month.5. Recruitment in the textile industries is making some progress. Totalman-power rose from 664,000 in March to 670,000 in April. Cotton spinning,cotton weaving, wool and silk and rayon all secured more workers and therewas also an increase in employment in iron foundries (other than engineering).Z7 nemployment6. The number of insured persons registered as unemployed in Great Britainfell again for the fourth successive month to 290,000 at 10th May.II. ProductionCoal7. There are still no signs of any improvement in the production of deep-mined coal. Although output rose in the first week of June to 4-02 million tons,this was again below the target of 4-12 million tons for the week. In the firsttwelve weeks of the year production exceeded the target by 873,000 tons. By5th June this surplus had disappeared and total production of deep-mined coal for the 22 weeks had fallen short of the target for this period, by 508,000 tons.This deficit will not be offset by the surplus of opencast production over targetsince opencast coal contains a much smaller proportion of large coal. It now seems likely that there will be a deficiency in the output of large coal and a surplus of small uncleanea coal. Large coal is used mainly by railways, domestic consumers, gasworks and some industrial consumers and is needed for the export market. Unless the deep-mined coal target is achieved either exports or home consumption will have to suffer. The whole matter is to be considered at thenext meeting of the Production Committee in the first instance.8. Total distributed stocks have been planned to rise frozn 13 -1 million tons at 1st May to 16-8 million tons by the end of October. In the five weeks ended.5th June stocks rose by only 177,000 tons.9. Deliveries of coal for overseas shipments and bunkers rose further to436,000 tons in the last week of May (Table 3).Steel10. The output of steel ingots and castings rose further to 302,000 tons inthe week ended 15th May. The Whitsun holiday reduced output in the thirdweek of May to 270,000 tons but output recovered to 298,000 tons in the lastweek of the month. Pig-iron production, however, was not affected by the holidayand rose to 185,000 tons in the third week of May. Receipts at steel works and steel foundries of scrap bought in the home market have risen from 83,000 tonsa week in January to 91,000 tons a week in April. In spite of the high level ofsteel production, stocks of scrap and of pig-iron have been maintained during april and May (Table, 4).Textiles11. Textile production in May was affected by the Whitsun holiday (Table 5).The average weekly output of cotton yarn (including waste varns) was 16-5 millionlb. compared with the target of 17-8 million lb. for May. Total production for the first five months of the year amounted to 369 - 8 million lb. or 3 - 5 per cent,below the target for this period.12. The output of worsted yarn rose to 16 - 43 million lb. in April, exceeding the target for the month. Total production for the first four months of theyear was almost up to the target set. The output of woven wool fabrics, thoughgreater in April than in March, was still below the January level and total production for January to April was 5-8 per cent, below the target for thesemonths. There was no significant change in April in the production of ravonyarn and staple fibre.
Motor &quot;mhieEes13. The high, level of automobile production was maintained ih May.PBodmetioa of passenger cars (including chassis) for the export market exceeded5,000 a week for the second month in successsion (Table 6). More large carsare mow being; exported. The number of passenger vehicles with engines exceeding2,200 cjc produced for export has risen from 98 a week in January to 165 a week in &quot;14. The substantial expansion in our exports of motor vehicles in recent months has been due solely to exports of passenger cars. Although productionof commercial vehicles for the export market increased in May to 1,493 a weekthis is still below the level of 1,536 a week achieved in January.fflwmber of motor vehicles produced for export (including chassis)Passenger cars    Commercial vehiclesWeekly average      Weekly averageJanuaryFebruaryMareh*AprilMay ...4,1983,9084,7865,1025,087* Average of five weeks.1,5361,4231,4981,2841,493III. External Trade15. Provisional estimates by the Board of Trade show that the value ofBritish exports rose further in May from  126 million to  130 million. Thevalue of imports declined from the high figure of  185 million in April to 176 million in May, but this is still almost equal to the previous peak levelreached in July 1947.18. Figures are now available of the regional distribution of our external trade in April (Table 7). They show that the increase in the value of our imports to  185 million in April was accounted for wholly by increased importsfrom Eton-sterling- countries outside the Western Hemisphere. The value ofBritish exports to Western Hemisphere countries declined in April from  23 - 3to  20-7 million. Exports to non-sterling countries outside the western hemisphere increased to  42-8 million the highest level achieved so far.IY. Bilateral Negotiations17. Since my last report, the protracted negotiations with S.C.A.P. (Japan)have teen successfully concluded. The new overall payments agreement securesthat trade between Japan and the sterling area will be in convertible sterling,except for the purchase of Japanese textiles manufactured from cotton of UnitedStates origin. The stage is therefore set for the expansion of trade with japan and negotiations will shortly start in Tokyo between S.C.A.P. and as many ofthe sterling area countries as wish to join in.IS. The delegations from India and Pakistan have now arrived and the sterling balances discussions are in progress. The Ministerial talks on trade withEire will start in London on 17th June.19. The payments discussions in Chile, as a result of which we hope tosecure transferable account arrangements, are nearing thei r conclusion.20. The Russian Ambassador has been approached about the resumption oftrade talks., as provided for in the agreement of December 1947; so far no replyhas teen received.Y. -Balance of Payments21. As forecast in the last issue of this report, the net drain on reservessince mid-May has increased very substantially. Among the principal causeshave been heavy drawings by countries in the Rest of Sterling Area,particularly India and Australia, and a large purchase of tobacco costingover fp39 million, made much earlier than usual, part of which, atleast, it is hoped, will be reimbursed under Marshall Aid. Some of theinfluences which helped to produce the abnormally low drain of earlier weeks35479 b 2
have also probably weakened or disappeared, e.g., the building up of sterling balances on American Accounts and heavy diamond sales. The recorded increase,though rather disappointing, has not carried the rate of drain above the average level forecast earlier for the current quarter; that is, if purely abnormaltransactions like the tobacco purchase are allowed for. One noteworthy item onthe receipts side is a further instalment of over $17 million in gold from SouthAfrica in reimbursement of dollars paid out on her behalf in February last.22. Taking everything into account the net drain, which was only  6 million in the first half of May, rose to  15 million in the second half, making  21 million in the month as a whole, and may reach approximately  35 million in the first half of June including the  10 million for tobacco referred to in paragraph 21.23. Nothing has yet been received under Marshall Aid in reimbursement of expenditure made by us during the second quarter. On present arrangementswe stand to receive S300 million as grants and possibly an amount which has notyet been determined as loans, but these sums will only become available graduallyas plans for reimbursement are completed and the system gets under way. Littlecan be expected before the end of this quarter.24. On the United Kingdom Balance of Payments as a whole the tentativedeductions which can be drawn from the Trade and Navigation Accounts suggest(after allowance has been made for the difference between c.i.f. and f.o.b. imports and other relevant factors) that the value of imports is running at about 10 percent, above the rate forecast in the Economic Survey while exports are only alittle above. In consequence the total net visible deficit is likely to be of the orderof  150 million or more compared with  87 million forecast in the economic survey. This excess is divided between the non-sterling area outside the western hemisphere and the Sterling Area. With the latter it produces a reduction inour visible surplus rather than an increase in our deficit. Chief responsibilityfor the excess must be placed on the movement of import prices, which have risen by about 7-J per cent, in the first four months of this year against an increase of only 3 per cent, in export prices. It is too early to say whether the record oninvisible account will help to redress, to some extent at least, the adverse develop-ments in the visible trade balance, but present, purely preliminary, indicationssuggest that it might.25. It is however clear that our receipts from E.R.P. will not be sufficientto maintain our reserves intact at the present rate of drawing. We must thereforecontemplate further cuts in our dollar and gold expenditure when we settle our import programme for the next 12 months.Total Net Brain on Reserves^1947-First halfJuly    ...August...SeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember1948 january february march ...April   ...May  million4671331569367594857^43472021* Including drawings of United States and Canadian credits and the International monetary fund.YI. prices import and Export Prices26. The terms of trade, as measured by the relative movements of import and export prices, continue to move against us (Table 9). The index of import prices rose by 2 per cent, from 277 in March to 283 in April (1938 = 100). Thiswas due mainly to a 5 per cent, rise (from 319 to 336) in the index for rawmaterials, reflecting sharp increases in the prices of raw wool and eygptian cotton.  The index of export prices, on the other hand, rose by only 1 per cent.
27. Compared with April 1947 the prices that we have to pay for purimports of raw materials have risen by 29 per cent, while the prices that we receive for our exports have risen by only 12-5 per cent.Import and export, price indices(1938	^00)			April	A pril	Increase	1947	1948	per cent.Import prices 			Total ...	239	283	. +18-4Food, drink and tobacco   ...	235	259	4-10-2Raw materials	260	336	4-29-2Articles  wholly  or mainly			manufactured  ...	224	275 .	4-22-8Export prices 			Total ...      ......   .   ...	223	251	4-12-food, drink and tobacco   ...	217	223	4- 0-3Raw materials	212	306	4- 44-3Articles  wholly  or  mainly			manufactured  ...      ...	224	251	4-12-0Wholesale Prices28. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices rose by 0-5 per cent,in May to 217-3 (1938 = 100). The index of industrial materials and manu-factures increased by 0 - 7 per cent, due mainly to higher wool prices and a further increase in cotton prices.Prices in the United States29. Commodity prices have risen again slightly during the last month.Moody&apos;s index of staple commodity prices (31st December, 1931 = 100) increased from 414 on 3rd May to 427 on 24th May and has remained at this level since then.35479
