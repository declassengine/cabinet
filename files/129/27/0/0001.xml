(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET2J bh May,  19U8.CABINETTHE DEATH PENALTY IN THE SERVICES DISCIPLINARY CODESMemorandum..&quot;by the Minister of defence at their meeting on 15th April (0.1.(1+8)  28thConclusions, Minute 2) the Cabinet invited me to report,  afterconsultation with the Service Ministers, what consequentialalterations should &quot;be made in the powers of courts martial ifthe civil courts in this country were deprived of the power toimpose the death penalty for murder.2. The Services Disciplinary Codes,  embodied in the Armyand Air Porce Acts and in the Naval Discipline Act,  provide that courts martial may impose the death penalty:-(a) for crimes punishable by death under the civil cod.., -for practical purposes, murder and treason;(b) for certain very serious military offences (summarised in Appendix) which may be broadly classified astreachery,  sedition or mutiny,  and gross cowardicein action.3* The Service Ministers and I have considered these provisions and our conclusions are as follows:-(1) Murder.      We are agreed that if the death penalty for murderis suspended in the civil courts,  it should similarly be suspended in the Services Disciplinary Codes.      In the meantime;,in the unlikely event of a sentence of death for murder being&apos;imposed by a military court martial, we propose to ensure thatthe sentence shall be commuted to one of life imprisonment.The necessary amendments to the Army and Air force acts and to the Naval Discipline Act could best &quot;be effected by aslight amendment to Clause 70 of the Criminal Justice Bill,extending the application of the clause to Section 1  and soenabling the necessary amendments to the Services DisciplinaryCodes to be carried out by Order in Council.The alternative would be to include the appropriateamendments to the Array and Air Porce Acts in the J\9h9 Armyand Air Porce Annual Act,  and to amend the Naval discipline act by a special amending act at the next convenient opportunity.But this, would be more laborious as well as making it impossibleto carry out the amendments simultaneously for all three services.(2)  Treason.      Since the death penalty for treason in the civilcode has not been amended,  it will remain unaltered in theServices Disciplinary Codes.COPY NO. &quot;
5(30 Service Offences.      We are very strongly of the opinionthat in the interests of morale and discipline, and for the safety of our Forces on active service and in time of war,  the death penalty must &quot;be retained for the majority of theseoffences.A detailed examination has revealed one or two smallanomalies and anachronisms,  for example the provisions relating to cowardice in action,  the absence of any alternative to the death penalty in certain sections of theNaval Discipline Act,  and the sections of that Act relatingto convoys and arson in dockyards.      But these are in no way related to the abolition of the death penalty for murder.Their application in practice can be satisfactorily limited by administrative action.      There has been no recent dispositionin the Mouse tj Question the death penalty for militaryoffences,  and we think that if an intention to amend the fewprovisions in question were announced it might lead toembarrassing demands far the deletion of further provisions which would be unacceptable.      Accordingly we recommend thatno changes need &quot;be made at present,  or unless and until theService Departments find a convenient opportunity of bringingthese provisions up to date.It. Briefly we agree that the Services should follow thecivil code on,the death penalty for murder.      We do notconsider,  however, that the suspension of the death penalty for murder need imply any other changes in the provisions relating to the death penalty in the Services DisciplinaryCodes.Ministry of Defence,  S.W.1.2kth May,  1
