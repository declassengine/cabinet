-   v 80THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret .P.(U8) 128 COPY NO. JO25TH MAY, 19U-8CABINETWAR DEPARTMENT PROPOSALS FOR A PRACTICALTRAINING AREA AT STANFORDMemorandum by the Home secretary in pursuance of the request of the Lord President&apos;sCommittee (L.P.(h,8)  8th Meeting, Minute 2) I am submittingthis memorandum on the nature of the pledge given at Stanfordand on the question whether similar pledges were given atPurbcck and elsewhere.2. So far as regards Stanford and Purbeck,  it hasalready been announced in paragraph 1+8 of the White Paper onthe needs of the Armed Forces for land for training and other purposes (Cmd. 7278 of 1947) that the Government accept thefact that pledges were given or understood to be given that persons required to leave their homes would be allowed toreturn at the end of the war.3* The documentary records of the Home Office,  theMinistry of Home Security and the Civil Defence regional headquarters at Cambridge and Reading for these transactionsare incomplete.    It is, however, within the clear recollectionof officers concerned that the Deputy Regional Commissionerfor the Eastern Region and the Arniy Commander held a publicmeeting or meetings in the Stanford area to secure thewilling co-operation of the inhabitants in the clearance ofthe area and to explain the civil arrangements for theirevacuation and resettlement.   As will be seen from theappended copy of a letter from the Regional Commissionerfor the Eastern Region to the Minister of Home Securitydated. 20th March, 19h-5?  the people concerned &quot;were given bythe Army Connmander or his representative and by Lord Cranbrook,(the Deputy Regional Commissioner) the most unequivocalundertakings that they would be allowed to come back whenthe war was over&apos;,!.In the House of Lords on hth July, 191+.6,  the earl of Cranbrook referred to these meetings and the statements which were made at Stanford and said that &quot;hewas one of the people who gave the most definite promisesthat the people should have their land and houses returnedafter the war&quot;, and Lord Cranwortb stated that he had been present at one of the meetings and had heard the promisesbeing given by Lord Cranbrook.
4* There is nothing in the records to indicate whetheror not any of the pledges given at the meetings held in theStanford Area can he regarded as specifically applicable tothe Gooderstone Warren Area, which was occupied by the Air-Ministry.5. The circumstances of the Purbeck Area appear fromthe records to be somewhat different.    There is nothing inthe contemporary records of any specific pledges having beengiven but in 19kk representations were made to the regional commissioner by the Rural District Council as the result ofwhich he made inquiries of the War Office and eventuallyinformed the Rural District Council on ?th February, 19Uhf  thatthe War Office was unable to give any undertaking as to thereturn of this area.   Neither in the representations from the rural District Council, nor in the correspondence between the regional Commissioner and the War Office,  is there any reference to pledges and it is a reasonable inference fromthis that at any rate no such pledges had been given in thename of the Regional Conaiaissioner*6. The only other case in which records of any kindcan be found is that of Imber and the only information in the records of it is that the Regional Commissioner reportedin December, 1943*  that thirty-seven families were successfullyevacuated from this area.J . C . E .Home Office, S .W.1.,25th May, 1948.
APPENDIXCOPY OF LETTER FROM SIR WILL SPEI-T3  (regional commissioner FOR: EAST ANGLIA) TO MINISTER &apos;OFHOME SECURITY20th March, 1945.My dear Minister,You may remember that we have in this Regionthree Battle Training Areas,  from which the population wasremoved in order that the Army might hold large scale exerciseswith live ammunition and so give the troops some &quot;battleinoculation&quot; before they went into action.    In all some1500 people were turned out of their homes and forced to give up their means of livelihood.    In every case preliminarymeetings were held at which the necessity for this &quot;battleinoculation&quot; was explained to the people concerned, and atwhich on instructions from &apos;the &quot;war Office they were given bythe Army Commander or his representative and by Lord Cranbrookthe most unequivocal undertakings that the disturbance wasonly temporary and that they would be allowed to come backwhen the war was over.    In every case, when they realised thenecessity that this &quot;battle inoculation&quot; was going to savelives of many of our soldiers,  the people left with scarcelya grumble,  but fortified by the promise that they shouldultimately return to their homes.While -we have heard nothing official, I have strongreason to believe that the soldiers after the war will wantsome  such range or battle training area in every Command, andthat a proposal is likely to be put forward to retain one atleast of the three in this Region.    I feel very strongly, andI believe that both the Army Commanders who were concerned would agree with me,  that to retain any one of the areas would involve a real breach of faith, and I should be gratefulif you would consider urging on the Secretary of State forWar that whatever area is taken, and. I fully recognise thatone may be necessary,   it should not be an area in respect ofwhich so categorical assurances have been given.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      WILL SPENS.
