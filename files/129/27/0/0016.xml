(48) 1362nd June, 1948CABINETIRON AND STEEL bill memorandum by the Lord President of the council as Chairman of the Socialisation of Industries Committee I have throughoutdone all I could to help the two Ministers of Supply in working out schemes forthe socialisation of iron and steel in the light of policy approved by the Cabinetfrom time to time. It is the most complex item in our socialisation programme and was bound to cause anxious thought to us all. My colleagues may be assured that I will continue to tender all the assistance I am able to give. NeverthelessI feel it my duty to draw the attention of the Cabinet to certain difficulties inthe argument set out in the paper of the Minister of Supply (CP. (48) 123) nowunder consideration.2. The Minister of Supply&apos;s paper sets out the position reached after examination of the Iron and Steel Bill by the Socialisation of industries committee. On the question with which the Committee was mainly concerned namely the scope of public ownership I am not fully persuaded in my own mind that Scheme C, which involves the acquisition of 240 companies in all (including155 subsidiaries) is preferable to Scheme D which involves the acquisition of 132companies (including 100 subsidiaries). The dilemma is whether to aim at a fairlycomprehensive scheme of acquisition, with the advantages that that would bring;or to make more certain, under a smaller scheme, that the new Iron and steel corporation can grapple effectively with an essential area of the industry under its control. I fully recognise, however, the force of the arguments which have led the Minister of Supply to favour the larger scheme; and the issue is a fairlystraightforward one which will doubtless be discussed by the Cabinet on the basisof Appendix V of the Minister&apos;s paper. It is not only, however, because of this aspect of the subject that I am submitting this paper. i3. The Minister of Supply says, very rightly, that we must be clear in our minds as to the grounds of our case. We have to persuade ourselves, parliament and the electorate that we are acting sensibly and in the public interest. Fromthis point of view, I confess myself to be unhappy about the adequacy of thegrounds set out in paragraph 22 of the Minister&apos;s memorandum, on which tojustify this scheme at this time.4. We secured the approval of the House of Commons on 28th May, 1946, toa motion to the effect that the socialisation of appropriate sections of the iron andsteel industry was desirable &quot; with a view to its efficient organisation in the publicinterest.&quot; Are we now to admit, openly or tacitly, that &quot; there is no question inthis industry of inefficiency, or of disinclination or inability to carry throughessential modernisation &quot; (paragraph 22 of CP. (48) 123)?5. If we are thrown back on the argument that &quot; no Government should riin the position of being dependent for an industry such as this (namely, a basicindustry) on the goodwill of a small body of industrialists &quot; (paragraph 22), wemust be prepared to meet two lines of argument :  (a) As to the form of control, I recognise its advantages in making possible I doubt whether we can say more the stage by stage reorganisation,35439
over a period of years, of the industry, under public ownership of the share capital But have we a convincing case for the form of sociali-sation which we are adopting ? If we leave the company structure andmost of the company directors, but deprive them of the prohts motiveare we not still dependent to some extent-particularly in the shortrun-on the goodwill of a small body of industrialists, while at thesame time arousing the bitter hostility of some of them by the action weare taking Is this what the Minister means when he says m para-graph 37 that &quot; it is beyond my power to guarantee that the livingspirit of those companies will be retained &quot; ?Some of the miners have been said to complain that when they goto the pit office or meet N.C.B. officials there are far too many of the old faces of the private enterprise era. In the case ofthe Coal Board the old company structure lias gone. In steel it willremain, so that the worker in iron and steel may have more reason tothink that the more things change the more they are the same. I donot say that such criticism is altogether reasonable, but it raisespsychological factors which have to be taken into account.If the aim is to deprive a small body of industrialists of control,what is the superiority of the present scheme over the proposals to take effective controlling powers, the &apos;&apos; socialisation &apos;&apos; of Steel House, and enabling powers in respect of acquisition, which I put forward last summer in CP. (47) 212, but which the Cabinet did not then see its way to accept ? I then believed and I still believe this to be the bestfirst step. The discussions (authorised by the Cabinet) with the Ironi and Steel Federation which led up to CP. (47) 212 were confidentialin character, but we cannot exclude the possibility that in the heat of controversy the Federation or Opposition M.P.S may refer to them.We should have in reserve reasoned arguments to show why theseearlier proposals were not adequate for the objectives we have inmind. At the moment I do not see the answer.(b) As to timing, the public acquisition of any basic industry, as distinct from its efficient functioning, is not necessarily a matter of the highesturgency, particularly if it is conceded that &apos;&apos; Steel House has hitherto been reasonably amenable to Government economic and social policy &quot;(paragraph 22 of CP. (48) 123). In my view, we should examine very carefully the extent of the danger of a fall in production and of delay in re-equipment, which the Minister dismisses&apos;1 rather lightly in para-graph 36. If there is any risk of a fall in production at this juncturein our national affairs, we must be ready with cogent arguments going beyond party promises and pledges why the full scheme mustbe proceeded with in this Parliament. We have to prove our case inthe light of the general  public interest. That is the test the averageBritish citizen wilt apply.6. I consider that the facts and arguments brought forward in the Ministerof Supply&apos;s paper would fit more aptly the scheme I recommended in CP. (47) 212under which the Government would have had ample powers of informed direction and control in addition to &quot;as and when&quot; powers of acquisition though these would not be extensively used at the outset. If we are toadopt the nominally more drastic proposals, either in the form of scheme C or Scheme D, we must make out a stronger case, includegrounds showing the need for immediate action in present circumstances&quot;And in my opinion we should most certainly publish the best argumentsavailable m the proposed White Paper, so as to convince the so the Tightness of our decision and to ensure that the Government and itssupporters speak with one voice and have a sound and reasonable ca&quot; e If wedo not do so we are Heading for a difficult Parliamentary discussion and run a grave risk of not carrying a sufficient body of public opinion with us onan Wwhich we must expect to be very prominent at tim next election at a tLm whei lieiron ana steel situation will be in a state of flux because the new order of thiv^has not been established let alone tried out. tliiugsH.
