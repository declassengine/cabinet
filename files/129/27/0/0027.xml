(h7)  299) indicatinghow the remaining sessions of the present Parliament wouldhave to be re-arranged if the Lords rejected the Parliament-Bill.      The Cabinet did net discuss this in detail and left the point to be considered by the Future legislation committee when the need arose (CM. (ky) 83rd Conclusions,Minute 3).2. In view of the rejection of the Parliament- Bill bythe House of Lords, we sust shortly decide what- adjustmentswe should make in the Parliamentary programme:    and there are some general considerations which I should like to bring before my colleagues before the matter is considered indetail by the Future Legislation Committee.3. The timetable set out in CP. ihl) 299 provided for -(a) k short session lr^ the autumn of the    present year,when the Parliament jj1.ii would be massed bv the Commons withformal Committee and -ere-t Stages ana sent to  the Lords fora second time.     This session would probably run fromIh th September to about 27th October. I9ho.      It might bepossible to persuade the Opposition in both Houses to accepta voluntary arrangement for the sittings,  so that this short-session could be terminated at an earlier date.     V/e cannot,however, exclude the possibility that the Opposition will seek to prolong the session by obstructive tactics.(b) A verv long 19 i5/hQ session., during which the parliament Bill would be sent to the nords for the third andlast- time and the iron and Steel Bill would be sent to themfor the first time.      This session would begin in late Octoberor early November, 13ho, and the Iron and Steel Bill would beintroduced at- the beginning of the session and given its second reading not later than the middle of November.      the parliament Bill could not finally leave the Commons untiljtwo years after Its second reading in the first session, i.e.not before 21-th November, 19*4-9,  end thereafter it will benecessary to give the Lords the statutory period of one month
5. k short session in the autumn of this year followedby a very long 19hS/h9 session (as proposed in C&quot;.P. (h?) 299)may^cause some inconvenience to Members of Parliament,  andto depart in this way from what would be the normal arrangement of sessions in order to advance the- date by which the parliament Bill will become law might be regarded as an invitation to the Opposition to use every means of obstructionat their disposal.      On the other hand, if we try to take thefinal stages of both Bills in the same session in the mannerindicated in paragraph h, we may encounter a technicaldifficulty which the Opposition might- be tempted to exploit-in the conditions immediately preceding a General election and which would at best be embarrassing and at worst preventthe Iron and Steel Bill becoming lav: in the present Parliament.The difficulty cerises from the fact that, if in the sessionwhich opened in the autumn of 19*49 the House of Lords did notreject either Bill outright but either adjourned debate orpressed amendments on the Commons up to the point ofprorogation,  the Speaker of the Bouse of Commons would notbe able  to give, until just before- prorogation,  a certificatethat the Parliament Bill had been rejected by the Lords.It might then be difficult for the Speaker to give a furthercertificate in- respect&quot; of the Iron ana Steel Bill that it hadbeen rejected within the meaning of the &quot;Parliament Act,  asamended by the Parliament Bill;    for, in the circumstancesenvisaged,   the course of events just before prorogation v/would have  to be a Commission to give the Royal Assent to the parliament Bill followed after an interval of not more then a few hours by a Commission to give the Royal Assent to theIron and Steel Bill,  with the result that the Speaker would either have to endorse his certificate on the Iron and steel bill before the Parliament Bill was actually law or else to run the risk of some hitch occurring in getting it endorseeto consider the Bill for the lest time.      The session could&quot;not,  therefore;  end before the week beginning 18th December, 19I4.9,( c)    A...relatively short 19^0 session., during which theIron and Steel Bill,  if it had been rejected in the -previoussession would, under the amended provisions of the Parliament/vet... be passed by the Commons with formal Committee and ResortStages and sent to the Lords for the^second and last time.This session would open in January, 19^0, and,  as more then ayear would have elapsed since the second reading of the Ironand Steel Bill in the previous session,  the Iron and steel bill could be taken in the Commons for the second and lasttime at any time ofter the opening of the session.     thereafter the Lords would have to be given one month for the considerationof the Bill.      The session must end by 31st July,  1950,  at thelatest.L\, The only practicable alternative timetable would beto have a normal session in 19h8/h9 end a session opening inthe autumn of 19*49,  the length of which would depend oncircumstances.      Under this timetable the Parliament bill would be sent to the Lords in the I9ho/l49 session for thesecond time and  the Iron and Steel Bill for the first time.In the subsequent session which opened in the autumn of 19*4-9the Parliament Bill would be sent to the Lords for the thirdtime and the Iron and Steel Bill for the second time.     Thus,in the session which opened in the autumn of 19*49,  both bills would run neck and neck and,  if the Mouse of Lords did notreject one or other Bill outright earlier in the session, bothBills would have to be put forward for the royal Assent atthe end of the    session.
during the short interval.6. My colleagues will wish to weigh the considerations set out- in paragraph 5*     My own view is that the timetablesummarised in paragraph 3 is preferable, first,  because it-would be more seemly to pass the Parliament Bill into law inthe session, preceding that in which we propose to make use ofits provisions to secure the passage of the Iron and steel bill,  and secondly,  because it would be Imprudent to leave injeopardy right- up to the eve of the Dissolution our policy of passing the Iron and Steel Bill in the lifetime of this parliament.7. If the Cabinet accept- the timetable proposed    in cp. (117)  299,  I suggest- that in the short session, this autumn,there should be -(i)    a short debate on the Address (llta to 17th September);(ii)    procedure mot-ions in the Commons for-rnalising theCommittee and. Report Stages of the Parliament-Bill - this follows the 191h precedents(20th September):(iii)    second reading of the Parliament- Bill in the commons and remaining stages (21st arid22nd sept emb er);(iv)    adjournment- of the Commons, pending considerationof the Bill by the Lords, who under the parliament act,  1911, must be given, one month to considerthe Bill;(v)    re-assembly of the Commons, if the Lords seek agreement on amendments:1 ?( vi ) ) &quot; prorogation (about 27th October).I also suggest that His Majesty should be consulted with aview/ to the short session&apos;s being opened by Royal Commissionrather than by The King in person.     There are manyprecedents for this, one of which is as recent as 1935.8. We should aim to open the long session, 19h-8/h9,not later than Tuesday,  2nd November,H.M.Office of the Lord President    of the Council, S.W.. 1. ,11th June,  191+8.
