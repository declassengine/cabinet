(47) 57th Conclusions, Minute 5.26th June, 1947);&quot; agreed that Government supporters should be informed that the Govern-ment adhered to their intention to bring appropriate sections of the ironand steel industry under public ownership, that it was doubtful whether itwould be possible to introduce the necessary legislation in the 1947-48session and that, before coming to a final decision on this point, the Govern-ment required more time to consider it in the light of the present economicsituation.&apos;&apos;(CM. (47) 10th Conclusions, Minute 6.7th August, 1947).The Prime Minister announced in the House of Commons on 21st October,1947, that &quot; it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the present Parliamentto nationalise the relevant portions of the iron and steel industry.&quot;(Hansard, Col. 33.)2. In fulfilment of these decisions, I now attach a draft Bill to give effectto them. An earlier draft (attachedto S.I. (M) (48) 22) has been examined by my colleagues on the Socialisation of Industries Committee, and S.I. (M) (48) 35,36, 37 and 38 dealt with particular and minor aspects to which effect has beengiven where necessary. The same draft was circulated to Departments at theofficial level, and the draft Bill now attached takes account of the conclusionsof the Committee and of points of detail which have been raised.35361 b
3. The general lay-out of the Bill follows previous nationalisation measures,but there is the important difference that, whereas in previous measures assetsor whole undertakings were transferred and merged into a single organisation,in this case it is the securities of selected companies which are acquired, and theexisting company structures will continue for the time being, subject to thecontrol of the sole shareholder (i.e., the Iron and Steel Corporation of GreatBritain).Outline of the industry. To assist the Cabinet in considering the Bill as a whole, and its implications-tions, some description of the industry follows.5. The &quot;iron and steel industry&quot; is a term loosely used, but generally regarded as covering the production of pig iron and ingot steel, together withthe casting of iron and steel and the shaping of steel by rolling, forging, drawingor extrusion. This, broadly, is the field covered by the control orders for ironand steel under Defence Regulations. The cutting or machining of steel is recog-nised to be a part of the engineering industry.6. There are about 2,600 firms, above the level of the village blacksmith,engaged in some way in the industry. Some 2,000 of these operate iron or steelfoundries and have no other interest in the industry. Many of them produceiron or steel castings exclusively for machinery or other products they manufac-ture themselves. Others produce mainly for sale, but their individual production is relatively small and its make-up in most cases highly diverse. No one has ever seriously suggested the nationalisation of this group of 2,000.7. The balance of 600 firms account for the production of iron ore, pig iron,ingot steel, billets, &amp;c, heavy sections and joists, plate, sheet, tinplate, lightre-rolled products, forgings, drop forgings, tubes and wire. About 350 companies are engaged in the production of forgings, drop forgings, tubes, wire and cruciblesteel, and have no other interests in the iron and steel industry. The Cabinet hasalready decided that public ownership should not apply to these sections. Thereare also about 110 companies each producing less than 20,000 tons per annumof re-rolled products. About half of them re-roll small quantities for use intheir engineering or other production and the other half are mostly jobbersand specialists. Another 40 concerns or so are relatively unimportant pro-ducers of iron ore, pig iron, steel, plate, tinplate and sheet. Virtually the wholeof the production of iron ore, pig iron, carbon and alloy steel, billets, &amp;c, plate,sheet, tinplate and re-rolled products is accounted for by a core of about 100 com-panies, and these companies also have important interests in other sections ofthe industry, such as forgings, tube and wire.8. Over the industry as a whole the constituent companies have a wide variety of interests. Many of the smaller producers of drop forgings and re-rolledproducts are primarily engineers, while the majority of the more important com-panies for good technical and commercial reasons have developed end- or by-products in other industries (particularly engineering and chemicals). Others,starting originally in the finishing industries, have developed back into the ironand steel industry to be assured of their raw materials. As a result there arevery few companies at the core of the industry which are &apos;&apos; clean &apos;&apos; in the sense that their activities are confined to the various forms of iron and steel produc-tion. (This cleanliness was a feature of the railway, electricity and gas under-takings; it was secured, in the main, for coal and road transport by transferringonly the colliery and haulage assets respectively.)9. But for the founders, drop forgers, foundry pig and iron ore producers(classes which have their own separate trade associations), the majority of thecompanies within the industry are members of the Conferences of the british iron and Steel Federation. The Federation has a firm hold over its constituentsin such matters as the bulk purchase of raw materials, the planning and adjust-ment of production, distribution and the allocation of orders, and, but for theIron and Steel Board, would determine selling prices of the basic products. Thepower of the Federation is considerable and it has proved its effectiveness in securing coherent planning and organisation of the industry.Scope of Acquisition10. After much thought, I reached the conclusion that acquisition of allcompanies producing in 1946 or 1947 upwards of 50,000 tons of iron ore. or
15upwards of 20,000 tons of pig iron, ingot steel (carbon and alloy combined) orof re-rolled products (i.e., light rolled products, plate, sheet and tinplate combined),would give ownership and thereby control over a field which, with certain exceptions, would be broadly comparable with that over which the Federationexercises control. Moreover, from the trade union angle, it would secure similar treatment of the great bulk of those who regard themselves as within the industry.This scheme, referred to as &quot; Scheme C &quot; in S.I. (M) (48) 22 and with more detail in S.I. (M) (48) 36, I propose to continue to call Scheme C for the purpose ofthis paper.11. Companies engaged in the sections to be excluded are numerous, but itis not necessary to transfer them in order to secure the economic power which is bound up in the industry. The Corporation will have substantial interests inthese sections through its acquisition of the Scheme C companies, but it will nothave a dominating position, and some machinery either continuance of theFederation or otherwise will be necessary to secure proper planning of produc-tion in certain directions. There are potentialities for trouble, but, with goodsense on the part of the Corporation and of the companies remaining in private ownership, the problem can be overcome.12. Under Scheme C on the basis of the latest information available, 102companies qualify for compulsory acquisition (17 of them being subsidiaries ofsome of the other 85). These bring in their train another 138 wholly-ownedsubsidiaries, many of which are outside the iron and steel industry. Some ofmy colleagues on &quot;the Socialisation of Industries Committee were inclined to theview that the administrative problems would be such as to over-burden the Cor-poration, particularly in the early stages, and that an element of competition wouldbe no bad thing. They at first preferred a smaller scheme which I put beforethem as a possible alternative. The issues were expanded at length inS.I. (M) (48) 36, and in subsequent discussion attention was concentrated onScheme D, which (again on the basis of latest information) would involveacquisition of 32 companies each producing upwards of 60,000 tons of ingotsteel, together with 100 wholly-owned subsidiaries. Appendix V reproduces infull those parts of S.I. (M) (48) 36 which discuss the pros and cons of the alterna-tive scheme. Scheme D is virtually identical with Scheme C on the productionof steel, but it is much weaker on the intermediate sections where steel is shapedto the requirements of the consuming industries. In my view, the fringe ofprivate enterprise over which the Corporation would have neither ownership norcontrol would be so large as to be an embarrassment to the State, to the Corpora-tion. and to the companies themselves. I stated mv firm conclusions on this problem in SI. (M) (48) 36.   They are :-&quot; Taking the long-term view, as we must when providing for the futureof the iron and steel industry, I have no doubt that its proper planning andthe smooth administration of its affairs can only be achieved bv the biggerscheme. The main argument against this is that the number of units to bedigested in the early days would put an unbearable strain on the Corporationwhich might affect the orderly functioning of the industry. I do not share the view that the immediate administrative problem will be serious or thatit will be materially affected by the additional units. It must be rememberedthat the management of each unit is to be left intact, to run its affairs as before, and will be affected only when the Corporation is ready to make changes.Moreover, even if greater difficulties than I anticipate should develop inthe early days, I still think it is right to take that risk rather than set up,deliberately, an organisation that we believe to be intrinsically unsound,and which indeed in the medium and the long term will involve the Corpora-tion in greater administrative and organisational difficulties than the biggerscheme. For the smaller alternative scheme proper planning of the industry would be impossible and there would be permanent conflicts between the nationalised and unnationalised sections of the industry. The Governmentwould be blamed for having turned a healthy industry into an unhealthy one.Sooner or later we would be forced to take over the additional units and establish yet another organisational structure. All the difficulties anddisturbances of the present nationalisation measures would have to be gonethrough again.I hold strongly that the unity of the industry as it exists to-day throughthe operations of the Federation must, as far as possible, be preserved.  That35361 b 2
can only be done by the bigger scheme as it virtually gives the Corporationownership of the field which the Federation now controls.For these reasons I have no hesitation in recommending Scheme C.This is essentially an occasion when caution is likely to be more dangerousthan boldness.&quot;13 The majority of my colleagues on the Socialisation of Industries Com-mittee accented these arguments in favour of the larger scheme, which I am satisfied is the only sound solution to secure the unity of and proper planningwithin the industry.14. If it is desired to lighten it in any way, it may prove possible, withoutdamaging the scheme as a whole, to eliminate about half a dozen iron ore pro-ducers whose main assets are mining leases of whose nature and duration I haveno knowledge. I suggest, however, that we should reserve judgment on this and make the concession during the Committee stage if a convincing case is made for it.15. Appendix I gives brief particulars of the companies which wouldqualify to be transferred by Scheme C. Those marked with an asterisk wouldbe affected by Scheme D. Appendix II is a chart indicating the respective out-put proportions of the industry which would be affected by Schemes C and D.16. Thus the basis of the Scheme is that, in accordance with the principles to be defined in the body of the Bill, all the securities of the companies which willbe named in a schedule, will be transferred on a given date to the Iron and steel corporation of Great Britain. The Corporation will become the sole shareholder,and the managements will remain undisturbed until the Corporation is in a posi-tion to regroup or re-organise the companies.Options17. My colleagues on the Socialisation of Industries Committee agree with me that no option to demand inclusion should be given to firms below the line for compulsory acquisition. Such firms will be allowed as of right to expand their production to double that in a base year or to the line itself, whichever is theless. They can exceed this by licence from the Minister. To grant options wouldmean that we should be saddled with concerns which were inefficient, or no longereconomic, and which we do not want, as well as with the introduction of a specialcompensation formula.Compensation to Stockholders18. I propose that this should be settled with the Chancellor of theExchequer.Powers of Corporation and of Companies19. From what is said in paragraph 8 above, it is clear that the corporation will inherit companies with activities far removed from iron and steel and withuntapped powers in their memoranda for much wider activities. About 21 percent, of the 295,000 employees of companies which will come into public ownershipunder Scheme C are classified as engaged in industries other than iron and steel.Some 35,000 are taken up in general and constructional engineering, another10,000 in the manufacture of bolts and nuts, some 7,000 more in coke and chemicalproduction and the remainder spread thinly over several other industries, in-cluding the non-ferrous and brick industries. Among the powers which thecompanies now possess, some of which are exercised, are to operate as bankers,-distillers, dye makers, printers, salt miners, builders, farmers, shipbuilders, loco-motive and motor manufacturers, timber merchants.20. It will undoubtedly be a point of complaint that in nationalising these companies we are nationalising a great deal more than iron and steel, and that private enterprise will be subject in its own field to competition from a Stateundertaking with a virtual monopoly in iron and steel, backed by State credit and Treasury guarantee. But this position must be faced. The existing inte-gration is in many cases physical and is generally founded on good commercial and technical considerations. There is still wide scope for developing by-product^and it would be unsound to attempt to restrict the companies. To do so wouldhamper them and the Corporation. I therefore propose to introduce the first alternative Clause 2 which gives the Corporation the sum of the existing powersm the memoranda of the companies, and allows each company to rest on its ownmemorandum.   If need be, however, I should be prepared to fall back on the
516second alternative which restricts the Corporation to the sum of the activitiesactually performed at the date of transfer by the companies, and limits eachcompany to activities which it can undertake under its memorandum and whichit or some other company was actually performing. In either case the minister would have power to authorise additional activities.The main answer, however, must be that the duty imposed on the Corpora-tion by the Bill is to produce iron and steel, and that it can be trusted not toenter unreasonably into fields beyond.Justification for Public Ownership21. When this issue was before the Cabinet last year, it was proposed to publish a White Paper simultaneously with the Bill for the purpose of (a) givingthe case for public ownership, (6) explaining the transfer, (c) indicating future policy. It is my belief that a White Paper for the purposes of (&amp;) and possiblyfor outlining certain matters of future organisation, would be helpful, but I am convinced that any attempt in a White Paper to justify the Bill itself or toimpose a policy on the new Corporation is inappropriate and might be an embarrassment to the Government.22. We must, however, be clear in our minds as to the grounds of our case.My own view is that it is wrong that this industry, tightly organised and con-centrated as of technical necessity it must be in relatively few hands, and vitalas it is to the country&apos;s whole economy, should be left in a position where sectionalinterest can be pressed against the national good. There is no question in this industry of inefficiency, or of disinclination or inability to carry through essentialmodernisation. The main argument must be that a basic industry cannot remainin private hands. While Steel House has hitherto been reasonably amenable toGovernment economic and social policy, no Government should be in the positionof being dependent for an industry such as this on the goodwill of a small bodyof industrialists.Financial Implications23. The Corporation will be the sole shareholder in the publicly-owned companies whose structure will remain. The Corporation will no doubt allowand encourage each to make appropriations to hypothecated reserves (eg., depre-ciation, repairs, pension funds, &amp;c.) which will be at their own disposal. Afterthese appropriations, the Corporation as sole shareholder will transfer to itself as a dividend the balance on profit and loss account. The aggregate of thesebalances will represent the bulk of the income of the Corporation. The maincharge on this income will be the interest payable on Iron and Steel Stock,together with appropriations to general reserve (which should be at the disposalof the Corporation and not of the underlying companies).24. Appendix III is an estimate, on the basis of the last financial year ofthe companies concerned, of income and expenditure. The estimated surplus (onthe basis of a 3 per cent, stock and provision for redemption in 90 years at 3 percent.) is about  3m. If interest rate on the stock were 1\ per cent., andredemption in 150 years at 3 per cent., the surplus would be about  5m.Thus, the effect of substituting State for private credit would, in present cir-cumstances of relatively high production and with current prices, be between 3m. and  5m. For purposes of illustration only, this surplus is equivalentto either (a) A reduction of the controlled price of steel by 4s. to 6s. Qd. per ton (i.e.,a reduction by 1 per cent, or 2 per cent.); or(b) an increase in the earnings of the workers in the industry by 4s. 6d. to7s. Qd. per week (i.e., an increase of 4 per cent, to 7 per cent.).25. The foregoing calculations take no account of the subsidies now beingmade to the industry, at a rate of about  25m. per annum; in the main they cover the difference between the cost of imported steel, pig-iron, ore and scrap, andthe home-controlled prices of these materials (and certain high cost home production). It is our present policy to maximise supplies of those commoditiesby buying abroad in whatever quantities we can at any price which is not toooutrageous. At present rates of consumption, the effect is to subsidise steel prices by about 10 per cent., and removal of the subsidies would involve an increaseof prices of about that amount. If, however, the new Corporation were to bear the whole cost of the subsidies without any corresponding increase in the priceof steel, the estimated surplus of  3m. to  5m. would be automatically converted into a deficit of  20m. to  22m.
26. I hope to discuss with my colleagues (on the Production Committee) the implications of these subsidies, which are now closely woven into the pricestructure of the industry. It is my provisional conclusion that in view of theGovernment&apos;s stabilisation policy, their continuance in part may be inevitable and that we must face the prospect of this nationalised industry starting its lifeas a charge on public funds, whether on its own account or through the Ministry ofSupply Vote.27. I turn now to certain matters which do not affect the drafting of theBill or the arguments we use, but of which the Cabinet should be aware.Interim Arrangements for Supervising the Industry28. The day-to-day relations between the industry (as represented by theBritish Iron and Steel Federation and the Joint Iron Council) on the one hand,and the Government on the other, are now conducted by the Iron and steel board which, under an independent Chairman, is composed of two leaders ofthe industry, two Trade Unionists, a representative of consumers and an ex-Treasury official. The staff are in the main Civil Servants, but there is a working understanding whereby on certain matters they rely on the services ofSteel House officials. The Board (which by its appointment has no responsibilityfor nationalisation, and on this footing has secured the confidence of both sides of the industry) is performing a most useful function in pressing forward with the Development Plan, securing maximum current production, and regulatingdistribution in accordance with the decisions of the Materials Committee.29. When the Bill is introduced, if not before, it is, I think, inevitable thatall or some of the members will resign. I cannot now foresee what will be the precise outcome, but there would be advantage in the interim period, while myDepartment will be in active opposition to the industry, if some semi-independent body were available to maintain friendly control. I therefore propose to do what i can to maintain the Board or at any rate an independent Chairman but ifthis proves impossible there will be no alternative but to absorb the staff of theBoard into my Department and maintain with the industry the best relationsthat circumstances will permit on matters affecting development, production anddistribution.Timing30. The Bill should be ready for introduction at the end of September orbeginning of October, 1948. It will be technical and not readily understood, andI should therefore prefer a reasonable interval before Second Reading, and a.reasonable interval before it enters Committee, to give opportunity for discussionwith interested parties.31. On the assumption that the Lords pass the Bill on the first occasion, itwould receive the Royal Assent in the summer of 1949. The Corporation wouldbe appointed in the early autumn, 1949. and the transfers of the companies couldbe effected on or about 1st January, 1950.32. If, however, the Lords reject the Bill, and it has to be enacted underthe Parliament Act procedure. Royal Assent could not be given until the spring of 1950. With the imminence of a General Election, there would no doubt be difficulty in obtaining members to serve on the Corporation until the resultsof the General Election were known. It might not be possible to effect thetransfers until the end of 1950 or beginning of 1951.U ncertainty33. There is thus the prospect of an interval of upwards of two years betweenintroduction of the Bill and effective action under it-^a period when there will inevitably be some uncertainty in the industry, both as to the personal prospects of individuals within it and on a great mass of contracts and agreements withthird parties which could be disclaimed under the retrospective powers in theBill. I see no way to avoid this uncertainty, although I hope to create a machinewhereby agreements and transactions entered into by the companies concerned could, if the directors so wished, be validated on behalf of the Minister and thereby be exempted from subsequent disclaimer or challenge.34. With a view to limiting the field of agreements which may be disclaimedor challenged, I should prefer not to put at peril those made before the dateof introduction. It would obviously be unreasonable to take powers to voidany hiving off transactions before some public warning had been given that
717existing units should not be broken up in a manner to evade the intentions of Parliament. But no such warning could be given without a great deal ofconsequential matter which would give plausible grounds for demanding a debate in Parliament. Although there is evidence of a number of hiving off arrangements being made by iron and steel companies, I have no evidence that as yet therehave been any deliberately undesirable activities, but I propose to keep an eyeon the situation and if there are good grounds for believing that undesirableactions are taking place, I shall seek the authority of my colleagues to issue a warning in suitable terms. Such a warning would no doubt have to indicateprecisely the companies concerned and cover such matters as compensation tostockholders, limitation of dividends in the interim period, &amp;c.Extent of Opposition35. My colleagues will no doubt appreciate the bitter opposition the bill will arouse. Apart altogether from the general political aspect and the deephostility of the industry itself, there will be opposition from a quarter of a millionseparate shareholders, whose income will be reduced, together with powerfulopposition from the trading community at large who, while welcoming theprospect of cheap and abundant steel, will see no clear dividing line betweenthe activities of the Corporation and what they regard as the legitimate field of private enterprise.36. I attach at Appendix IV a copy of a letter I have received fromSir Archibald Forbes, Chairman of the Iron and Steel Board, in which heexpresses fears about the danger in the short term of a fall in production ofsteel and serious delay in carrying out the modernisation and development plan.I do not share Sir Archibald&apos;s fears, although his line of argument will certainly be followed in the general opposition to the Bill. There is no factual evidence to support it, however, and the matter, to my mind, is mainly one of politicaljudgment. I should be more concerned at the possible loss of enthusiasm on thepart of the workers and a consequent fall in production if the Bill were postponed.(I would add that, in spite of specific mention at the time of his appointment thatthe Government would look to him personally &quot; for advice as necessary on techni-cal questions involved in the preparation of any plans for public ownership,&quot; SirArchibald has asked to be absolved from this obligation.)Conclusion37.   The attached draft Bill is in my view a thoroughly workmanlikemeasure which gives effect to the decisions of the Cabinet referred to in para-graph 1. It will effectively transfer to public ownership and with minimum disturbance-bance the securities and the control of the companies which form the core ofthe industry, but it is beyond my power to guarantee that the living spirit of those companies will be retained.   I seek the support of my colleagues for the structure,and for the main features of the Bill.   The details can be further pursued at theofficial level, and ratified by the Legislation Committee before introduction.   i must, however, be assured at an early date that the main features are acceptable 5and will be implemented.   As we may be denied opportunity for revision in the IHouse of Lords, it is the more important that the Bill as introduced shall neither frequire nor justify extensive amendment.38. If this assurance is given to me, I further seek authority to inform theBritish Iron and Steel Federation, the Joint Iron Council and the iron ore pro-ducers and, of course, the Trade Unions that the broad outline is fixed government policy, but that I should welcome their assistance on detail. I expect all but thelatter will refuse to co-operate, but I should prefer that the onus for non-co-operation should rest on them, and not on the Government.Summary39.   I seek the authority of the Cabinet for the scheme embodied in the draftBill and taken as a whole, and particularly for the following features  (a) Scheme C 85 companies (paragraphs 12-15).(b) No options (paragraph 17).(c) Wide powers for the Corporation (paragraph 20).(d) representative bodies to be informed of the outline as embodying fixedGovernment policy (paragraph 38).G.

Therefore, I must make it abundantly clear that this letter expresses only my own views on certain aspects of the matter and does not in any way purport to convey those of mycolleagues. But I consider it my duty to lay these views before you because ofthe responsibility resting upon the Board for the general supervision of theindustry and the oversight and facilitation of production and development.The Government continues both by official publications and pronouncementsby Ministers emphatically to underline the critical economic situation of thecountry and the vital part which steel production must play in redressing the adverse balance. This is fully recognisecL within the industry and a great efforthas been and is being made to achieve maximum production.I think it can fairly be claimed that output over the past six months hasbeen most satisfactory and if all goes well the target for 1948, in itself a highfigure, may be beaten.   And this is being done concurrently with substantial
progress in the carrying through of the modernisation and development plan(probably the largest single industrial project of its kind) designed to increaseproductive efficiency and obtain greater output in 1949 and succeeding yearsLIt is essential to any proper consideration of the matter that there shouldbe a full appreciation of the real extent and nature of the effort which is beingmade and that the sustaining of this effort is essential to the fulfilment of theproduction objective over the next few years.The utmost enthusiasm exists at all levels throughout the industry andmanagements and workpeople are combining in a manner at once impressive andin keeping with the traditionally good relations between both sides. The work-people have not only extended the field of continuous working, but maintain ahigh rate of output per shift. Managements are carrying the additional respon-sibility and burden inseparable from increasing production under conditionswhere materials and services are not in abundant supply. A high degree of successis attending the continued efforts to secure the maximum utilisation of existing resources by adaptation of plants and modifications of processes. The central organisation of the Federation has intensified its efforts to obtain materials ofevery kind from every source, to secure that these materials are distributed where these can be most efficiently used, to relieve bottlenecks and to adjust the phasing of production and development to current needs.In considering the managerial problem, both individually and particularlycentrally, regard must be had to the complexity of the industry. Raw materialshave to be obtained not only from home sources but from all over the world andin ever-increasing volume. The quarrying and mining of ore and the manufactureof pig iron and coke, in themselves complicated operations, have to be carried outbefore commencing steel production proper. Basic steel has to be made by differingprocesses and in many qualities. End products constitute an infinite variety in number, nature, quality&quot; and size. Ancillary activities range over a very wide field from the manufacture of bath salts to bridge building. Transport bothby sea and by land is itself a major problem. Research is constantly proceeding,both by individual concerns and centrally, concerning improvements in technique,and the development of new processes and products.I hope that this may convey some indication of the many difficulties whichhave to be faced, especially in operating under present conditions and those likelyto endure for some time to come. Up till now these have been met or foreseento a degree that calls for high commendation. In my opinion the overall efficiency of the steel industry on the basis of its existing equipment is of an outstandinglyhigh standard and as a result of good organisation within itself the whole instru-ment is now keyed up to, and is working at, concert pitch.Above the internal organisation of the industry is the Iron and Steel Boardexercising a general supervisory and controlling function on behalf of the State.Although its de jure authority may be limited in some aspects nevertheless fromthe de facto standpoint it exercises the necessary control over the policy and operations of the steel industry. I am assured that the Board commands theconfidence of both sides of the&apos; industry and I think it can be claimed that itplays its part in supervising operations on behalf of the Government.In short the whole organisational machine is working smoothly and theresult is reflected in the present level of output.If maximum production is to continue to be obtained the machine must bekept at its present level of efficiency, and there is no room for error or experi-ment under the &quot; marginal &quot; conditions to which it is now working. In my view the introduction of a dislocating factor in the form of proposals for public owner-ship would inevitably lead to a loss of production and a slowing down of thedevelopment projects. I fail to see how it could be otherwise. Maximum effortcould hardly be sustained during a period of acute political and public contro-versy concerning the industry. Diversion of thought and energy on the partof the leaders of the industry and administrative executives could not be avoided.Disheartenment and doubts about the future would be no more than natural andwould affect a large section of the managerial structure. While I believe the publicspirit of the management of the industry to be of a high order (and of this thereis ample evidence) I do not think that this could altogether offset such humanreactions.Moreover, apart from the probability of disturbance of the higher manaa;e-ment for the reasons stated, it would be certain that there would be&quot; a dislocatino-effect deriving from the mere alteration of the structure. The settling down ofa new organisation inevitably takes time, and when nublic funds are involvedexecutive decisions cannot be made with the same degree of despatch.   This
1522industry is engaged in competitive operations demanding prompt decision in lightof market conditions.This letter is not concerned with the long-term aspects of public ownership of this industry. But so far as the short-term is concerned I submit to you withail the emphasis at my command and in light of all the knowledge at my disposal,that if maximum production of steel over the next few years is essential to theeconomic recovery of this country this will be gravely endangered by proceedingnow with any plans for public ownership. Moreover, the securing of the ultimatecompetitive position of the industry which is the object of the modernisation anddevelopment plan (and the second stage of which is about to be considered) mightbe seriously delayed.I wrote in somewhat similar terms to your predecessor about a year ago. Theadditional knowledge which I have gained since confirms the view that I thenexpressed that from the national economic standpoint there seems nothing to be gained and much which may be lost.I would therefore most earnestly appeal to you that if, as one understandsfrom ministerial statements, it is still the intention to proceed with the matter,the timing at least should be reconsidered on the grounds that it cannot fail to jeopardise the attainment of maximum steel production during the very period which is said to be all importantYours sincerely,(Signed) A. F.FORBES.Rt. Hon. G. Strauss, M.P.,Minister of Supply,Shell-Mex House.APPENDIX VExtract from S.I. (M) (48) 36(Memorandum submitted by the Minister of Supply to the Committee on the socialisation of Industries on 3rd May, 1948)Background to Scheme C2. Scheme C (i.e., 87 companies) gives substantial effect to the conclusions reached a year ago by the Cabinet (the scope of the scheme being set out onpp. 15-18 of CP. (47) 123). It transfers to public ownership practically thewhole of the iron ore, pig iron, carbon and alloy steel, and (except for minorjobbing and specialist activities) the re-rolling sections of the industry. It aimsat providing the new Iron and Steel Corporation with a virtual monopoly inthe heavy and re-rolling sections of the industry, thus affording scope for effectivecomprehensive planning, and the maximum opportunity for reorganisation. Itavoids a division of ownership in these sections which would lead to seriouscomplications in such matters as price control, supplies of raw materials andadjustments in overall production to accord with current needs. It enables theCorporation to co-ordinate, reconstruct or close down any of the major plants inthe industry that it chooses and ensures that each plant makes the products towhich it is best suited.3. Ownership of pig iron and steel production would automatically secureownership of the great bulk of United Kingdom iron ore production. It is,however, desirable that the independent iron ore producers should also be trans-ferred, as their continued existence might frustrate planned development of the ore deposits in that there would be privately-owned pockets in the various orefields over which the Corporation would have no control. While nothing is knownof their mining leases, the independents may have more extensive mining rightsthan their proportion of recent production suggests. Some of them may have tobe subsidised.4. About 45 per cent, of the output of light re-rolled products is produced by the steel-making companies. The balance is spread over some 130 companies.At one end the large companies concentrate mainly on mass production work,and at the other end the small companies deal mainly with jobbing and specialistproduction. In the middle range, companies do both jobbing and re-rolling appro-priate for mass production.   There are sound economic and technical reasons
why the mass production type of re-rolling should be integrated as far as possible with steelmaking, and, while it is not easy to distinguish the companies concerned,the transfer of all producing more than 20,000 tons per annum would secureState ownership of the whole field likely to be seriously affected by extension of mass production and thus provide full scope for rationalisation. For similar reasons the greater part of sheet and tinplate production should be transferredwith heavy steel production. The modern tendency is towards even greaterintegration of the production of sheet and tinplate with steelmaking.5. The fringe companies in the heavy sections to be left in private ownershipunder Scheme C would probably give rise to some difficulties in control, adminis-tration and planning of production, but they should not be serious. The widerthe fringe, however, the greater would be the difficulties. Further, a substantialmargin of private re-rollers would almost certainly lead, in a time of fallingdemand, to a price war between them and the Corporation, although the balanceof advantage should rest with the Corporation.6. Scheme C involves the transfer of 87 parent companies and 150 wholly-owned subsidiaries, together with various additional controlling interests. Iwas naturally concerned lest the control of so many companies should involvetoo great an administrative burden on the Corporation, particularly at the outset,but I concluded that, as the acquisition of securities should not by itself interferewith the day-to-day operation of the individual companies, their managementscould carry on as at present until the Corporation devised a workable system of supervision and control. The Corporation could determine their own pace ofaction, and would be free either to set up subsidiary bodies to supervise particularsections or to arrange for a number of the smaller companies to become subsidiaries of the larger concerns. There is perhaps some danger, particularly with thesmaller concerns, of key individuals leaving the industry, but they would probablybe replaceable by expert personnel from the larger units. The greater the numberof the companies left in private ownership, however, the wider is the scope foremployees of the transferred companies to leave a nationalised industry and findalternative jobs requiring their particular expert knowledge.7. One important feature of Scheme C is that as far as can be judgedit would result in bringing the British Iron and Steel Federation (which now ineffect supervises the industry as a whole) under the control of the Corporation,and, although arrangements would be necessary to plan to some extent the opera-tions of the fringe companies (which in all the sections would total between400-500) with those of the Corporation, Steel House would have outlived its functions, and it could be expected that the expert staff of the Federation wouldby negotiation be transferred to the Corporation.Scheme B Pros8. The preceding  )aragraphs state the case for Scheme C. In this and paragraph 9 I set out as objectively as possible the pros and cons of Scheme B(41 companies). It must not be assumed that all the arguments are equally cogent.Among the arguments which can be adduced for Scheme B are the following : (i) The Governments pronouncements about the extent of public ownership would be substantially fulfilled by acquiring companiesproducing about 95 per cent, of the output in the pig iron and carbonsteel sections, and the bulk of the production in the iron ore, alloy steel,sheet, tinplate and re-rolling sections. (It would be desirable to addfour more companies, mainly with the object of bringing in morealloy steel production.)(ii) The scheme includes all the companies working on a large scale, andexcludes a wide range of companies which tend to concentrate on special lines. It also admittedly excludes some smaller companies which are efficient and prosperous, and which the Corporation would no doubt like to have, but their significance in the general economy is relatively small.(iii) The problems of transfer would be eased.   Scheme B relates to unitswhose organisations should be the better able to stand the shock of acute political controversy for many months. The smaller units arein greater danger of disintegration under that controversy.(iv) The problems of administration after transfer would be reduced: theday-to-day worries of the smaller companies which would filter to
i7 23the Corporation might be quite as complex as those from the largercompanies; indeed, possibly more so since the directors might be lesssure of themselves. There might be a real danger of swamping theCorporation with details of administration. Moreover, if it isintended to hive off non-iron and steel activities, where appropriate,the process might be easier in the case of the larger units, where thereis increased specialisation and more departmentalism, than in the caseof the small units where the activities are likely to be well scrambled,(v) If market prices were adopted as the basis of compensation there wouldbe less work for the arbitration tribunal: Scheme B Scheme C(as modified in para. 8 (i))Nominal issued capital   ......       176 million       182 millionProportion quoted......... 81% 79%No. of classes of securities Quoted ..m....... 68 (16) 72 (18)(No. of companies in brackets)Unquoted       .;....... 52 (29) 107 (65)(No. of companies in brackets)(vi) Some competition from medium and small-sized firms would be no badstimulus to the Corporation. Whereas in the public utility fieldduplication of services results in absolute waste, and there is therefore a powerful case for absolute monopoly, in the field of trade, competitioncan help to promote efficiency, and can act as a check on prices.(vii) By agreement, or if necessary by subsequent legislation, the Corporationcould acquire excluded companies at a rate to suit its own convenience.Scheme B would, in fact, result in a publicly-owned cartel, which couldbe used to influence, in the public interest, the activities of the sectionsleft in private ownership.Scheme B Cons9.   Arguments which can be adduced against Scheme B (as modified inparagraph 8 (i)) are : (i) There would be 44 more companies in the main sections (iron ore, pigiron, steel, re-rolling, sheet and tinplate) left in private ownershipthan would be the case under Scheme C, many of them being fairlysizable units;Many of our supporters, including employees of the excludedcompanies, would find it difficult to understand why so many companies which have always been considered as an integral part of the iron andsteel industry, are to be left out. The scheme would savour ofcapitalist cartel technique rather than socialisation, and critics of theGovernment would contend that, despite the time at their disposal,Ministers had shied away from the task of preparing a comprehensive and coherent scheme and had snatched at an easy but irrational and half-hearted solution.(ii) While the scheme should break the power of Steel House, the Federationwould still remain a force in the industry in continuing to look afterthe interests of the excluded companies.(iii) The   division  of   the  industry  would   create   many   problems   ofadministration and control. Effective supervision of the industry asa whole and the operation of arrangements for subsidies, bulkpurchasing, statistics, production planning, reorganisation, consumers&apos;committees, and research, could be achieved only by close co-operationbetween the Corporation and the Federation or its successor. It is highly important to ensure that the coherent planning of the industry as a whole, more or less on present lines, should continue. At present there is a comprehensive organisation of virtually the whole range of production in the iron and steel industry in the Federation &quot; Con-ferences.&quot; Guidance is given to a joint &quot; Supplies Committee &quot; ofthe Conferences by the Iron and Steel Board and by the various userDepartments, through the permanent staff of the Federation, whichcan thus take steps rapidly to adjust production at all stages tomeet the Government plans.   This influence of the Steel Board and35361 . d
Idthe Federation rests in the ultimate on the Government&apos;s powers under defence Regulations, but they are kept in the background, and inpractice the co-operation of the industry stems from a desire to meetnational needs and to demonstrate that control through &apos;&apos; self-govern-ment&apos;&apos; is effective.Under a limited scheme of the character of Scheme B, the only way to continue the cohesion might be for the publicly-owned com-panies to continue as members of the Federation (through the Con-ferences), the Corporation using its strength to dominate the policies of the Federation; but any such arrangement would be exceedinglyunsatisfactory and might lead to constant trouble.(iv) The Ministry of Supply would have to &quot; sponsor &quot;the privately ownedsections and endeavour to secure that they got a fair crack of thewhip. This would inevitably make for friction between the Depart-ment and the Corporation.6The difficulties outlined in (iii) and (iv) above admittedly apply in some degree to Scheme C, but they would be much less serious andshould be surmountable.(v) Would-be &quot; deserters &quot; from transferred companies would find it easier to secure employment with private enterprise concerns.(vi) Any suggestion that the field excluded might be reconsidered at a later date and compulsorily transferred would have a stultifying effect onthe companies concerned, some of which are important units whoseproduction and morale must be kept up.Description of Still Smaller Scheme (D)10. Should my colleagues consider, in spite of the arguments in this paper,that Scheme C is too ambitious and should at this stage be drastically restricted,it would, I think, be logical to go a step further than Scheme B, and limit com-pulsory acquisition only to the important carbon and alloy steel producers. Theeffect of such a scheme called D is shown statistically in relation to Schemes Band C in Appendix I; compared with Scheme B, it has the following features : (i) By taking the thirty-two companies producing more than 60,000 tonsof steel per annum, we should have a virtual monopoly of steel produc-tion and of heavy and primary rolling. Because of the wide ramifi-cations of those companies we should also secure important but notnecessarily dominating interests in the intermediate and finishingsections.(ii) We should leave in private ownership eight more pig-iron companies,some of them important concerns. But these companies are substantialproducers of foundry pig iron and we do not aim deliberately tointerfere with the foundry industry. Some also make haematite ironused for both foundries and for steelmaking, but the steel companies which would be transferred have a substantial output of haematiteiron and should not be seriously jeopardised if these few producersremained in private ownership, though flexibility in planning iron ore and pig-iron production would be impaired.(iii) None of the independent re-rollers would be transferred, and by com-parison with Scheme B the following companies would be excluded,except in so far as some of them are controlled by companies to betransferred :- -1946 ProductionTonsGuest, Keen and Nettlefolds, Cardiff.........      314,596Whitehead Iron and Steel Co., Newport     ...      ...      184,687Templeborough   Rolling   Mills,   Ltd.,   Rotherham(partly owned by United Steel)  ...      ...      ...      127,678Darlington and Simpsons, Ltd., Darlington (partlyowned by Dorman Long)  ...      ...      ...      ...      109,622Smith and Maclean, Glasgow (controlled but not wholly owned by Colvilles) ...      ...      ...      101,811Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds have wide interests apart fromre-rolling and own or control upwards of twenty subsidiaries, some ofwhich are outside the industry; Darlington and Simpson are-primarilywindow section specialists, over whose affairs Dorman Long have some influence.   We should secure control of Smith and Maclean in
any event, and the Corporation would have a one-third interest in theTempleborough Company which should be operated as an integral partof the United Steel organisation. By the transfer of the thirty-twosteel companies we should secure direct control of 46 per cent, of ,the total production of light re-rolled products, and some 81 per cent,of sheet and tinplate. The exclusion, under Scheme B, of re-rollersbetween 20,000 and 75,000 would, in any event, substantially reducethe scope for rationalisation within the Corporation^ field.
