IS  DOCUMENT  IS   THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC   majesty&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1948SECRET Copy No.    ^CP. (48) 13026th May, 1948CABINETSCRAP  FROM  germany memorandum by the Minister of supply at their meeting on 8th April (CM. (48) 27th Conclusions, Minute 7) theCabinet considered a memorandum by me (CP. (48) 99) covering an InterimReport by the Scrap Investigation Committee on the prospects of obtaining steelscrap from Germany. The Cabinet approved the proposals made in the memo-randum for increasing deliveries of booty scrap from Germany and agreed thatendeavours should be made to place further contracts for commercial scrap fromGermany. I promised to circulate a further memorandum by the end of Mayshowing how far it had been possible to increase deliveries of booty scrap and what progress had been made in placing additional contracts for commercialscrap.2. The Scrap Investigation Committee in their Interim Report pointedout that the collection and delivery of booty scrap could be accelerated if addi-tional labour, technical supervising staff, equipment and transport were provided.As regards labour, I understand that the importance of booty scrap to the UnitedKingdom has been brought strongly to the notice of the Regional commissioners in the British Zone, that a high priority is being given to labour requirements for this work and that, as a result, the labour position has recently improvedappreciably. The technical supervising staff employed on booty scrap recoveryhas been considerably strengthened in recent weeks.3. Attention has been concentrated on securing the early provision of equip-ment and transport and I am glad to report that very satisfactory progress hasbeen made. Sources of supply have been located for all the items of equipment and transport required and arrangements made, in co-operation with all theGovernment Departments concerned (in particular the War Office), for the equipment to be made available, after such reconditioning as may be necessary,for booty scrap operations in Germany. A detailed statement of what has sofar been accomplished is given in the Appendix to this Memorandum.4. The effect of these measures on deliveries of booty scrap will, however,not become apparent until June at the earliest. The total tonnage of booty scrapreceived at shipping depots in Germany during April was less than in thepreceding month, but this was entirely due to the embargo imposed by the soviet authorities on barge and railway traffic from Berlin, the effect of which was tohold up some thousands of tons of scrap which otherwise would have reachedthe shipping depots during the past few weeks.Deliveries to shipping depots in Germany of booty scrap and of scrap fromother German sources up to the end of April last were as follows : ReparationsPeriod Booty Scrap     Purchased Scrap   and Government TotalSurplusTons Tons Tons Tons1946 (2 months)   ......... 9,451 37,872 ... 47,3231947                               ..... 270,575 142,527 ... 413,1021948 Tanuary       ......... 34,863 2,474 ... 37,337 1       ........ 36 328 3,079 ... 39,407March                   ...... 37,183 2,304 .     422 39,909April           &apos;......... 35,789 15,780 1,606 53,17535402
25. As regards commercial scrap, our efforts to secure supplies, in additionto those covered by the contracts for 140,000 tons which have not yet been com-pleted, culminated in our sending to Germany an officer with an expert knowledgeof the German scrap industry to establish direct contact with German scrap merchants. He was, however, quite unable to induce any scrap merchant to accept an order.6. It will be recalled that the Scrap Investigating Committee expressed theview in&apos;their First Interim Report that satisfactory deliveries of commercialscrap will not be forthcoming until currency reform has been introduced. while believe this to be true, I feel that it will in any case be necessary for somecentral organisation to be set up in Germany which will bring pressure to bearon the Germans to fulfil their obligations to supply scrap for export, control allexport sales and ensure that deliveries are made and distributed in accordancewith an allocation scheme. We have yet, however, to get the Americans to agreeto even a provisional allocation for this year. They appear to be partially con-vinced at last of the need for some controlling and executive machinery which canovercome the inertia at present being displayed by the German scrap merchants,and have agreed that a German central organisation should be set up which wouldhave some responsibility for ensuring that deliveries were made. Without sucha central organisation there would be no hope of getting any substantial quanti-ties of commercial scrap from Germany this year. The precise method of achieving the end in view is under discussion between the Foreign Office and myDepartment.7. With the object of securing the most effective machinery for obtaining the maximum amount of scrap from Germany, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs has agreed that some one of high prestige and authority as well as organ-ising ability and drive should be appointed to the Control Commission. On booty scrap his function would be to sponsor and co-ordinate with the control authorities our scrap recovery efforts and to see that so far as is humanly possibledifficulties of procurement and of the provision of plant, equipment, labour andtransport for the collection, sorting, cutting and shipment of the scrap wererapidly overcome. On commercial scrap, he might also act as the senior UnitedKingdom representative in Germany in all negotiations with the Americans and germans. We are agreed that a suitable choice would be Lieut.-General SirKenneth Loch, if he would be willing- to serve; General Loch is at present with theBritish Council and is also a member of the Graham Cunningham Scrap Investi-gation Committee.G.
