/HIS  DOCUMENT IS   THE PROPERTY OF   HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1948 103CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.     g QCP. (48) 13226th May, 1948CABINETSOCIAL SERVICES IN WESTERN EUROPE: M. BIDAULT&apos;proposal FOR AN EXHIBITIONMemorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign affairs append the Report of the Official Committee on Social Services in western europe on the proposal made by M. Bidault for a Social Services Exhibition to bearranged jointly by the five signatories to the Brussels Treaty.2. As my colleagues will be aware, I am anxious to promote any co-operativeproject which will yield useful results in the social service field, but I snare theCommittee&apos;s doubts about the effectiveness of an exhibition for this particularpurpose. There is, however, little doubt that the French will renew their proposal on the Consultative Council or Permanent Commission under the Brussels Treaty.3. I do not wish us to appear in any way unsympathetic about the objectiveat which M. Bidault is aiming, and if my colleagues accept the Official Committee&apos;recommendation that we should favour a film or series of films rather than anexhibition, it would be highly desirable to make a proposal to this effect as soonas possible through the machinery of the Brussels Treaty. I hope, therefore,that the Foreign Office and Central Office of Information, in consultation withthe Departments concerned with the main social services, may be authorised to study this matter quickly with a view to framing a definite proposal for submission to the Permanent Commission at a reasonably early date.E.

COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL  SERVICES  IN  WESTERN  EUROPEPROPOSED   SOCIAL  SERVICES   EXHIBITIONNote by the ChairmanI attach the report of my Committee on M. bidault&apos;s suggestion for a social services Exhibition.Briefly, the Committee&apos;s views are that the basic idea is a good one, thatthey do not favour an exhibition and treatment through the medium of the filmwould be much better and more effective, that the proposal for a film or series offilms should be studied by experts within the arrangements of the Brusselsmachinery and that the United Kingdom should be ready to submit concreteproposals at an early date.I would only add (1) That it is important that we should move quickly in this matter, as other-wise we may be faced with concrete proposals from other quarters foran exhibition which it would be difficult to resist; and(2) that whatever British Government Committee is charged with the dutyof drawing up concrete proposals should, for this purpose, have theassistance of representatives from the Departments concerned with themain social services, for example, the Ministry of Labour and NationalService, the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Ministry ofNational Insurance, Ministry of Pensions and Scottish Office.(Signed) G. MYRDDIN-EVANS.21st May, 1948.COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SERVICES IN WESTERN EUROPEProposed Social Services Exhibition1. The Committee were instructed (CM. (48) 29th Conclusions, Minute 2)to consider M. bidault&apos;s suggestion, made during the meeting in Paris on 17thApril of the Foreign Ministers of the five signatory Powers of the Brussels Treaty,that the five Powers should organise a joint Social Services Exhibition.2. In the Committee &apos;s view there is a great deal to be said for the basicidea which appears to underlie this suggestion, and they have very much sympathy with the principle of the proposal. To portray the progress made in social services in the five countries, perhaps emphasizing in the case of each of them the points of greatest development, would be of great human interest and wouldhave great educational value for all their peoples. Nor would the advantages to the &quot;Brussels&quot; Powers be confined to those just mentioned; the record of progress is a good one and any steps which would serve to show the rest of theworld what has been achieved in those countries would be a healthy correctiveto that propaganda of which there is much which suggests that in socialmatters the countries of Western Europe are &quot;backward.&quot;3. On the specific suggestion for a Social Services Exhibition, theCommittee have taken some preliminary soundings of the Public RelationsDepartments of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, the Ministry ofHealth, and the Ministry of National Insurance as well as of the Central Officeof Information. In the light of the views obtained the Committee are doubtfulwhether a Social Services Exhibition would be a satisfactory way of securing theresults aimed at. The subject is not, in their view, one which readily lendsitself to the Exhibition technique and the result might well be flat anduninteresting. In addition there are certain practical difficulties associatedwith an Exhibition of this kind which would themselves detract seriously fromthe value of an Exhibition. In order to permit of its being moved in turn to eachof the five &quot;Brussels &quot; countries, ihe Exhibition would have to be severelylimited m size.   Even so, it could reach only a relatively small number of people,
and this with a considerable time-lag and a corresponding fall in the publicinterest. Moreover, so far as this country is concerned, there are difficultiesconnected with the supply of the necessary materials, while the time of theDepartments mainly responsible for organising Exhibitions is fully mortgagedfor some time to come.4. An alternative method of portraying the growth and development ofthe Social Services would be through the medium of the film, and the committee consider that this has real possibilities which are worthy of study. The dis-advantages of an exhibition as set out above would not apply to a film or seriesof films, and the story of the Social Services could be made alive and interestingby use of the film technique. Copies could be shown in each of the countriessimultaneously and in the appropriate language. Moreover a much wider publicjin the &quot; Brussels &quot; countries woulid be reached than by any exhibition, and thejshowings need not be restricted to a particular geographical area, but could be shown anywhere in the world.5. It is clear, however, that any such film or series of films would needmuch careful preparation, and the Committee do not underrate the practicalidifficulties and objections which would need to be overcome. They understandthat there is another working party which is urgently studying the whole questionof publicity and propaganda in relation to Western Union, with a view to sub-mitting a memorandum on this subject at an early date to the permanent commision under the Brussels Treaty. The use of films, together with other methods of disseminating information about Western Union, will form part ofthat study. In these circumstances the Committee would wish only to emphasise that, as a means of giving effect to M. bidault&apos;s idea, the film affords muchgreater possibilities than an exhibition, to suggest that its possibilities shouldbe studied by experts in this field, working under the arrangements contemplate under the Brussels Treaty, and to recommend that concrete proposals shouldbe submitted by the United Kingdom at an early (date to any appropriatemachinery which may be established under the Brussels Treaty.; 6. Conclusions(1) The Committee warmly support the basic idea of portraying jointlythe social services of the &quot; Brussels &quot; countries.(2) An exhibition is not a good medium for this purpose, and a film or seriesof films would be better.(3) The proposals for a film or series of films would need detailed studyby experts under the arrangements contemplated in the brussels treaty and concrete proposals should be submitted by the UnitedKingdom at an early date.Signed on behalf of the Committee,G. MYRDDIN-EVANS.20th May, 1948.
