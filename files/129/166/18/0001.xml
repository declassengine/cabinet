US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 1436 December 1972CABINETMASS EXPULSIONS ON THE UGANDA MODELNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs and the Secretary of State for the Home department in -view of Parliamentary and public concern that if another country wereto follow the President of Uganda1 s example this country might be facedwith a further heavy influx of United Kingdom Passport Holders, we havebeen considering with some of our colleagues the form of a possiblestatement to Parliament.    With this note we circulate for the considerationof our colleagues the draft of a statement that might be made if it were decided that one was necessary.COPY NO    n aA D-HR foreign and Commonwealth Office6 December 1972
DRAFT At?;-:CUNCgIE-ITThe Government have thoroughly reviewed their policy about admission tothis country of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies living in other independent Commonwealth countries who hold no other citizenship and are eligiblfor the issue of United Kingdom passports.   Those who have no connexion by birthor descent with the United Kingdom or any of its dependent territories are believed to number about 250,000.   More than half of this number live inMalaysia and Singapore;   they have presented no real problem because they   havenever shown any wish to come to this country.   Host of the others areEast African Asians.2.    Successive Governments in the United Kingdom have kept a careful watch on tposition of East African Asians.   It is because they started, coming here from east Africa in substantial numbers that the immigration control was extended to people in this category in 1968.   The Act of that year was mainly aimed atphasing the entry to the United Kingdom of those Asians who were affected by theEast African Governments&apos; progressive policy of Africanisation.   The Act enabledthem to come here for settlement only if they obtained an employment voucheror a special voucher.   The Government of the day envisaged in 1968, and statedin Parliament, that if such persons were ejected from another country we wculdaccept the responsibility for taking them in.   Accordingly we admitted those whowere expelled from Uganda and who had nowhere else to go.   T.7e gratefullyacknowledge the assistance we have received from a number of Commonwealth   andother Governments, particularly the Governments of India and Canada, in dealingwith the Uganda situation.3.    Looking to the future, we shall continue to admit United Kingdom passpcrtholders from East Africa and India under the special voucher scheme in a controland orderly way, which alone will penait their satisfactory integration into cursociety.   But the Government consider that it would impose too heavy a burden or.
1 .       occaiinthis country if we again had to receive large numbers of people who have beendisplaced from their country of residence by mass expulsion.   We consider it right to /5ay this//ann0unce this decision/ at a moment when we have oust honaccepted the obligation thrust upon us by President Amin&apos;s urgent and inhumaneaction and when there is no immediate crisis.ii.    We believe that any future problems of this nature must be tackled byinter-governmental action and we propose, therefore, to embark at once on aseries of discussions with the Governments of Commonwealth and other countries aboutpossible means of dealing with them.   Suggestions have been made that we oughtto bring forward legislation to alter our nationality law so as to alleviate thedifficulties with which we could be faced.   Our nationality law is in need of bringing up to date and we shall proceed with the review of it which is already inhand.   But the real answer lies in co-operation with other governments,5.     In the discussions which we shall now initiate our objective will be tosecure arrangements which will not place on the United Kingdom a disproportionateburden and will at the same time be acceptable to other governments.
(secret)POSSIBLE EXPULSION OP UNITED KINGDOM PASSPORT HOLDERSINTRODUCTIONThis paper assesses the risk of a mass expulsion of United Kingdom passportholders from countries other than Uganda.2.     We concern ourselves throughout with non-white United Kingdom passportholders, or potential United Kingdom passport holders, subject to UnitedKingdom immigration control, and with no other citizenship.3.     The paper falls into two parts: the first deals with the situation in4 African countries, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia, where we see therisk of expulsion as highest; the second covers the rest of the world.4.     The paper is.written against the background of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfspresent immigration policies.   If those policies were to change in a way whichwas interpreted abroad as racially discriminatory, then a number of countries,notably India, Kenya and Tanzania, which at present co-operate     with her majesty&apos;s Government over, for example, the voucher system, would probablybe less inclined to continue to do so; but it seems unlikely that the reaction to such changes would in itself significantly increase the risk of massexpulsion of United Kingdom passport holders.SUMMARY5.     Although the anti-Asian pressures vary from one country to another, itis on the whole unlikely that under their present leaders any of the 4 african countries in question (Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia) will follow Amin&apos;sexample.   The situation in Kenya, Tanzania and Malawi could, however, changeunder successor Governments.   In general the risk of expulsion would be higherunder such Governments, particularly if they were unstable or weak..   &apos; --------     d iA .       1  : -     - v(secret)
(secret)6.     In Kenya anti-Asian pressures are strongest.    It is Government policy that United Kingdom passport holders must all eventually leave and we expect that the Kenyan Government will seek to increase their quota for entry intothe United Kingdom.   While Kenyatta remains in control, the Kenyan Governmentare likely to keep anti-Asian pressures in check.    There is a reasonable prospect of an orderly succession to Kenyatta and grounds for hoping thatthere would be no dramatic change in Asian policies under a successorGovernment.    But we cannot be sure of this and the chances of Asians becomingtargets would increase if there was instability or a weak Government.7.     Under Uyerere Tanzania is extremely unlikely to emulate Arain, thoughGovernment policy is that all United Kingdom passport holders must eventuallyleave and Tanzania will want to ensure that any concessions over quotas givento Kenya are also given to Tanzania.   Nyerere&apos;s position may recently have become less strong, but evidence does not so far suggest that he will bereplaced in the near future.    It is by no means certain that a successorGovernment would seek to emulate Amin, though the situation would then needre-assessing.   &apos; -8.     In Malawi, Banda does not - currently seek to expel Asians, thoughinfluential members of the Malawi establishment would like to see them frozenout.   We cannot be entirely sure of Banda-*s future policy and after Banda thesituation will require re-assessment.9.     In Zambia under Kaunda the risk of an expulsion of Asians is at presentvirtually nil.   We have no particular reason to think that a successorGovernment would follow a substantially different line, though large-scaleexpulsion of United Kingdom passport holders from the other African countries could generate internal pressure to follow suit.   ,&apos;i0.     In any event many Asians in East and Central Africa, particularlyUnited Kingdom passport holders, alarmed by Amin&apos;s action, are likely to seek to leave of their own accord, or to seek to get their money out.   This islikely to generate friction between Asians and host Governments and pressure for accelerated rate of admission to the United Kingdom.2
(secret)11.     Elsevrhere in the world the risk of a mass expulsion of non-white UnitedKingdom passport holders is slight, although in the longer term a refugeeproblem could in certain circumstances conceivably arise in Malaysia and hong Kong.i i   i 4s       i *  i    **(secret)
(secret)MAIN REPORTPART I.     THE ASIAN PROBLEM IN EAST AND CENTRAL AFRICAGeneralThis Part of the paper examines the likelihood of Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia orMalawi following President Amin,s example by expelling their Asians holdingUnited Kingdom passports.   In all 4 countries the obligation of HerMajesty1s Government to admit the Asians to the United Kingdom, should they be expelled, would be the same as in the case of Uganda.2.     Although other circumstances vary in the 4 countries, there are 2 commonfactors.    The first is that Asians, as in Uganda, are unpopular.    The degreeof resentment varies and is lowest in Zambia, but the reasons are broadly speaking the same.    It is not just that they have attained a controllingposition in trade, disproportionate to their numbers, but that they constitutealso an important&apos;middle class element, holding jobs in management, teaching and the civil service, to which the newly-educated Africans aspire.    On theother hand, all 4 Governments, and in particular their Presidents, disapproveof President Amin&apos;s methods, however much private sympathy there may be withthe principle of what he has done.    They recognise that Amin has broughtdiscredit to Black Africa as a whole, not only by the manner of his handling of the Asian problem, but also because of his own shortcomings and the widely-publicised tribal killings and disappearances of prominent Ugandans.    Thisis likely to restrain them from following Amin&apos;s example.Kenya f   J J &amp;       4 V t    j* ... . .3.     Of the 4 countries, Kenya presents the most serious problemj not only because of the size of the Asian community, but also because public andpolitical anti-Asian pressures^ are strongest.   The total Asian communitynumbers approximately 105,000, of whom probably about 35iOOO are UnitedKingdom passport holders.   It is Kenyan Government policy that the latter mustall eventually leave Kenya and at the current rate of departure this will take6-7 years.   Amin&apos;s announcement on 4 August expelling Asians from Uganda was : .(secret)
b is a copy. the original is1Detained under section 3 (4)of the public records actareceived with sympathy and understanding in Kenya, not only by the man in the street, but also among the educated, classes and some members of the Government.These reactions were tinged with malice towards the Asians in Kenya, whereAfrican traders in particular are bitter about the continued Asian success infreezing them out of business.   The initial reaction to Amih&apos;s announcement on the part of the Asian-baiters, including some members of Parliament, wasto increase the virulence .of their anti-Asian propaganda.   This led to public statements by President Kenyatta and Vice-President Moi which underlined theKenyan policy whereby all non-citizen Asians must ultimately leave the country,so reassuring the African population that the Government policy remained unchanged, but which were probably also designed to keep down the temperature.4.     In the months since Amin&apos;s announcement have reflectedcontinuing unease in Government circles that public and Parliamentary anti-Asian pressures could build up to a point where they would become difficultto control, particularly if, as expected, the coming months see an increasein the Governments economic and political problems.   However,  there have alsobeen reliable indications that the Kenyan Government has no intention of following Amin&apos;s example - ie to the point of ordering wholesale expulsionswithin a short time-limit.   Their attitude is one of private understandingfor the principle of Amin&apos;s action, but disapproval of his methods and anawareness of the damage to the Kenyan economy (already likely to suffer fromthe Ugandan situation) if similar action was taken, even in a modified form.In particular, they are aware that they cannot afford to lose the confidence of foreign investors.   There are indications that in order to keep anti-Asianpressures under control the Kenyan Government will seek to increase the quota for the entry of Asians into the United Kingdom, but so far they have notofficially requested this.   On 7 November Moi made it clear in a public state-ment that the Government expected Her Majesty&apos;s Government to increase therate at which Kenyan Asians are accepted, but we know thaton the same day he expressed concern in confidence about the disturbing effectthat Amin&apos;s policies were having on Kenyan Asians, adding that he contemplatedissuing a statement reassuring them that the Government had no intention of taking &quot;harsh or illicit&quot; action against them.5*     A key factor is the position of Kenyatta.   The latter has deliberatelyadopted a low profile towards the Ugandan situation, has made no public statemenl5(secret)
and does not intend to become involved if he can avoid it.   At the same time he wishes to prevent the Ugandan problems spilling over into Kenya.    his instructions to his Government have been that as little as possible should besaid about the Ugandan Asians or about the Asian problem in Kenya.   He hopes that this will prevent popular antagonism towards the Asians in Kenya from becoming unduly aroused.    He is reported to have reminded Hoi on 13 november that the British were &quot;Kenya1s friends&quot; and to have said that, rather thantrying to accelerate the rate of departure, Moi should concentrate on makingsure that his Department did not connive at abuses of the immigration procedure as long as Kenyatta remains in control it is unlikely that anything willhappen to change the present Kenyan approach.    There have been signs that heis beginning to lose his grip; but even if Kenyatta does leave the sceneduring the next year or so, the chances of a reasonably orderly successionare still fairly good.   The likelihood of the Asians becoming a target would increase if there was disorder or internal instability, or if a weakerGovernment came to power;  though a relevant factor is that the Asian communityhas taken care by a variety of means, probably including the use of bribes,to retain the goodwill and support of Kenyan Ministers.6.     In sum, while Kenyatta remains in control a decision to follow Amin&apos;sexample by expelling United Kingdom passport holders en masse and within ashort period is unlikely.    The situation after Kenyatta&apos;s departure will beless certain.   But in any event there will be increased public and political pressure on the Kenyan Government to get rid of the Asians at a faster rate.This is bound to lead, in our view, to Kenyan pressure on Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to increase the quota.Tanzania7.     Of an approximate total of 70,000 Asians in Tanzania, about 15-20,000are United Kingdom passport holders.   As in Kenya, it is Government policy that the latter must all eventually leave the country and at the current rateof departure this will take about 16 years.   Generally speaking, publicantagonism towards Asians is less strong than in Kenya and Uganda (there is,for example, still one Asian Cabinet Minister) and pressiire on them to leave6
has hitherto been less intense.    One reason is that they have less of a gripon commerce because of President Nyerere*s nationalisation policies, withwhich the Asians co-operated.    There is, however, one aspect of government policy which produces a situation unique to Tanzania.   An Asian United Kingdompassport holder is declared a prohibited immigrant as soon as he becomesunemployed or, in the case of teenagers, soon after his 18th birthday.Thereafter, if he is unable to obtain a voucher admitting him to the UnitedKingdom, he is liable to be brought to court and heavily fined.    This results in considerable hardship to individuals.8.     President Nyerere condemned Amin&apos;s action in unequivocal terms and aslong as he remains in control the chances of similar action to Amin&apos;s beingtaken in Tanzania can virtually be ruled out.   There have been some indication that Nyerere&apos;s position is weaker particularly following his involvement inthe abortive invasion of Uganda by pro-Obote guerillas in September, but sofar the evidence does not add up to the likelihood that he will be displacedin the near future.    Even if he was displaced, it is by no means certain,given recent Tanzanian-Ugandan hostility, that a successor Government would seek to emulate Amin, though the situation v/ould require re-assessing.9.     Nevertheless, Amin&apos;s actions have been received with sympathy in someTanzanian circles and pressure on the Government could develop to accelerate the departure of the Asians.    This could lead to Tanzanian pressure on her majesty&apos;s Government to increase the quota,  particularly if it was thoughtthat more attention was being paid to Kenyan than to Tanzanian needs.Malawi10.     There are about 13,000 Asians&apos; with United Kingdom passports out of atotal Asian community numbering approximately 14j000.   Unlike Kenya andTanzania, the United Kingdom passport holders are not required to leave the&apos;c&apos;ountry systematically as a matter of Government policy, though individualsare periodically deported for currency and other offences.   President Bandasupports the continued presence of an Asian community in Malawi, including those with United Kingdom passports, providing they conform to Malawi laws7
(secret)and customs and co-operate in the Africanisation of trade and business.Following Amin&apos;s announcement that non-citizen Asians were to be expelled fromUganda, Banda offered to receive up to 1,000 of the expelled A.russians.    (inthe event only 35 Asians have gone from Uganda to Malawi.)   He then assured the Asian community in Malawi that they could &quot;live and die here providingthey were not obscene or arrogant&quot;.11.     But this is not the whole picture.    Some influential members of theMalawi establishment would like to see the gradual freezing out of Asiansfrom the country.    Steps have already been taken to reduce Asian tradingfacilities in rural areas and there have been indications that some seniorMalawians would like to see Asians prevented from trading not only in rural areas, but also in the towns; with the ultimate aim of convincing them thatthere was no future for them in Malawi so that they would leave the country.This is not Banda&apos;s policy, but it could become the policy once he has departedor sooner if he found it politically expedient to change direction.    Thesituation is therefore one of uneasy stability at present (ie as long as Bandaexercises undisputed control), but future uncertainty.   A fresh assessmentwould need to be made at the time if there were a change of Government.Zambia12.     Of the 4 countries, Zambia provides the least, future uncertainty forthe Asians.   Of a total of under 10,000 Asians in the country, about 6,000are British passport holders.   As in Malawi, the latter are not required toleave the country systematically as a matter of Government policy, thoughaccess to the special quota for entry to the United Kingdom is available ifneeded.   There appears to be no strong anti-Asian feeling in Zambia, though there have been some indications of impatience with their exclusiveness.In September, President Kaunda strongly condemned Amin&apos;s action in expelling .Asians from Uganda.   In early October, President Giri of India, on a StateVisit, publicly assured the community of his confidence that action such ashad taken place in Uganda would never, in his view, occur in Zambia.    Itseems unlikely that he would have made so categorical a statement withoutobtaining the prior approval of Kaunda.   We assess the likelihood of Asians8 .(secret)
(secret)being expelled en masse from Zambia as virtually non-existent at present andthere is no particular reason to expect that any successor Government wouldbe likely to adopt a substantially different line.   However, if there was a move towards large-scale expulsion of United Kingdom passport holders from theother countries, pressure might build up in Zambia for the Government tofollow suit.Reaction of the Asians13-     Regardless of the current attitudes of the Governments of the countriesin which they live, many of the Asians themselves, particularly those with united Kingdom passports, probably see Amin&apos;s action in Uganda as the writingon the wall for Asians generally in Africa.    It is likely that they will seekin increasing numbers to leave under their own arrangements.    This will be anadded factor in increasing pressure on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to accelerate the rate of admittance to the United Kingdom.    It is likely also to lead toAsians increasingly seeking, by one mee-ns or another, to get their money outof their present countries of residence.    This could lead to increased friction between the host Government and the Asians.Prospects14-     Although the Asians are, and will continue to be, generally unpopular,present evidence suggests it is unlikely that any of the 4 countries will decide to expel Asians en masse in the near future.    It can, however, beexpected that Kenya will seek to bring pressure on Her Majesty1s Governmentto increase the rate of departure from Kenya of Asians holding Britishpassports; and that the Tanzanians will expect any concessions granted to kenya to be matched for Tanzania.    The situation could change in Kenya,Tanzania or Malawi if the ^present rulers were displaced.   Although there isno particular reason to expect that successor Governments would support suchdrastic policies as those of Arain, the likelihood of anti-Asian measures could increase in circumstances of internal instability or weaker government.The situation would require re-assessing in each case but in general we seethe risk under successor Governments in these 3 countries as likely to be higher than at present.    In the case of Zambia, it seems unlikely that a mass9
(secret)expulsion of Asians holding British passports will he ordered in the foreseeable future,  even if there was a change of Government.PART II.    THE REST OP THE WORLDGeneral15^     Outside East Africa, there is again no present reason to expect any country to decide to emulate Amin.    In many countries overseas there arenon-white United Kingdom passport holders, or potential United Kingdom passportholders, subject to immigration control, and with no other citizenship.    Butin most of these countries the numbers do not run into 5 figures; thus theproblem does not arise even in principle.    The exceptions are India, Ceylon,Singapore, Malaysia and certain Dependent Territories.India.16.   There are probably some 25,000 persons in this category in India.   almost all are East African Asians, who have gone to India from East Africa over theyears.    India has had little difficulty in assimilating these immigrants andthe likehihood of the Indian Government taking any discriminatory actionagainst them is remote.Sri Lanka17-     In Sri Lanka, probably around 400,000 Tamils (mostly tea estate coolies)fall within this category, although very few in fact hold United Kingdompassports or have shown any interest in obtaining one.   The status of theseTamils is regarded by India and Sri Lanka as a matter for these 2 countriesalone.    Thus, this group&apos; is^unTikely*ift practice to present any problem forthe United Kingdom.Singapore and Malaysia18.     There are probably some 30,000 persons in this category in singapore and some 110,000 (mostly of Indian descent) in Malaysia.   There is no immediate prospect of either the Singapore or Malaysian Governments taking discriminatory10
action against these groups.    Singapore enjoys a high degree of political stability and the economy is booming.    In the unlikely event of an economicrecession in Singapore, it is possible that the Government would takediscriminatory action, for example, in the employment field,  in favour of singapore citizens to the detriment of non-citizens.    This could lead to pressure on non-citizens to make their homes elsewhere, but any mass exodusis most unlikely.   Malaysia has been, at least outwardly, cairn since the communal violence of 19^9-    The economy is growing.    The Government is, howeverengaged on a programme of deliberate discriminationt notably in the economicand educational fields, in favour of the Malays to the detriment of theChinese and Indian communities.    The danger of further communal troublesremainsIf such trouble arose, the Government could react harshly against the non-Malay communities.    One vulnerable group would be non-citizen Indians, andthe possibility of mass expulsion of these in such circumstances cannot be excluded.    There is even a possibility, though it must be regarded as a veryremote one, that the Government, in extreme circumstances of communal disorder,would attempt to deprive all non-Malays of Malaysian citizenship.    If thathappened, some 1 million of them, born in Malacca and Penang before 1957, orthe children of fathers so born, at present dual United Kingdom/Malaysiannationals, would become legally a United Kingdom responsibility.Dependent Territories19*     As long as Her Majesty&apos;s Government retain their responsibility in the dependent Territories, the question of mass expulsions or an uncontrolledinflux of their inhabitants into the United Kingdom does not arise.   Thereare, however, 2 Dependencies where a majority of the population falls intothe category defined in Paragraph 15 above, and which are claimed by foreign states.   These are:a.     Hong KongSome 2 million people of Chinese race in this category live in Hong Kong.Although the Peking Government claims that Hong Kong is part of China,present indications are that Peking regards this problem as one for eventual peaceful negotiation between China and Britain, and that meanwhilPeking is content that the Colony should continue to exist.   This is unlikely to be a problem for the near future.    But if and when sovereignty11
over the Colony&apos;- eventually reverts to Peking, whether by force or by negotiation, China would certainly expect the Chinese in Hong Kong to acknowledge their Chinese citizenship.   We think it probable that onlya limited number of Hong Kong Chinese, mainly those particularly associatedwith the Colonial Government, would wish to come to the United Kingdom.It is impossible to quantify these; various estimates ranging from 90,000to 250,000 have been given.    But the number who in practice became a united Kingdom responsibility would depend on the way in which Hong Kongin the event came under Peking&apos;s control (a violent takeover might leavefew the option to leave, even if they wanted to and for many the choiceto stay or leave would depend on how Peking seemed likely to run HongKong after a takeover).b.     British HondurasThere are some 120,000 persons in this category in British Honduras whichis claimed by Guatemala.    We have no reason to believe that the Guatemalansare at present intending to pursue their claim by force;    or that,  if theydid, this would necessarily produce a significant refugee problem.    Itis impossible to predict to what extent such a problem might arisefollowing a negotiated settlement.Associated States20.     A high proportion of the total population of some 470,000 of the associated States in the Caribbean consists of people in the same category.However, at present we can foresee no circumstances in which a mass expulsionof such people might arise.   Persons in this category will cease to be entitledto United Kingdom passports as each of the territories concerned becomesindependent.rAssessment Staff,Cabinet Office24 November 1972&apos;   &apos;   I - . 12 : &apos; &apos;   &apos;(secret)
