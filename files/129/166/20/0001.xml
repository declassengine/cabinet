DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 145 COPY NO     6 78 December 1972CABINETCHANGES IN ASSISTED AREASMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the Environmenthas been considering possible changes in assisted areas arising from aproposal that the intermediate area (LA) of Edinburgh, Leith and Portobelloshould become a development area (DA).    The LA was created whenassisted areas were reviewed in March 1971.    It was recognised thatEdinburgh had been left as an isolated pocket in an otherwise assisted area;but it was felt that to make it a DA would not be defensible withoutcomparable treatment for other areas in England and Wales.2. Edinburgh&apos;s claim for DA status is long standing, and has beenstrenuously pressed since 1970 when unemployment in the area sharplyincreased.    It is now the only area north of Yorkshire which is not a DA.In terms of unemployment the case is not conclusive (details are at annex);though the geographical anomaly may prove an embarrassment in negotiations within the European Economic Community (e.c.) to settle our&quot;central&quot; and &quot;peripheral&quot; areas, and Leith will suffer in competition withother east coast ports which can offer DA benefits for operations connectedwith North Sea oil.3,        If the Edinburgh IA were to be upgraded, several other areas willexpect similar treatment on grounds either of worse unemployment, poorerprospects, or a geographical situation equally anomalous.    Officials have reviewed the field, and consider that the strongest all round claims arethose of Cardiff and Newport to be upgraded from IA to DA, and ofChesterfield, now a derelict land clearance area, to be upgraded to IA(details at annex).    Apart from these Lincoln has a strong claim on grounds of geographical anomaly, and other areas have higher male unemployment,for instance Hull (8.1 per cent), Torbay (8.5 per cent - seasonal), Boltonand the surrounding area (6. 6 per cent), Newark (6. 6 per cent); but to concede all these would dilute benefits still wider and bring yet other areas to the new boundary line.4. The Exchequer cost over a full year of upgrading the Edinburgh iate DA is tentatively estimated at  6- 7 million, and of upgrading the Cardiffand Newport IA to DA at f 11- 13 million; the cost of including Chesterfieldin the IA is not likely to be significant (see note at annex).    The total cost1
over the period of the current public expenditure survey might amount to 50 million which would be additional to the programme already agreed.The only way in which an addition to public expenditure could be avoidedwould be if changes in policies or programmes were made elsewhere to achieve corresponding reductions.    The Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry does not feel that there is scope for this within his ownprogrammes,5. The Committee considered three options.a. To make no change.    In the last two years there have beentwo reviews of assisted area boundaries, and we have argued as aGovernment that industry now needs a period of stability.    To make changes now may relieve existing pressures, but other claimantsalready exist and new ones will inevitably appear;  small changestend only to dilute the effect of our regional policies and increaseexpenditure with little benefit to the assisted areas as a whole.b. To upgrade the Edinburgh IA alone.    This would have to be defended mainly on the grounds of Edinburgh1 s isolated position inthe Scottish DA, with particular reference to the problems of Leith.To confine action to Edinburgh should minimise pressure for changes elsewhere, but would be difficult to justify on grounds ofemployment.c. To upgrade the Edinburgh and Cardiff and Newport IAJs,and make Chesterfield an IA.    Cardiff and Newport face large-scaleredundancies in steel and are likely to be affected by coalminingredundancies in the surrounding DA.    Chesterfield, whoseunemployment rate is higher than Edinburgh^, is sandwichedbetween two IA&apos;s.6. The Committee was not able to decide between these options.    Themajority of the Committee considered that the choice lay between makingno change and upgrading all three areas; though if the latter option werenot accepted the Secretary of State for Scotland would press for theEdinburgh IA to be upgraded alone.    The Committee also agreed that ifchanges were to be made now, they should be done before 1 January 1973,because of the need to settle the pattern of our assisted areas beforebeginning negotiations within e.c.;  and that all further representationsmust be resisted for some time to come.7. I invite the Cabinet to decide which option should be adopted.R home Office8 December 19722

In IA&apos;s (and in derelict land clearance areas untilMarch 1974) RD&amp; are pauable on new buildings on qualifying premises.   Officialsbelieve that there will be no additional costs for selective regional assistance under the Industry Act, since increased costs in one area would probably be offset by reductions elsewhere.   If the Edinburgh IA and the Cardiff and Newport IA areupgraded to DA&apos;s, the phasing of expenditure on REP and EDG is tentativelyestimated as follows:1973-74      1974-75      1975-76      ,1976-77REP -t- 8 + 6 * *RDG + 8 4-9 4-9 +10Total        +16 +15 4-9* 4- 10**Additions in these years will depend on the method of phasing out REP andwhether anything replaces it.
