DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 149 COPY NO 0 J11 December 1972CABINETTHE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME FOR 1972-73Memorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Cabinet have accepted in principle (CM(72) 52nd Conclusions,Minute 1) that some reduction in the legislative programme must besecured,,    To assist in our further consideration of the matter I haveshown in the Annex to this paper the Bills which colleagues still wishto introduce in the current Session indicating those Bills which probablycannot be deferred and those which should be considered for deferment.Bills which are at present on the Reserve List are also shown, but not bills for the Second Reading Committee procedure since such Bills will not go ahead unless the Opposition agree to that procedure for the Bill inque stion.2. Measures to deal with Inflation and on Northern Ireland togetherwith the Finance and Consolidated Fund Bills must be given first priority in the remainder of the Session; and these measures together with thelegislation already introduced will make heavy demands on the availablelegislative time.    We cannot accommodate all the other Bills except atthe expense of another Session at least as bad and possibly worse than thelast two Sessions.    Recesses would again have to be shortened; importantGovernment business would again have to be taken after 10 o&apos;clock;   andmany reasonable and strongly-supported requests for debates on importantsubjects would have to be refused.    In my judgment and that of the chief whip, we would be severely criticised if we were to inflict on parliamentary wholly unreasonable burden of legislation;  and unless we lighten theprogramme the Bills to which we must give priority will be jeopardised.3.        There are four major Bills which have not yet been introduced and,in consultation with the Chief Whip, I have regretfully concluded that I must ask my colleagues to agree that two of them should be deferred.    The Billsare:-Training and EmploymentWater ReorganisationLocal GovernmentInsurance
4. In addition, I recommend that the Channel Tunnel and UnoccupiedOffice Properties Bills should be deferred.    Although there is a case for introducing a short money Bill on the Channel Tunnel in July I believe itwould be practicable to defer it until after the Summer Recess and possiblyuntil nejit Session.    As regards Unoccupied Office Properties I accept that something must be done to deal with the problem of Centre Point but I verymuch hope that some method not involving legislation can be founda    Whetheror not Spot-the-Bali will be needed depends upon the decision now awaitedfrom the House of Lordp in the appeal case.    We will not know until wehave received recommendations from the Speaker^ Conference whetherthe Bill on Electoral Registration will be required.&apos;   Of the three scottish bills, it has already been agreed that the Lord High Commissioner (church of Scotland) Bill should be deferred at least for the time being, but provided the Second Reading of the other two Bills can be taken in the Scottish GrandCommittee I would have no objection to their proceeding.    I would hopeBhowever, that it would be possible to defer the Bill to make amendments to United Kingdom legislation consequential on changes in Northern Irelandlav/.J privy Council Office11 December 1972
