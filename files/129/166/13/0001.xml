DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 1384 December 1972CABINETRELOCATION OF DEFENCE FACILITIES FROM SHOEBURYNESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for defence, My Department has to relocate essential defence facilities from theProof and Experimental Establishment, Shoeburyness, to make way for theThird London Airport,    My colleagues were informed of the position on8 August (CM(72) 40th Conclusions, Minute 9), and promised support.There are strong local objections to one of the planned sites, Tain inRoss and Cromarty,    Despite these, the Ministerial Committee on regional Policy and the Environment accepted in October that therewas no alternative to Tain, and that, since a public inquiry would onlyexacerbate the situation, we should dispense with one.    The Committee&apos;view was reported in a minute from the Home Secretary to the PrimeMinister dated 23 October (now circulated to members of the Cabinet).In view of the political difficulties, I am asking my colleagues to affirmthe decision of the Committee.2.        The facilities planned to be located at Tain, and the penalties ofnot reproviding them, are described in Annex A.3. Because of the strong (although not, in the opinion of the Committee,overriding) local opposition to Tain, I have again reviewed all conceivablealternatives, including sites in Northern Ireland as well as England,Scotland and Wales.    I have also consulted the Defence Lands Committee,which under an independent Chairman, Lord Nugent, and with outsidemembers, is examining defence land holdings, and is due to report early next year.4. This further review shows that only one alternative site has emerged, castle martin in Wales, and this would entail the most severeproblems.    The site had been considered at an earlier stage, but rejectedbecause we should have to dispossess the Germans, now using it, with theRoyal Armoured Corps, as a tank range.    The objections to such adispossession still remain; moreover, the Defence Lands Committeeseek to release Lulworth, the site of the Royal Armoured Corps GunnerySchool, and castle martin is a key relocation site in their plans,copy NO
5. Annex B sets out the implications of putting the Shoeburynessfacilities into castle martin.    All the options which would then remainwould have serious political and/or military consequences.    If Lulworthcannot be released, the value of the Defence Lands Committee&apos;s majorreview will be seriously impaired, if not put in question; if the germans are dispossessed, this would not only be disadvantageous to Anglo-german relations and European defence collaboration, but would also carry therisk of the loss of the much greater British tank training facilities inGermany, which are vital to the efficiency of BAOR;  a land-acquisitionof 6,000-7, 000 acres at Kirkcudbright, which would be required if Lulworthwere released and the German training reprovided, wo-ild be likely to createeven greater environmental and political objections than the relatively smallland-take proposed at Tain.6, My colleagues will wish to consider if the penalties in overcoming the local opposition at Tain are commensurate with those involved inchanging the use of castle martin, with the consequent large land-takeat Kirkcudbright, unless Lulworth is retained and the training facilities at present provided for the German Army in Britain are withdrawncompletely.    Of the possible courses of action I consider that theTain solution is the least objectionable and I seek my colleagues&apos;agreement accordingly.c ministry of Defence4 December 1972
Annex AFUNCTIONS TO BE REPROVED ED AT TAIN1.     These are:a.     the development and assessment of Naval proximity fuzes;h.     the proof of Naval fuzes;c. accuracy trials of tank and anti-tank guns and ammunitionat ranges up to 3,000 metres;d. proof of production for anti-tank ammunition andfragmentation trials of HE shell:e. proof and development trials of graze fuzes;f. the R&amp;D &quot;battery, with comprehensive instrumentationfor gun and ammunition development trials;g. climatic chamber for development and evaluation trialsto cover NATO standard temperatures.2.      If these are not reprovided, UK research and development oflarge calibre weapons and ammunition will be halted, as will theessential proof of fuzes and tank ammunition.   A large part ofthe defence research, development and production capability wouldbe removed, with consequent redundancy, reliance on foreign supplyand loss of sales,  in addition to the repercussions on collaborativeprojects such as the next main &quot;battle tank and the 155 mm systems.There would clearly be severe operational penalties.- 1 -
Annex DCASTLEMART IN1.     The main recommendation which the Defence Lands Committeeseek to make is the release to the public of the tank trainingrange at Lulworth on the Dorset coast.    This is, in fact, theonly major release of land which the Committee is likely to propose.2.     The RAC Gunnery School now at Lulworth can only be re-locatedat the RAC range at castle martin in Wales,  or at the MilitaryVehicles range at Kirkcudbright in Scotland.    Neither site couldaccommodate both the RAC tank training requirement and theShoeburyness facilities nor could these facilities be fitted in with the existing use of Kirkcudbright.    The effect of locatingthese facilities at castle martin would therefore mean that the only alternative range to Lulworth for the RAC would be Kirkcudbright.3.     Moreover, castle martin is also used as a tank training rangefor the Germans.    If we are to continue to provide facilities forthem, they too,  if castle martin were denied them, would have tobe accommodated at Kirkcudbright, if they were prepared to go there.k.     The options,  if the Shoeburyness facilities were to go toCastlemartin, are therefore:a.     to retain Lulworth for the RAC Gunnery School relocatingthe castle martin training,  including the Germans&apos;, atKirkcudbright.    This would mean the acquisition of some,200 - 1,500 acres of land at Kirkcudbright,  and thetransfer of the military vehicle range to castle martin.- 6 -
b. to release Lulworth and accommodate both British andGerman tank training at Kirkcudbright.    This would entail a land-take of some 6000-7000 acres and (again)the transfer to castle martin of the military vehiclerange.c. to release Lulworth, but to deprive the Germans oftheir training facilities altogether, moving the RoyalArmoured Corps facilities to Kirkcudbright with theacquisition of some 1,200-1,500 acres.d. to retain Lulworth, to deprive the Germans of their training facilities, to retain the military vehiclerange at Kirkcudbright, and to colocate at Castlemartinthe Royal Armoured Corps training now carried on therewith the Shoeburyness facilities.    There would be noland-take at Kirkcudbright on this solution.5.      If the Shoeburyness facilities were to be relocated at Tain,the Defence Lands Committee would retain the option^ of recommending the release of Lulworth without incurring the penalties of dis-possessing the Germans or of requiring the land-take of 6000-7000acres noted at paragraph Jib above.k December 1972- 7 -
