THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 156 COPY NO      6318 December 1972CABINETBRITISH STEEL CORPORATION: DEVELOPMENT STRATEGYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. Since the Cabinet&apos;s preliminary discussion of the British steel corporation^ (BSC) development strategy (CM(72) 58th Conclusions,Minute 11), the Ministers directly concerned have discussed with theChairman of BSC and members of his Board the issues on which mycolleagues had voiced concern.    The Annex summarises the answers we obtained.2.        The important points made by the BSC are:-a. Compared with other developed countries, the United kingdom has under -in vesved for a decade;  assets per man employed in japan are Z\ times greater.b. Steel industry employment will be at higher risk by lessmodernisation than by more.c. Striking cost reductions are possible ( 10 a ton on one mainproduct) and quality improvements are also necessary to remaincompetitive.d. The world market will rise from 600 to 900 million tonnesbetween 1970 and 1980 and the European Coal and Steel community countries will account for a production of 165 million tonnes;  the potential world market for exports is 125 million tonnes:  what isat issue is what our share of this is to be.e. BSC have already reduced their sights in export marketsto lessen risks of unprofitability; their expectation of a risingshare of the United Kingdom market reflects the fact that the fastestdemand growth is for the products they produce;  their priceassumptions are not excessive compared with the allowance theyhave built in for general inflation.f. The risk of low profitability from proceeding needs to beset against the risks to employment, the balance of payments andinsufficient investment for growth if we do not.
g. We cannot afford to forgo the lower costs obtainable fromconcentrating bulk steelmaking at large coastal works, whereraw materials can be assembled most cheaply;  it would make no commercial sense to redevelop steel making at Shotton at an extra cost of  4 a tonne (though finishing processes, employing6000 men, can economically continue there) and, even if we did,nearly 3000 jobs would still have to go.h. In Scotland, however, without fundamentally affectingtheir strategy, BSC can raise steel making capacity ultimately to 4-g- million tonnes by further developing Ravenscraig and electric arc plant, and will maintain a wide range of finishingprocesses.3. I think those of my colleagues who were present would agree thatit was evident to us that bsc&apos;s choice of strategy had been based on avery thorough analysis, backed up by careful examination of all thepractical alternatives;  and that wo need to judge the strategy as acomposite whole.    The part-time members, as much as the full-time members, showed themselves fully committed to it and made two points which my colleagues may think pertinent:a. A firm decision in favour of this kind of strategy, whichthey had recommended only after the most detailed enquiry,was necessary if the United Kingdom was not to become the residual legatee of other countries&apos; decisions.b. Sir David Barran, asked by the Prime Minister whether,if he had the same decision to make as Chairman of a private company, he would adopt the strategy, unequivocally said thathe would.4. The presentation has confirmed me in my views that the right course for us is to approve the strategy.    It is of course vital that weshould have a control over the timing within the strategy for this could have a substantial effect both on profitability and on social and economic problems.    We have therefore agreed a procedure with the BSCwhereby every major development will be reviewed by the department and cannot proceed other than on the basis of the Departmentsagreement.    I invite my colleagues to agree that I should make theattached statement on Wednesday 20 December.P w department of Trade and Industry18 December 19722CEfRFT
p r       ^-MM-m rV   Von   Am  prMINISTERSThe risk :of ovcrcapacity.       World, steel consumption is predictedto rise from 600m tonnes in 19?0 to 900m tonnes in 1980.   ECSCcountries alone will use 165m tonnes and the potential world market for exports is 125m tonnes-     If the UK is to win a proper share ofthis market, ESC&apos;s plans are not ever-ambitious.     Moreover we startfrom a position of having seriously under-invested in steel for adecade: capital per man employed in the Japanese steel industry is 24-times our own and in order to match thea and. our major Europeancompetitors we must get quality up and. costs down.    (The Port Talbotexpansion provides a striking example of the cost reductions obtainable 10 a tonne on steel strip.)      Ox the  300m average annual investmentBSC propose, two-thirds is needed simply to maintain and. moderniseexisting capacity, and only one-third is for expansion.     the investment programme relies largely on -established processes and. isnot open to major technological risk.   Half of it should be internally-financed; and BSC have confirmed that they can reduce the investmentpeak in 1976/77 so as not to exceed the  360m   for which we have-made provision in the Public Expenditure Survey.2.     Robustness to market risks.       BSC s primary objective is todevelop a profitable business and, before submitting their strategy,they adjusted it to take account of market risks, for example byaiming to supply rather less than the UK&apos;s traditional share of export markets, whose profitability could be in doubt.    In the home market, bsc&apos;s assumption is that imports would be brought down totheir historical market share,  since the current level reflects aperiod of slack trade which Community producers have used, to establish a footing here prior to our accession; within ECSC, whilst there willbe more inter-trading, we should be able to hold our own.,    Theassumption that BSC1s own share of the home market would increasereflects the fact that BSC are the only UK producers of products suchas sheet for motor cars and consumer durables, pipes and structuralsections for the North Sea, which represent the fastest-growing partof the market.    As to their price assumptions, discussion with other-steel producers convinced them that the world steel industry wouldbe bound to retain much of the proceeds of future efficiency gainsto finance investment, and would not be able to afford to pass them on in prices.     Nonetheless, bsc&apos;s plan assumes that steel prices would rise by less than the 6 per cent general cost inflation (9 percent wage inflation) for which they have allowed.     For these reasonsthey do not consider they have been over-optimistic, and believe the strategy   to be reasonably robust; the high-investment course they recommend is not of course risk-free, but the &quot;downside risks&quot; of itsproving unprofitable must be weighed against those of a low-investmentcourse - inadequate capacity to sustain growth, greater import-dependence at the expense of the balance of payments, and reduced, employment in the plant industry (where BSC s proposals would maintain some 75,000 jobs, principally in heavy electrical,mechanical and. civil engineering).3*     Emplorpient and Social Consequences.    More important still, thefailure to modernise, and. thereby remove the danger of becominguiicompeiitive in both cost and. quality, would threaten the long-termjob security of all steelworkers, and would represent a far greaterrisk to employment than the strategy itself, as the steel unions (towhom BSC have disclosed, their plans in detail) acknowledge.    The50,000 job losses required, by the strategy would be spread over/8-1.G years

Because othe need for plants to specialise, however, Scotland cannot sensibly hava self-contained industry but mast import some- products and export other6,?eess.id&apos;The reasons why BSC think it essential to have a commitment new to build a new steel complex on Teesside are that thisworks would be the only plant of completely modern design with whichthey can expect to enter&quot; the 1980&apos;s;    and there is need to settle the pattern of strategic developmnt for the sake of other necessary investme.decisions - for example the location of the 2m tonne plate mill that is needed to meet modern specifications for shipbuilding and for the north sea:    and so that they can plan and assure raw material supplies, new amatter of some urgency.     BSC acknowledge that commitment now x^ould tendto reduce their flexibility of response- to slower market growth, but.argue that enough flexibility would remain - upwards by their ability to defer clos&quot;ore of older plant, and downwards by carrying those closuresthrough and, if need be, under-running modern plant for a time - withoutputting any modern plant at risk;    and that this would be a cheaper courof action than if they were forced to rely wholly on older plant andheritage developments alone, as well as providing a better long term,assurance of stable employment for their 180,000 labour force in the1980&apos;s.7-     The economic justification for concentrating balk steelmakingaylarge coastal plants is. firstly the need to deliver the raw materials(principally oreJT which represents half the cost of the liquid steel,at costs competitive with *those of major overseas works:    this requireslarge ships and the avoidance of double-handling on shore.     Secondly,the economic size of modern blast furnaces and steelmaking units/dictates

With permission, Mr Spealcer, I wish to make a statement&quot; onSECRETthe modernisation programme of the British Steel Corporation.I have reached agreement with the Corporation on a strategy forthe major modernisation of British steel production over thenext 10 years.    It will be a  3,O0OM programme of modern!sationand expansion - &quot;by far the biggest carried out in the historyof the British steel industry.The object of the strategy is to create an efficient, profitable,modern industry able to compete with the rest of the world and able to assure future employment.&apos; It involves a major development of the 5 main heritage sites and the developmentof a major new steel complex.   The effects on the majorsteel-producing regions will be as follows:-wales major development to 6 million tonnes at Port Talbot inaddition to the cirrrent expansion, at Llanwern.    Steelmakingand hot-rolling at Shotton will continue until towards theend of the 1970&apos;s and finishing processes will continuethereafter..   Wales will have nearly 30percentof the total investment under the strategy - and investment.approaching 900M.    Steel production in. Wales will be increased to about10 million tonnes.scotland the heritage site at Ravenscraig is already&quot;being expanded.    It will be further expanded during the period and -the Corporation contemplate new electric arc steelmakingin Scotland of up to 1 million tonnes.,    Finishing processeswill continue at most of the present Scottish works, includingGlengarnock.    By the end of the strategy steel, production in
The Norbh. Ey, s there will he a substantial increase in output from theheritage site at Lackenby and the development of a major new&apos;steel complex on the South Bank of the Tees *   Thiscomplex will be developed in two phases each of about-2- million tonnes capacity.    The new works will be adjacent to the existing Lackenby works and their combined capacitywould ultimately exceed 12M tonnes.Toxvfcshi r e /Humb e r s id eThere will be a substantial increase in output   from theAnchor development on the heritage site at Scimthorpe.In the Sheffield/Kotherham area capacity for stainless and allsteelmaking and rolling will be modernised and expanded.The five heritage plants and the new Teesside -works areexpected eventually to provide the whole of the Corporation&apos;sbulk steelmaking apart from certain electric arc furnaces. Forsome years steelmaking will also continue at other centres.  .The existing finishing plants at a number of these centreswill continue for the foreseeable future.It is vital that there should be flexibility to adjust plans to changing circumstances and we have agreed with the BSCguidelines under which we will be able to review the timing of the major projects.    Decisions as to timing will ofcourse be affected by the pattern of competition, demand and prices and by the changing efficiencies of particular plants.This strategy should enable employment in the industry tobe maintained at a higher level and with far greater securitythan vrould otherwise have been possible.    It will however.in a number of areas mean soggcft^PS of jobs over the decade.
line  lL,V..-v-:; ^uTu^CTSWmSWWM J,J,,J1,,&quot;together and with the TradSEOREUns concerned so as to minimise the social consequences and to make positive plans for introducing new industry and job opportunities where theyare most needed.    The investment programme will sustainand create a large number of jobs - possibly as many as 75,000.    These will be principally   in heavy electricalmechanical and civil engineering.   The programme will giveBritish plant manufacturers a domestic market which willbe a good base for export opportimiti.es.British industry requires steel of high quality at competitiveprices to ensure its own contribution to growth at home., to benefit from the Common Market opportunities and to participate in expanding world trade.   A modernised British, steel industry will make a vital contribution to this.    This strategy willgive management and men, with their great tradition andskills, the opportunity to win for the industry its shareof the expanding steel market and to assure Britain&apos;s continuingplace among the major steel producers of Europe and theworld.
