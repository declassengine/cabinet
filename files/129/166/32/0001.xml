Public Money in the Private SectorGovernment Observations on the Sixth Reportof the Expenditure CommitteeHouse of Commons Paper 347, Session 1971-72IntroductionThe Government welcome the Sixth Report of the expenditure committee, entitled Public Money in the Private Sector. The Report sets out the main considerations involved in providing financial aid to the private sector of industry and draws attention to some of the lessons to be learntfrom the past, and thus is a useful contribution to informed discussion on the subject. It provides a picture of recent examples of government intervention and also a summary of the evidence submitted on it fromwitnesses who, from widely differing positions, have experience of the difficult problems involved. The Government value this conspectus andwill bear in mind the Committee&apos;s views when considering future casesof financial aid. Their detailed observations on the Committee&apos;s conclusions in Chapter 11 of the Report are set out below.Principles and criteriaThe Government note what the Committee say in Chapter 2 (paragraphs17 to 44) about the principles and criteria behind Government decisions to give selective financial aid to the private sector. They accept the needfor clarity of purpose in giving financial assistance, and in particular theconclusion in paragraph 262 that rigorous analysis of the case for supporting, or continuing to support, a particular firm or industry is always desirable. They do however recognise that, although profitabilityand efficiency form an important part of Government objectives in providingfinancial assistance to industry, the purpose of Government^ financialparticipation often includes broader policy objectives of benefit to theUnited Kingdom. As witnesses from industry and commerce pointedout and the Committee have recognised, the Government may need to take account of the objectives of creating and sustaining employment, ensuring the continuing operation of a company or industry considered to be of vital national importance, and promoting the development of an advanced technology industry.Particular industries in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 the Committee discuss certain aspects ofGovernment aid to private industries, including the civil aerospace industryand the shipbuilding industry. The Government will draw on this analysiswhen applying the general lessons to which the Committee draw attention in Chapter 11.However, the Government would like to comment on Chapter 4 since they cannot accept the conclusion that the basic criteria for government assistance to the shipbuilding industry have not been thoroughly thought
out. The fact is rather that the criteria have inevitably been changed fromtime to time to meet changing circumstances. The rise in the general level of unemployment during 1971, the increasing difficulties which theindustry as a whole was facing, the existence of subsidies to foreignshipbuilding companies, and the collapse of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders inJune 1971 an event which shook confidence in the industry and could have led to the collapse of other firms all contributed to a situation inwhich new Government assistance was necessary. The measures which were taken were needed to deal with the short term situation, but were introduced in the context of a continuing Government policy of encouraging the development of a commercially viable shipbuilding industry in the United Kingdom as well as improving employment opportunities in the assisted areas. As was foreshadowed in. theWhite Paper on Industrial and Regional Development published inMarch 1972 (Cmnd. 4942), a major new long term appraisal of the shipbuilding industry is now being undertaken by the Industrial DevelopmentExecutive with the aid of consultants. The Government will decide on their future policy in the light of the results of that review.Lessons learntIn paragraph 264 the Committee set out four lessons that emerge fromChapters 3, 4 and 5. The Government^ views on each of them are asfollows:Lesson 1. Before a Government gives selective assistance on a large scaleit must satisfy itself, first, that the company has the financial, technical andmanagerial resources to complete the contract, even allowing an adequatemargin for unforeseen contingencies; and secondly, that the company&apos;saccounting systems are such that all necessary information can be regularlyand rapidly made available to management and Government and subject as required to Government audit. Once it has decided to give selective assistancefrom public funds to a firm or project, the Government should be prepared toexercise a say in the affairs of the firm proportionate to its financial stake.Government representation on the board, although it may have its value, isnot sufficient.The Government agree with the Committee that the main problemsarise in cases where selective assistance on a large scale in relation to a firm or a project is in question: experience, for example that of administering the Local Employment Acts, has shown that for other types of case the arrangements for assessing and monitoring have in generalproved satisfactory.The Government also agree broadly with the Committee&apos;s propositionsthat the Government should be prepared to exercise a say in the affairs ofa firm proportionate to the Governmenfs financial stake.As regards assessment and monitoring the formation within the IndustrialDevelopment Executive of the Industrial Development Unit, some of whosestaff are being drawn from the City and Industry and will have particularfinancial and commercial skills, is designed to strengthen the Departmentscapability. This is being done with Part II of the Industry Act particularlyin mind but the skills of the 123 will be available to the Department asa whole.
This development reinforces the Governmenfs long-standing acceptanceof the need to assess as far and as carefully as possible the financial, .technical and managerial resources of a company seeking selective assistance on a large scale and to ensure as soon as possible that the company&apos;sestimating, accounting and information systems are adequate (or are madeadequate).Complex problems may however remain, as the following examplesshow:(a) if the Government decides on emergency action to avert the threat of theearly liquidation, a full prior assessment may be impracticable and deficiencies in the company&apos;s accounting systems may have to be accepted for the timebeing;(b) the ability of a company to continue in business depends not only on financial accounts of its past or present situation but on its forecasts. Agood system of financial control, agreed if necessary by the Government, should help significantly to ensure the validity of these forecasts; but an element ofjudgement and often of conjecture is involved and the Government is boundto rely to a substantial extent on the judgement of the board of the company.Moreover, the Government should not get itself into the position of taking over from the board responsibility for the running of the company. TheGovernment therefore has to hold a balance between these considerations andthe action that is reasonably practicable to safeguard Exchequer funds.The Government agree with the Committee, that although Governmentrepresentation on the board is not of itself sufficient, it may have its value.Indeed in some cases the involvement may be such that the Governmentwill be concerned with the composition of the board as a whole; and whereserious difficulties arise a change in the management of the company maybe called for, though even such a change may not relieve the Governmentof the need to choose between giving the firm further financial assistancein a situation that is not altogether satisfactory and allowing it to go into liquidation.A director appointed by the Government can provide a valuableadditional link between the Government and the company. The chairmanof the company should however always remain the principal channel ofcommunication on major matters. The Government therefore have proposed to continue to ensure that any special duties of a Governmentdirector in a particular case are carefully defined with a view to avoiding any misunderstanding or conflict of interest.Lesson 2.   Too often over-optimistic commercial assessments have been usedto justify decisions made largely on other grounds.In the event some of the previous commercial assessments have proved to be optimistic; and commercial assumptions may often involve a largeelement of judgement. It is also possible to take too pessimistic an assessment. Nevertheless, the Government accept that such assessmentsshould be as realistic as possible and that the grounds on which decisions are taken should be clearly distinguished and identified.Lesson 3. It may or may not be wise to take on a commitment whose originalcost-estimation is of its nature highly speculative as for instance that of concorde. Nevertheless, it is wrong to treat the estimates for this type ofproject, either for decision-making purposes or for public presentation as ifthey bore the same degree of reliability even as those for a motorway or
hospital. It should be absolutely clear how far a project involves unexploredtechnical problems, or. for example, depends on uncertain marketing factors.The Government accept this recommendation.Lesson 4. The principle that launching-aid for aerospace projects must bea fixed sum and that overrun must be carried by the company is no longerappropriate to the larger and more advanced projects. First, it is reasonablethat the Government should carry its share of cost increases due to inflation.Secondly, although it may be more difficult to devise a satisfactory formula to cover increases arising from such factors as unforeseen technical problems,it should be possible to find a solution that lies between the rigid applicationof the no-overrun principle and the acceptance of a completely open-endedcommitment. In any event regular reviews between the Government and private partners must be undertaken and the project proceeded with only by mutual agreement.As regards inflation, the Government accept that, where their contribution to and recoveries from a project have been calculated on anestimate made on a constant-price basis, both should be adjusted to take account of changes in the general cost level facing the industry.As a general rule the Government consider that the firm must carry the primary responsibility for the technical and commercial success of a project,and should accordingly bear the cost of any unforeseen technical difficulties.For this reason it is important for the Government to ensure before givinglaunching-aid that the firm has the financial strength to carry these risks.The Government accept, however, that this general policy will not always be appropriate, particularly where the project is very large or technologicallyadvanced. Exceptionally, therefore, it will be willing to consider sharingtechnical risks in such cases. The exact provisions will need to be related to the circumstances of each case to ensure that the spur to efficiency forthe firm is weakened no more than necessary.Regular review of the project by the Government and the firm is something to which the Government has in the past attached and willcontinue to attach importance. Such reviews do not of themselves stopthings going wrong, nor are the partners likely always to agree at a review on how good or bad the prospects of the project are at that time. It isimportant therefore that the circumstances under which a project might be stopped or one partner be permitted to withdraw should be defined ascarefully as possible from the outset of the agreement.Social and regional factorsThe Government note the Committee&apos;s view in paragraphs 170-172and 265 that there should be thorough investigation and continuing analysis of the factors behind the locational decisions of industry and of the effectiveness of regional industrial policy. The Government share the viewthat decisions on policies involving the expenditure of large sums of public money should be taken in the light of the best available information. Ithas to be recognised however that there are many practical and theoreticaldifficulties both in investigating the factors influencing locational decisions and in assessing the effects of policy in this field. For example, decisions on industrial location are influenced by a great many factors together; therelative weight given to any particular factor by an individual company is
subject to change-over time, and varying packages of incentives have been operating in economic conditions which themselves have varied bothcyclically and secularly. Nevertheless the Government agree with theCommittee that analysis and research have a useful role to play.Agencies for channelling public money into the private sectorAs the Committee recognise, the Government have now decided to setup the Industrial Development Executive (IDE) within the Department ofTrade and Industry and the immediate task is to make this instrument as effective as possible. They believe that there are real advantages in givingthese functions to a body which reports direct to Ministers and is directlyaccountable to Parliament, and which is in a better position to co-ordinateits activities with other related Government activities. They will of coursecontinue to study, in the longer term, the possibility of alternative models,but they believe that the requirement now is for stability in organisation as well as in systems of assistance.Departmental responsibilitiesThe Committee refer in paragraph 268 to the special obligations ofthe Treasury in the control of public expenditure, and in paragraph 269they suggest that questions concerning the framework for interdepartmentalconsultation on selective assistance in the private sector, and the Treasury&apos;srole in the consultative process, should be reviewed. Certainly theGovernment accept the Committee&apos;s view that this is an important field for the exercise of the Treasury&apos;s responsibilities. These arise from theTreasury&apos;s concern not only with the allocation of resources to the variouspublic expenditure programmes and major individual projects, but also with the management of the economy and in consequence with various aspects of industrial policy. The use of public funds as an instrument ofpolicy in this field has to be viewed in relation to the use of other instruments such as fiscal and credit policy.However, these responsibilities, as the Committee recognise, aredischarged through the processes in operation for the interdepartmentalconduct of business. Whatever view is taken of the particular casehistories which the Committee has examined, the Government could hardlyaccept that they establish a special case for departing in this particularfield from the principles of collective governmental responsibility.The degree to which the Treasury becomes involved in particularprojects or cases, as distinct from general policies or programmes, will ofcourse depend on their size and importance, the extent to which they lendthemselves to the formal delegation of financial authority, and on whetherthey give rise to any special problems of financing or of propriety in theuse of public funds. It is also obvious that some of these cases arepolitically sensitive and thus engage the interest of the Departmentsconcerned with economic and industrial affairs, including the Treasury,at Ministerial as well as official level.
Commercial confidentialityThe Government note the Committee&apos;s view in paragraph 273 thatthere may be a case for expecting companies in receipt of government assistance to accept some loss of confidentiality in the interests ofParliamentary scrutiny. The Government will give careful considerationto this view.The Government in this context has carefully considered theCommittee&apos;s view on the desirability of disclosing the element of R &amp; Drecovery in the Concorde selling price. They are not however persuadedby the Committee&apos;s arguments and believe that, for the reasons given inevidence, the public interest in this case is best served by not releasingthe information.The Government note the Committee&apos;s view in paragraph 277 thatthe Government should publish annually White Papers on Concorde andon each major example of selective assistance to industry. Section 16 ofthe Industry Act 1972 provides that an Annual Report be laid beforeParliament and they share the Committee&apos;s view that Parliament should bekept as fully informed as possible. They are considering what would bethe most suitable arrangements having regard to the need to protectinformation of a commercially confidential nature, disclosure of whichcould impair the chances of a company&apos;s viability or make it difficult toobtain the best financial return on a project.The Government accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation inparagraph 81 that future public expenditure forecasts of Concorde shoulddistinguish estimates of development expenditure from those of productionloans.conclusion the Government welcome the final comment made by the Committeein paragraph 280 of their Report and they entirely agree that there shouldbe the maximum informed discussion about the complexities associatedwith investment of public funds in the private sector.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office3136824  Dd. 250809  K24   12/72
