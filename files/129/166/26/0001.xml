confidential^EUROPEAN NEGOTIATIONS ON LORRY WEIGHTS:Memorandum by the Minister for Transport Industries.1.      Lorries are at present restricted in this country to32 tons overall xreight, 10 tons per axle and If? metres in length.    The Council of Ministers now has before it aproposal that as from 1st January I960 the limits shouldbe ij.0 tonnes overall, 11 tonnes per axle ana metresin length.2.     The acceding countries opposed the weight limits ata meeting of the Council on 6th November.    They did so on grounds of cost,  intrusion upon the environment and risingpublic concern.    It was argued in addition that publicopinion in the acceding countries would be greatly affrontedby a decision so soon before they became full members inrespect of a policy which would not become fully effectiveuntil 1980.3.     On the following day the Six met.    The Dutch, withsome support from the Germans and Italians, were able to avert a decision, but it was agreed to meet again onDecember l8th and 19th as a result of strong pressure from the French to enforce the orientation.li.     The Dutch Minister who has given very staunch supportthroughout,  then suggested that we should exert all the pressure we could through embassies.    Information securedsince which was largely confirmed to me by a number of individual Ministers at last week&apos;s meeting of the EuropeanMinisters of Transport in Paris,  suggests that as thingsnow stand there will be no decision before the end of theyear.5-     Before the November consultations the ministerial committee on Europe  $SUM(72) 7th Meeting. Item 1) empoweredme to accept a compromise of either liO tonnes and 10 tonnesor 38 tonnes and 10^- tonnes.    In the event, nothing of thekind was on offer.6.     The Government&apos;s acceptance of the recent motion inthe House makes it in my view undesirable and even dangerous to open up any discussion this year,  though we should beprepared to give a general assurance that we would not dragour feet and work towards a decision during 1973.7-     The outstanding matter is the attitude we should adopt when the matter comes up again in the New Year.    Ihave argued throughout that axle weight which does thereal damage is the prime consideration.    10-g- tonnes,(equivalent to 10 tons 6 cwt) would be, in the lightof all advice given to me, as far as we should go.1.
(CONFIDENTIAL)8.     On overall weights assuming that we have concededthe above we should not go beyona a maximum of 38 tonnes.I would be the more willing to go as far as that if itwere possible to cut down on length but this will be a source of difficulty bound up as it is with the dimensionsof containers.9.      I am sure however that we should not be in a hurry-to move next year.    The other two acceding countries whohave given us good support have firm views particularly on axle weights.    The Dutch ana others of the Six maywell want to review their positions.    Moreover, the argument has not gone unnoticed by the public eitherhere or on the Continent.    It may well be that in theNew Year more reasonable attitudes will prevail.JPDepartment of the environment  Marsham StreetSW111 December 19722.
