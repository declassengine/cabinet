HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 131 COPY NO27 November 1972CABINET6$PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS ON THE ACTIVITIESOF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THEEUROPEAN COMMUNITIESMemorandum by the Lord Freeident of the council. The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure havebeen considering the attached paper, prepared by an interdepartmentalworking group of officials, which makes proposals for the handling ofParliamentary Questions on Community matters after we join theEuropean Communities on 1 January 1973.2. The main recommendations of the working group are that -li       Broadly speaking, Ministers should answer Questions inParliament on decisions taken, or under consideration, by theCouncil of Ministers and all its subordinate bodies and, inparticular the line taken in the Council and its subordinateCommittees by United Kingdom Ministers and officials(paragraph 3(a) of the paper).ii.       Ministers should also be prepared to reply to Questionswhich merely seek information on the activities of Communityinstitutions, such as the European Court of Justice, for whichthere is no direct Ministerial responsibility (paragraph 3(b)).iii. Ministers should also be prepared to answer questions on the line taken by their officials in the Management and regulation Committees on which Member Governments areofficially represented (paragraph 3(c)).iv. Questions should be answered by the Minister withpolicy responsibility for the particular subject raised in theQuestion;    and Questions of a general nature should be answered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary or, as now happens in practice in appropriate cases, by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, without being formallytransferred (paragraph 4).1
3. The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedureconcluded that the best course would be to proceed for the presentbroadly in accordance with the general guidelines suggested in theattached paper;  but not to consider making any guidelines knownpublicly (although the guidelines would be observed by Departments)until experience had been obtained of the handling of these Questions.The Committee considered that it was not practicable to say at thisstage that answers should be refused to certain categories of questions, since much would depend both on the substance of aparticular Question and on the terms in which it was expressed.It is probable that in practice a Minister will best be able to indicatehis position with regard to the subject matter of the Questions by a carefully framed Answer rather than by an outright refusal to answer.As experience is gained of handling such Questions it should be possibleto reach a clearer view about the treatment of Questions on the actions of the Council of Ministers which have been taken against the viewsuf United Kingdom Ministers, and about giving information in answer to Questions relating to matters not strictly within the area of ministerial responsibility.4. If the proposed ad hoc Select Committee is set up it is likely that it will consider the handling of Questions on Community matters.5. I invite my colleagues to endorse the conclusions of the ministerial committee on Parliamentary Procedure.J privy Council Office26 November 19722
J V-&apos; i&apos;4 i   H ^PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS ON THE ACTIVITIES OP THE INSTITUTIONS OP THEEUROPEAN COMMUNITIESThe Chief Whip in the House of Commons wrote to the Opposition Chief Whipon 18 October reiterating the government&apos;s invitation to the Opposition toagree to the setting up of an ad hoc Select Committee to consider inter aliathe procedures for Parliamentary scrutiny of proposals for Communitysecondary legislation and to make recommendations.      If this Committee isset up, these terms of reference would enable it to consider ways, includingthe use of Parliamentary Questions, in which Parliament could obtain information on the activities of the Institutions of the European Communities.In the meantime, however, Ministers will need to form a preliminary view on how such Parliamentary Questions should be handled;     and they may wish toconsider whether it is desirable that these views should be made known eitherto the Table Office who will no doubt take them into account in deciding whatQuestions the Speaker should accept and what questions he should not accept(as is done for example in the case of Parliamentary Questions on the nationalised industries) or by means of a Ministerial Statement or arrangedParliamentary Question.      These views would, however, be subject to modification in the light of whatever discussion takes place in the ad hocSelect Committee, if it is set up.     (For the position of the House of Lordssee paragraph 5 below.)2.     The present rule is that Questions are admissible only in respect of those matters which are within the Governments responsibility or which could be made so by administrative or legislative action.     On the other hand the institutional structure of the European Communities and the Government&apos;srelationship with the Communities is unique and poses particular problems; and,in the context of the Parliamentary debates on the proposal that there shouldbe an ad hoc Select Committee, the Government has intimated its desire to keepParliament fully informed on a wide range of Community activities not all ofwhich fall within  Ministerial responsibility and not all of which are published3.     The range of cases likely to arise is as follows -a.   Proceedings of the Council of ministers and its subordinate, bodies.i.   All the actions of the Council of Ministers, of which the BritishGovernment provides a member and, a fortiori, the attitude taken byBritish Ministers within the framework of the Council of Ministers,would seem to fall clearly within the realm of Ministerial
responsibility; and it would accordingly seem appropriate that ministers should be answerable to Parliament for all Regulations,Directives and Decisions adopted by the Council of Ministers and allCommunity Treaties, concluded with-    the Council1s authority, and forthe part which British Ministers played or instructed their officials to play in the discussions leading up to the adoption of these acts.ii. The situation is the same in respect of the matters before theCouncil of Ministers and its subordinate bodies (ie the Committee ofPermanent Representatives and Committees and working groups operating under its aegis);    and it is indeed the procedure for the scrutiny ofthe proposals of the Commission to the Council (which constitute themajority of such matters) which constitutes one of the suggested terms sof reference of the proposed ad   hoc Select Committee.     From thepolicy point of view, it will from time to time be undesirable that ouilnegotiating position at these preliminary stages should be the subject Iof Parliamentary debate, including probing by Parliamentary questions and in these cases Ministers would no doubt wish to bear this in mindwhen answering.     On the other hand Parliament could rightly claim that it was being deprived of influence on the attitude to be taken up by the British Minister sitting in the Council of Ministers if theracould be no Parliamentary discussion of the issues involved until theCouncil of Ministers had adopted secondary legislation which would therlbe binding:    and it would not be appropriate to withhold relevant information from Parliament.     One way by which Parliament could obtairjsuch information would be through Parliamentary Questions.iii. It goes without saying that Ministers can have no responsibility!for the attitudes /taken in the Council of Ministers and itssubordinate bodies by the Governments of the other Member Statestowards proposals of the Commission to the Council;   and Questionsdirected towards^ s^ abolishing tl1fe.se attitudes should not be admissible.Ib.   Activities of the other Institutions of the Communitiesi.   Ministers manifestly cannot have responsibility for judgments ofthe European Court of Justice, Resolutions of the European Parliament,Opinions of the Economic and   Social Committee (or the equivalent ECSC committee I), proposals of the European Commission or those Regulations, IDirectives and Decisions or other comparable acts which the european commission is empowered by the Treaties or secondary legislation to enact or carry out without benefit of the advice or approval of Member IGovernments.     On the other hand, it is clearly desirable thatI CONHDENTiAQ
Parliament should have access to the contents of these.   Many butnot all of them are published - in many cases not particularlypromptly.     But some, notably those proposals of the european commission which are not sent by the Council of Ministers to theEuropean Parliament for an opinion, are; not published by the communities.     There is no reason from the Community point of viewwhy this information should not be made available to the british parliament.   One solution would be for all such material,voluminous thought it may be, to be automatically put in the library of each House of Parliament.     But Parliamentary Questionsasking for information on such activities would be admissible,though there will be a very small range of confidential documentsabout which Ministers could not give information.     SinceMinisters do not have any responsibility for these activities, itwould be reasonable for them to decline to be pressed intoexplaining and defending the activities in question of theseCommunity Institutions.ii.   Ministers could well decline to answer questions on theformative stages of the acts of Community Institutions listed ini above.     It is inherent in the Community Treaties that these institutions deliberate independently of Member Governments.   ButMinisters might well wish to answer questions on the policy issues involved, particularly if their officials had been consulted byCommission officials.c.   Action taken in accordance with the Management or Regulation CommitteeThere is an area where limited Ministerial responsibility exists; and,Commission enacts a very large volume of secondary legislation on thebasis of decisions taken within the framework of &quot;Management Committees&quot;in respect of agriculture and (to a less extent) &quot;Regulation Committees&quot;mainly in respect of non-agricultural subjects.     Member Governments areofficially represented on these committees, which were constituted by regulations issued by the Council of Ministers;   and there is thusMinisterial responsibility at least in respect of the attitudes adoptedby the British officials who serve on these committees.     these committees operate by qualified majority voting on the basis of proposals by the Commission and, if the Commission^ proposals obtainthe required mimhpr n-F --ynt0Fit-   the Cnmmisaion is then Empowered toprocedureas the vast bulk of Community secondary legislation (in quantitativeterms) arises from it, it needs very; careful consideration.     The
issue Regulations or other secondary legislation.     There is, however,provision (which is very rarely brought into operation) whereby asufficient number of votes in a Management or Regulation Committee canresult in the matter being brought to the Council of Ministers forconsideration (in which case the situation in paragraph 3.a. above appliesVery many of the Regulations and other secondary legislation actsadopted under the Management Committee or equivalent procedure are of short duration and are concerned with the implementation of agreedagricultural and other policies.     But in view of the volume of thissecondary legislation, the participation of British government representatives in the decision-taking process and the ultimate responsibility of the Council of Ministers^there is a strong case for ministers to answer Parliamentary Questions on the activities of UKofficials in these Management and Regulation^ Committees.4.    Apportionment of Ministerial ResponsibilityA case could be made for all Questions on matters relating to the activitiesof the Institutions of the European Communities to be addressed to the Secretaryof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs because he is the Minister-generally responsible for UK representation at the Council of Ministers.     Butit is Government policy that all Departments should &quot;think European&quot; and thatour relations:  with the European Communities should be treated as anextension of our domestic affairs rather than as a separate external activity.In these circumstances it would seem appropriate that where parliamentary questions on the activities of the Institutions of the European Communitiesconcerned one specific subject, these should, as at present, be addressed tothe Minister primarily concerned with the subject matter of the Question.Questions of a more general nat ure should, however, continue to be addressedto the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs but, inaccordance with current practice, these could in appropriate cases be answeredby the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster without being formally transferred.5*    The House of LordsThere are no fixed rules governing the framing of Questions in the House of Lordsnor is there any Lord or officer in whom authority is vested to refuse questions on the grounds of irregularity.     The decision whether or not a. Question &quot;is inorder&quot; is in the last resort one for the House itself;   and the House allowsconsiderably more latitude than does the House of Commons.   If, therefore,Questions are tabled in the House of Lords which would not be admissible in theHouse of Commons, Ministers will no doubt wish, vihere appropriate, to decline&quot;to reply and to explain their reasons on the lines set out in the appropriate
recommendations.     Ministers are invited to agree-subject to whatever may emerge fromthe work of the proposed ad hoc Select Committee -a. with the conclusions set out in paragraphs 3-5 above;b. that suitable guidance should be given to Parliament on the intentions of Ministers on these matters and that this should&quot;bedone as soon as possible and in any case before the date of our accession to the Communities.27 November 1972 i ii 4 f
