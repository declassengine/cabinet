HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 134 COPY NO      g g28 November 1972CABINETHOUSING (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS) (SCOTLAND) ACT 1972:DEFAULT BY LOCAL authorities memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland, Twenty local authors.ties in Scotland are still refusing to implement the Act.    Local enquiries were held last week in relation to four of these(Glasgow Corporation, Lanark County Council. Falkirk and KirkcaldyTown Councils).    The report of the Glasgow enquiry has already beenreceived and ffnds the local authority in default;  the remaining threereports are expected very soon,2, I should like to make a default order in relation to Glasgow thisweek- and tc make similar orders as soon as possible for Lanarkshire,Falkirk and Kirkcaldy, if in the light of the reports I find them in default.3, The orders will require the authorities to remedy their defaultwithin specified periods which make reasonable allowance for theprocedure involved, and to make further rent increases by 1 October 1973,so that they come into line from that date with authorities who complied by1 October 1972.4. I will consult colleagues later about the steps to be taken if theauthorities concerned fail to comply with the default orders.5, Subject to the views of the other Ministers most closely concerned,whom I am consulting, I am appointing Reporters this week for four further enquiries (relating to Midlothian County Council, Clydebank, Dunfermlineand Kilmarnock Town Councils), to open in the week beginning27 December.6, The announcement of these further enquiries will set the scene forthe four default orders which I expect shortly to make, and will indicatemy intention to continue to make progress with all reasonable speed inaccordance with the prescribed procedures in Scotland.1
7. I have received from the auditor a report to the effect that expenditure by Glasgow Corporation on a tendentious publicity leaflet andposter was incurred illegally.    In accordance with normal practice theCorporation has been given the opportunity to comment on the report before I consider it.    No auditors&apos; reports have yet been received onfailure to comply with the Act.8. On 15 November I reported that certain residual subsidy payments were being deferred in the case of authorities which had resolved not to implement the Act.    These payments have now been made to twoauthorities which have reversed their earlier decisions (Rutherglen andLochgelly Town Councils).9. If my colleagues agree, I propose to issue default orders to glasgow corporation this week and (if, in my judgment, default is established) toLanark County Council, Falkirk and Kickcaldy Town Councils as soon aspossible.G scottish Office28 November 19722
