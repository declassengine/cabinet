I HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 140 COPY NO       U &quot;05 December 1972CABINETEUROPEAN COMMUNITIES:  PARLIAMENTARY scrutiny of DRAFT INSTRUMENTSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. At its meeting on 13 July (CM(72) 36th Conclusions, Minute 6) theCabinet approved CP(72) 76 which referred to the proposals made by theGovernment during the Second Reading of the European Communities bill that there should be an ad hoc Select Committee of both Houses to considerthe most suitable method of ensuring adequate Parliamentary scrutiny of draft instruments of tie European Communities.    The Cabinet decidedthat Ministers should seek to steer the ad hoc Select Committee towards a recommendation in favour of a Standing Committee to debate draftCommunity Instruments after a preliminary appraisal by a &quot;sifting&quot;Select Committee.    The Chief Whip accordingly wrote to the OppositionChief Whip and reiterated the suggestion that this ad hoc SelectCommittee should be appointed.    He proposed that its terms of reference should be &quot;to consider the procedures, upon entry to the european communities, ..0.0. for Parliamentary scrutiny of proposals for community secondary legislation and make recommendations&quot;.2. The Parliamentary Labour Party are likely to decide on13 December whether to agree to the setting up of this proposed ad hocSelect Committee.    It seems likely that, as regards the scrutiny of proposals for Community secondary legislation, they may well agree to doso; but we shall need to decide whether the Government shouldunilaterally propose a Standing Committee and a &quot;sifting&quot; Committee ifthey do not agree, and whether to propose this as an interim arrangementif they do agree3.        I believe that it is in the interests of the Governments relationswith Parliament that we should, as a matter of principle, keep parliament as fully informed as possible on the development of proposals for community legislation before decisions are taken by the Council ofMinisters,    Unless and until such arrangements are made we shall be exposed to continual criticism that decisions are being taken on which parliament has had no opportunity to express a view.    The Chancellor  .of the Duchy of Lancastei and I have already arranged that those ministers
who attend meetings of the Council of Ministers should as a general rulereport to Parliament on major business which has taken place at thosemeetings,.    At its meeting on 30 November (CM(72) 54th Conclusions,Minute 5) the Cabinet decided the line which Ministers should take inanswering Parliamentary Questions on the activities of the Institutions ofthe European Communities,,    But these arrangements do not by themselvesmake adequate provision for Parliamentary scrutiny of draft CommunityInstruments.4, I accordingly recommend to my colleagues that, in any event as atemporary measure and possibly as the longer-term solution, theGovernment should on 14 December or as soon as practicable thereafterannounce that it will propose to Parliament the setting up of a &quot;sifting&quot;Select Committee to make a quick perusal of the relevant draftCommunity instruments and pick out those requiring the attention ofParliament, and a Standing Committee which could debate such draftCommunity Instruments.    The &quot;sifting&quot; Committee is needed because the overwhelming majority of Community Instruments are of a short termnature and merely implement policies previously decided.    Only acomparatively small number of draft Community Instruments will meritParliamentary scrutiny; but these will in many cases be draft instruments of considerable importance,5. Since the &quot;sifting&quot; Committee would be a Select Committee, thereis no reason why it should not be a Joint Committee of both Houses.Although there is no precedent for a Joint Standing Committees the cabinet agreed that the possibility of establishing such a Joint Committee shouldbe explored.    The Lord Chancellor and die Lord Privy Seal have bothrepresented to me that it would be most welcome to the House of Lordsif the Standing Committee could be constituted as a Joint Committee ofboth Houses.    I shall accordingly, jointly with the Chief Whip, explorewhether a Joint Standing Committee for this purpose would be acceptable to the House of Commons.    If not, separate arrangements for each house would have to be made.conclusion. I invite my colleagues to agree that we should on 14 December or assoon as practicable thereafter propose to Parliament that there should beset upa. a Joint &quot;sifting&quot; Select Committee and b. a Joint Standing Committee if our soundings indicate that thisJoint Standing Committee would be acceptable to the House ofCommons;  otherwise a Standing Committee in the House ofCommons and appropriate arrangements in the House of Lords.Privy Council office December 1972J P
