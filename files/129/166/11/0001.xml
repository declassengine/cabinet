DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(?2) 136 COPY NO      &amp; y   -28 November 1972CABINETWHITE PAPER ON EDUCATIONAL POLICY IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. On 3 October the Home and Social Affairs Committee considered and endorsed, subject to consideration of the expenditure implications, the strategy for the development of the education services in Scotland set outin my 1972 Programme Analysis and Review (PAR) Report on higher education and Schools Expenditure.    The Committee agreed that mystrategy should be announced in a separate White Paper and I am circulatingwith this memorandum a draft White Paper for consideration.2. For the reasons set out in paragraph 3 of CP(72) 133 I am puttingthis draft Paper direct to Cabinet,    It has not been considered by Homeand Social Affairs Committee.3. The main features of the strategy announced in the Paper for the decade to 1982 are:a0 The restriction of the expansion of higher education tomaintain only the present level of opportunity for qualified school-leavers in Scotland (now substantially below the full opportunity-rate envisaged in the Robbins Report).b. A programme of expansion for nursery education which willenable nearly 40 per cent of pre-school children to receive some form of education by 1976-77 and which will continue thereafteruntil expected public demand is met;  the programme to be steeredin its initial stages towards areas of urban deprivation.c. The maintenance of a school building programme at broadlyits present level throughout the decade with increasing emphasis on replacement and renovation of older schools from 1975-76onwards;  and the expansion of the building programme for special schools to 1976-77.d. An increase in the allocation of resources for books and educational equipment.1
e. The improvement of the pupil teacher ratio in prima: yschools to 24:1 and its stabilisation thereafter with the restrictionsof intake to training this will entail.    The improvement of pupilteacher ratio in secondary schools to a level of 15:1 - probably by1977-78 &quot; and its stabilisation thereafter,f. The diversion of resources to the development of a force of teaching auxiliaries to relieve teachers in primary and secondary schools of non-professional duties.The expenditure implications of this programme have been accepted by treasury Ministers up to 1976-77.    Thereafter the programme has been framed and expressed in terms which allow flexibility in its implementationas resources permit.    If the programme were implemented in full therate of growth on education services in Scotland would, over the decade, beless than 3 per cent per annum.4, The proposals made in this Paper for Scotland differ in some respects from those made in CP(72) 133 for England and r/ales.    Therehas, however, been close consultation and the differences are no greaterthan can be justified by the different educational systems and conditions.5. The proposals in this White Paper will, I believe, be generally regarded in Scotland as getting the priorities right and I ask my colleagues to agree that it should now be printed for presentation to Parliament onWednesday 6 December 1972.G scottish Office28 November 19722

1,   INTRODUCTION1C    In the last quarter of a century the demands on the education services havebeen very great.   The influence - and the sanctions - of the family and oftraditional institutions like church and school have been challenged by powerful and persuasive new forces..   At the same time the physical environment in whichyoung people grov; up has been affected by technological change, the momer.tum ofwhich continues^   The accepted standards vrhich hitherto guided the aims of educationhave had to be questioned and re-appraised and the objectives of the educational system and the content, of its curricula have required searching study to discoverhow schools, colleges and universities might besi equip young people for adultlife in tho changed structure of society and for work in the modern economy.2,   In this difficult environment there has been a steady advance in educationalstandards.   This has been achieved partly by the diversion of a larger share ofnational resources to the education service.   In the schools the supply of bothprimary and s?ccndary teachers has increased,class sizes have been reduced,unqualified teachers have been eliminated, in-service training has been developed,and the minimum leaving age has been raised to 1*3.   The opportunities for young people to participate in post school education in all its variety have been greatlyexpanded, and there has been an unprecedented growth over the past 25 years in thenumber and diversity of Scottish institutions and in the numbers of students takingcourses in them.3.    Additional resources by themselves are not enough;   and in the schoolsparticularly advance in educational standards has also owed much to a thoroughrevision of the content of primary and secondary education both in its broadeducational intent and in the academic content of the subjects that are taught.
it-   For long, Scottish schools have properly been conscious of the opportunitiesthey have provided for the academically able.   The advances of the past 25 years have done much to extend to all young people similar opportunities to developfruitful and fulfilled lives.   The standards which have always guided theattitudes and the &quot;work of Scottish teachers and educationists in their care p.i&amp;development of able children, are now being applied in bhe education of all young people.5.    The purpose of this White Paper Is to outline further improvements in thequality of the educational system in Scotland;   improvements for -which the changes of recent years provide a solid foundation, and to set out a strategy for the use to their best effect of the resources that are likely to be available for theeducation service in the 1970&apos;s.   It describes proposals for t^e improvement of teaching and teaching resources of all kinds in primary and secondary schools.It&apos;announces the Governments intention to extend the educational process down/ardsto encompass a corsiderable proportion of children of pre-school age, and itcontemplates the further expansion of higher education throughout the decade alonglines first drawn in the Robbins Report*.   The sectors of the education system forvhich policies are outlined in this Paper account for the major part of public expenditure on education in Scotland.   Other parts of the education system, of whichthe largest is non-advanced further education, are not discussed.   In these, eitherit is anticipated that development will continue in line with existing policies,or policy decisions cannot yet be taken;    (for instance, the Government arrait thereport of the Alexander Committee on Adult Education).6.    In presenting this programme, the Government is conscious that it providesonly a framework within which education authorities, teachers, colleges of education and all others - not least parents - concerned with the educational provision thatis made for children and young people, will have to contribute, whether as institution;or as individuals, to the translation of policy into effective action.&quot;Report of the Committee on Higher Education.   Cmnd. 2154-   HMSO 1963
2.   HIGHER EDUCATION7.    Higher education* in Scotland is provided in four distinct types of institution.The eight Scottish universities, like other universities in Great Britain, are financedthrough the University Grants Committee and are within the Ministerial responsibilityof the Secretary of State for Education and Science.^&apos;   The ten colleges of education and the ten central institutions are each administered by a Board of Governors but arefinanced directly by the Secretary of State.***   The colleges of education are mainly,though not exclusively, concerned with the training of graduates and school leaversfor teaching.   The central institutions are essentially teaching institutions and provide advanced courses, in many cases directly vocational in purpose, leading todegrees of the Council for National Academic Awards or to college diplomas.   Theyhave strong links with industry and with commerce.   Finally, there are certain colleges of further education run by education authorities, such as Napier College of science and Technology in Edinburgh and the Glasgow College of Technology, which providemainly advanced courses, some leading to degrees of the Council for National AcademicAwards.8,    The development of the higher education system in Scotland, as in England andWales, has been determined by acceptance of the &quot;Robbins&quot; principle that courses of higher education should be available for all those who qualified by ability andattainment to pursue them, and also by the steady increase in the numbers of qualifiedschool leavers.   In relation to the higher education system in Scotland (with theexception hitherto of the colleges of education) the term &quot;qualified leaver&quot; is takento mean a person who has obtained at school or in further education three or morepasses on the Higher grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education - regarded as equivalent to two or more passes at Advanced level in the General Certificate ofEducation.    (The minimum qualifications for entry to the*In this Paper the term &quot;higher education&quot; is used in the same sense as in the RobbinsReport (Higher Education: Crand 2154- 19&amp;3) to cover the work of universities and colleges of education, and also of central institutions and further education collegesas far as. the last two are concerned with advanced courses.**The Government&apos;s policies for the universities are contained in cmnd - 1972 presented by the Secretary of State for Education and Science, and published simultaneously with this White Paper,***There are also three colleges of agriculture financed by the Secretary of Statethrough the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, which provide someof the courses of higher education.
njincitial course of teacher training at &quot;colleges of education which is available toschool leavers are being raised to three passes on the Higher grade fron October197k; in practice this standard has already been achieved,)a    The number of qualified leavers in Scotland has grown strikingly from some 5,800in 1960-61 to about 15,300 in 1970-71 and a statistical projection of this trendsuggests that the number of qualified leavers might increase to over 27,000 by 1 $80-81.Sot all qualified leavers, however, become candidates for higher education;   a significant proportion chooses otherwise and goes straight into employment.   Thisnuaber is only partly balanced by entrants to higher education who have otherqualifications.   And in other respects too, the capacity of the higher education fiystemlanriot be exactly related to the numbers of qualified leavers from Scottish schools.All the institutions - and particularly the universities - have students who are not&quot;cots;   moreover, the universities provide places for older students engaged in post-graduate work and, similarly, a substantial proportion of the population in the colleges of education consist- of graduates taking teacher training,   The nature ofthe relationship between the number of qualified school leavers and the provision of places for higher education is therefore a complicated one, determined by a variety of factors.10.  Nevertheless, it is evident from the figures given above that a substantialexpansion of the Scottish higher education system will be required during the next decade.   In 1961-62 the full time student population in higher education was some29,700;   in 1971-72 it had risen to almost 61,500 (37,600 in universities, 14,850 incolleges of education, and 9-000 in institutions of advanced further education) *   Thegovernment&apos;3 aim is to make possible further expansion in higher education that willtake account of the prospective increase in the output of qualified school leaversand will meet the likely demand for higher education from qualified applicants.11.   Scottish universities, in addition to providing professional education (in law,medicine, veterinary.science etc.) and honours degrees in various subjects, have bytradition provided a broadly based higher education through the ordinary degree courseWi Arts,   The Scottish ordinary degree course represents a natural extension into
univeristy education of the Scottish secondary school curriculum.   Insofar as thereis a demand for general rather than specialised courses of higher education - and itaccordinglymay prove to be a growing demand - the Scottish universities are/well placed tocontribute to meeting it.   The Government will keep in mind this special characteristicof the Scottish universities and the distinctive place which they occupy in the Scottishhigher educa+do&quot; system.   In the light of the advice of the University Grants Committeethey are satisfied that the target of student numbers for Great Britain for the1972-77 quinquennium can be achieved without adding to the number of universities.The Committee however intend in due course to advise the Government whether, in itsview, an early decision in principle will need to be made to establish one or moreuniversities to be active sometime in the 1980&apos;s.12.   The non university institutions play a complementary role that is increasingly important, and it is estimated that to enable them to do so over the years until 158there should be by that date about 45,000 places in the institutions of higher education outside the universities.   The nature of this expansion is likely to showsome variation from the pattern over the past decade.   It seems likely that the teaching profession will in future require a smaller proportion than hitherto ofthe output of the higher education system and therefore no significant further expansion is required in the next decade in the colleges of education, the capacityof which more than doubled in the 10 years from 1961-1971.13.   On the other hand, there will be a continuing steady expansion of the central institutions, and a substantial growth in the number of places for students takingadvanced courses in the further education colleges provided by education authorities.An increasing number of these colleges will provide advanced courses, and a few maybe expected eventually to become wholly institutions of advanced further education.The Government does not foresee any change in the present arrangements for administerinand financing central institutions, but it recognises that the development of localauthori fcy colleges and their expansion in advanced further education will have to be carefully co-ordinated with provision of courses in central institutions to ensure thatthere is no unnecessary duplication of provision, .
1L.,   It is tlie Government&apos;s intention that courses in advanced further education should continue to have a strong vocational bias, with specific relevance to someaspect of cojaiuui-ck, industry or. the arts, and with u. urohouuufed weighLiug in suchsubjects as applied science, engineering, art, domestic science, music (often asa preparation for teaching these subjects), commerce, business management,text:-i 3s and agriculture.   In the next decade, these Institutions will continue tooffer the courses which they have hitherto provided, though on a considerably increased scale.   However, they may be expected to develop in addition a variety ofnew courses to meet the requirements of advancing technology, and to respondgenerally to the fresh needs of society.   Moreover, as the numbers of young peopletaking higher education increase, fresh consideration will have to be given to thenature of the courses which they follow and the relevance of these courses to thecareer prospects of those taking them,ip.   The Government&apos;s plans for central institutions allow for capital expenditure to start building projects to the value of  29*pm In the five year period to 1976-77*In addition, it is proposed tc authorise education authorities to start further education college projects to a value of  16*3- i&quot; this period, and seme of thiswill be for places in higher&apos; education   It is the intention to allocate furtherresources for the additional, expansion that will be required to accommodate thenumbers of students expected in the second half of the decade.
3.   THE SCHOOLS&apos; SYSTEM(i)    Introduction\d.  The primary responsibility for the administration of school education inScotland rests with 35 education authorities:     Under the Government&apos;0. proposals for local government reform there will be? from 1975? 8 regional authorities and 3 islandauthorities with responsibility for education.    Of the children within thecoapulsory age limits, 96*7% attend education authority schools5   and a further &quot;u10$attend grant-aided schools which will continue to receive Government support, and can therefore be said to be within the public system of school education.Primary Education17.  Primary education in Scotland covers 7 years - from the ages of 5 to 12 -       is usually provided in schools which cater for the whole of this ago range.    the recommended basis of the primary school curriculum is a memorandum published in 19&apos;S5vmich has already had a marked and beneficial effect on content and methods.    TheSecretary of State has recently set up a Central Committee to keep under reviex* all aspects of primary education.18.  In the 10 years 1962 to 1972, the population of education authority and grant-aidedprimary schools grev by only 10.670 (from 581,200 to b42,800).     On the latest projectionsbased on estimates of child population by the Government Actuary, the number of pupilsin primary schools will fall steadily after 1972 to about 585,000 in the late 1970s,and will then gradually rise again.19&apos;  With the decline of rural population, better transport and a wider appreciation ofthe social as ;rell as educational advantages   of   a   larger school, educationauthorities have for many years followed a policy of amalgamating small primary schools;and in consequence the number of primary schools fell from 2813 to 2522 between 1962and 1972.
20.   In the 10 years 1962 to 1972, the population of education authority and grant-aided secondary schools rose by 15.5^ from 292,200 to 337,500, in spite of a slightfall in the number of secondary school children within compulsory age limits.   Theincrease was entirely accounted for by the fact that the number of children staying proportionate school after the minimum leaving age more than doubled fic-m 42,000 to 88,20^*21.   It is expected that the number of pupils in secondary education will rise toover 423,000 in 1977-78 as a result of the raising of the school leaving age to 16 in   :session 1972-73, and, of that number, some 70,000 are likely to be staying onvoluntarily after the new minimum leaving age.   Thereafter, the earlier decline in the primary population will extend into the secondary population, which, on presentprojections, will fall to about 393*000 by the mid 1980&apos;s before again rising.22o   In the present session, secondary education in 22 education authority areas is organised on comprehensive lines and all other authorities are presently at differentstages of implementing schemes of reorganisation.   In 1971, 72/2 of secondary pupilswere attending schools with a comprehensive intake.23.   Reorganisation on comprehensive lines has naturally involved considerable changein the demands made on school buildings, and in their design, use and location.Considerable numbers of 3 and 4 year secondary schools have been closed in order tobring their pupils together into larger schools.   In 1962 there were 752 secondary schools in Scotland, but by 1972 this number had fallen to 51 o.   A3 reorganisationcontinues, and as school buildings are replaced, the number of secondary schcols will fall further;    the average secondary school   may be expected to have a roll ofabout 1,000 and the organisation of secondary education/is likely to be more uniform,with a large proportion of schools close to the average size.
f24,&apos; There has been continuous review of the -educational content and balance ofthe school curriculum, and study of the syllabuses of individual subjects taught.The Consultative Committee on the Curriculum (the Secretary of State&apos;s mainadvisory body) has systematically examined many aspects of the curriculum through its forking Parties and Central Committees -aid&quot; has published much dc uailed advice.A further expansion of its work has been recommended in the recent Millar Heport onMoral and Religious Education.1&apos; There has also been a growing awareness of the needfor pupil guidance in choice of curriculum and of vocation- and in personal problems,and this is being recognised by the appointment of teachers with specificresponsibility fcr guidance.   In addition, the Scottish Certificate of EducationExamination Board has introduced far reaching changes in almost all SO17, examinationsyllabuses.25.  The effect of these changes is difficult to assess.   The success of&quot; an education service cannot readily be measured in terms of output, but it is pertinent to take account of the number of pupils ^ho have been brought forward to a stage vrhere theycan leave schooj. with forma&quot;) qualifications,,   Whereas in the period 1963 to 1972 the secondary school population grew by about 18?&apos;, the m^ber of passes in individualsubjects in the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary grade examination rose from 124,400 to 20i/,500,   In the SCE Higher grade examination the number of pussesin individual subjects rose strikingly from 39?60Q in 19^3 to almost 85,000 in 1972*26.   The Certificate of Sixth Year Studies was introduced into Scottish secondary schools in 1960*   This is not a pass/fail examination; it is designed to provide a stimulus for independent study in depth and so prepare pupils for the transition to higher education.   In 1968 the number of presentations ir individual subjects was1*993; by 1972 the number had risen to 8,900.27*   Thus in the past 10 years the schools, have gone through very substantial changesin organisation and. at the same time, have introduced fundamental changes in curriculumand in their general approach to the education of pupils.   These changes, and particular]the development of new curricula designed to meet the needs of all pupils in a rapidly*Moral and Religious Education in Scottish Schools, MS0, I972
1 \changing society and the introduction of more systematic arrangements for the guidanceof individual pupils, have laid the foundation for further advance towards the idealof full opportunity for all our children.(ii) The Under Fives28.   There has been a statutory duty on education authorities in Scotland since 1%-5to make adequate provision for nursery education but, because of other demands on resources, successive Governments have been unable tc let education authorities cerryout this duty.   The present Government believes that the time has come to remove therestrictions imposed in this field and to make nursery education available a.c widelyas possible, without charge, to children whose parents wish them to benefit from it,.29.   The benefits which can be derived from nursery education have been described inthe-Report of the Working Party on Nursery Education, &quot;Before Five&quot; .*   Because ofincreasing interest in the subject, and the fact that some modest expansion of provision was becoming possible, the Working Party was set up on the advise of the consultative Committee on the Curriculum, to make an appraisal of the best practices in nursery schools and classes and of the principles on which pre-school educaticnshould be based.   To quote from the opening chapter of the Report:&quot;The first few years of a child&apos;s life are being increasingly recognised asa period of highly significant growth.   During this time, he makes comparativelymore progress, both physically and intellectually, than he appears to make inany other period of similar duration.   This progress, however, is closely related to the child&apos;s environment, which is now considered to have a markedinfluence-; on the level and rate of his development.The ideal educational environment in these years will afford opportunities for the child to develop his physical, intellectual, social and emotionalcapacities.&quot;*Before Five, HMSO, 19.7.1.
jO.   &quot;Before Five&quot; observes that development of nursery education began from the wishto alleviate the poor physical conditions of children in slum areas.   As the proport-ion of children who lack adequate feed, rest and clothing has decreased, there hasbeen increasing interest in the role of nursery education in providing intellectualstimulation in a beneficial social setting for children whose early experiences are limited and narrow because of deficiencies in their environment.   However, compensatoryeducation is not the sole function of nursery schools.   There has been an increasing demand for pre-school education from both parents and educationists, as knowledge has grown about the effects of social contacts and intellectual stimulus, and as changesin patterns of living have made it more difficult for parents generally to provide athome the opportunities a child needs for all-round development.present Provision31,   Some progress has already been made, and there has been a steady increase in thenumber of children attending education authority and grant-aided nursery classes orschools especially in areas 01&apos; social deprivation where assistance is available under the urban programme.   With the increasing trend towards part-day attendance,which enables one place to benefit two children, the number rose from 6,727 inJanuary 1966 to 14,818 in January 1972.   It is estimated that approximately 9,500places are now available in nursery schools and classes.320   More recently there has also been an increase in the number of children admitted to primary schools before reaching the age of 5;    the number in education authorityprimary schools rose from 2,025 in January 1971 to 6,476 in January 1972, possiblybecause of the change made by some authorities to a single commencement date in eachysar,   (There are, of course, always a number of 5 year olds not in primary schools.)
33.   Despite these increases in the numbers receiving nursery or primary education,however, the proportion of 3 and 4 year olds receiving some form of education wasonly some YZfo of the combined ago group in January 1972.Planriing..Ssrvlces, for Pro-School Children34.   The Report &quot;Before Five&quot; called attention t;o the need for a c.&apos;.^jer integration of services to facilitate &quot;the oost effective use of all available resources to complement the natural or substitute home in providing the best possible start inlife for young children&quot;.   To assess the needs of pre-school children in eachcommunity and to plan appropriate services, close consultation will be necessarybetween education, social work, and local health authorities.   Integrated facilities,combining, for example, nursery education with provision for children who requirecere for a longer period of the day than nursery schools can normally provide, orshort term residential care, can have en important function in certain circumstances.35.  If nursery education is to provide compensatory education for those children whoneed it most, it will be necessary to ensure that the parents of these children aregiven every posbitle encouragement to take advantage of the facilities that beoomeavailable.   Health visitors and social workers mil have an important part to play inadvising parents and nursery teachers of those children who would lie most likely to gain advantages from nursery education,   &quot;Before Five&quot; called attention to the benefittfkich mentally or physically handicapped children can derive from mxing with other children in nursery schools or classes for part of each day or part of the week, and authorities will be asked to consider the extent to which provision can be made forhandicapped children vhen they draw up their plansc
36.   The need for nursery schools and classes in any area will also be influenced bythe extent to which other facilities, and particularly playgroups, are already available.   There nas been a steady growth in the number of playgroups in Scotlandwhich were attended by over 22,600 children in December1 1971*   Their development hasbeen guided and assisted both by local authorities and by the Scottish Pre-SchoolPlaygroups Association, and the Government has indicated its support for the movementby increasing their financial assistance to the Association.   They hope the developmentof playgroups will continue, since clearly both nursery schools and playgroups have apart to play in meeting the potential demand for facilities for pre-school children.In areas where both nurser3r education and playgroups are or become available, parentswill be free to choose between them.   Close co-operation and consultation between theeducation authority, the social work authority and the playgroup movement will benecessary in planning a comprehensive service for each area,37*   Nursery schools and playgroups may learn from each other,,   The playgroup movement-has shown that&apos;the child, benefits from the better understanding which the parent gainsfrom participation in the playgroup and. which the playleader gains from ahari ig theparent1s experience of the child.   It is hoped that similar close co-operation betweenhome and nursery school or class, and similar parental participation in the activitiesof the school will be encouraged as nursery education is expanded.   Equally, it ishoped that nursery teachers will continue to-offer the benefit of their training and experience to the playgroup movement, and that local authorities will increase their assistance to the movement, in the form both of advisory services and of materialhelp such as the provision of equipment and accommodation.Scale of Expanslop38.   It is difficult to estimate with precision the demand for places in nurseryschools and classes because attendance is voluntary and will remain soe   It will therefore be for each authority to assess the needs of its own area as its programmedevelops.   The Government intend now to authorise expenditure which will permiteducation authorities to start nursery education projects to a value of  A..5m in eachof the 3 financial years 1974--77.   The expansion programme will continue thereafter
and it is the G-government!s aim to provide by 1932-83 sufficient nursery places tomeet the expected demand from parents who wish their children to attend from thebeginning of the school year after the age of 3.   The actual number of places to beprovided will depend on the extent of this demand as well as on the resources whichcan be made available.39.   The number of places which can be provided, out of the  13.5s1. to be made availablein the period 19?&apos;;- to 1977 will be determined by the type of provision educationauthorities consider necessary.   Much vd.ll depend on the extent to which provision ismade in the form of nursery extensions to primary schools     an economical form of provision since some facilities can be shared with the primary school - or in the formof separate nursery schools.   In seme areas it may be appropriate to provide nurseryclasses attached to pi-imary schools.   In others, however, it will not be practicable to build additional classrooms on to existing primary schools;   and it is undesirable to attach classes to large primary schools since young children cannot easily cope with very large numbers of fellow pupils.   In some places, therefore, sep?.i&apos;at nurseryschools will be necessary.40.   On the assumption that about half the new places will be provided in separateschools and half in extensions to primary schools in the early years of theprogramme, it i- calculated that about 35,000 places will be available in nursery education by 1977, compared with 93500 places this year.   Taking account also ofchildren under 5 likely to be in primary schools, provision of this order will mean that probably about hff/o of the combined 3 and 4 year old. age group might be receiving some form of education by 1977, the exact number depending upon the numberof children requiring full time education end the extent of part-time attendance.410   It is expected that education authorities&apos; current expenditure on nursery education will rise from approximately  2a in 1973-74 before the building programmebeginr., to nearly  6ra in 1976-77 (at 1972 prices).   Much of the additional expenditure involved will be on teaching and supporting staff-,    The numbers of teachers needed for this programme are being taken into account in planning future levels of entry to the colleges of education (see section 3(v), para 60).   The extent of the increase
in current expenditure, like the number of places which can be provided for theavailable capita3 investment, will be influenced by the form of provision since thecost per place is higher in a separate nursery school than in an extension to 8,primary school.   All such expenditure will be reckonable expenditure for rate support grant purposes.Priorities42.   It is intended that each education authority should be given an allocation fromthe capital investment that is to be made available for nursery building and should be-free to select the projects to be undertaken in it3 area   The Government, however,takes the view that in the initial years ox&quot; the nursery building programme, priority should in general be given to areas of social need.   Education authorities will accordingly be given certain guidelines to assist them to ensure that this is done.For this purpose, areas of social need will include, ii: addition to those areas whichhave hitherto been eligible for nursery provision under the urban programme, other districts which have not sc benefited but which nevertheless show features whichjustify a degree cf priority in the allocation of resources, for example, highdensity housing with insufficient play space for&apos;children.   The extent to whichareas of social need exist within tne area of an education authority will be takeninto account by ^he Government in determining the authorityss share of the building programme.
((iii)   School Building43,    For many years the main objective in school building has been to provide additional primary and secondary school places to keep pace with the growth of theschool population and with its redistribution as pupils moved with their parentsinto areas of new housing development.   More recently, education authorities havealso had to provide extra secondary school accommodation to prepare for the raising of the school leaving age.   As a result of extensive building to meet these basic   -needs and, on a lesser scale, to improve and replace obsolete school accommodation,the great majority of primary and secondary pupils and their teachers are now housedin schools that have &quot;been built or improved in the past 25 years.   Indeed, school building projects completed in the past 10 years alone have provided permanent accommodation for the equivalent of about 35$ of the primary population and 6l/  ofthe secondary population in education authority schools.44.    Nevertheless much remains to be dons to remodel or replace unsatisfactorybuildings in the stock of existing schools.   This applies particularly to the primary schools, where the proportion of pupils in modern accommodation is substantiallysmaller than it is in secondary schools.   Prom next year, the total primary school. population in Scotland will start to fall, and from the middle of the 1970&apos;s therate of increase in the secondary school population is expected to slacken.Consequently ther^ will not be the same need to concentrate on the provision ofadditional school places, and this provides an opportunity for more work to be doneon the renewal and modernisation of old and unsataofactory school buildingso45o    In 1970 the Government announced an increase in the school building programme for 1972-73 to permit faster progress in the replacement and improvement of primary schools; and in 1971 a continuing programme specifically for primary schools1improvements was announced at the level of about  8rn a year for th&amp; period 1973-74to 1975-76.   Under the main school building programme there is also some scope for
the improvement and replacement of secondary schools.   It is now proposed toincrease the school building programme by  2m a year in each of the 3 years 1974-75to 1976-77 to enable education authorities to start more improvement and replacementwork.46.   In the primary sector, the improvement programme already announced up to1975-76 will continue for a further year and will be augmented, particularly in1974-75, to enable education authorities to provide the extra accommodation needed for the improved primary school staffing standards which they are expected to attainby the mid 1970&apos;s.   The size of the increased programme will be determined inconsultation with education authorities.47.   V/hile secondary school accommodation in Scotland is on the whole more modernthan primary accommodation, there remain in many areas secondary schools which warrantearly improvement or replacement.   The amount of work on these schools which can beundertaken in 1974-75 will be limited because of the need to concentrate onimprovements in the primary sector, but by 1975-76 sufficient progress will havebeen made with primary schools for more of the resources available to be us^d forsecondary school improvements and replacements.
i,8.   There is also need for improved provision for handicapped pupils.   There is ashortage of provision in the public sector in Scotland for maladjusted children, andnew schools, some of them residential or with hostels attached, are needed.   Inorder to encourage education authorities, individually or in collaboration, to meet this need the Government has arranged for expenditure on the special education ofmaladjusted pupils to be pooled.49v   Many of the existing special schools for all types of handicapped, children arehoused in old and unsuitable buildings and ought to be replaced.   Man;/ special schoolindeed, are housed in old- primary or secondary schools no longer needed for bheir   -&apos;original purpose.   Even where premises were originally planned as a special school,they may no longer be suitable to accommodate new patterns of handicap and new methods of instruction;   for example, a school which might once have accommodatedchildren suffering the effects of poliomyelitis may lack the spaciousness and facilities needed for chairbound children with spina bifida.50.   All the provision required for handicapped, pupils will not be made in special schools or classes.   The Government welcomes the increasing tendency to encc-^rage anyhandicapped child who can, with appropriate support, cope in an ordinary school toattend there;   anu. education authorities are being encouraged to make the necessaryphysical adjustments in sore of their schools, especially in the secondary sector,for this purpose.51.   In order to meet the needs for additional new provision and for replacement of unsatisfactory older special schools, the Government propose to authorise a specialschool building programme of  11.1m in the next five years rising from  1.5m starts i1972-75 to  2.4m in 1973-74 and continuing at that level to 1976-77.
(iv)   Supply of Books and Educational Equipment52,   It has not been the policy of the Government to set standards for the supply oftext books, library books and educational equipment in schools.   This is an area in which education authorities have complete discretion.   It is, however, increasinglyclear that as teaching methods become morfi sophisticated, more resources will be needed for expenditure on books and equipment.   Curriculum revision has led to 3more rapid turnover of text books and to use of a variety of books in primary schools.   In secondary schools a wider range of booKo is used to cover certainsubjects fully;   for instance, English studies are no longer confined to a small number of major classical texts.   Quite apart from the range and variety of booksneeded to cater for new developments, it is clear that, given the current pace of change in all aspects of society, the books provided in our schools will have to bereplaced more often than in the past if education is to remain relevant to theexperience and interest of pupils.53.   Modern teaching methods also require an expanding use of technological aids,such as film scrips, films, film loops, tape recorders, projectors and, at a moreelaborate level, language laboratories and video tape recording equipment.   In. somesubjects, notably science, more sophisticated and costly equipment is needed to match the modern cuniculum and demands will be created not only by new subjects, such ascomputer studies, but also by new concepts and methods in old established subjectslike art and technical studies.   The development and expansion of outdoor education -and field studies also creates a demand for expensive equipment.%,   These developments suggest the need to leave room for expenditure on books andequipment to increase much more rapidly than in the past few years, when the levelof spending in this area has been virtually static.   Fox- planning purposes, therefore,it has been assumed that spending will rise by about   6 f0 annually to 197&amp;-77, axl^-thereafter at a more moderate but still substantial rate.
(v)   Teachers ano Auxiliary Staff55.   The classroom teacher remains at the centre in the school system and programmes for improvement of the education service, whether they involve better facilitiesor equipment or additional staff, serve to create an environment in which the teacher can work more effectively.   So far as the teaching force itself is c^iicerned,the Government&apos;s objectives are the maintenance of a suitably qualified and trainedteaching force sufficient in number to permit classes of a reasonable size in whichpupils can receive individual attention and to provide necessary remedial educatiur.,to allow for a curriculum adequate in scope, and to provide sufficient resources of manpower for the general management of the schools, for the guidance and counsellingof pupils and for a reserve for in-service training.   There are no easy tests that canbe applied to assess the right level of teacher strength and hence the proper level of teaching costs, which acjount at present for about 66% of total current expenditureon schools.56.   The post-war period was characterised by widespread teacher shortage, and the concern of the central Government was almost wholly directed to the achievement of minimum staffing standards through regulations stipulating maximum class sizes andformal qualifications for teachers.   Education authorities were pressed to eliminateoversize classes, to replace unqualified teachers and re-employed retired teachers and to fill vacancies.   There was limited progress for many years but with theestablishment of the General Teaching Council for Scotland steps were taken in 1968 .to eliminate unqualified teachers from primary schools and to restrict their employment in all schools.   Since 1968 there have also been significant improvements in the supply of teachers.   The qualified teaching force in education authority andgrant-aided schools has grown from 36,300 in October i960 to ^.6,700 in January 1972.57.   A fair distinction is drawn in Scotland between the qualifications requiredfor primary and for secondary teaching respectively, and the differences inqualifications make it necessary to treat separately the two sectors of s chool
education for the purpose of stating a policy on teacher numbers,   In general,however, the Government has decided that further increases in the number of teachersare not now the only priority, and that the proper staffing of the schools is not tobe achieved simply by prescribing maximum class sizes.Primary Schools58,   In primary schools it has become evident that the prescription of maximum classsizes inhibited the development of more flexible types of organisation.   Accordingly,new standards of staffing based on minimum complements linked to the roll of theschool were set by regulation from 1 August 1972.   They are such as to permit anaverage class size of no more than 35 in a school with a traditional form of classorganisation.   They imply a national pupil steadier ratio of 26:1 when account istaken of remedial teachers and visiting specialist teachers in, for example,physical education.59*   The Government&apos;s intention to move towards a further improvement in staffingstandards by session 1975-76 was announced in Scottish Education Department CircularNo. 819.   Again, these standards were expressed in terms of a complement of teachersrelated to school size.   They would produce a maximum average class size of at most 30 in a traditionally organised school]?    and they imply a national pupil:teacherratio of 25:1;   remedial and visiting special.&quot; it teachers would be additional to theminimum complements.   On this basis, it is estimated that a teaching force of25,800 - about Qzfo more than the numbers actually in service in 1971-72 - would be   -required in education authority schools in session 1975-76.   The Circular indicated the Government&apos;s view that once these standards had been achieved any additional resources should not be used to expand further the primary/teaching force, but shouldinstead be devoted to other educational objectives, such as the provision ofadditional auxiliary assistants, books and aids to teaching in the primary schools,or to meet emerging need  in other sectors.
&apos;60.&apos; The announcement that the 1975-76 standards, once achieved, should not befurther improved on for some years implied some control of entry into training ifsupply was not to exceed demand and unemployment of teachers was to be avoided.Accordingly, the entry of students to primary diploma courses in the colleges ofeducatiei was restricted to about 2,500 in October 1972.   Teachers from thececourses will be available to take up work in the schools ab the beginning of the1975-76 session and it is estimated that, together with graduates who have taken the 4 year course leading to the degree of BEd or the one year post-graduate courseof teacher training, they will be adequate in number to enable education authoritiesboth to achieve the 1975-76 staffing standards anl to appoint the teachers requiredfor their increasing nursery provision.   The Government will seek to maintain areasonable balance between supply and demand of teachers by control of intake infuture years.Secondary Schools61.   It has become clear that in secondary schools, as in the primary schools,the prescription of maximum class sizes does not amount to a satisfactory staffingpolicy.   A staffing study has been undertaken with the object of establishing a method of measuring the demand for teachers that will be sensitive to the manyfactors affecting the number needed in schools ci different sizes and types.   Theresults of this study will-be published shortly and will be the subject of consultation with education authorities, teacher associations and other interested bodies.62,   Meantime the Government&apos;s provisional view, baood on these results, is that the objective for the staffing of education authority secondary schools during the second half of the decade should be a national pupil steadier ratio in the region of 15:1,compared with the ratio of 16.2:1 that is expected in 1973-74.   It is this provisionalobjective which they will propose, therefore,as a basis for consultation.   In 1977-78,when the school population is expected to be at its peak, a ratio of 15*1 will require a teaching force of about 27,300 compared with 20,700 in 1971-72 - an increase of 32$..The stabilisation of the teaching force at a national pupil:teacher ratio of 15:1
^Ly involve placing some restriction on the number of graduates entering teacher training.Teacher Training63.   In the primary field, the colleges of education, in addition to providing the3-year primary diploma course, will cater for the growing number of students vmowish to follow a combined course of academic study and teacher training leading tothe degree of Bachelor of Education and will also make provision for the trainingof the increasing number of graduates who are expected to enter primary teaching.A report on the training of secondary teachers,-which was prepared by a Working Partyset up by the General Teaching Council for Scotland and approved by that Council,will be published shortly.   Without prejudice to decisions about the future pattern of training for persons entering the profession that may be taken after consultation on this report, it is the Government&apos;s intention to expand the provision of courses for teachers who are already in employment both in primary and in secondary schools.The staffing levels set out in the foregoing paragraphs allow for this expansion,and the National Committee for the In-Service Training of Teachers is alreadystimulating the necessary developments.Auxiliary Staff64.  The primary schools at present employ the equivalent of some 300 auxiliaryhelpers.   Experiments in the extended employment of auxiliaries are being conducted by several education authorities.   The working arrangements vary but the general pattern is for one auxiliary to assist three or four teachers in a range of&quot;household&quot; duties, including the preparation of play and other materials.   TheGovernment is satisfied that there is scope for a considerable increase in this form of assistance for teachers.   In secondary schools there has&apos; been much interest in recent years in the employment of administrative and clericalauaisbants, laboratory technicians and other auxiliary staff to relieve teachers ofwork that does not require their professional skills.   This development is generally welcomed by educational interests and the Government will encourage education
authorities to make further provision of this kind.  Meantime a working party willinvestigate how such staff can be employed most effectively.   A second working party will identify the nature and range of functions in secondary schools which mayappropriately be undertaken by persons such as youth and community workers, librariansand instructors.The Teaching Profession65.   Educational standards ultimately depend on the effectiveness of the teachingthat is provided.   For many years teachers were handicapped by deficiency in numbers,a deficiency which education authorities were forced to try to offset by employingteachers who were not fully qualified, and by shortages of auxiliary staff,accommodation and equipment.   The policies now proposed will consolidate and continuethe improvements in these fields that have already been made.   It must be recognised,however, that as the deficiencies are overcome and higher standards become feasible,these changes will bring witn them a new fora of challenge; more will be expected of teachers by education authorities, by parents and pupils, and not least by their colleagues in the schools.   The Government has no doubt that the teaching professionwill respond fully to the challenge that the new opportunities will offer.
4.   EXPENDITURE IMPLICATIONS66.   It is provisionally estimated that the proposals made injbhis White paper the further expansion of higher education will increase public expenditureexpenditure on student support but excluding expenditure on universities, fromover  32m in 1971-72 to about  45m* in 1976-77.67. The proposals for schools will, it is estimated, increase expenditure in &quot;sector to about  222m in 1976-77 compared with  185m in 1971-72. The higher it of expenditure proposed allow for a substantial start to the nursery school gxtprogramme, continued expansion of the teaching force, increased expenditure on building and for a start to be made on other improvements such as the recruitmeAAof non-teaching auxiliaries.68.   Altogether, it is estimated that the cost of all educational services inScotland, including, in addition to the two main sectors mentioned above, r; &quot;teducation, school meals etc., but excluding universities, will rise frcm  28$1971-72 to about  345m in 1976-77, an overall rate of growth of 3.7?2 per annuities:*,A.69. The main impact of the cost of the nursery expansion programme will be insecond half of the decade, when there should also be a continuing improvement :provision of teaching aids and teaching auxiliaries and, in later years, some in the primary teaching force to meet an increasing population. Higher educat::will also continue to expand at a steady rate. After 1976-77, however, there ^be some levelling off in expenditure on teaching costs, and, on the assumption;.out in this Paper, total expenditure on education services in Scotland woula riabout  380m by 1981-82. *70.   The Government considers that the programme of educational expansion propcin this Paper is no less than is required to achieve the personal fulfilment of young people, a balanced and progressive society and a vigorous rate of ecor-cmicadvance in the last quarter of this century.   The policies proposed are Mgnifi*A11 expenditure projections are in terms of 1972 prices
and ambitious.   They should be taken as indicating the general scope ana :of the education programme over the next ten years.   Although they arc lasrealistic assumptions of the resources that will be required, it is not poto make precise estimates over a ten year period.   The pace and extent c::&apos;in the later years must therefore be regarded as flexible.   The Governmentthat the deployment of resources in the directions outlined in this paperj.ensure that they are most effectively used to farther the objectives of theducational services in Scotland over the next decade.I
