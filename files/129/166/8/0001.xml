DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENTx  , _____....      028 November 1972CABINETEDUCATION: A FRAMEWORK FOR ADVANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science .        On 3 October the Home and Social Affairs Committee approved,subject to the outcome of the public expenditure review, proposals for our future strategy for education which the Secretary of State for Scotland andI submitted.    These proposals were based on the three programme analysis and Review (PAR) Reports prepared by the EducationDepartments.2.        As the Committee asked, we reported the conclusions of that meeting to the Prime Minister;  and with his agreement I indicated at theConservative Party Conference that the Government had new and positiveproposals in mind, particularly in nursery education, which would be announced soon.3.        I also arranged, in consultation with the Secretary of State for wales, for the preparation of a White Paper, and a draft is attached.    TheSecretary of State for Scotland has done the same.    The draft White paper would normally have been considered first by the Home and Social AffairsCommittee, but the Lord President has asked if publication could bespeeded up and with the agreement of the Home Secretary (as Chairman ofthe Home and Social Affairs Committee) and the Chief Secretary, treasury am submitting it direct to Cabinet.4. Publication, which is eagerly awaited by the educational world, willboth discharge the undertaking in The Queen&apos;s Speech to present toParliament proposals to extend the education service and to set newpriorities, and also announce the Government1 s decisions on therecommendations of the James Committee on Teacher Training.5.        The White Paper which I submit sets out a ten year strategy to1981; its principal features are:a.        Nursery education will be provided for up to 90 per cent of4 year old and 50 per cent of 3 year old children if demand justifiesit; priority will be given to deprived areas in the early stages,1
ba        A programme for improving or replacing obsolete secondary schools will supplement, though on a smaller scale, that alreadyoperating for obsolete primary schools.c. The building programme for special schools for handicapped children will be increased,,d. The staffing ratio in schools will continue to be improved butat a reduced rate, to give a 10 per cent real improvement over1971 standards.e. Teachers will be released to have, eventually, the equivalent of one term&apos;s in-service training after seven years1service;  and all probationary teachers for the equivalent of one dayper week to continue their training during their first year of service.f. The rate of expansion of higher education will be restrainedto aim at a target o  750, 000 places by 1981, of which about halfwill be in universities;  various measures will be taken to reduceunit costs.6. This is a balanced programme for continued expansion.    The rateof advance of some sectors (notably teacher supply and universityexpansion) will be slowed to enable the others to go ahead faster.    Theexpenditure consequences of the policies shown in the White Paper up to1976-77 correspond to the relevant figures to be shown for the education programme in the White Paper on Public Expenditure due to be published on 19 December.    For later years, the programme is described insufficiently flexible terms to avoid making any precise financial commitment,7.        Inevitably the spokesmen of some sectional interests will be critical of the White Paper when it is published, but I believe thai thosewho are concerned with education as a whole will welcome it and that theGovernment will gain enduring credit with responsible public opinion.    invite my colleagues to agree that the White Paper should be laid beforeParliament and published on Wednesday 6 December.M t department of Education and Science27 November 19722CO NHDEMTIAL

INTRODUCTION: 1.     The last ten years have seen a major expansion of the education service.    The next ten will see expansion continue - as  it must  ifI education is to make its full contribution to the vitality of oursociety and our economy.2.     Since they took office more  than two years ago,  the Governmenthave been reviewing the directions  in which the service is growing;its objectives and its priorities.     In particular they have&apos; examinedfive of its aspects which require close attention at the present time:I nursery education,  school building,  staffing standards in schools,teacher training and higher education.    Each of these poses difficultI decisions about the allocation of resources if, within those available,a balanced programme of advance across all five is to be achieved.3.     This White Paper lays down under each of these heads the objectives,i at which the Government are aiming,  the lines on which they intend thatleach programme should develop and the resources they are planning to-devote to their attainment.     It will be seen that expenditure in eachof the five areas  (with one partial exception,  noted below) will1 continue to increase substantially in real terms over the coming decade.expenditure was the increasing number of young people using theeducation system.    The expansion was led by quantitative,  or demographicfactors:    larger age groups within the span of compulsory education;rising demand for access to sixth form,  further and higher education;more buildings to accommodate them;    and more staff to teach them.There was little respite from the job of simply coping with rising-numbers .5.     In the 1970s these pressures will not be so intense.    Someprogrammes - that for higher education, for example - must continueto grapple with the familiar problem of rising numbers and more places.&quot;Roofs over heads&quot; in the schools,  on the other hand, will be a lesspressing problem (the exception noted above).    Choices of a new kindcan therefore be made.I h,     In the 1960s the main determinant of rising   educational-1
6.     Thus,  the nursery programme extends the boundaries of theeducation service  to include children aged 3 and k.    The  school building programme gives a new impetus to efforts to get rid of badold schools.    The size  of the  teaching force will continue to be expanded but,  no less and perhaps more importantly,   the teacher training programme envisages a major new initiative to improve  thequality of training and thus  of the  teaching force.    Finally the continuing growth of higher education makes possible the developmentof a more diverse range of opportunities for both students and institutions. *7.     There is no ready way of deciding what weight to give to each ofthese programmes.    The total resources available will always be limitedEverything cannot be done in full at once.    Bach programme is in a very real sense in competition for its share of resources with other programmes,  both within and outside the education service.    But, withthe exception already noted,  each of the education programmes underreview must continue to grow.    This White Paper represents theGovernments  judgment about the appropriate rate of expansion for each.8.     The White Paper is designed to provide a framework for future action.    It indicates the general direction of a ten-year strategy for the education service but there is room for a good deal oftactical flexibility and for variation in timing in the later yearsand in the rate of progress.    In each part of the programme,  many points still remain for decision.    The Government and their severalpartners in the provision of the service will be able to consider these and work out in consultation how the programme can best becarried through.    This will call for a sustained co-ordinated effortover a substantial period.19.     Apart from education in the universities,  for which responsibilityrests with the Secretary of State for Education and Science throughout ;Great Britain, education in Scotland is the responsibility of theSecretary of State for Scotland and will be the subject of a separateWhite Paper.
10.    Under the Transfer of Functions  (Wales) Order 1 970 theSecretary of State for Wales assumed re spoil sibilit3&apos;- for primary and secondary education in Wales, although all other educational  functions in Vales remain the responsibility of the Secretary of State for education and Science.    Those Sections of this White Paper whichcover nursery,  primary and secondary education in England and Walesare therefore presented on behalf of both Secretaries of State.-3-

Primary and secondary schools   (including nursery schools andclasses for the under fives)  still claim more than half the totalof educational expenditure,  in spite of the rapid growth of higherI education over the past decade.      Resources apart,   the  schoolsI are of paramount importance because  they provide the foundation1 for all continued education,  and because  they affect almost thewhole population of the country at some stage in their lives.      InI 1971 over 93fb of all the children of compulsory school age inEngland and Wales were attending maintained primary or secondary schools.12.   The Government have carried through to finality a great reform,the raising of the school leaving age to 16 in accordance with theprovisions  of the Education Act,  19^.      They have also devotedsubstantial additional resources  to  the replacement and improvementof unsatisfactory primary schools.      The next phase of the Government&apos;policy for the schools,  which is set out in the following sections  ofthis White Paper,  makes advances Avliich are no less important.      these include a major initiative in the provision of facilities for  the under-fives.      In addition to this  important extension of the range of education,  plans have been made for increased capital expenditureon the improvement of secondary schools and on an enlarged special schools building programme;    and for a ten-year progx-anime for improving school staffing standards and the extension to all teachersof opportunities for in-service training..THE UNDER FIVES13.   The Government have decided to launch a new policy for theeducation of children under five:      This will be the first systematicstep since I87O, when education was made compulsory at the age offive, to offer an earlier start in education.&apos;-   Although local education authorities were required by the19H Education Act to &quot;have regard&quot;  to the need for the provision-4-jtfNIrlDcNl Sill
of nursery education,  its  claims  on resources have had to be subordinated to the needs of children of compulsory school age and to the growing demands for longer secondary school education and all forms  of post-school education.      &quot;While  the school-leaving age has been raised twice,  local authorities were asked in Circular8/60 to restrict the number of under fives in school  (other than&quot;rising fives&quot;)  to the number in 1957-      This has been mitigatedonly by a concession to enable local education atithorities  toestablish new nursery classes where  these would allow marriedwomen to return to teaching,  and by the approval of some 20,000new places  in nursery schools and classes  under the urban programme .15.    Children are already admitted by some schools in the termbefore their fifth birthday,  as  &quot;rising fives&quot;,   even though in lav/they need not be admitted until the beginning of the term after they become five.      Indeed,  in some  areas where buildings and teachers are available,  children start  school even earlier.      InJanuary 1971 there were about 220,000 children under five ininfant classes  (mostly attending full-time but some   4,000 part-time);    and about 100,000 more   (45,000 full time and  55,000 part-time) in some 500 separate nursery schools and 2,000 nurseryclasses in primary schools.      This  provision amounts  to the equivalent of some 300,000 full-time places.      But the proportionof children receiving education in maintained schools for even partof their fifth year was still under 35fo;    for three-year-olds  theproportion was a mere 5$-      These are very low figures compared
with the level of provision in some countries  of the European1Ec economic Comnumi ty .l6.    There is now considerable evidence pointing to the importanceof the years before five  in a child&apos;s education - and to the most effective ways  of providing for the needs,  and potential, whichchildren display at  this age.      The Reports  of the Central2Advisory Councils   ,  under Lady Plowden and the late ProfessorGittins,  based practical proposals upon these ideas.      they recommended that most needs could be met by part-time nursery education and that places  should be provided for all three and four-year-olds whose parents wished them to attend.      The PlowdenCouncil estimated that provision for 90$ of four-year-olds and50$ of three-year-olds wottld be adequate to meet demand.17.    The Government now propose to give effect to these recommendations.      Their aim is that within the next ten yearsnursery education should become available without charge, withinthe limits of demand estimated by Plowden.,   to  those children ofthree and four whose parents wish them to benefit from it.Circular 8/60 will be withdrawn.Objectives18.    Important as  the new policy is  in making possible asubstantial increase in facilities for the under fives,  it willmake the contribution that it should,  both educationally andsocially,  only if equal attention is directed to the characterof the provision.      A clear perception of objectives and1 .    Nursery places are provided for over 50$ of three-year-oldsand over 80$ of four-year-olds in France;    for over 80$ ofthree-year-olds and over 90$ of four-year-olds in Belgium;for over 80$ of four-year-olds in Holland;    and for over50$ of three and four-year-olds in Italy.2.

imaginative implementation will bo necessary.      While  the government can give a lead,  success  or failure will depend much more on the enterprise,  skill and sensitivity of local authorities,  teachers and other1 staff,  and on the response of parents.19.    The value of nursery education in promoting the socialdevelopment of young children has long been acknowledged.      Xnaddition we now know that,  given sympathetic and skilled supervision,children may also make great educational progress before the ageof five.      They are capable of developing further in the use oflanguage,  in thought and in practical skills  than was previouslysupposed.      Progress  of this kind given any child a sound basis for his subsequent education.20.    The opportunities which the new policy offers for familiesliving in deprived areas - both urban and rural - in bringing up their young children will be particularly important.      There,  as elsewhere,  the Government believe that provision for the underfives should build on, not supplant,  parents&apos;  own efforts.
21.    The extension of nursery education will also provide anopportunity for the earlier- identification of children with special difficulties A\rhich,   if neglected,  may inhibit  their educationalprogress.    These difficulties may be predominantly social,psychological or medical.    It will be  important to ensure that suchchildren&apos;s parents are made aware of the facilities available;remedial measures are much more likely to be effective  if appliedearly.    Close contact between, those responsible for the education of the children and socxal workers,  educational psychologists,nurses and doctors will be of great importance.Nature of Expansion22.    Planning the provision required to meet the aims of the new policy is complicated in two ways.    First,   the Government are notlaying down a uniform detailed pattern;  they hope that  local planswill reflect local needs and resources,  particularly the contribution of playgroups.    Secondly,  demographic factors apart,   the extent  of demand and its future growth are uncertain.    It will therefore benecessary to watch the development of demand carefully in the early years .23.    In preparing for the expansion of nursery education,localauthorities will need to take account of other facilities for underfives,  existing or planned,  so as to prepare a scheme for their areasin which nursery classes and schools,  voluntary playgroups,  daynurseries and other forms of day-care all play their part.    TheGovernment attach importance to a full assessment of local resources and needs,  and will welcome diversity in provision so long as it  isefficient and there is no sacrifice of standards  in the education and care of the children.    The main burden of this responsibility must rest on education committees,but other departments  of local authorities will need to share in it,  and consultation with voluntary bodies willalso be necessary in many areas.
24.    The Government believe it would be right for most  of the extranursery provision to take the form of classes for the under fivesforming part of primary schools.    Educationally this has the advantag&apos;classes  - new and existing - should be housed,  staffed and equipped t(meet the special needs of young children.    Where standards in existing classes wholly or mainly for children under five are below those appropriate for nursery classes,   additional assistance toteachers and improvement to equipment,   accommodation and outdoorplaying space may be required, *25.    The majority of educationists regard part-time attendance at school as sufficient,   indeed preferable,  for most children until they reach compulsory school age.    The number of under fives attendingmaintained schools part-time rose from 4,000 in 1 9^0 to  60,000 in 1971There will,  however,  continue to be some children who have a specialneed to attend full-time,  either for educational reasons or becauseof home circumstances.26.    The Government&apos;s plans have therefore been made on the basisof half-time attendance as  the general rule for children undercompulsor3&apos;&quot; school age.    In estimating the cost of additional provision allowance has been made,  as recommended in the Plowden andGittins Reports,  for 1 5/o of three-    and four- year-old children to attend full-time for educational and social reasons.    The effect could be that eventually about one place in five would be usedin this way,  although the proportion will vary according to need fromone part of the country to another.    No allowance has been made tocover the higher capital and current costs  of nurser)&apos; schools.    any significant expansion of nursery schools would slow down the rate atwhich the Government 1s objectives can be reached.of avoiding a change of school at five.It  is important that the9-
27-    Authorities should consider carefully the role of voluntaryplaygroups.    Many thousands  of mothers devote considerable timeand energy to running and organising such groups,     &apos;which make animportant contribution,  providing for over a quarter of a millionchildren under five.    The Government hope that  the development ofplaygroups will continue,  particularly among socially deprived children,  and that local authorities will consider how in theinterests of the children the best use can be made of them,&apos; alongside the expansion of nursery education.    Some playgroups,   if provided with better equipment and qualified staff,   could become maintainednursery classes:  part of the primary school but on a separate site.Many playgroups will remain until nursery education is more widelyavailable;  and there may be others for which there is a continuingneed.    These voluntary groups may be assisted by localauthorities  in their various capacities by cash grants,   the loan of equipment,  or the advice of the authority&apos;s nursery and infantspecialists.    They may be associated with a local primary school,and thereby enjoy the support of qualified teachers.    Whereplaygroups are supported in this way,   it will be important toensure that  they provide the same opportunities as in maintainedschools for identifying children with special handicaps.10-

All children can gain from nursery education but it isparticularly valuable for children whose home and life are restricted,for whatever reason.    While the Government *s aim is  that nursery education should be widely available within ton years for children ofthree and four,   priority will be given in the early stages of the     vprogramme to areas of disadvantage.    Local education authorities with substantial areas  of social deprivation,  urban and rural,  will begiven some priority in the allocation of capital resources in 1974-76.It is hoped that all local education authorities will in their turntake account of those considerations  in deciding which parts of theirown areas should be given priority in the establishment of newclasses for the under fives,  or in giving additional help to exis ting-classes.    The experience gained in the administration of the urban programme should be valuable in suggesting criteria.    If in the early stages  of the expansion programme the demand for places exceeds thesupply,  authorities will no doubt consider how far their admissionspolicy  should give priority to children with special needs.The Role of Parents29.      Local education authorities will also wish to adapt and applyto nursery education lessons which can be learned from the experienceof playgroups.    The most successful of them have derived much strengthfrom the  support of parents which the playgroup can generate by providing a local focus of interest in education in a community.    Somemothers have been able  to give practical help in running playgroups;as nursery education expands,  many more may wish to have some  trainingsuch as a further education college can provide,   in order to make themost of their time and their skills whether working in a playgroup ora nursery  class.    Their maturity and experience with children are important assets.    For others,   there will be useful opportunities to learn more about children&apos;s development and education from teachers and other staff trained in the care of young children.    In addition,nursery education probably offers the best opportunities forenlisting parents  understanding and support for what  schools are trying to achieve,  which is of key importance to successful educationat subsequent stages.-11 -
30.     Many teachers in nursery classes are already achieving thesejresults.    Enlisting parental  support is particularly important in theIdisadvantaged areas, where the need to stimulate interest and establishlinks between home and school is greater, but it is important in all*jareas.    Local authorities will need to consider how  to make the mostof the opportunities nursery education offers in this field.    social services departments will also have an important part  to play,especially in disadvantaged areas.Staffing31.     The rapid expansion of nursery education will require more  staff.The further education service will need to expand provision forcourses leading to the certificate of the National Nursery ExaminationBoard;    and it will be necessary to seek new and imaginative ways of attracting as nursery assistants not only school-leavers but also womenwhose family responsibilities may not give them the time or resources to undergo full-time training.    Both wll be needed and each will have adistinctive contribution to make.32.     Above all,   the programme will require many more qualifiedteachers particularly if,  as  the Government hope,   the proportion of teachers in the staff of nursery classes,   at present about a third,  isto grow to at least a half.    The objective is to maintain the presentoverall ratio of pupils to adult staff of 13:1 .    For this purpose,  thepresent number of about 10,000 qualified teachers  of pupils below theage of five may need to be increased to upwards of 25,000 in ten yearstime.    It follows that more students in colleges of education must be attracted to  suitable courses.    This should be the  easier because theexpansion of nursery education will make the teaching of young-children a more attractive career.    In addition some serving teacherswhose initial training and experience have been concerned mainly witholder age groups and who wish to turn to nursery education may require futher training to equip them for the purpose.    Guidance will begiven to local authorities and to colleges of education on their partin these two developments.
ll II ii Is I P Hi II I ill laResources33.    If demand does reach the figures estimated in the PlowdenReport,  some 700,000 full-time equivalent places may be needed inall by 1981-82.    300,000 are at present available,  half of themfor children of rising five.    New capital provision apart,  this figure would probably rise by about  150,000 over the next tenyears for two reasons.    First,  in many areas the number of children in the five to eleven age group will fall, and authorities will beable to adapt accommodation in existing primary schools for theneeds of the under fives .    Secondly,  more nursery places  already approved under the Urban Programme will be brought into use.    even so a substantial programme of purpose-built accommodation will berequired,  and as the first step the Government propose to authorisespecial building programmes of  15 million each in 197^-75 and1975-76.    The effect will be to increase total current  expend! time on the under fives from about  30 million in 1971-72  to nearly  60million in 1976-77-    Detailed guidance on the administration ofthese building programme allocations,  and related matters, will begiven shortly in a Circular which will ask local authorities tosubmit plans for their areas in consultation with the voluntaryschool authorities.Research3^.   The Government propose to set up a research programme tomonitor the development of the new provision.    This will includestudies of the results and effectiveness of nursery education in reaching its several goals.    These studies will take in a wider viewof results than the children&apos;s  educational attainment,  though thiswill naturally form an important part.    Studies may need to be planned in conjunction with other Departments concerned with social policy,and will take account of any development launched in support of thenew programme by the Schools Council.
Is sk0 ft flri I ) &apos;!SCHOOLS:     CAPITAL INVESTMENTPrimary and Secondary School improvements35.    School building programmes need to be  large enough to  ensure thata school place is available for every child.    The programmes must take account of changes both in the total size of the school population andin its geographical distribution.    These basic needs must have firstclaim on the resources available for school building.     Over the past ten years the number of children in maintained primary and secondary schools in England and Wales has risen by over a million.     In additionprovision has had to be made for the raising of the school-leaving age.Primary rolls  increased throughout the above period,  but  the fall inthe birth-rate since 1 96h will mean that numbers in primary schools will decline after 197&apos;&apos;-    Increases in secondary rolls began in themiddle of the past decade and are expected to continue up to 198Owhen the effects of the falling birth-rate will start to be reflected in the secondary schools.    The pressure of basic needs has,  therefore,already diminished substantially in relation to primary schools andin a few years&apos;  time will start to diminish in relation to  secondary schools.    Such easing of the pressure  of increasing numbers affordsa favourable opportunity to catch up on the replacement or improvementof unsatisfactory school buildings.36.    Over a long period,   substantial capital resources  over and above those required to meet basic needs have been devoted to  secondary education.    This process began with the reorganisation of all ageschools, first in rural  areas,  and then in urban areas,  in the 1 950sand early 1960s,  and continued with the provision of betteraccommodation for science teaching and more general improvements.    Thenumber of new permanent  secondary school places provided since 19^5is now equivalent  to about  75/Q of the secondary school population,only about 5$ of which is housed in 19th century buildings.37.    In the primary schools,  apart from the special programme for educational priority areas in 1968-70,  the provision of new placeshas done little more than keep pace with the  increase and movement ofthe population, and many old and unsatisfactory primary schools have-1 4-
remained in use.About 20^0 of primary  school children are still inVictorian buildings.    The Plowden Report argued convincingly that alllater education depended a great deal on the soundness of the foundations  laid in the primary schools ,  and would suffer if theywere starved of the resources that they need.    It was against this background that the Government promised to bring about a shift of resources within the education budget in favour of the primary schools.To implement this policy substantial programmes for the replacement of unsatisfactory primary&apos;- schools were initiated from the year 1 972-73 *These programmes at current prices average more than  50 million a yeai38.    By 1976-77 good progress will have been made with the primary-improvements programmes;    and the fall in primary school numbers from197^ until the end of the deca.de will enable some old schools to betaken out  of use.    This progress,  and the continued growth in secondary school numbers after the raising of the school leaving age,make it desirable  to devote some resources to the replacement  orimprovement of the worst secondary school buildings.    For this purpose the school building programmes for 1975-76 and in 1976-77 will each beincreased by  10 million to  60 million.    These additions will comprisethe first  stages  of a substantially rising secondary school improvementprogramme for England and Wales.39-    These resources will enable progress to be resumed on the replacement or remodelling of the hard core of old secondary school buildings that are well below standard and lack specialist facilitiesneeded for secondary education.    Old schools of this kind are to befound in all parts of the country but particularly (outside greater london) in declining industrial areas in the Midlands,  the Northand in Wales.    The systematic programme now to be launched for theirimprovement and replacement, will not only improve educationalfacilities,  but also make a contribution to the Government&apos;s policy for the regions.&apos;l0.    The addition of a secondary renewal programme to that for primary schools should pave the way for a more systematic  long-term approach to the problem of renewal of school buildings.    In aggregate the
nation&apos;s schools represent a very large geographically dispersed,capital plant,  provided at different times over the  last hundred years or so.    Most of the oldest school buildings - those providedbefore 1902  - are by any standards near the end of their useful lifeunless they have been substantially remodelled.    But some more recentbuildings also exhibit  serious deficiencies.    The aim should be tohave a steady programme to keep the plant up to date and to preventthe accumulation of backlogs of obsolete buildings.     Such a policyneeds to be very flexible,  not only as between primary and secondary schools , but also to take account from year to year of variations inthe level of demands for resources in other sectors and changes in theeconomic situation.    But it  is easier to move towards such a policy at a time when basic needs are less clamant than they have been atany time since 19^5.    The next decade will be such a period.Special Schools41 .    Special schools for handicapped children,  like  other schools,have their&apos; share of old and inadequate buildings and it is right that they should also have their share of the resources availablefor replacement and renewal.    The provision of more  special school places for certain handicaps  is at least of equal importance.42.    There is an additional reason at the present time for increasingthe size of the special school building programme.    The Education(Handicapped Children) Act 1970,  brought mentally handicapped childrenfor whom there had previously been no obligation to provide education,within the scope  of the education system as from 1  April 1971 -     since then local education authorities have been surveying the field oftheir new responsibilities and assessing what is needed to dischargethem.    Many of these children are not at present receiving anyeducation and there is often a lack of suitable accommodation in or near the hospitals or homes in which they live.    Local educationauthorities are therefore making plans for a number of new special
/(3.    To help meet  these needs the Government are proposing a rapidacceleration of the England and Wales  special school building programmefrom  11  million in 1972-73  to reach  19 million by 1976-77 as follows: m (starts)1972-73       1973-74 1974-75        1975-76        1976-7711 12-J- 15 17-2- 19
	I IP	1; 1 9 E2JJ fST9 a lilLSCHOOLS - RECURRENT EXPENDITURENon-teaching Costs44.      The salaries,  superannuation,  and National insurance contributions of teachers account for about  70^o of the total  cost of running the schools.  &quot;Non-teaching costs&quot; as they are called account for the remaining 30% and amounted to  355 million in 1971-72.About one-half of the non-teaching costs is  directly attributable to the upkeep of grounds and buildings,  and nearly a furtherquarter to the pay of staff employed for this purpose.    Expenditureon textbooks,  library books,  school stationery,  and materialsaccount for about one-eighth of the non-teaching costs;    wheneducational  equipment and other supplies are added this proportionrises to about one-sixth.45.      The Government do not  control these items of expenditure,and trends in non-teaching costs result from many separate decisions by individual local  education authorities.    A number of generalfactors, however,  influence these trends:    for example,  changesin pupil numbers,  improvements  in staffing standards,  which enablepupils to be taught a more varied curriculum in smaller classes or groups,  and newly provided school buildings which entail higher standards    of lighting, heating and general maintenance of thepremises and    grounds.     In addition there is a tendency forteaching equipment and materials to become more elaborate andsophisticated.    All these factors tend to lead to a higher level ofnon-teaching costs.    Since 1964-65 these costs have been rising,per head, at an annual compound rate of 2.8$ in primary schools andand 3.2^o in secondary schools,  on a constant price basis.46.      In recent years there has been a greater increase in expenditure on the salaries and wages of non-teaching staff thanon other components of non-teaching costs,  and this  trend is likelyto persist for some years ahead.    Expenditure per head on books,while varying considerably among authorities, has on average beenbelow what is recommended by the Association of Education committee as necessary to achieve a good standard of provision.      TheGovernment believe that local education authorities will generallyrecognise the importance of an adequate supply of books in schoolsCONFIDENTIAL
and hope that, where this is necessary,  they will aim at improvingstandards.    In their view it should be possible to meet  this aim,and also to absorb the demands for higher expenditure generated inthe ways described above,  within a level of non-teaching costs which,on average continues to  rise at yf, per annum,  taking primary and secondary schools together.The Size of the Teaching Force47-      School staffing is much the largest single item of schoolexpenditure.    Moreover,  the standard of the education provideddepends ultimately on there being an adequate number of teachers ofof the right quality.    From both points of view the subject demandsthe most careful consideration by both the Department and thelocal education authorities.      The following paragraphs examine the staffing needs of the schools over the next ten years.48.      In March 1971?  in full-time equivalent terms,  there were  some10,000 qualified teachers  of pupils below the age of 5 in main-tained schools   (including under 2,000 in maintained nursery schools)and 354,000 teaching pupils aged 5 and over:    a total of 364,000.In 1961   the number of qualified teachers  was 276,000.    This one-third increase in the number of qualified teachers has been accompanied by the virtual disappearance of the unqualified andthus represents a qualitative,  as well as a quantitative  improvement.It has been a major achievement by the staffs of the traininginstitutions,  the local education authorities,  the voluntary bodies and many others.    The statistics of the last ten years show theprogress that has been made:    from 1961  to 1971  the national pupil/teacher ratio improved from 25-3:1  to 22.6:1, despite an increaseof over a million in school rolls,  and the proportion of primaryclasses of over 40 registered pupils declined from 14.4$ to 3-3/0.This year it is only 2.5/0.49-      The proportion of oversize classes is, however, a crudeinstrument for measuring staffing standards.    Class size dependsnot only on the number of teachers employed but also on a numberof other factors, not least the freedom of the heads of schoolsto deploy their teaching staff as they see fit  in the besteducational interests of the pupils.    The pupil/teacher ratio isnow in more common use and provides a simpler and more reliable-19-
ffs f			II i			&quot;J (j   ia fixindicator of current standards and a better index of progressin improving them.    But it  does not allow for changes in the agedistribution of the school population.    For example,  an increase,within a given total school population,  in the proportion of olderpupils with their more favourable staffing ratio would necessitatean improvement  in the overall ratio merely to retain the samestandards.        The projections of pupil numbers to 1981  in factshow both an increase in total numbers and an increased proportionof older pupils,  and both factoids will have to be taken, intoaccount .50.      In the years of worst shortage,  increasing the number of teachers and eliminating the largest classes was an overriding-priority.    Now however judgements of relative priorities are becoming possible between improvements in staffing and other ways in which extra resources can be used to benefit the schools.Although there is no conclusive  evidence yet on the  educationaleffects of class size,  the Government think it right to be guided by the judgement of experienced teachers and educationists that afurther reduction in the average size of classes would be justified on both educational and social grounds.    They accordingly intendthat staffing standards generally should continue to  improve pro-gressively:     it is onli7&quot; the rate of progress which must be decided,in relation to  the pursuit  of other objectives.51.    The Government believe that  the local education authorities,as the employers,  share this wish to see not merely a maintenanceof real standards but a continuing steady improvement during thepresent decade and probably beyond;    and that they will welcome abroad policy objective of securing by 1981  a teaching force 10$above the number needed to maintain the staffing standards reached in 1971.    To   achieve this for the 1981 numbers will require anincrease of about 110,000 and a total of about 465,000 qualifiedteachers for pupils aged 5 and over by that date.52.      In addition, upwards of 25,000 teachers may be needed by 1 981to staff the expanded provision for children under five,  described in Section 3;    and Sections 7 and 8 below will indicate the need for another 20,000 to carry out the Governments policy for implementing-20-
the James Report recommendations on in-service training and theinduction of new teachers.    Thus  the Government  see a broadrequirements    which they propose for adoption as a basis for planning- by all concerned, for some 510,000   (full-time equivalent)qualified school teachers to be employed in maintained schools by1981.    This would represent an overall pupil/teacher ratio of about18-1:1.      The figures quoted on this and the previous paragraphmust be subject to the unavoidable xuicertainties inherent in pro-objections    of this kind;     in particular they do not take intoaccount the recent signs of a falling uirthrate,  the implications ofwhich fox- education in the longer term require further study.53.      The implications of these figures for the colleges of educationare considered later  (Section 17).    But first they must be placedin the context  of the Government&apos;s decisions on the recommendationsof the James Committee,   set out in the following Sections,  and ofGovernment policy for higher education generally.21 -
ttti^JAMBS REPORTk/j The last metjor changes in teacher training followed thepublication of the McNair Report&apos;  in 1944.    Over the  last decade,however,  the colleges and departments of education have faced three great challenges:   the extension of teacher training courses to aminimum of three years;  a rapidly rising school population;  and theneed for a rapid improvement in schools  staffing standards.    Thepresence in these institutions of nearly 120,000 students on initial training compared with fewer than 40,000 in 1961-62 shows howsuccessfully they have responded.55 The earlier need for the quickest possible expansion hasrecently eased,  so that in the last two  to three years attention has turned to the content,  structure and organisation of training.In 1969 a Select Committee of the House of Commons began a majorstudy of these questions^ and in February 1970 the Area TrainingOrganisations were asked to make a thorough review of their owncourses and procedures.    Towards the end of the same year the new government appointed a strong Committee of Inquiry into TeacherEducation and Training under- the chairmanship of Lord James of Rusholme,With the Select Committee&apos;s evidence  available to them and the ATOreviews already under way, Lord James&apos;  Committee had massive dataon which to work.    Their report was  completed within a year and published in January 1972-5.56 The six objectives  at which the Committee aimed have receiveduniversal acclaim.    These are they:  a large and systematic expansionof in-service training;  a planned reinforcement  of the process  ofinduction in the first year in school;  progressive achievement  of anall-graduate profession by means of a more flexible,  open-endedand challenging pattern of courses, without loss of emphasis on thedevelopment of professional skills;   the improved training of further     . jeducation teachers;  the whole-hearted acceptance of the colleges of1    Teachers and Youth Loaders.

It is clear that  the six-fold objectives outlined above are widely supported.    They are fully accepted by the Government.    Butthe methods by which the James Committee proposed that some of them should be achieved have proved more controversial.59 The debate which followed has been of great value.    TheSecretary of State&apos;s discussions could not have hoped to achievecomplete unanimity over so wdde a range of inter-locking problemst butthey have established a large measure of common agreement on the best way of achieving the six main objectives.    The Government believe thatthe decisions which follow form an acceptable basis for sharingresponsibility for the preparation of teachers with the Governmentsmain partners:  teachers themselves - whether working in schools andfurther education or in training the profession - the institutionsconcerned with training,  and,the local education authorities and voluntary bodies .
Ij^MSRYICE TRAINING60.    The James Committee considered it essential that there beadequabe opportunities fox- the continued education and trainingof all teachers at intervals throughout their careers.    It wastherefore their leading and most widely endorsed recommendation that all teachers should be entitled to release for in-service training for periods equivalent  to one term in every seven yearsof service in the first instance.    They estimated that   actualtake-up of such an entitlement would result in 3$ of the teachingforce being absent on secondment from schools at any one time;this involves a fourfold increase in present provision.61 .    The Government propose to give effect to the Committee&apos;recommendation,  in the firm belief that  expenditure to achieve an expansion of in-service training of this  order is a necessaryinvestment in the future quality of the teaching force .    Therecommendation will need to be implemented over a period asincreases  in the teaching force permit larger numbers  of teachersto be released.    The raising of the school leaving age will putstaffing standards under temporary strain, but the Government1s aimis that a substantial expansion of in-service training should begin in the school year 1974-75 and should thereafter continue progres-&apos;sively so as to reach the target of 3?o release by 1981 .62.    Underlying any such programme is the problem of striking a balance between the teacher&apos;s personal interest in his professionaldevelopment and the employer&apos;s  concern with the current needs ofparticular- schools and of the pupils in them.    The Government&apos; sconsultations with those most closely concerned have also exposedthe practical difficulties  of making an express entitlement a matterof contract between a teacher and his employer.    It would benecessary to determine priorities for release,  to consider whataccount should be taken of service before the introduction of thearrangements,  and to preserve opportunities for some teachers toattend courses of more than three months in duration.63.    Once the programme is under way,  the Government believe it maybe best for the teachers&apos;  associations and local authorities to-2k-confidential
negotiate an agreed basis for the release of teachers for in-service training.    In the meantime the Government will look for vigorouspreparation for the expansion to come.
1? U L I. .&apos;,       e-ia a 15*4 a Ps aTgDUCTION OF TEACHERS64.    The:re is no major profession to which a new entrant,  howeverthorough his initial training,  can be expected immediately to makea full contribution.      The Government share the view of the JamesCommittee  that a teacher on first employment needs,  and should be released part-time to profit from,  a systematic programme of professional initiation,  guided experience,  and i briber study.    in what follows this process is described, for brevity, as &quot;induction&apos;5.The word &quot;probation&quot;  introduces the further,  though subordinate,idea that the period of induction is also one  of assessment, whichwhen successfully completed, makes the teacher a full member of the profession.65.    The Government intend that the element  of assessment willcontinue,  as one aspect of the function of professional recognitionwhich is described in paragraph 92 below, and that the existingperiods of probation will remain unchanged.    In future,  teachers whohave successfully completed probation will be described as&quot;registered teachers&quot;.66.    There has been widespread support for the Committee&apos;s view thatthe induction of probationary teachers needs powerful reinforcement.Serious doubts have been expressed, however, about the status proposed for the &quot;licensed teacher&quot; and about the deferment of the award of theBA(Ed) degree until after the completion of a year&apos;s teaching.    TheGovernment do not  support the alternative proposals put forward insome quarters,  under which &quot;licentiates&quot; would be regarded as students,as supernumerary teachers or as half-time teachers.67.    The Government consider that a teacher&apos;s initial professionaltraining must include substantially more than the minimum of four weekspractical experience in the schools suggested in the Report.    during their training students should have been given sufficient experience to be acceptable,   on taking their first employment in the schools,as teachers who are qualified though still subject to probation.-26-
58.    This must be accompanied by two provisos.    The first is thatfor their period of probation (normally a year)  they should receivethe kind of help and support needed to make the induction process bothmore effective and less daunting than it has often been in the past.The second, is that they must be released for not less than one-fifth of their time for in-service training.    For the remainder of their time probationer teachers would be serving in the schools,  but witha somewhat lightened time-table,  so that altogether they might beexpected to undertake three-quarters  of a full teaching load.    TheGovernment&apos;s plans for the growth of the teaching force assume that local education authorities will engage the additional teachersneeded to make this possible.    The Government share the Committee&apos;swish to see the teaching profession itself playing a major role in theinduction process.    They agree that professional tutors will need tobe designated and trained for this purpose and that a network of professional centres should be established, based principally on existing training institutions and teachers&apos;   centres.69.    The Report drew attention to the practical difficulties whichthe schools and local education authorities would face.    At presentmany schools are heavily dependent on probationers.    In some areasit has been necessary to appoint them to posts which would tax evenexperienced teachers.    For the future,  as teacher supply improves,newly-qualified teachers will form a diminishing proportion of the teaching force and it will be possible to be more selective about their postings.    The local education authorities have shown in the consultations that they fully accept the prime responsibility for ensuring that newly qualified teachers are appointed to suitablefirst posts and are given the supportive advice and guidance they need.70.    The raising of the school leaving age and local government reorganisation will preclude for two or three years a general start     -.,\on plans for improved induction.    Meanwhile  there is much to be done.The Government are proposing to the local authority associationsthat the planning of pilot schemes should be started in 1972-73 in four areas not heavily affected by local government reorganisation,to study the practical problems.     It is hoped that in the pilot areas the training of professional tutors can start during the school
IPLU Liyear 1973-74.    At the same  time,  other local education authorities will no doubt wish to make a beginning with improvements in theinduction process as fast as their resources allow.    The aim isto introduce a national scheme  in the  school year 1975-76.71 .    These positive improvements in in-service training and theinduction process have a number of features in common.    Togetherthey give rise to a substantial demand for extra teachers,   and bothwill require the designation of professional tutors and place newresponsibilities on the schools.    In both contexts,  local educationauthorities will wish to  strengthen their advisory staff and facilities.    This can be achieved in part by the redeployment ofexisting resources in colleges of education and elsewhere.    Finally,both raise broader issues of regional organisation and administration which are discussed in Section 11  below.72.    The major part  of the cost  of putting into effect the Government 1 snew strategy for teacher training will result from these two newdepartures.    They will require about 20,000 more teachers by 1981than wrould otherwise be needed and are  likely to cost about ^5 million annually by that time,  at 1972 prices.
73.    The Government propose to work towards the achievement of agraduate teaching- profession as the ultimate aim.    The James committee recommended that this aim be  secured by awarding intending teachers anow unclassified &quot;professional degree&quot;,  the BA(Ed),  after the3r had successfully completed not less than two years of personal higher education and a further two years  of professional training,  the second year of which would be in employment in the schools.    They proposedthat a new awarding body should validate the degree.74.    The Government have received many representations about theseproposals.    They agree with the view that a new awarding body would tend to divorce  teacher training from the rest of higher education.They also share  the widespread doubts  that have been expressed aboutthe value of a degree composed of three elements for which there might be no common standard or common responsibility;    nor would theylike to see the existing B.Ed.,  to the development of which muchcareful thought has been given,  confined to the in-service stage.Finally,  consultations have indicated that there is now greater support for concurrent courses for those wishing to commit themselves toteaching at an early stage than there appeared to be when the Committeewere engaged on their task.75-    During consultations a substantial measure of agreement has emerged in favour of an alternative development.    Many of those most closely concerned with the content of training would like theopportunity to construct,  and to see introduced as soon as possible,new three-year courses incorporating educational studies wdiich are  sodesigned that they will lead both to the award of a B.Ed.  degree,and to qualified status.    The degree would normally be an OrdinaryB.Ed degree with the assumption that a proportion of students whoattain a sufficiently high standard in the three-y ear course couj-d,if they wished,  continue for a fourth year to take an Honours B.Ed.degree.    The normal entry requirement would be the same as foruniversities and the academic content no less rigorous than that ofexisting degree courses.    The length of the college  of education year
would also permit  the inclusion of at least 15 weeks supervisedpractical experience in a three-year course.    The Government stronglysupport the promotion of such a development.76.    The Government think it is  important that this new degree shouldbe subject to validation by the existing awarding bodies.    Theywelcome the declaration by the Council for National Academic awards of its willingness to participate in such validation,  and they hopethat universities will be receptive to any request to do so that  is put to them by a college of education.77.    it will be for the colleges planning these new three-year B.Edcourses to ensure that the3r meet both the academic and the professional,requirements.    On the one hand an intending teacher must acquire,  aswell as the necessary knowledge and the capacity to apply it,  thatattitude to learning which will sustain him throughout his careerand enable him to profit by subsequent in-service training.    On theother hand he must be adequately equipped for the professional tasksthat await him in the schools.    The balance between these requirements will depend on the particular teaching objectives of the student,  andthe timing of the studies which contribute  to them will be determinedby the extent to which the student is committed to teaching whenhe enters college.    The Government share the James Committee&apos;s desireto cater not only for the committed student but also for the studentwho wishes to keep his options  open or who embarks  on teacher trainingbut later changes his mind.    This the Committee proposed to achieveby the arrangements for a Diploma in Higher Education,  designed in ateacher training context and described in their Report.78.    Section 13 below sets out  the Government&apos;s proposals for introducing a range of two-year courses of higher education in a widercontext and with a wider purpose.    The Government have been assured by those concerned that it will be possible to devise three-yearB.Ed.  courses, where required,  in such a way that the first two yearsof study could lead to a Diploma of Higher Education (Dip HE).    Ifthese courses were constructed on a unit basis they would offerflexibility of content and timing sufficient to meet  the needs cfboth committed and un-committed students.-30-
Vsl C$ ii - u  S       Era ii &apos;J      g ii4 [4xAt present about kO% of entrants to colleges of educationhave the entrance qualification of two or more A levels proposed for both B.Ed and Dip HE courses.    There would not in the short term be enough applicants with this qualification to moot all teacher supplyneeds, and a policy of wholesale exemptions would undermine thestanding of the new degree.    The Government consider therefore that,so long as  the needs of the  schools require it,  certificate coursesshould continue  to be provided.    Exceptional students should been abled to transfer from certificate courses  to B.Ed.  courses atan appropriate stage.80.    The contribution to teaching of mature entrants is widely valued.The new B.Ed.  courses should be accessible to those mature students who can show their ability to benefit from a course of study at thata level even though they do not have the formal minimum entrancequalification.    Shortened courses of teacher training  should, however,continue to be provided for mature candidates who already hold highacademic qualifications.81 .    Growing numbers of graduates are seeking entry to one-year coursesleading to a postgraduate certificate of education whether inuniversity departments  or in colleges  of education.    The James committee referred to the problem of providing adequate preparation in suchcourses for the  teachers&apos;  professional responsibilities.    TheGovernment recognise that the teaching profession will always needamen and women with the highest academic qualifications and that itwill be necessary for postgraduate training courses for such entrants to continue.    But the need for graduates is not confined to the teaching of specialised subjects  - nor to secondary schools where,as in primary schools,   there is great scope for teachers who havepursued a broader course of undergraduate study.    This suggests thatas competition for places in postgraduate courses increases,  thetraining institutions should vgive preference to applicants who have followed a broad rather than a specialised undergraduate course.Theare also likely to welcome particularly applicants whose degreestudies have  included elements relevant  to  their professionaltraining,   including practical experience.    A number of universitieshave already introduced education options at the undergraduate stage,and a few offer four-year sandwich courses in which one year ofSilfiffillTIIL
yjsa t\7\ gam ?i  JT *v-J     b\3 &amp; &apos; Li Wprofessional teacher training is introduced within the period of studyfor a degree.    The Government welcome  such developments.
p tm m EimKit h u u li iis&apos; 610.__TRAINING FOR FURTHER EDUCATION82.      The Government accept that a much higher proportion of thoseteaching in further education should receive initial training -either before  oi- after taking up appointment - and that they shouldhave opportunities for further training later in their careers.83.      The James Committee proposed that teachers in further education should have an in-service training entitlement  similar to that of teachers in schools and that those entering further education fromtraining should  in their first year receive the same kind of support as new teachers  in schools,  including release for one-fifth of their time for further training.    They also recommended that every further education establishment should appoint a professional tutor.    they recognised the practical problems  of introducing compulsory trainingof all new entrants to further education teaching and siiggested thatas a first step it  should be introduced on a limited scale for thoseintending to teach mainly the 16-19 age group.8k.      Initial training is currently provided in three ways by thefour colleges  of education  (technical).    The traditionalfull-time course - usually pre-service - is effective,  butdifficulties of attendance by mature students seem likely to inhibitexpansion.    Newly appointed teachers are sent by some authorities toattend a sandwich course consisting of two terms of traininginter-leaved with two terms  of supervised practice  in the collegesto which they have  been appointed.    This method has  certain provenadvantages but,  again,  attendance can be difficult and co-co-ordination between the training and teaching practice elements needs strengthening.A growing number of further education teachers have more recently beenable to attend part-time courses provided in their o\m or nearbjrcolleges as extra-mural centres of the colleges of education(technical).    While more  convenient for the students,  these coursesimpose greater demands  on the training staff concerned.85.      At present only a minority of teachers recruited to further education is covered by these arrangements.    The Government wish tosee initial training become more widespread but they doubt whetherit would be desirable or practicable to impose compulsory initial training on a category of teachers  (such as those intending to teachmainly the 16-19 age group) which could not be  easily defined in advance.-33-&quot;1T 111
ill new teachers need a systematic  introduction to their role in the workr their colleges;  for those entering without formal training or substantialUching experience this should be accompanied by a carefully plannedlitre-auction to teaching both at  the beginning of their service and spreadIyer the first year.    The Government proposes to discuss with localducat ion authorities and others  concerned whether and,   if so,  how soon araining requirement along these lines should be introduced for teachersewly appointed to further education;  and to what extent the  opportunitiesor teachers in further education to have in-service training    should be improved.16, The Government do not consider that the required expansion could[e based on the four existing colleges  of education  (technical) alone;hey see a clear need both to encourage the polytechnics and perhaps somether further education institutions  to share in the training processInd to give greater emphasis to regional considerations in planningraining.    These issues will be pursued in consultation with thoseoncerned.-34-iiUFIIEKTIIL
87.      Regional responsibility for the co-ordination ana supervision of teacher training has,  since the war,  rested without major changewith 20 Area Training Organisations   (ATOs),   on -which universities,colleges  of education,  local education authorities and the teaching profession are represented.88.      The radical recommendation of the James Committee  that these organisations should be replaced and all  their present functionsassumed by new bodies virtually divorced from the universities ha.scaused wide misgivings which the Government share.89.      It is important  to distinguish the main functions  that need to be discharged in relation to  teacher training.      In theGovernments view these concern,  respectively:    academic validation,professional recognition,  co-ordination,  and higher education supply.90.      Academic validation is here taken to mean determining whetherthe conditions  of entry to and the structure of courses,  includingschool and other practical experience,   the content and level ofsyllabuses and the standard of achievement arequired,   justify theaward of a certificate,  diploma or degree.      In the Government1sview this  function should remain the responsibility of existingacademic bodies - the senates  of universities,   the academic boards of polytechnics and colleges of education and the Council for national Academic Awards  (CNAA).91.      The Government expect, however,   that  these bodies willcontinue and,  indeed,  develop the arrangements by -which the teaching profession and the local education authorities are associated closely with their work.      Some colleges,   singly    orjointly with others as at present,  may seek academic awards froma university,   others from the CNAA.92.      The function of professional recognition is  to determine,firstly, whether the professional content,  structure and standards of courses are such as to warrant the acceptance as qualifiedteachers of students who complete  them satisfactorily;    secondly,-35-
If tjh iMtf&quot; Hu j&quot; ;vi ;.-   ;/./. &apos;Vjy &apos;iy um ii u iix* tei 11 j      u&quot;u Inswhether candidates for admission to  the profession arc acceptable on other than academic grounds;    and thirdly, whether new entrants maybe judged to have completed their probation satisfactorily and  fcobe eligible for registration.      The Government  think it right  thatin the  teaching profession,  as in others,  members  of the professionshould have a major,   though not exclusive,  role in the dischargeof this function;    and that in this context  teachers in colleges and departments  of education should be regarded5  as they regard themselves,  as members of the teaching profession no less  thanthose who woxic in schools.      Future arrangements  should reflectthis general principle.93.      The  third function includes the  promotion,  co:-ordination and supervision of in-service training,  an improved system of induction,and the professional centres related to both;    of the allocation of teaching practice;    and of the distribution of teacher training courses,  in number and kind,  between higher education institutions.S)k.      By the fourth function,  higher education supply,  is meant thedevelopment,  financial support and control of higher educationinstitutions.      The Government recognise  that improved arrangements are required for planning and co-ordination in the non-universitysector;     this is discussed further in Section 18 below.      In themeantime responsibility for this function., both generally and inrelation to teacher training,will continue to rest where it does now.95.        It is in respect of the third function that  the Government,share the view of the James Committee  that new regional machinery is required.      Effective co-ordination needs the close co-operationof the local education authorities,   the training institutions andtheir staff, and the  teaching profession.      The Government therefore propose that after further consultation the Secretary of State should establish,  in place of the  existing univearsity-based ATOs,  newregional committees to co-ordinate the. education and training of teachers,  composed in such a. way as properly to reflect  these  threesets of interests.   . These committees will not have executive or financial responsibility for the services they co-ordinate;     thiswill remain with the local education authorities and the training-36- *f$ fffe W tf &apos;,&apos;\ W&amp; B* H ffl R
agencies who will need to include in their estimates suitableprovision for in-service training. The administrative costs of the committees will be met by direct grant from the Department.96.      The demarcation of suitable regions for this purpose presentsserious difficulties which cannot be- resolved until firmer decisionscan be reached on the fourth function identified above - supply.Meanwhile  the Sccretaiy of State hopes  that the ATOs will continueto discharge  their existing responsibilities for both initial andin-service training.97-      There remains  the question by what machinery the Secretary ofState can best obtain the advice of the local authorities and otherproviding bodies,   the  teaching profession and the institutionsthemselves,   on the discharge  of her central responsibilities forteacher supply and training.      The Government accept therecommendation on this matter of the Working Party which reported1in 1970    and the Secretary of State has  it in mind afterconsultation to establish an Advisory Committee on the Supply andTraining of Teachers broadly on the model then recommended.98.      The Government also agree, with the report of the working party that a separate body is required to concern itself with the professional recognition functions inferred to above.      There is,however, no alternative  to responsibility for professionalrecognition continuing to rest with the Secretary of State unlessthe outcome  of any further discussions  justifies her in deciding to share this responsibility with a Teaching Council set up onthe lines  recommended in the report.      The Government are anxious,however,  that in the meantime  there should be arrangements forA Teaching Council for England and Wales.HMSO 1970
advising the Secretary of State on the discharge  of thisresponsibilitj&apos;&apos; which would recognise the general principle thatthe profession should have a major but not  exclusive voice.The Government propose to consult further with the interests concerned - the teachers,   their employers and the institutions in which teachers are educated and trained - as  to how this might best be  effected.-38-
AFTER SCHOOL AND BEYOND99.    In the stage beyond the school,   the expressions  &quot;further&quot;,&quot;advanced&quot;,   &quot;higher&quot;,   &quot;adult&quot;,   &quot;tertiary&quot;  and  &quot;recurrent&quot;education arc common currency but by no means self-explanatory.100.     &quot;Further education&quot;  derives from the Act of 1 O-V-l .    Strictlyit comprises the whole stage beyond secondary.     But  it is most  oftenused to describe the activities of the mainly - but now far fromexclusively - vocation-oriented institutions,  most of which are maintained by local education authorities :  polytechnics&apos; and otherfurther education colleges including colleges of art,   commerce and agriculture and,  in some contexts,   of education.    These providea main meeting ground between the world of education and industry,business and the professions - a partnership which the Governmentwould like to see greatly strengthened.101.    The further education system has a vital contribution to makein ensuring that  the country has a work force capable of meeting - atall levels - the changing demands of industr3r and commerce.    TheGovernment are concerned that  employers should increase their support for further education by making full use of all its facilities,particiilarly those  offered part-time - not  only for employees ininitial training but for those over 1 8 in need of up-dating andre-training.    In this context plans are far advanced to give effect1to the recommendations  of the    Ilaslegrave Committee  on theorganisation of technician courses.    Much of the work of further education colleges  is also concerned with full and part-time courses for those who leave school at 1 6.    A lively account  of them is  to2be found in a recent book published for the Department  .102.    &quot;Advanced&quot; Courses are broadly those leading to qualifications0* a higher standard than GCE Advanced level or its  equivalents;  thisis also the basis on which the cost of their provision is sharedamong local education authorities.Report of the Committee on Technician Courses and Examinations HMSO. 1969Inside the Colleges  of Further Education.

103-    In this paper the  term &quot;higher education&quot;  is used in the same3sense as  in the    Robbins Report to cover the full and part-timework of universities,   colleges  of education and further educationinstitutions  so far as the last are  concerned with &quot;advanced&quot;courses.1Ok.     &quot;Adult  education&quot;  recalls first and foremost the pioneeringefforts of the Workers Education Association,  the extra-muralboards and the residential colleges to expand the opportunity for university education to working men and women.    It boundaries,however,  have been so enlarged by the subsequent work of localeducation authorities and others as  to make it almost co-terminouswith a large part of  &quot;further education&quot;.    The Government propose togive it careful study in the light  of the forthcoming report  of theCommittee on Adult Education which was appointed in 19*59 under sir Lionel Russell&apos;s Chairmanship thoroughly to review the wholefield,105.     &quot;Tertiary&quot;  and  &quot;recurrent&quot;,  though recent additions  to the educational vocabulary embrace concepts  long familiar in futureeducation.    The first  is concerned to stress that after the secondary school the need for a third stage of education is not confined by age or standard to those who can qualify for entry to&quot;higher&quot;  education.    The second concept emphasises a two-fold need:to make good for individuals the absence or loss of earlieropportunities and to encourage the renewal of knowledge and skillsmade obsolete by the explosion of knowledge and the  impact of technology on a rapidly changing environment.    Institutions havebeen created or adapted to meet this need for post-experiencecourses.    Birkbeck College is a long-standing example of one suchcreation;  the Open University is an impressive modern one.    Further.Higher Education.  IIMSO 1 963
and adult education have long and successfully responded to  theneed.106.    The divisions  indicated by these definitions are artificialin that they present different faces  of a broadly organised effort to enable all members  of society, with their widely differingaspirations and capacities,  once they have left school behind toto -learn where, when and what  they want  in the way that best suitsthem.    So far as resources allow the Government wish to see advances made across the whole  of this broad front.     In what follows,however,  special attention is paid  to the development of higher education for two reasons.    First,   it  is here that the greatest need exists for long-term planning to match growing demands and limited resources  in relation to other priorities.    Secondly,  theGovernment believe that  they have a contribution to make to  thecurrent debate about the objectives of higher education.107.    The motives that  impel sixth formers  to seek higher educationare many,  various and seldom clear-cut.    A minority wish to continue for its own sake the study in depth of a specialised subject to the top of their bent.    It  is  crucial for the world of scholarship,research and invention,    that their needs should met.    This has alwaysbeen a leading function, of the universities and must remain so.    Somestudents have a specific career in mind.    A larger number are anxiousto develop over a wider field what  the Robbins Committee called thegeneral powers of the mind,  but not without questioning whether aspecialised honours degree course is the best way of achieving it.The Government announced in August 1972 the start of the newTraining Opportunities Scheme,  aimed at a major and continuingexpansion of opportunities for individual men and women to preparethemselves    through appropriate combinations of education anddraining,  for new employment over a wide field.    The education service,and particularly establishments  of further education,   are expectedto play a major part  in the Scheme.
Some ask for no more  than a stimulating opportunity  to come  to terms with themselves,   and to discover where their real interestsand abilities  lie.     Others have no better reason theninvoluntarily to fall in with the advice of their teachers  andthe example of their contemporaries.    But not far from the surface of most candidates 1  minds  is the tacit belief that higher education will go far to guarantee them a better job.    All  expectit to prepare them to cope more successfully with the problems thatwill confront  them in their personal,  social and working lives.108.    It  is  important that the last and most widespread of theseexpectations  should not be disappointed.    The Government havesympathy with the sincere desire on the part  of a growing numberof students to be given more help in acquiring - and discoveringhow to apply - knowledge and skills related more directly to thedecisions  that will face them in their careers  and  in the world of personal and  social action.    This  is wdiat  is meant by &quot;relevance&quot;.The wider the span of student motivation the greater the need to match it with a wide and flexible choice of course.    This is being achieved increasingly b3r a system of ttnits  and credits devised insuch a way as to ease transfer from one course  or institution toanother - which should help students to retrieve false starts and make more possible the development  of recurrent education.109.    The traditions of institutional autonomy and academicfreedom place squarely on the universities,  polytechnics and otherhigher education institutions responsibility for tackling these issues.Much valuable thought and experiment  is being devoted to them.The Government would like to see still more.    They welcome  inparticular the research into the construction of university coursesinitiated by the Nuffield Foundation and innovations made by 0.number of polytechnics  in co-operation with the Council for NationalAcademic Awards.    The latter are designed to enable students to pursue coherent courses which draw on1a number of relateddisciplines,   reflect individual needs and,  while not narrowly-42-
vocational,  have high relevance to the world of work.    TheGovernment believe,  however,   that  they have identified a gap thatstill remains in the growing manifold of options that  await the choice  of school leavers well qualified&quot;by :their examination results to enter higher education.
DIPLOMA OF HIGHER EDUCATION110.      Those who wish to continue  their education have the choice either of entering employment and doing so part-time,or,  in the main,   of commiting themselves to a course lastingnot less than three years.    Only a limited range of two-yearcourses is available at present,  all in specific vocationalareas.111.      The Government consider this gap ought now to be filled.They believe  that a range  of intellectually demanding two-3&apos;earcourses will be a critical element in achieving greater flexibility in higher education.    They welcome the JamesCommittee&apos;s recognition of the potential of two-year courses,but the proposals which follow are designed  to serve a widerpurpose than that envisaged in their report.112.      As a result of their consultations 011 the report,  theGovernment conclude that  there is  sufficient  support for theintroduction of new two-year courses,  leading to a Diploma of higher Education (Dip HE) with the following six characteristics(i) StandardThey must offer a genuine and useful addition tothose forms  of higher education already available,not a cheap substitute for any  of them.    This means that they must be no less demanding intellectuallythan the first two years of a course at degree level.Thus  the normal minimum entry qualification should be1the  same as for degrees or comparable courses(ii) AvailabilityCourses on the lines proposed should be seen as a newoption to be offered by&apos;institutions in each of themain sectors  of higher education.    It is intended, that both general and specialised courses should be madeavailable.15 GCE passes including(or the equivalent)2 at Advanced level
(iii) AcceptabilityThe qualification offered after two years must bemade generally acceptable as a terminal qualificationand in particular as a qualification needed for entry to appropriate forms of employment.     Clearly the fullachievement of  this will depend on experience of courses offered and of the  capacities achieved by the students who have completed them.    The Government will undertake discussions with the appropriateorganisations to explore the question of acceptability;meanwhile as employers themselves thej&apos; will consider how the qualifications might be  fitted into their arrangements for recruitment  to  the public service.(iv) CreditCourses should also be seen as providing a foundation for further stud3&apos; and be designed,  where appropriate,in such a way as to earn credit  towards otherqualifications,  including degrees and the requirementsof professional bodies.    This  objective would bo more readily achieved if courses were developed on a unitbasis - offering students the opportunity of a programme which could be modified as  their interestsand career plans unfolded - and  if this principlebecame mere common in longer courses as well.(v) ValidationCourses should be validated by existing degree awardingbodies.    The Government welcome  the willingness ofthe Council for National Academic Awards to undertake this responsibility;    they believe that a number of universities will wish to offer the Dip. HE themselves and be prepared to validate courses where colleges donot seek validation firom the CNAA.
(vi)    AwardsIt is the Government&apos;s intention that Dip. HEstudents  should qualify&apos; for mandatory awards.113-      Careful attention will need to be  given to the relationship of the Dip.  HE to the Higher National Diploma and to other courses and qualifications which will be  the concern of the Technicianand Business Education Councils which are now being set up,following the recommendations  of the Report of the Committee  onTechnician Courses and Examinations  (the Haslegrave report).-k6-
fflxfflERS^AND COSTS TN HIGHER EDUCATION11 k. The Government of 1963 endorsed the general principle, following the report of the Robbins Committee,  that courses of higher education should be available for all those who were qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them and who wished to do so.    successive governments since have followed this principle and,  despite the pressures of economic stringency and competing claims, higher education institutions have been enabled to grow and to keep pace broadly with the rising numbers of those qualified for and seeking higher education.    The number of full-time and. sandwichhigher education students in Great Britain more than doubled from192,000 in  (academic year)  1961-62 to 463,000 in 1971-72;     in thesame period the number of part-time  (day) students rose from 42,000to 70,000.115-    The impetus of increasing staying-on in education to 18 willcontinue beyond the raising of the school leaving age;and the propor-tion of young people achieving qualifications at the Advanced level ofthe General Certificate of Education(or its equivalent) will alsocontinue to  increase.    The planning of higher education provision must make allowance for this,  as well as for the increasing size of these age groups over the next ten years.    Much harder to foresee,however,  is the likely trend in the attitudes and intentions of thoseyoung people towards higher education and their requirements wTithinit.116.    The subsequent career patterns of some of those taking degreesor parallel higher education qualifications in future,  for example,must be expected to differ significantly from those of their predecessors.    The expansion of higher education provision has already reached the point where employers&apos;   requirements for such highly-qualified people in the forms of employment they traditionally enterare, in the aggregate,  largely being met.    These patterns of employ-ment are already changing and will continue to change as  employersincreasingly take the opportunity to enlarge the areas of work inwhich more highly educated and qualified recruits can be placedadvantageously.    Even so,  there seems little doubt that the continuingexpansion of higher education will more than match the likely-47-lit! i IM
expansion of graduate employment opportunities as  these areund crsto o d to day.117.    Opportunities for higher education are not however to bedetermined primarily by  reference to broad  estimates of the country1sfuture need for highly qualified people;    although attempts to relate supply to likely demand in certain specialised, professions -and, particularly, at the postgraduate stage - will be no less important than    before.  The Government consider higher educationvaluable for its contribution to the personal development of t hosewho pursue it;    at the same time they value its continued expansionas an investment in the nation&apos;s human talent in a time of rapidsocial change and technological development.    If these economic,personal and social aims are to be realised, within the limits of available resources and competing priorities, both the purposes and the nature of higher education,  in all its diversity, mustbe critically and realistically examined.    The continuouslychanging rela.tionship between higher education and subsequentemplojTiient should be reflected both in the institutions &apos;  and inindividuals&apos;  choices.    The Government hope that  those who contem-plate entering higher education - and those advising them - will the more carefully examine their motives and their requirements;  andbe sure that they form their judgement on a realistic assessment of its usefulness to their interests and career intentions.118.    The possibility of significant changes of this kind,  alongside the uncertainties inherent  in trying to predict matters of humanbehaviour some ten years ahead, makes  it difficult to offer morethan tentative estimates of the likely level of demand fromqualified applicants for higher education places by the end of the decade.    On a balanced judgement, however,  the Government would expect to be providing by about  1981  for something of the order of200,000 entrants annually from within Great Britain aged under 21.This would represent about 22fo of the age group then aged 18:compared with 7$ in 1961  and 15fo in 197&apos; *    Further uncertainty arisesabout the total number of places such an entry might  imply.    Forexample,  the Government would not consider it justifiable tomaintain, with so large an entry,  the proportionate share that hasbeen devoted to postgraduate work in recent years.    And it is hard-48-
to know how many within the entry might choose a shorter courseloading to  the Diploma in Higher Education if these developedsuccessfully on the lines  indicated in the preceding Section.Allowing also that provision for more mature entrants and fo.rentrants from overseas would, not grow proportionately so fast asthat for qualified yomig leavers,  the Government consider that needswill be met within a total of 750,000 full-time and sandwich coursehigher education places in 1981.    This  figure has accordingly beenadopted as the basis for the Government&apos; s longer-term planning in higher education.119.      Following the report of the Robbins Committee in 19^3 thefastest rate of expansion,  but starting from a relatively small base,was in the polytechnics and other maintained colleges offeringadvanced further education.    The colleges of education also achievedremarkable growth, now completed,  to meet and overcome the shortageof qualified teachers.    Even so,  as the following table shows,universities were still providing for over half the higher educationstudents in Great Britain by 1971-72.Table 1:    Distribution of Full-time or		Sandwich Course	Higher EducationStudents in	Great Britain:	1 97&apos;i -72		England &amp; Wales	Scotland &apos; 000	Great Britain	&apos; 000		1 000Universities	1 98	38	236Advanced Further			Education	90	9	99Colleges of Education	114	15	1 29TOTAL	402	62	-           464120.      The responsibilities of the Secretari?- of State for education and Science cover all higher education in England and Wales and universities throughout Great Britain  (including Scotland).      Theproposals in the remainder of this Section therefo.re relate only to-49-CilfSIIITjltl
the area of her responsibilities;    they do not deal with non-university higher education in Scotland which will be covered ina separate White Paper presented by the Secretary of State forScotland.121.    For the future,  the Government are planning on the basis thatthe fastest  expansion should continue to be in the polytechnics andother non-university colleges,  with the intention that by 1981there might be an approximate balance of about 375)000 places ineach of the university and the non-university sectors in GreatBritain:within which about 3355000 places would be in the non-university7&quot; higher education institutions of England and Wales.122.    The Government confidently count on the   co-operation of theaiithorities and institutions on whom the achievement of this furthervery substantial expansion will depend.    It will, however,  involvea rapid growth in public expenditure;    and the Government have accordingly been examining in some detail how the objectives of theprogramme can be achieved most effectively and economically.123-      They are encouraged by the widesprea-d recognition that thereis scope for change and greater flexibility in higher education.For example,  the introduction and general adoption of new coursesleading to a Diploma of Higher Education   (as discussed in Section 13)could enable many students to achieve in two years,  instead ofthree or    more,  as much higher education as they aspire to betweenschool and first employment:    a change which might well be accompanied and supported by enlarged opportunities to take iipserious study again in later life.      Similarly there could be more widespread adoption of the practice of a break between a stiident &apos; sleaving school and his embarking on higher education,  enabling himto gain more experience of the world and use his higher education to better purpose.    The Government welcome developments of this kind and wish to encourage them:    first because they will lead studentsto gain more from their higher education, although they would also make a contribution to easing the financial burden the expansionwill impose.124. But these must in their nature bo questions for the longer term.More immediate questions arise on the current running costs of the-50-
institutions and courses in their present pattern.    In the pastdecade of rapid expansion,  during which many new institutions of higher education have been founded . and others have greatlyenlarged both their horizons and their student numbers,  there havebeen heavy initial costs to bear.    If expansion is to continue asindicated in the decade ahead, unit costs cannot be allowed to goon rising and scope must bo found for economies of scale.    Someinitial provision for such reductions has indeed already been madein the University Grants Committee&apos;s quinquennial settlement(see Section 15 below);    and the Government propose a continuingreview in the course of future quinquennial and Rate Support grant negotiations .125.    For example,  since so much of the expenditure in higher education is  incurred in the employment of teaching staff,  andthere is at present great diversity in staffing standards between different kinds of institution and different kinds of course,economies should follow more effective staff use.    The Government&apos;view is that  the   financing   of universities and of non-universityhigher education should be based on the assumption that staffingratios could be modified by the end of the decade to an average level of about 10:1.    They consider that a gradual transition tothis average figure should be possible &quot;without lowering standards.126.    The Government have also considered whether the distributionbetween public and private expenditure on higher education shouldbe changed;   for example by relating fees more closely to theeconomic cost of tuition or by substituting loans for some or all of the grants now available to students,  to mention two of the suggestions which have been widely canvassed and,  indeed,  favouredin some quarters.    For the time being the Government will continuethe existing arrangements for the support of undergraduates in higher education,  differentiating as they do between students whosefamilies are able to meet a large part of the cost and thoserequiring full maintenance.    The Government are, however,  consideringthe feasibility of introducing a loan element  into the supportsystem for students at postgraduate level.    They also propose toexamine, in consultation with those concerned, whether tuition feesshould be revised at the proper time to take account of changes.  -51-    ...
in price levels and other factors  since the present rates wereestabli shed.12&apos;/.    The continuing expansion of higher education which theGovernment are proposing will require substantial provision to bemade for the residential accommodation as well as the tuition of students.This is an essential component of the programme and,  as will beseen below,  substantial provision is being made for it.    At the sametime,  the Government share the frequently-expressed view that it is-unrealistic and unnecessary for such a high proportion of studentsto reside and study at a distance if equally acceptable coursesare available to them within daily travelling distance of their homes.    In universities ,  for example,  only 16$ of students are homebased.    The case is different in advanced further education,  wherethe proportion of students provided with residential places hasalways been far lower;    but here too the Government will expectpolytechnics and colleges to do all they can to  encourage studentsto live at home and not to add to the demand for  hostels    or thecompetition for lodgings which is bound to arise in many places fromthe proposed expansion.128.    Both educational and practical complications make this a difficult question,  and opinions may well differ as to the educational and social advantages of residence and the justification for sub-sxdising its expansion.    The Government are examining what steps might be taken to reverse the present trend and thus encourage many more students to base themselves at home while  studying.    They donot believe that this problem can be solved either by this means orby the provision of additional residential facilities alone;    therewill have to be substantial progress in both of these directions.-52-.i    j : a	J a v [J i	II iifi 1
IO1 wTIE UNIVERSITIES129.    It is in the light of all these considerations  that theGovernment have considered the advice of the University GrantsCommittee on the development of the universities during the 1972-77quinquennium.    They have decided that,  sLibject to the annualapproval of Estimates by Parliament in the normal way,  the followinggrants should be made available  towards expenditure on recurrentitems and on equixsment :Academic Year Recurrent grant Equipment grant  million   million1972-73 252.0 23.51973-7Z! 263.0 24.51974-75 276.O 25.51975-76 292.0 27.O .1976-77 309.0 29.01392.0 129.5These figures  take account of the Government&apos;s intention to arrestthe tendency of unit costs  to rise  (at constant prices)  from yearto year.130.    The grants are at 1972 Survey prices.    Before they areallocated to the universities by the University Grants Committeethey will be revalued to take accovint of subsequent price increases in addition some transfers will be made within the recurrent,equipment and capital grants in order to give universities greater flexibility in the use of their resources .131.    The recurrent grant of  252.0 million for 1972-73 compares with the provisional allocation of  250.3 million ( 248.5 millionannounced in November 1971  plus  1.8 million for vacation and fieldstudy courses).    In addition,  compensation of  7.4 million will bepaid during 1972-73 for price increases which occiirred in theprevious academic year.132.    The Government are planning in the longer term on theassumption that by 1981  there will be of the order of 375,000full-time  (including sandwich)  students in the universities.    this compares with 236,200 such students in 1971-72.    In that year there-53-P ffh M w n Ffa If M &quot;W R A 1^ W Hti b u    ka ti-a a b 8%Ea
were also part-time students equivalent to an additional 12,900full-time students, making 24-9,100 in all.133.    In arriving at the broad target of full-time student numbers to be achieved in 1976-77 the Government have taken into account the estimated numbers of qualified school leavers ,  the growingopportunities for them to obtain entry to degree courses outside the universities,  the short-term rate of expansion involved having regardto the additional capacity&apos;&quot; already provided for in building-programmes,  and the desirability of maintaining a reasonably smoothrate of increase over the period 1971-81 .    These considerations have led them to include in the grants shown above provision for 254,000undergradxiates by 1 976-77 .134.    The number of postgraduate students  increased from 35,000 in1967-68 to 45,200   (of whom about a quarter- were from overseas)  in1971-72:    that is,   from 17.6$ to 19.1$ of full-time students.    TheGovernment have made provision for this number to be increased inthe new quinquennium by nearly 7,000 to 52,000,  representing 17$ or&quot;a total of 306,000 full-time students.    They hope that,  as a means  of strengthening the universities&apos;   contribution to the initial andin-service programme of teacher training,  and to research in educationit will be possible to include in this additiona.1 number about 1 ,000extra places for postgraduate students of education.135.    The grants shown above are therefore intended to enable the universities  to reach a total of 306,000 full-time students and atthe same time to increase the number of part-time students  to thefull-time equivalent of 15,500;    making 321,500 in all.136.    The Government have told the University Grants Committee thatthey would think it reasonable to plan on the assumption that 4-7$ ofthe full-time students in 1976-77 will be arts-based and 53$ will bescience-based.    This would represent a small movement towards  the arts and would reduce the present disparities between the opportunities for arts  candidates and science candidates to obtainadmission.137.    It is important to distinguish between students and places.Full-time students  do not require places when they are away onsandwich and other courses.    Many part-time students can be
accommodated without the provision of extra places.    In May 1970 theUniversity Grants Committee issued a preliminary  and tentativememorandum of guidance which was intended to establish a framework within which universities might  start to consider their individualplans for  the  1972-77 quinquennium.    The Committee stated that theirexpectation was that the figures it contained might need to be revisedafter discussions had taken place with the universities and with theGovernmojit.    The memorandum was based on a total of 3-20,000 places.Underlying this figure was a total  of about  331,500 students  (ofwhom 316,000 would be full-time and  15,500 would represent thefull-time equivalent of part-time  students).    It was assumed that thefull-time students would need 313,000 places  (since at any time,000 students would be  away on sandwich or other courses)  and thatthe part-time  students would need 7,000 places.138.      Under the   settlement for 321 ,500 students now made by theGovernment a total  of 310.000 places will be required.     Of these303,000 would be for full time students on campus and  7,000 for part-time students.     It is assumed that 3,000 full-time students would beaway on sandwich and other courses.    Most  of the places are already available or are being provided in building programmes up to and including that for 1972-73-    The 1 973-7-4 building programme,  of a total value  of  27 million,  which the Government announced last year,   isexpected to provide some  9,000  further places. in order that theremaining requirements for places may be met the Government havedecided to allocate   29 million for the building programme for 1974-75,this figure includes an allowance for increases in building coststhat took place between 1   January 1971   and 1  April 1 972.139.      In the  context of the policy for  student  accommodationdescribed above,   the Government have again taken special note of theneed for more residential places in deciding on this figure.They hope  that it will thus be possible to provide for a further11,000 places to be  started in 1974-75 and  that as a result  the totalnumber in 1975-76 may rise to about  1 30,000.    Further provision willbe made in the   i975-76 programme.    This has yet to be settled butalready the general prospect is   that extra places will be available
for some two-thirds of the additional students expected inthe quinquennium.\kO.    In the light of the advice of the University GrantsCommittee the Government are satisfied that the new 1976-77target of student numbers can be achieved without adding to thenumber of univei&quot;necessities.    The Committee, however,  intend in due course to advise the Government whether in their view an early decision in principle will need to be made to establish one ormore universities to be active some time in the 1980s.
l4l-    The substantial expansion of higher education proposed inSection 14 will leave the non-university institutions with theformidable  task of providing,  on present estimates,  for some335,000 full-time and sandwich students in England and wales in 1981.      This compares with 204,000 in 1971-72 and points to a net expansion of some 130,000.142.    The major part of the 1981 total must be pjrovided by &quot;thepolytechnics.      Their development plans suggest that  they arccapable of reaching the  target of .180,000 places at which theyhave been encotxragecl to aim.      The Government will look to  thelocal education authorities and. the governing bodies and staffs of the polytechnics to ensure  that  they can play the key role inthis expansion.      They have been impressed by the speed and vigourwith which these new institutions have assumed and pursued theirinnovative  task.      This gives great promise  of their ability to fulfil the individual plans which they are formula.ting in discussion with the Department.1^3.    The process  of expansion is already well under way.      Comparedwith the  7 million for polytechnic building projects  to be started in 197-2-73,   the allocation for 1973-74 is  19 million.       For thefollowing year  the substantial figure of  27-6 million has beenearmarked and the Secretary of State has notified local educationauthorities  of the projects  on which detailed planning can be putin hand with a view to building work starting in that year.      all this accommodation is expected to be in use by the end of 1977-At the same time  the needs of  other colleges of FE, many of whichcateD.&quot; for advanced courses,  have been recognised:     36 million hasbeen allocated to major building projects to be started at  thesecolleges in the period 1974-75-      Provision will be made in laterprogrammes for any additional expansion required.M   P4i 11
Xhk.    To meet tlie Government &apos; s plans  the other colleges of further education and the colleges  of education will also need to expandto provide a total of about 155?000 places.      At present  thesecolleges together provide for some 138,000 students.      As aresult of changes in the role and organisation of the colleges ofeducation some  of  these places may cease   to be available for higher education and will have to be made good.      Alongside theexpansion of full-time and sandwich courses,   the Government willexpect to see provision also of the widest possible range of opportunities for part-time study.1^5.    In the planning of the expansion there are  three sets  of considerations,  far from easy to reconcile,   to which the government attach importance.      The first concerns  the concentration in some areas of very large numbers of students  on a scale which presentsacute problems of residence and transport.      Many cities havewithin or near&apos; them as well as a university and a polytechnic  oneor more large colleges  of education.      This will lead the Governmentto question any proposal that in this context a college of education should be expanded to  form    a separate third centre.lk6.    A second,   opposite,   consideration is  that an institvitioncapable of providing higher education cotirses adequate in standard and range must reach a critical size to obtain full economies of scale.      This will set a limit to the number of further educationcolleges that can expect  to provide advanced full-time and sandwichcourses,  but leaves room for expansion of such provision in manyof those colleges  that already make it.      The same factor makes it extremely difficult  to see how a small or isolated college ofeducation can hope to make on its  o\m the wider contribution to higher education that it would like.lh&apos;7.    There remains a third relevant factor.      Side by side withthe expansion of social demand for higher education will grow the expectation that wherever possible provision of courses should bemade within reasonable reach of their homes for part-time students who wish to combine study with employment;     there is also a needfor a higher proportion of full-time students to be based at home.p Hi m r:t i mf3 mw sa av$     Ixil I u     ha &amp;\J &amp; I lm i-a
This reinforces the need to give even more attention than in thepast  to the geographical distribution of opportunity.
COLLEGES OF EDUCATION148.      The Government&apos;s plans will requi.re more teachers.Earlier sections have already indicated a potential demand by1981 (subject  to uncertainties about the future birthrate)made up as follows:i.     about  465,000  (full-time  equivalent) qualifiedteachers needed not merely to maintain existingstaffing standards for pupils aged 5 and over,in the  face of  increased numbers and the changingage distribution,  but to secure the progressivefurther staffing improvement for which theGovernment are planning  (paragraph 5&apos;&apos; ) ;ii.    upwards of 25,000 for pupils below the age  of 5,to  staff the planned expansion of nursery education(paragraph 32);iii.     about 20,000 to permit,   without  loss of staffingstandards,  the  release of teachers for in-service training and of probationers who will be under-&quot;talcing additional  training during their inductionperiod following the Government1s acceptance ofthese recommendations of the James Report(paragraph 72).In order to be  ready  to meet these needs when the time comes,  theGovernment propose - as in paragraph 52 - that planning should bedirected to  securing the employment of about 510,000  (full-timeequivalent) qualified school teachers in maintained schools by1 981 .149.      The attainment, of a teaching force of this size will not require its present growth by 18-20,000 a year to be continuedindefinitely,    There must soon,   therefore,   be  some reduction inthe  rate of recruitment.     The schools recruit their teachersmainly from three sources:  direct from three and four yearcourses in the  colleges  and polytechnic departments of education;f&quot;a (R\ P&apos;j     p fi*\ !?a fM!*v? [5 f% fi[.1 n k 9 -&apos;- f-3 is u s ; a 1 1 fl 8 j.i Ish3 w w s IP Is HI sU-Uk,-60-
direct from the one year postgraduate courses in universities and  colleges;  and from among the large numbers of qualifiedteachers,  mainly married women,  who are out  of service and can be attracted back into the schools.     The effect on the colleges ofthe  reduction in recruitment will depend in part on  the preference of employers among these three sources.150.      On present trends the best estimate which the government can make  is that the number of initial training- places requiredin the colleges and polytechnic departments of education by 1981will be 60-70,000 compared with the  1971-72 figure of about114,000*1.    This will involve stronger competition for entry to training than in the past, with the welcome result that standardswill be  raised substantially.    This figure of 60-70,000 assumes that after allowing for the  increase in the provision to be madeby the university departments of education noted in paragraph 134,such expansion as is needed in one year postgraduate courses willtake place  in the  colleges.    Within the same broad total  therewill have to be increased emphasis  on training for nursery education.151.      Provision will be  needed to give effect to the Government&apos;decision greatly to expand the number and variety of in-servicecourses and to reinforce the  induction process for teachers,released for- the purpose during their first year of service.    This]task will fall not only on the colleges;   it will be  shared by theuniversity departments of education,   the polytechnics,   teachers&apos;and professional  centres,  the advisory  staffs of local educationauthorities and HM Inspectorate.    If the colleges&apos;   share were tobe two-thirds,   the teaching load would add up to  the  equivalent of about  1 5,000 full-time students by 1 981 .    The  outlook therefore,is  that the number of places in the colleges devoted to thepreparation of teachers &quot;will be  reduced by 1 981   to 75-85)000.152.      The quality and  experience of their staff and  the strengthof their physical resources admirably equip a number of the at present some 3,000 of this total of 114,000initial training places are in polytechnics.
colleges to share in. the  expansion of higher education.    TheGovernment intend that,  subject to what was  said  in paragraph 145,some  colleges either singly or jointly should develop over theperiod into major institutions of higher education concentrating on the arts and human sciences,  with particular reference totheir application in teaching and other professions.    Others willbe  encouraged to  combine forces with neighbouring polytechnics orother colleges of  further education to fill a somewhat  similarrole .153-      Many of the 1 60  colleges are,  however,   comparatively smalland inconveniently located for development into larger general purpose institutions.    Some of these will  continue  to be neededexclusively for purposes of teacher education with, increasing-emphasis  on. in-service rather than initial training.    Some may seek greater strength by reciprocal arrangements with the OpenUniversity on the lines of the experiment recently-initiated.Others may find a place in. the  expansion, of  teachers5   and professional centres.    Some must face the possibility that in due course they will have  to be converted to new purposes;   some may need to close . [154.      The Government know that some  colleges would like a more complete integration with the university sector of higher education and  that some universities would welcome this in thecase of particular colleges.    To be  fully effective educationally such integration would need,   in the long run,  to be  complete andto be planned accordingly:   staff,   students and courses would need jito become  equal and integral parts of the institution concerned.     jThe Government do not believe that a college should be encouraged to combine  forces with another higher education institution on       Iany lesser basis.    A university&apos;s numbers thus enlarged,  would form part  of the total  target numbers  fox- the universitypopulation set out in Sections  14 and 15.155.      The Government have been pleased to learn that  theproviding and. governing bodies  of many of the voluntary colleges,while not unaware of the difficulties,  will, wish to participate%B ii.&quot; liKi a   i LV      Li J li  I J&amp;a la-62-
in these developments outside teacher education and look forward to further central and regional discussions,   in which they hopethe  local education authorities will  join,   to consider how suchparticipation can best be arranged.    Difficult problems of organisation and finance will be  involved and a change from direcgrant to some form of assisted status might contribute to asolution.156. The last few paragraphs can leave no doubt that if, as most of them earnestly wish, the colleges of education are tofind a fuller and firmer place in the higher education family,their staffs must face major changes. The Government will beinitiating consultations about the fairest ways of protecting the legitimate interests of teaching staff who might be adversely affected.157&apos;      These developments have many implications for theorganisation of  the non-university sector of higher education,which is  the  subject of the next Section .
ORGANISATION ()F HIGHER EDUCATION153&apos;.    Last year,  after long and helpful discussions between theSecretary of State and the local authority associations,   it wasagreed in principle that improved arrangements were needed for theco-ordination and provision of higher education in the non-university sector if the anticipated programme of expansion was  to be planned to the best advantage.    These discussions were temporarilyadjourned partly because the associations were heavily engaged withthe  reform of local government and partly because it was not possibleto anticipate the recommendations of the James Committee.    Thediscvissions will shortly be resumed and will be much helped by therecent decision of the associations to set up the Local Authorities&apos;Higher Education Committee wdiose function it is  &quot;to consider and advise on the provision,  co-ordination and future development of higher education in the local authority sector&quot;,159-    The earlier discussions were concerned at first with the planning only of the polytechnic programme but were soon broadenedto cover all the colleges that provide advanced courses.    The need to include the colleges of education in a reformed system remainedunresolved, not  least because of the difficulty of fitting the direct grant voluntary colleges  into a system of local government finance based upon the pooling of expenditure.160.    The logic  of the conclusions  recorded in this White Paper isthat,  leaving aside those colleges which find their eventual home in a university,  the substantial broadening of function proposed for the great majority of colleges of education will involve theirmuch closer assimilation into the rest of the non-university sector of further and higher education.    Put another way,  a college whichexpands and diversifies - either alone or by joining forces with asister college or a further education institution - enlarging the range of its courses and extending its  clientele - will not be easily distinguishable by function from a polytechnic or otherfurther education college.64
161 .    The Church of England Board of Education have expressed their general sympathy and support for what  the Government wish to achieve on the tinder standing shared with them that nothing must bedone which will obscure the special  insights they have brought tothe creation of educative communities.    Discussions with the roman catholic authorities and other voluntary bod.ies about the future oftheir colleges  are still at a preliminary stage,   and it  is  alreadyclear that  they wish to maintain their concern for  the  training of teachers.162.    The renewed discussions with the associations will need notonly to return to all these questions but also to review the composition,   functions and boundaries of the Regional Advisory-Councils for Further Education.    There would bo obvious advantagesif it proved possible to define new boimdaries which   coincided withthose to be determined for the proposed regional co-ordinatingcommittees for teacher training.    In both contexts the problems posedby the concentration of colleges  in the Greater London area and.,the  south-east  region will require separate discussion,  not  leastwith the Inner London Education Authority,  the University ofLondon and the London Institute of Education.
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE.IMPLICATIONS1.63&apos;    The proposals described in  the previous sections are intendedto be implemented,  in the main,  during  the  present decade.      some indication of the costs of certain of these measures has beengiven in the appropriate sections;    this section attempts to give some indication of how the pattern of public expenditure on education might have changed by 1901-82.l6k.    This can naturally be only a very tentative forecast.      Manyof the  children to be educated  then are not born yet,  and their number is uncertain.      The Government must be free to vary the pace of development of  these new measures according to thecircumstances,  including for example  the response  to the proposeddevelopment of pre-school education and In-service training fromparents and teachers respectively.      And no forecast can be usefully offered at  this  stage for the important  sectors of educationwhich have not been under review on this occasion,  eg non-advancedfurther education,  adult education and special education.I65.    Within  these limitations,  it is possible  to offer some indication of the orders of magnitude of expenditure on primary and secondary schools  (including nursery provision and in-service training for teachers) and on higher education  (including initial training for teachers)  that could result in 1981-82 if the aimsset out earlier in this paper were achieved by that date.Provisional out-turn expenditure figures for 1971-72 are included for comparison.      All the figures are at 1972 Survey prices.166.    Table 2 gives such an indication for the schools sector.On the above assumption,   the capital expenditure necessary forthe expansion of nursery provision and for the extension of in-service  training would have been almost wholly incurred by 1931and is accordingly not reflected in the 1981-82 figures.Moreover, as explained in paragraph 33?  few new school places will need  to be started in  the later part of this decade  to cater for growth of school population,   though there will still be a need to provide for movement to new housing areas.,CS (Tk hi it&quot; R fr^ fip ftfl &quot;BP a n aw \iu u q a a fma confidential i3 vj a a f j-66- &quot;  .

Thus on the basis of the assumptions made in the preceding paragraphs,  the total annual expenditure in these two sectors -
which together amount to some three-quarters but not the wholeof the education expenditure within the Secretary of State&apos;responsibility - could rise by some  910 million over the decade1971-72  to 1981-82,  from  2135 million to some  30^5 million;which would be equivalent to an annual rate  of growth of some 3.6%.This average disguises,  however,  the very different rates of growthwhich, mainly for demographic reasons,  characterise  the individualsectors.      Thus  the equivalent annual rate  of growth of expenditurein the schools  sector alone would be some 2 . 9$5  which may be compared with a figure of 2.3$ for the decade 1961-62 to 1971-72.For the higher education sector,  where  the very rapid expansion ofthe 1960s gave an annual growth rate  over that decade of 6 .hjo ,the corresponding figure for the decade  to 1981-82 would be some5.1$.I69.    These precentage figures are very vulnerable  to the uncertainties of longer-term forecasting,  and are not of great significance in themselves.      But,  taken together,   they illustrate the Government&apos;s intention to continue  the expansion of the  education service;    and,  at the same time,  reflect their judgment and intentions as to respective rates of expansion within the growingtotal.      The Government believe that  these constitxite a balancedprogramme which builds upon  the  successes already achieved and willmatch,  as they develop,  the different requirements  of the decadeahead.After discounting the impact of the relative price effect
