DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 130 COPY NO    0 027 November 1972CABINETHOUSING FINANCE ACT 1972 - DEFAULT PROCEDUREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for wales. The Cabinet agreed at its meeting of 15 November(CM(72) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 3) that it would review this week theposition on the refusal of certain local authorities to implement theHousing Finance Act 1972.ACTION TAKEN IN wales. I made default orders on 13 November against Merthyr TydfilCounty Borough Council and Bedwas and Machen Urban District Council,the only Welsh authorities refusing to implement the Act.    Under these orders the authorities are required to take specified action as follows:by 29 November, they should have instructed their officers to preparerent rebate schemes and proceed with the preparation of rent allowanceschemes:  and by 6 December, they should have served notices on their tenants of rent increases to take effect in early January.PROPOSED FUTURE ACTION3. Neither authority shows any sign of reversing its decision not to implement the Act.    Accordingly, in the light of the discussion which tookplace at the meeting of the Cabinet on 25 October (CM(72) 46th Conclusions,Minute 6), I propose to appoint (by Statutory Instrument) on 8 DecemberHousing Commissioners to discharge the functions of two authorities underParts I, II, V and VI of the Act, ie those relating to housing subsidies, rent rebates and allowances and fair rents.    I also intend to confer on theHousing Commissioners the functions of the local authorities under sections 111, 112(1) and 113 of the Housing Act 1957, that is the general management, regulation and control of their houses.4. This will take from the authorities the right to the management oftheir housing stock, including the allocation of tenancies, repair andmaintenance, rents and rebates.    It will not take away all of their functions in the housing field, and they will still be responsible for new house-building, the operation of the improvement grants scheme for privatedwellings, and local authority mortgages.1
5. Since the Housing Commissioners will need to give all tenants28 days&apos; notice of rent increases, there is no question of the increaseshaving to be paid by the tenants before Christmas.6. I propose to appoint the following:To Merthyr, Mr Geraint Walters, a retired civil servant whowas until recently Controller for Wales in the Department of the environment.    To Bedwas and Machen, Mr Edward Lewis, until recently Regional Secretary to the National Coal Board in Wales.They have both been approached and have agreed to take this on.PUBLICITY7. There is a great deal of public interest in this matter in Wales, andI propose, on the day I make the Housing Commissioner Order, to hold a press conference in Cardiff, at which I will make a statement on the lineof the draft annexed to this memorandum.8. I seek the agreement of the Cabinet to the action proposed inparagraphs 3 and 7 of this memorandum.P TWelsh Office27 November 19722
annex draft PRESS statement i have today made by Statutory Instrument orders appointing HousingCommissioners to discharge the following Housing functions in the nameof, and at the expense of Merthyr Tydfil C3C and Bedwas and Maehen UDC:-All functions under Part I, II, V and VI of the Housing Finance Act1972 - that is, those relating to Housing Subsidies, Rent Rebates and allowances, and Fair Rents.The General Management, Regulation and Control of the Councilshouses as provided in Sections 111, 112(1) and 113 of the Housing Act1957.I have appointed Mr Geraint Walters to be a Housing Commissioner forMerthyr Tydfil CBC and Mr Edward Lewis for Bedwas and Machen UDC.Their first task will be to ensure that the Housing Finance Act isimplemented, so that the many tenants who are entitled to rent rebateswill receive them, and the continuing loss to the ratepayers brought about by the refusal of these councils to move towards fair rents will be halted.The local authorities will from today cease to perform any of the functionsI have conferred upon the Housing Commissioners.    They will howevercontinue to be reponsible for their other housing functions such as newhouse-building, improvement grants, mortgages, clearance of unfit houses,general improvement areas, etc.I must make it clear that the Government has taken this step with great reluctance,    I will be ready to restore these functions to the two localauthorities whenever they are prepared to carry out the duties which parliament has thought it right to place upon them.3
