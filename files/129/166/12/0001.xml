DRAFT WHITE PAPERAREA EXCLUDED FROM PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER&apos;S INVESTIGATIONOBSERVATIONS BY THE GOVERNMENTParagraph 10 of Schedule 3 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act1967 covers the exclusion from investigation by the parliamentary commissioner of all personnel matters involving Crown servants inthe following terms:&quot;10.    Action taken in respect of appointments orremovals,  pay,  discipline,  superannuation or otherpersonnel matters,  in relation to:a. service in any of the Armed Forcesof the Crown,  including reserve and auxiliary and cadet forces;b. service in any office or employmentunder the Crown or under any authoritylisted in Schedule 2 to this Act;  orc. service in any office or employment,  orunder any contract for services,   inrespect of which power to take action orto determine or approve the action,in such matters  is vested in Her Majesty,any Minister of the Crown or any suchauthority as aforesaid.&quot;2. In their Second Report of the 1969-70 session published on11 February 1970 the Select Committee on the parliamentary commissioner for Administration examined this paragraph,  andconcluded that the jurisdiction of the important should be extended tocover personnel matters involving Crown servants.    In a white paper published in May 1971   (Cmnd 466l) the Government set out its observations on this report giving its reasons for believing that the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner shouldnot be extended in this way.3. In their First Report for the session  1971-72,  the SelectCommittee examined this matter again   in   the  light of the Governmentsobservations;  they remained unconvinced that there was adequatejustification for not extending the Parliamentary Commissioner&apos;sjurisdiction to the personnel matters covered by paragraph 10 of schedule 3 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act.4. The Select Committee&apos; s main argument for  including thesepersonnel matters within the Parliamentary Commissioner*s scopeis that Members of Parliament already have wide rights to raisewith Ministers personnel matters relating to Crown servants.    Theyargue that the Parliamentary Commissioner provides the means toenable them to discharge their functions more effectively andthere is no good reason why his services should be denied them inRESTRICTED-1-
this particular area.    The Select Committee recognise that the accepted procedures for dealing with the grievances of crown servants are normally followed with the utmost (are and fairness.But they are not prepared to accept that this in itself is adequatereason for not extending the purview of the Parliamentary Commissioner.5. The Government have once again given careful  considerationto the Select Committee&apos;s arguments which are similar to those they expressed previously.    The Parliamentary Commissioner  was set   upto invest igate on behalf of Members of Parliament  complaints by private eitizens that thev had suffered from maladministration bya Government  department.    The Government does not consider  itwould be consistent with this purpose to extend the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner to the relations between theCrown as employer and  its employees or between the Crown  and other-persons with whom it enters  into business contracts.6. Since the Government last considered this matter,  thepassing of the Industrial Relations Act  (which applies generally to Crown employment) has  introduced an important new  factor.This Act   sets out the principles of industrial relations policyand the Code of Practice  issued under it gives guidance as to how these principles are to be applied.    The policy underlying the Act  is that as a general rule the grievances of individualworkers should be remedied by properly instituted procedures(including independent arbitration if necessary within employers1establishments),  based on agreement between the employer andthe employees  representatives.    Additional remedies are providedwhen there are special reasons as in the case of unfair dismissalor the infringement of trade union rights;  in these circumstancesan employee may present a complaint to an independent industrialtribunal.    It would be inconsistent with this policy to provideyet another remedy for Crown servants by extending the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner.    Moreover,  there is no obligation on a complainant to exhaust the established internalprocedures for providing redress before asking his Member ofParliament to submit his complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner.Although  it  is within the power of the Parliamentary commissioner to reject  a case where alternative redress is available,  he isunder no obligation to do so.    If the Parliamentary Commissioneris used instead of, rather than as a check on,  establishedinternal procedures,  confidence in those procedures will  sufferand the morale of management will be adversely affected.7. The Staff Side of the National Whitley Council  havereaffirmed to the  Government their strong opposition to includingpersonnel matters within the scope of investigat ions conducted by the Parliamentary Commissioner.    They consider that grievanceswhich may arise on personnel matters should be resolved withinthe procedures which already exist, and which can be improvedif that is shown to be necessary,  for dealing with grievances.8. The Armed Forces are not within the scope of the industrial relations Act, but they have their own statutory procedure forthe redress of individual complaints which is laid down in theService Discipline Act.    This provides for the impartial  considerationof grievances at the highest level.    The Government does notconsider that the additional remedy of appeal to the parliamentary commissioner would be consistent with this system.
9. The Select Committee suggested that the case for allowing the Parliamentary Commissioner to examine complaints from crown servants relating to personnel matters has special force inrelation to superannuation questions,  where the relationship between employer and employee no longer existed.    But superannuationquestions are not distinct from other conditions of service.Most of the issues which affect what a pensioner receives after his retirement are settled during his working career either bythe exercise of options open to him or in accordance with conditions of service which in the case of civil servants are agreed with the Staff Side and on which an opportunity to appealunder the recognised grievance procedures is open to him at thetime as with other conditions of service.    Similar considerations apply to the Armed Forces,  and any individual with a grievancemay have it dealt with under the statutory procedure for redress.10.        The Government therefore remains of the opinion that the accepted internal procedures, which ensure the fullest possibleconsideration of individual complaints, make ample provision forredress without any extension of the jurisdiction of theParliamentary Commissioner to cover personnel matters involvingCrown servants.
