SELECT COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYGOVERNMENT OBSERVATIONS ON FIRST AND FOURTH REPORTSSESSION 1971-72PROCEDURE1. In their First and Fourth Reports, Session 1971-72, the Select Committeeon Science and Technology put forward a wide-ranging series of recommenda-tions on Government research and development policy. These recommendations were considered by the Government before it reached the conclusions set outin the &quot;Framework for Research and Development&quot; White Paper (Cmnd. 5046)in July 1972. Cmnd. 5046 also commented on those recommendations of theSelect Committee which were directly relevant to the decisions which itannounced. Since then, the Lord Privy Seal has given further oral evidence tothe Select Committee. This White Paper sets out the Governments observations on the recommendations in the Select Committee&apos;s First and Fourth Reports.(The appendix lists all the recommendations made in the two Reports togetherwith the paragraphs of this White Paper commenting on them.) The recom-mendations in the Second and Third Reports, which cover areas for which theDepartment of Trade and Industry is responsible, will be dealt with in anotherWhite Paper.2. Recommendation 1 in the Select Committee&apos;s First Report related tothe Green Paper &quot;A Framework for Government Research and Development&quot;(Cmnd. 4814). The Committee suggested that, as a general rule, the consultativenature of the recommendations contained in a Green Paper should not be impaired and public discussions should not be prejudiced by Governmentstatements of policy in advance. They also suggested that future reviews ofGovernment research and development should include the taking of evidence from all interested parties and that as much of that evidence as possible shouldbe published.3. The Government does not believe that hard and fast rules should belaid down on the content of Green Papers. In the case of Cmnd. 4814, it believes that it was right to make clear at the outset that there were certain general principles which the Government endorsed. In particular it endorsed certaincommon points which emerged from both Sir Frederick Dainton&apos;s and LordRothschikTs reports. The main thesis of Sir Frederick Dainton&apos;s report wasthat the Research Councils should remain with the Department of education and Science, rather than be allocated to different executive Departments; andLord Rothschild in his Report implicitly accepted that the Research Councilswould remain with the Department of Education and Science. The government therefore felt it right to remove immediately any uncertainty about the futurelocation of the Research Councils by stating in the Green Paper that the research Councils should be preserved under the sponsorship of the Departmentof Education and Science. The Governments conclusion, also in the green paper, that a body of authoritative advice should continue to be available tothe Secretary of State for Education and Science, followed naturally fromthis. The other main point, which Lord Rothschild&apos;s and Sir Frederick Dainton&apos;sReports both advocated, was that more research and development should belone on a commissioned basis. Lord RothschiWs Report discussed at length
the organisational machinery necessary to accomplish this, crystallised in the concept of the customer-contractor principle. While leaving the details open for discussion and these details are, of course, of great importance-theGovernment endorsed the customer-contractor principle as a sound generalguideline for organising commissioned research and development. This earlyendorsement of these very general points enabled the widespread discussions and consultations on the more detailed arrangements to take place in full knowledge of the Governmenfs general approach.4. So far as any future reviews of Government research and developmentare concerned, the Government does not believe that it would be right toattempt to determine in advance the precise form which such reviews might take. This can only be decided according to the circumstances of the individual case.MINISTER FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT5. The main proposal in the Select Committee&apos;s reports is that a Ministerfor Research and Development should be appointed, together with a statutoryCouncil for Science and Technology of which he should be the Chairman. Sixrecommendations (numbers 2, 4, 5, 6, 13 and 15) of the First Report were directed towards this; and the Fourth Report, after discussing it at length,recommended in paragraph 57 that the proposed Minister for Research andDevelopment should have the following duties and responsibilities:(i) To examine and approve all Government research and developmentincluding defence and to make recommendations to the Cabinet onthe relative priorities to be given to the research and development programmes proposed by different departments.(ii) To co-ordinate departmental programmes and to establish the criteria for decisions on priorities particularly in relation to the european economic Community.(iii) To be Chairman of the Council for Science and Technology in itsrole as an independent voice advising on national priorities.(iv) To account to the Cabinet and Parliament for the work of the Govern-ment Chief Scientific Adviser.(v) To maintain links between his Secretariat and Chief Scientist organisa-tions in the Departments.6. These recommendations were linked closely in the Select Committee&apos;sReports with questions about national objectives, assessment of priorities, and central co-ordination of departmental research and development programmes.Thus, paragraph 20 of the Fourth Report concludes: &quot;. . . Such decisions [onpriorities for research and development programmes] inevitably involve theexercise of some central co-ordinating authority. In industry this exists. InGovernment today it does not.&quot; Similarly, paragraph 26 states that&quot;.. . unless there is one Minister responsible to Parliament who would make recommenda-tions to the Cabinet on the range, structure and balance of the Governmenfsresearch and development as a whole there can be no proper scrutiny of nationalobjectives and how they should be defined.&quot;
7. The Government appreciates the Select Committee&apos;s concern withthese matters and recognises their importance, but does not accept that thereshould be a Minister for Research and Development. The basis for this decision is the principle of functional organisation. As explained in the White Paper on&quot;The Reorganisation of Central Government&quot; (Cmnd. 4506), the governments view is that Departments should be organised by reference to the tasks to bedone and the objectives to be met. Each department should be a complete andcoherent organisation for dealing with its executive tasks and should have allthe facilities necessary for this, including the right and means to commission the research and development it needs to fulfil its tasks. But with the rightgoes also the responsibility. Each Department must be accountable for the effective use of the Vote it receives for the pursuit of its tasks. The Minister incharge of a Department is thus fully accountable for ensuring that his policyobjectives are properly backed by all necessary facilities, including research and development. But he could not carry this responsibility if the authorityfor approval of part of these facilities was placed elsewhere, with an independentMinister possessing the power to adjudicate between departmental research and development programmes.8. This can be illustrated by considering how the proposed Minister for research and Development would perform this part of his duties in practice.To take an arbitrary example, suppose that he were to conclude that a differentpriority ought to be given to, say, road research. Would he then require thatthe priority be changed by the transfer of a given financial sum from:(a) another part of the total road programme;(b) other research and development activities within the same Department;or(c) research and development activities in other Departments ?The first of these requires a judgement on questions going beyond research anddevelopment as such, i.e. on the optimal allocation of all resources deployedon the road programme, which is a direct responsibility of the Secretary ofState for the Environment. Furthermore, since there is nothing special about this example, the Minister for Research and Development would, in coveringall departmental research and development, inevitably become involved in thetotal activities of all executive Departments. Possibilities (b) and (c) may appearto stay within the orbit of research and development programmes, but in factdo not. A transfer of funds from one such programme to another would alter the balance of each programme in relation to all the activities which make upthe total effort of a Department on a particular task. In this case also, thedepartmental Minister would lose control over and responsibility for the bestdistribution of the resources available to him to meet his policy objectives. Anadditional point about (c) is that it would require, or at least imply, the existenceof an overall Government budget for research and development. government expenditure is not structured in this way, nor should it be, according to theprinciple of functional responsibility.9. It is for these reasons that the Government regards the primary dutyrecommended for the proposed Minister as unworkable. Nevertheless, there are other possibilities in the proposal which the Government has considered.In particular:
(a) Could the Minister, as &quot;the strong, independent scientific voice in formulating policy decisions at a high level&quot; which the Select Committee(para. 36, First Report) wishes to see, have a justifiable role in cabinet as an advocate for Governmental research and development?(b) Are the executive Departments not sufficiently good at perceiving theirown research and development needs, and in giving due weight to themwhen allocating resources to their functional tasks? Is an extra-depart-mental Minister therefore needed to reinforce the scientific capabilityin Departments ?(c) Are any areas of nationally important research and development likelyto be neglected without such a Minister to bring them to the Governmenfsattention at a high level?(d) Should there be overall national objectives for research and development which would be the proper responsibility of a Minister for research and Development, distinct from the various national objectives relatingto defence, health, economic improvement and so on, the pursuit ofwhich requires research and development ?10. Questions (a) and (b) are clearly important, but they call for a centralfunction of an advisory nature, not an executive one. They do not provide arole for a Minister since the performance of this central function must in all circumstances leave the final responsibility, as now, with the departmental ministers who implement the Governmenfs policies, even when their research and development programmes are influenced by the considerations of centralGovernment. The means for providing this independent, central advisoryfunction exists through the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government, whoadvises the Cabinet. The question of the ability of Departments to perceive theimportance of research and development to their work and to give it the rightpriority is, of course, crucial to the arrangements announced in Cmnd. 5046.This is why the Government attached so much importance to building upstrong Chief Scientist organisations in Departments. They will have primary responsibility for ensuring that their Departments make full and effective useof research and development; and at the same time the Chief Scientific adviser to the Government is in a position to compare and advise on the generalresearch activities of Departments.11. As regards question (c) above, the Government fully accepts theimportance of looking after areas of research and development which do not fallclearly within the ambit of one Department. This is one of the reasons for the government&apos;s central co-ordinating machinery. In this respect the Governmentis in a different position from industry, which does not have a central co-ordination -ing machinery since individual firms generally prefer not to share their research and development projects with their competitors. So far as Government isconcerned, the Lord Privy Seal has special responsibility at Ministerial level forco-ordination of policy on research and development issues. The Chief scientific adviser to the Government, in addition to his advisory duties, is responsiblefor ensuring that there is adequate co-operation and co-ordination between departments. He carries out these functions both through his chairmanshipand membership of various committees, inside and outside Government, and through his contacts with the general scientific community in this country and
abroad. Inside Government the co-ordination is done through the normalCabinet Office arrangements. This machinery provides means for bringingisseus to the attention of the Cabinet, as well as for providing advice on request;for submitting independent views as well as for collating and presenting the combined views of Departments; and for preparing the ground for major policy decisions by clarifying the issues, balancing departmental interests,advising on priorities, and presenting the options, as well as for processing the consequential decisions and on-going work which result from major policy decisions.12. The question, in (d) above, of national objectives in relation to research and development, was raised as an important issue by the Select Committee.If there were major national objectives for research and development as such,constituting a distinct function of Government, a separate Vote for a minister in charge of this function would be desirable. The Select Committee does not go as far as this, however, since it states in its Fourth Report that the Voterecommended in its First Report would relate only to the Ministers need for asecretariat. In the field of pure research, there is, of course, the objective toimprove natural knowledge, which is recognised on a national scale through thefinancial support given by the Government to the Royal Societies, the research councils, the Universities and other Institutions, for basic research in high-energy physics, radio-astronomy, molecular biology, oceanography and otherscientific subjects. Here, where the performance of the research itself can beregarded as a national objective, a separate budget is provided and the Secretaryof State for Education and Science, assisted by the Advisory Board for the research Councils, is in a position to take the lead in the Governments formu-lation of policy decisions in this field.13. Outside pure research, however, research and development is a means to an end and, as such, serves more general national objectives. The determina-tion of what forensic research, for example, is done and how much is spent on it is part of the general policy for law and order, not science policy; and it isfor the Home Secretary to decide what proportion of his resources should go into forensic research to support this policy. There are no separate nationalobjectives for forensic research. Again, the national objectives for defence research and development are inseparable from the general national objectives for defence as a whole; and similarly for all other Government activities. Thefact that some applied research and development projects are, at any given pointof time, still at the stage of speculative ventures in no way alters this argument.For instance, in respect of national objectives the programme of nuclear fusionresearch at the Culham Laboratory is no way different from that for theconstruction of a more conventional power station; in both cases the objective is the assurance of the country&apos;s future energy supplies.14. It follows that the priorities given to particular programmes of applied research and development in support of national objectives must depend, firston the priorities given to these objectives themselves, the determination ofwhich in major cases is a matter for Government as a whole, and secondly onthe optimization of the resources available for an objective, which is a matter for the departmental Minister within whose area it falls. Thus the advisory and decision-making machinery for determining priorities, on both a national and departmental basis, fully exists, and there is ample evidence of its functioning
in the stream of policies made and decisions taken in areas of a largely scientificor technical nature. Both positive decisions, such as that to go forward as amatter of priority with the advanced passenger train or the fast breeder reactor,and negative decisions, such as that to withdraw from the European launcher development Organisation, or to abandon the Ipswich desalting project, havebeen made deliberately and knowingly, through this machinery, after detailed study which has taken account of the scientific and technological factors as wellas the other factors, economic, social, industrial and political, which affectthe issues.15. The Select Committee, in its Fourth Report, referred to the proposedMinisters roles in relation to the European Economic Community. Entry ofthe United Kingdom into the Community will lead to enhanced opportunities for collaboration. The Government welcomes this, but does not see it as creating a need for a Minister for Research and Development, because the principlesdiscussed above will remain unaffected by the new situation. In the field of purescience, European collaboration exists on a wide scale at present, between countries both inside and outside the Community, and is expected to continue and develop in the future. The United Kingdom already participates extensivelyin these collaborative projects and has for example recently announced itsagreement to participate in the European Molecular Biology project, and isnegotiating with the French and Germans with a view to participating in theHigh Flux Beam Reactor project at Grenoble.16. In the fields of applied research and development, whether domestic orinternational, the objectives lie outside the research and development itself andfall within other areas of policy-making; for example, policy for industrialdevelopment, or for the improvement of the environment. The United Kingdomalready has many collaborative agreements with various European partnerson technological projects, is working actively with its partners in the setting upof further projects, and has found its machinery fully capable of dealingsatisfactorily with these projects. European space policy is often quoted as an example against this. The difficulties here are not due to any inability to formu-late national priorities, but to the fact that different countries have differentpriorities.17. The Commission of the European Community has recently proposed a comprehensive Community policy on scientific research and technological development. This is under active study at the present time by the members ofthe Community. The United Kingdom is participating in the discussions, butit is too early yet to anticipate what the outcome will be. An important feature of the Commission^ proposals is the emphasis they place on the direction of research and development towards social needs, for example public health,industrial safety, transport, energy supply, communications, and improvementof the environment. This is fully in accord with the United Kingdom&apos;s arrange-ments for Government research and development, based on the functionalapproach, for which the Lord Privy Seal has a co-ordinating responsibility. Inmatters affecting the Community this responsibility is discharged in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
COUNCIL FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY18. Without a Minister for Research and Development the case for anindependent statutory Council for Science and Technology to support himformally disappears. The Government has nevertheless considered the merits of the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations for a Council, made in its first and Fourth Reports, in terms of the possible wider value of such a body tothe Government generally. While it is undoubtedly true that scientific advisory councils have made important contributions in the past, particularly in fieldswhere Departments were then scientifically not well equipped, the case for themtoday is becoming weaker as the Departments grow increasingly strong and self-reliant in their own scientific activities. Experience shows that the most effective contributions from independent scientific advisory bodies have usuallycome, not from the ordinary regular proceedings of a standing committee, but from short and intense efforts made by temporarily assembled groups called into deal with particular tasks. Sometimes such groups have been formed underthe auspices of a standing Council, but their successes do not thereby establish the case for such a Council itself; and the more recent trend, which the Govern-ment approves, is to set up such task forces directly, rather than through an intermediate standing Council.19. The Government has, therefore, decided not to set up such a Council.As indicated in Cmnd. 5046, however, the Secretary of State for education and Science is replacing the existing Council for Scientific Policy with a newAdvisory Board for the Research Councils. Other departmental Ministers willcontinue to seek independent advice as and when they require it. The Secretaryof State for Defence, for example, receives through the Defence ScientificAdvisory Council and similar bodies the advice of eminent scientists of independent standing. Where necessary, advice will additionally be sought fromgroups specially assembled for particular studies, such as the task force onmobility of scientific manpower announced in Cmnd. 5046.STANDARD DEFINITIONS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT20. The Select Committee recommended in their First Report (recom-mendation 7) that a study should be commissioned with a view to drawing upstandard definitions for research and development, and that there should be close collaboration with international standard-making bodies such as theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (recom-mendation 8).21. The Government attaches considerable importance to the questionof obtaining agreed definitions of research and development in relation to allthe areas with which, as maker and executor of policy, it may have to deal.Broadly speaking, therefore, it is primarily interested in definitions and usageshaving their chief application though not their only one in relation to the intentions and expectations of the people or authorities responsible for finding the funds for research and development work. The United Kingdom played a significant part in the international effort conducted through OECD whichachieved agreement on standard definitions of research and development foruse in collecting information about this topic. The United Kingdom adheres tothese definitions in all surveys of expenditure on research and development,
and the data available from such surveys are therefore fully in line with therequirements in this respect for international statistical comparisons. TheGovernment intends to continue to play a full part in those activities of OECDand other international organisations which are directed towards the setting of standards, and to contribute similarly to any developments in the setting of standards within the European Community.22. Over and beyond this, there is a need for a vocabulary capable ofdistinguishing between, on the one hand, Government funding of research anddevelopment work which is directly in support of such Government functions as defence or health, and, on the other hand, Government funding of research and development provided for other purposes, such as the general maintenanceof a capability of scientific excellence in particular fields.23. For all these reasons the Government considers that the cause ofclarity is best served by continuing the policy of international co-operation insetting standards, and that a specific national enquiry would hinder rather thanhelp the process. In this connection, the Government believes that some of thedifficulties which appeared during the debate on the Green Paper (Cmnd. 4814)and the enquiries of the Select Committee arose from a confusion between needs.The emphasis in the Governments requirements for definitions and vocabularyhas been stressed above. However, there is a quite separate requirement amongscientists for a description of research and development activities from thepoint of view of the intrinsic nature of any given piece of research rather than from the viewpoint of the non-scientific end to which it may be directed or maycontribute. It is the Governments understanding that a vocabulary with this latter function exists and is in normal use in the scientific community at large.The Government suggests that it is likely that problems arose largely becauseof the unspoken differences between the frames of reference of the differentcontributors to the debate.RECOMMENDATIONS AFFECTING THE RESEARCH COUNCILS24. The Select Committee said (recommendation 14) that the Governmentshould state clearly what the role of the Research Councils should be in thewhole field of research and development. In Cmnd. 5046 (paragraph 42) thepurpose of the research which is supported through the five Research councils and the University Grants Committee is clearly stated: to develop the scienceas such, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research and to support higher education. The Department of Education and Science remains the sponsor ofthe five Research Councils, and their links with the universities are unaltered.What Cmd. 5046 has done is to provide a framework for the closer partnership between the Councils and customer Departments which is required. Apart fromthe decision to abolish the Nature Conservancy Committee of the NaturalEnvironment Research Council and to establish a new Nature ConservancyCouncil the Government has maintained the objectives of the Councils&apos; RoyalCharters. Some modification to the Charters will be required to enable the council&apos;s to appoint additional members in line with paragraph 47 of Cmnd.5046.25. Recommendation 9 in the Select Committee&apos;s First Report stated that membership of the Research Councils should be reconstituted to ensure a wider
representation of Government Departments, industry, trade unions, the universities and the professional staff associations.26. As has been announced in Cmnd. 5046, the Government has acceptedthe Select Committee&apos;s recommendation by deciding that in future departments with a substantial interest in the work of a Research Council should have fullmembers and not, as is the usual pattern at present, assessors. The Secretary ofState for Education and Science will also in future agree the appointment of the chairmen and of the members appointed by the Secretary of State with thoseMinisterial colleagues principally concerned, in addition to consulting as necessary the President of the Royal Society. It is certainly the Government^wish that the membership of the Councils should reflect as wide a range aspossible of different backgrounds and experience. Appointments will continueto be made, however, on the basis of the contribution which the member can make as an individual, rather than as a representative of any sectional interest,to the work of the Council in framing and judging policy and taking collective responsibility for its implementation. The Government will bear in mind the categories of person recommended by the Select Committee for the abovepurpose.27. Recommendations 11 and 17 in the Select Committee&apos;s First Reportrelated to the re-allocation of responsibilities for programmes of researchbetween Departments and Research Councils.28. The Government announced in Cmnd. 5046 its decision that certainfunds would be transferred, over a three-year period, from the science budget of the Department of Education and Science to the Votes of customer Depart-ments, to help meet their needs for commissioned research. These funds will bebrought within the scope of the customer/contractor principle. The government made it clear that no transfers would be made until all customer departments had established their central scientific staffs. The Government emphasised in cmnd. 5046 (paragraph 51) that no conditions would be placed on the use ofthe money transferred to customer Departments, but that the expectation wasthat it would be spent to commission applied research work from the research councils. The total amounts involved in the transfers represent the Govern-menfs judgment on the balance which has to be maintained between the needsof Departments for commissioned research on the one hand, and the needs ofthe Research Councils on the other hand, in fulfilling their Charter responsi-bilities. The translation of the broadly expressed needs of the customerDepartments into specific research programmes is being worked out in partner-ship with the Research Councils and will become fully operative over the next three years. Although the Select Committee recommended that no transfershould be made until this detailed work had been completed, the government considered it essential to announce its general intentions in order to avoid afurther period of prolonged uncertainty about the future funding of the research councils. As stated in Cmnd. 5046, partnership and co-operation between departments and the Research Councils are an essential feature of the Govern-ment&apos;s approach, which is also designed to ensure that the support which the research Councils give to the universities should continue. Like the SelectCommittee the Government attach great importance to the continuance ofthis support.
29. The Government believes that the establishment of the advisory board for the Research Councils to take the place of the Council for scientific policy will do much to promote and enhance such partnership and co-operation.For the first time the customer Departments will be represented at meetings ofthe body which will advise the Secretary of State for Education and Science onthe allocation of her Department^ science budget among the Research councils and other bodies. The close understanding which should be fostered by theappointment of departmental members to the Research Councils will be strengthened by the inclusion in the membership of the Advisory Board of senior scientists from Departments with a major interest in the work of the research Councils, as well as distinguished independent members and theChairman or Secretary of each of the five Research Councils. The presence of arepresentative of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government on the advisory board will also ensure that its work is closely related to the total scientificeffort of Government.30. The Select Committee recommended (recommendation 12) that thebudget of each Research Council should be increased to permit an improvedheadquarters staff, able to provide guidance and information to users and closercontrol of programmes.31. The Management Services Division of the Civil Service Department,in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, is already workingwith the Research Councils on a review of their existing headquartersorganisation. Account will be taken in this review of the Select Committee&apos;views, as well as the views expressed by Lord Rothschild in his report published as part of Cmnd. 4814.32. The Select Committee also recommended (recommendation 13) thatthe work of each Research Council should be examined every five years and aquinquennial report made to Parliament.33. The Council for Scientific Policy established the practice of surveyingthe work of the Research Councils on a rolling five-year basis, and it is expectedthat the Advisory Board for the Research Councils will continue this practice.The annual public expenditure White Paper presented to Parliament is also on a five-year basis. In addition each Research Council presents an annual report to Parliament; as suggested by the Select Committee (recommendation10) the Research Councils have already begun to re-examine the form of theseannual reports with a view to expanding the information on how their financial resources have been allocated and are being spent. The Government considersthat these arrangements meet the main point of the Select Committee&apos;recommendation.34. The Government has noted the Select Committee&apos;s special interest inthe investigation of potential hazards to life and health (recommendation 11)and this subject will receive attention. Considerable work is being done in this field already by individual Departments and Research Councils and on acollaborative basis. For instance, a division of the Department of Health and social Security is concerned with co-ordinating action between Departments-especially the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food-and research councils on the health aspects of such matters as food additives, pesticides and chemical contamination of the environment. Part of the Department of Health
and Social Security&apos;s own research programme is directed specifically towardsthe risks associated with equipment and material used in the health service.Within the Department of Employments field of responsibility for occupationalsafety and health particular attention is being paid to respiratory diseases,occupational exposure to substances suspected of being carcinogenic, thedanger from machinery and molten metal explosions in the foundry industryand to the problems arising from the physical and biological testing andmonitoring of factory environments. The Department of the Environmentundertake a large programme of research aimed at reducing hazards to life and health. The programme can be summarised under the main subject headings of road and vehicle safety, fire hazards, water pollution and quality, air pollutionand work in support of building regulations.IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FULTON REPORT35. The Select Committee&apos;s First Report recommended (recommendation16) that the Government should make faster progress in implementing theFulton Report, particularly as regards mobility in the scientific Civil Service.36. The most recent report of the Joint Committee of the National whitley council, &quot;The Shape of the Post-Fulton Civil Service&quot;, published in March1972, sets out the present position. As explained in this report, a system ofunified grading was introduced down to and including Under Secretary levelon 1 January 1972, so that at the highest level in Departments all the specialismsand disciplines will come together into an open structure. Below UnderSecretary level, the Committee concluded that the best way to pursue the objec-tive of improved flexibility and mobility in staff deployment would be throughthe improvement of arrangements for personnel management, while at thesame time seeking to simplify the structure by further development of the category and occupational group. This simplification began when the GeneralCategory (205,700 staff) was created in January 1971, and continued with theintroduction of the Science Category (16,800 staff) embracing the old ScientificOfficer, Experimental Officer and Scientific Assistant classes in September1971, and the formation of the Professional and Technology Group (37,800staff) in January 1972. These three categories already embrace over half of thenon-industrial Civil Service.37. With the introduction of these structures go new arrangements forcareer development. These include arrangements for staff movement designedto ensure that specialists not only acquire broad experience in their specialismbut also in the wider field of administration. Thus the most able will be equipped for the time when they may occupy top posts in the Civil Service. these arrangements provide for interchange between categories or groups throughtemporary or permanent &quot;lateral movement&quot; and through the creation of&quot;opportunity posts&quot; which can be filled by people of varying disciplines.38. In support of these arrangements for movement within the CivilService, programmes of administrative and management training for specialists(Cmnd. 5046 paragraph 36) have been set up which will enable scientists tobroaden their background and, for those who show aptitude, to experienceadministrative work and play a more effective part in policy making. these programmes have been universally welcomed and first indications demonstrate that they are being strongly supported.
39. As mentioned earlier the Government also announced in Cmnd. 5046the setting up of a small high-level task force to work out a scheme for greaterinterchange of scientific talent between the Civil Service on the one hand andthe Research Councils, universities and industry on the other. The task force has started work and plans to produce its first report by the end of December.DEPARTMENTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES40. The Select Committee recommended in its First Report (recommenda-tion 3) that Government Departments should formulate their research anddevelopment programmes on a rolling five-year basis. The Committee elaboratedthis recommendation in its Fourth Report.41. As already noted, under the Public Expenditure Survey procedures all government expenditure programmes are reviewed on a rolling five-year basis;and one of the objectives of the central scientific organisations in deparment is to strengthen forward planning procedures. But flexibility is also required and research and development programmes often need to be adapted in thelight of changing circumstances. In the Government^ view, therefore, it wouldbe wrong to attempt to impose a rigid pattern in respect of all departmentalresearch and development programmes.42. In Cmnd. 5046 the Government announced its agreement with theSelect Committee that at present neither Parliament nor the public is givensufficient information about departmental research and development pro-grammes. Further consideration has now been given to the way in which this deficiency can be remedied.43. It is the Governments intention that all Departments with research and development activities should report annually on these activities. Reportswill include as far as possible the information listed by the Select Committeein its First Report (recommendation 18). In most cases Departments will listtheir major research and development projects, or aggregates of minor ones,but there will be instances where, for example, considerations of national security and commercial confidentiality will limit the amount of detail whichcan be given. The degree of detail will naturally vary between projects, and it isconsidered that a comprehensive review of a Department^ continuing activity in the research and development field can best be built up by highlightingdifferent programmes at different times. Reports will provide the most up-to-date figures of out-turn, as well as the latest available estimates of expenditure.44. The Select Committee recommended that Departments should reporton their machinery for maintaining a dialogue with potential users, &quot;customers&quot;and &quot;contractors&quot;. Cmnd. 5046 has already stressed the need to provide for continuing discussion and partnership between &quot;customers&quot; and &quot;contractors&quot;and with other interested sections of the community. In their first reportsDepartments will explain the machinery they will have set up, and will subse-quently report on the way in which it is working.45. Some Departments will publish separate reports on research anddevelopment. For others it will be more appropriate to include the information on research and development in reports and publications on their activitiesgenerally. In some cases there is a statutory requirement for Departments to
publish such reports. The inclusion of information about research and develop-ment in a comprehensive account of the way in which a Department hasdischarged its responsibilities is entirely in keeping with the functional approach to research and development as a support for departmental objectives.46.
