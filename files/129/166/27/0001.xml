secretDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 152 COPY NO     I ?12 December 1972CABINETBRITISH STEEL CORPORATION:  DEVELOPMENT STRATEGYTO THE EARLY 1980&apos;sMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and IndustryL, The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy has not yet reached a firm conclusion upon the proposals I made in my memorandum to the Committee, a copy of which I now attach, about the British steel corporation (BSC) development strategy for the next 10 years or so,2.        If there is to be a statement to the House before the Recess theCabinet will need to reach a final decision next week, and so that theCabinet can have a first look this week at the problems, thu Prime minister has asked me to circulate this note now.3. bsc&apos;s development strategy involves difficult regional employmentproblems.    Although the total redundancies vary little between thedifferent options, the impact of the bsc&apos;s plan is particularly severe on some areas (eg, parts of Wales).    Concentration on a few large works inorder to benefit from the economies of scale means closing down someexisting works in places where the jobs will be hard to replace.    For thisreason the Secretary of State for Wales has argued for a lower totalcapacity with modernisation of more of the existing works includingredevelopment of steelmaking at Shotton, and no new steelworks.    TheSecretary of State for Scotland supports the strategy generally but would prefer to delay the new steelworks on Tees side in order to make room forsome additional capacity in Scotland,4,        If employment considerations dictate a course leading to a less efficient industry there may be no way open to us in the European Coal andSteel Community of compensating the BSC.    An uncompetitive industry ina world market will not provide secure employment.    It is wrong to seethe problem as a choice between modernisation and saving jobs becausewithout a strategy aiming at world standards there could be an even greater loss of jobs as we lose out to our competitors.    It could also resullin our steel using industries relying upon imported steel or becomingthemselves uncompetitive.1SECl LSI
5. The bsc&apos;s proposals would increase its capacity to some 36 -38 million tonnes of liquid steel by the first half of the 1980s.    TheJapanese are building major new steelworks on coastal sites.    TheJapanese steel industry&apos;s capacity should have reached 140 million toncesby the mid-1970s.    The French are doing the same and will have boostedtheir industry from a current production of 24 million tonnes to a capacity of 35 million tonnes by the mid-1970s.6. If we are to have an efficient competitive steel industry as afoundation for economic growth, it needs to be modernised rapidly.     Ifit is to take advantage of profitable opportunities it must be suitablyexpanded.    An agreed strategy is essential as a basis for planning.    the bsc wishes to keep it flexible, but, even so, there are risks in proceedingquite as fast as the BSC would like.     The Chief Secretary, Treasury,prefers no commitment at all to the new Tees side steelworks at thepresent time.    The Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) recommendspostponing its start by 4 - 5 years.    I consider that we should endorse the strategy now but safeguard against the risks by keeping control ofthe timing of two major developments (the new steelworks proposed forTees side and the expansion of Port Talbot).    This we should do by establishing year by year whether the circumstances justify proceeding with the next stage in line with the general strategy which we shouldhave endorsed.7. These are the main issues which the Cabinet will need to bearin mind.    My colleagues on the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy are meeting the Chairman of the BSC on Friday 15th december to learn at first hand the thinking underlying the bsc&apos;s strategy.    Itshould then be possible for firm proposals to be put to the Cabinet early next week.P w department of Trade and Industry12 December 19722
BRITISH STEEL CORPORATION DEVELOPMENT STRATEGYTO THE EARLY EIGHTIESNOTE BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE &amp; industry i attach a memorandum by the Minister for Industry with which I amin full agreement.     Annexed to it are the British Steel  Corporationproposals and the draft of a statement which I propose making in thHouse.P.W.Department of Trade &amp; industry Victoria StreetLondon SW1H OET24 November  1972
The British Steel Corporation (BSC)  seeks our approval for itsproposed development strategy for the next 10 years or so,  outlinedand examined in Annex A.     In brief, the strategy is to concentratebulk steelmaking at  5 main existing plants -  Port Talbot,   Llanwern,Scunthorpe,  Lackenby and Ravenscraig - and to create a major newcomplex on South Teesside;  all the obsolescent steel making would eventually be phased out,  but there would be no firm commitment onthe timing of closures so as to retain some flexibility on the capacity to be achieved by any particular year.    Steel finishing and small scale production of special qualities would continue elsewhere,including Sheffield/Rotherham.2.      In my view bsc&apos;s plant strategy makes sense.     I support the aim off creating a thcrroughly modern industry as a springboard for further expansion.     But the pace of the proposed expansion in relation towhat I consider to be the likely growth of profitable demandintroduces the danger of a poor return on investment.     I believe wecan secure the advantages of the strategy by giving it our backing inprinciple but keeping control of the pace at which it is implemented.In particular, we can allow planning to go ahead for the expansionof Port Talbot and for the new complex,  but  reserve the right to delay the placing of contracts until it is clearer that the marketprospect justifies the expansion of capacity.    BSC says it will want to place the first contracts for these in 9-12 months&apos;  time but i recommend that we should not commit ourselves to that timing.A Lower Capacity Course3-      I have considered imposing a lower capacity course with no major new works.     It would greatly accentuate the difficulty of BSCstask in retaining the co-operation of the unions and making a success of this  industry.    It would mean greater reliance onobsolescent plant and would appear inconsistent with our growth aims in the context of the Community.     Politically it would be mostunattractive.4.      Another course would be to leave it uncertain whether therewould be a new works at all.    This would be intolerable for the BSC,and politically impossible for the Government.     If the final decisionwent against a new complex the BSC would have wished to pursue adifferent strategy in the rest of its system.    In effect we shouldhave all the disadvantages of imposing an altogether different and lower strategy than BSC judges right,  and would additionally create difficulties through the lack of clear guidance now what theindustry&apos;s ultimate shape would be.     BSC would have serious difficulties in planning investment at Teesside and other works, withcontinuing cost penalties.    We should also be under great and constant pressure from local interests hoping to avoid closures.Attitude of BSC5.      The bsc&apos;s proposals have the unanimous backing of their Board,including Sir David Barran and all the other non-executive members.If we impose a course that in effect rejects their strategy we shouldbe openly over-riding their commercial judgment.     It will be difficult/toBRITISH STEEL CORPORATION:  DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY TO THE EARLY EIGHTIESMemorandum by the Minister for Industry
to persuade them willingly to accept  even the reservations on timingI propose,  let alone actual  postponement of contracts if and whenthe time comes for that.Stockholding and raw materials investment6.      BSC has asked for reasonable freedom,  if necessary, to investin stockholding in the UK and European Coal  and Steel community countries and in raw materials production overseas.    I have told them that I shall want to look at each significant case.Presentation7.      There will be a great deal of concern about prospective closuresand loss of jobs.    In many cases,  the need for flexibility preventsany definite statement on timing,    but I think it right to make clearthat steel-making must be expected to close at the marginal worksby the early eighties.    There are however many positive points in theproposed strategy and in our approach to regional problems generally and we should stress these.    A draft statement is at Annex B.conclusion.      I invite the Committee to agree that we should approve theBSCs development strategy subject to an understanding that thereis no commitment to the timing of starts on the new complex atTeesside or the expansion of Port Talbot nor to    the time by whichthe full capacity proposed should be achieved;   to the line I amtaking: as indicated in paragranh 6;   and that a statement should- bemade to Parliament as at Annex B.T.B.Department of Trade &amp;* Industry24 November 1972
secret annex ABRITISH STEEL CORPORATION:    DEVELOPMENT STRATEGYBSCs Proposals1.      The main features are:i)    the development strategy should provide for a continuingplanning process with considerable flexibility avoidingpremature commitments to fixed tonnage capacity by fixeddates;ii)    the development  programme should have two main phases,the first taking capacity to a level of 33-35m tonnes ofliquid steel by the late 1970s and the second taking itto 36-38m tonnes by the first half of the 1980s (Table 1attached shows how these figures might be made up);iii) within those ranges, the five existing manor steelmakingplants, Port Talbot , Llanwern, Scunthorpe, Lackenby andRavenscraig,   should be brought up to their optimum capacity;iv)    a start should be made as soon as possible on a new steelcomplex on South Teesside,  with a view to bringing thefirst  phase of the complex into operation by  1979;v)    two new mini-steelworks should be built,  one of which shouldbe in Scotland;vi)    new arrangements and procedures in the labour and social policy fields should be established to handle the associated programme of closures.    There would be a netmanpower reduction of about 50,000 to some  180,000 by1982/83,  of which about 20,000 have already been announced:vii)    capital expenditure at  1972 Survey prices would averagea little over  300m a year,  with a peak in 1976-77 orsoon after./Background
background.      The Joint Steering Group  (JSG), whose conclusions I announced on 8 May   (OR Cols 909-923),   recommended that BSC should  examineits future development within a capacity range of  28-36m ingot tonsin 1980-8l.     During the summer, the BSC carried out a computer-based evaluation exercise to assess alternative courses within this range and the Board have decided their strategy  in the lightof it.3.      Having discarded various other options at an early stageBSC evaluated its chosen strategy by comparison with three others,covering in the main the upper half of the JSG range.     This is aflexible strategy with ranges of capacity for each of two phases,whose timing is uncertain.     Comparison with the JSG  range isfurther complicated because BSC now expects    a somewhat higheryield,  in terms of finished product from a given crude steelcapacity.    To supply the product requirement JSG  envisaged would now require crude steel capacity of only 279-35m tons instead ofthe 28-36m tons then calculated.    The following table shows the likely position in 1980/81  under bsc&apos;s strategy  (on centralassumptions about timing)  compared with the other main optionsstudied and the JSG  range on the same basis:Capacity in 1980-81  (m tonnes liquid steel)Chosen strategyTSr Option        Option        Option Lower      UpperA B C Path        Path27A-35 30.0 33.1 36.2 34 36Profitability4-      BSC examined the profitability of the options in terms of adiscounted Net Present Value (NPV) using a discount  rate of l6%  in money terms  (equivalent to the public sector Test Discount Rateof 10% in real terms).    On this basis,  the lower path    of the secret/chosen
chosen strategy is the most profitable course,  but the marginsbetween the NPV1s are small   (less than  100 million over the whole range).5.      Nevertheless,  the figures are sensitive to relatively smallvariations in the assumptions used.     BSC have assumed that theywill be able to increase margins and raise their market share toa degree that past experience and McKinsey&apos;s advice to DTI suggestsis too optimistic.     If they do not succeed,  there will be a heavy fallin profitability  (in NPV terms of perhaps up to  500 million)fromtheirbeing fully committed too early to a high level of capacity,  withthe incremental investment  (Port Talbot expansion and the Teessidecomplex)  showing a low or even negative return.    This is the justification for having reservations about the timing proposed byBSC; the problem is more one of phasing capacity to match profitabledemand than of the ultimate profitability of the projects if carried out at the right time.Flexibility6.      The flexibility emphasised by BSC lies mainly in the timing ofclosures.    The scope for this becomes limited by the end of thisdecade, when the new complex and expanded Port Talbot would becommissioned and,  under bsc&apos;s lower path,  most marginal plantswould have been closed  (except Tempieborough and Normanby Park,both making  &quot;square1  products).    Asked how it would meet a 3m tonneshortfall in profitable demand,  BSC has shown    that various steps would be open to it but there might be below-capacity working tothe extent of  lm tonnes.    The cost of this might be roughly offset by the lower running costs of the new plants.     This does notinvalidate the view that on bsc&apos;s timetable for expanding capacity,there would be a low return on the investment if the market failedto develop favourably. SECRET/Economic
Economic growth7.      All the courses evaluated by BSC allow for a total UK home market demand of 2 2m product tons  in  1980/81,   based on growth ofGDP by 3-2% a year on average over the decade 1971/72 to  1980/81(the differences between the courses relate to bsc&apos;s share of the uk market and the level of its exports).    However,   DTI estimatesindicate    that this tonnage of product sales would be consistent with a growth rate of  3^% over the decade,  and substained growthat 4% a year would  require only a marginally higher quantity.     TheBSCs capacity proposals could accommodate an even higher growth rate than 4% without imports reaching unacceptable levels and stillprovide substantial exports.     It  is not known how much steel asubstained 5% growth rate,  for example,  would require;  but ifimports rose to the extent indicated by past trends,  BSC postponedsome of the later planned closures,   and the private sectormaintained its present market share,  some 6m additional  producttons would be available in 1980/81 with exports still at BSCsassumed level.Capital expenditure.      BSC estimates that expenditure on fixed capital assets inthe UK would average  305-311m a year up to  1982/83  (March 1972prices).    Simultaneous development of the new complex and thePort Talbot expansion creates a peak rising to  408-435m in1976/77 and  348-38lm in 1977/78.     BSC has been asked to examineways of limiting expenditure in 1976/77 to a maximum of  360m.Employment9-      The total reduction in employment is not greatly affected bythe choice of course,  because most of the closures are the/inevitable
inevitable result of obsolescence.    The following table givesestimates of the net	regional	changes in BSC	manpower under	Options A and B and	the chosen	strategy up to	1980/81:-Chosen	StrategyRegion	Option A	Option B	Lower Path	Upper PathScotland	-8000	-8000	-7000	-7000North	-5000	-8000	-5000 *	-3000*North West	-4000	-4000	-4000	-4000Yorks/Humber	-2000	-2000	-2000	E Midlands	-2000	-2000	-9000	-9000W Midlands	-4000	-4000	-4000	-4000Wales	-21000	-16000	-18000	-17000Other Regions			-;h:-	-Si-ttTotal	-48000	-46OOO	-49000	-45000* Includes new works at TeessideLess than 500 net changeAll figures have been rounded to the nearest  100010.    The pace of the manpower rundown depends on the timing ofclosures,  on which BSC has taken no firm decisions and,  under theflexible strategy proposed,  does not expect to do  so yet.    Anillustrative breakdown used in the evaluation showed a peak year in 1975/76 with 10,000 net job losses and four other years with over 5,000.    These figures can be compared with an actual reductionof 20,000  in 1971/72.11. There are some communities specially dependent on steel,(Ebbw Vale, Consett, Glengarnock,  Cardiff, Corby and Shotton) whereexpected closures will pose especially acute social problems.    Apartfrom Ebbw Vale the timing of these closures is not yet firm,   andthey are not due until the second half   of this decade or the early&amp;0s.    BSC is itself anxious to help mitigate the consequences.The measures needed to provideSECRET/alternative
alternative .jobs in the worst affected places are being studied;Joint action with BSC and the TUC is under discussion.Location of new complex12.     BSC carried out a separate study of alternative locations forthe new complex (Teesside,  Hunterston, Shotton,  Port Talbot andLlanwern), which indicated that Teesside has important costadvantages.     A major factor was the possibility of using the existingcoiled plate mill there  (which would otherwise be closed)  as thebasis for a new hot strip mill,  with major savings of capital.     as now proposed, the new complex would operate with the existingLackenby plant as an integrated works reaching a total capacity of12tonnes in the first half of the lQ80&apos;s.13-    Interdepartmental studies of labour availability,   infrastructurecosts and planning and environmental considerations have revealedno reason to  prefer any site other than Teesside.Balance of Payments14.    BSC estimated the likely direct balance of payments effectof operating in line with the strategy in the year 1982/83, taking account of  (i)  raw material imports but not of imports of  steel(which would be higher under lower capacity options)  and  (ii) directsales abroad of steel and other products of which BSC assumes 82mproduct tons would be possible in 1982/83   (on the upper path;  thelower path allows for 6m product tons)  (4m product tons are exportednow).    In 1972/73  prices and at $2.60 to the   the net gain to thebalance of payments would be:- mLower Path196Upper Path241For comparison,  estimates for the 1lower capacity options considered,
but For the year 1980/81 were: mOption A 90Option B 100The benefits would be greater at a lower exchange rate.Stockholding and raw materials investment15.    BSC has asked for reasonable freedom,  if necessary,  to investin stockholding in the UK and ECSC countries and  in raw materialsproduction overseas,  arguing that both may become important to thesuccess of the strategy, the former to match the concentration ofproduction and to forestall foreign penetration of the UK market,and the latter to assure supplies at favourable prices.

ANNEX draft STATEMENT ON BSC STRATEGYV/ith permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on thedevelopment programme of the British Steel Corporation.2.     The Corporation has now completed the work referred to inthe Minister for Industry&apos;s statement to the House on 8 May on the detailed evaluation of alternative courses within the range of capacity recommended by the Joint Steering Group.    In the light ofthis work, I have reached agreement with the Corporation on ageneral strategy for development over the next 10 years.3.     The object of this strategy is to create an efficient,profitable, modern industry able to hold its own against worldcompetition and thus to provide assured future employment.    Worldconsumption of steel is expected to continue to grow strongly, andthe Corporation^ aim is to continue as the main supplier of ourdomestic requirements and also to take full advantage of opportunities for develop&amp;ng   profitable sales in overseas marketsk.     The Corporation will pursue two major lines of plant developmIt   plans to expand its present five main oxygen steelmaking sitesat Ravenscraig, Lackenby, Scunthorpe, Port Talbot and Llanwern -to their optimum production and earning capacity for the corporations system as a whole; and to develop a major new steelcomplex on the south bank of the Tees.    It will also build anelectric arc steelworks of about %m tons capacity in Scotland, andpossibly one elsewhere.   For the new works on Teesside two phasesare envisaged over the next decade or so,  each of about tonnesThis works will be adjacent to the existing Lackenby works andtheir combined capacity would ultimately exceed 12m tonnes.SECRET
5.     The plants so developed are expected eventually to providethe whole of the Corporations hulk steelmaking, apart from certainelectric arc furnaces.    In the Sheffield/Rotherham area capacity for stainless and alley steelmaking and rolling will be modernisedand expanded. For some years, steelmaking will also continue at other centres and, even when this is closed down, finishing plantsare likely to continue in a number of these centres.6.     The pace of development will depend on how the market developsin the next few years.    The strategy proposed aims at completingrapidly the transition to modern and efficient bulk steelmaking.There must of course be flexibility to adjust plans to changing circumstances and I&apos; have therefore agreed with the Corporation thatits capacity should he developed as a result of a continuous andflexible planning process, and that it should not attempt to formulate a rigid plan reaching many years ahead.   The course of demand, the changing efficiencies of particular plants, and the pattern of competition and prices will need to he continuouslyreassessed in reaching final decisions on new projects as wellas closures of older units.   Meanwhile: the Corporation will startplanning and design work at once for a major expansion at port Talbot, which would bring its crude steel capacity to6m tonnes,  and for the proposed new Teesside complex.7m     Capital expenditure \under this strategy is likely to averagearound  300m a year at March 1972 prices, compared with an actuallevel of  2i4-3m last year and a similar level in the current year on the same price basis) this expenditure will help&apos; to ensure a high continuing work load for the plant industry.
8.     This is a strategy of modernisation and expansion.   If theindustry and the employment it provides are to have an assuredfuture it must match the standards of its competitors with lowproduction costs combined with high standards of quality.Modernisation will inevitably involve loss of jobs;    the Governmentand the Corporation will work closely together to minimise thesocial consequences of this and to make positive plans for introducing new industry and job opportunities where they are needed.9.     British industry requires steel of high quality at competitiveprices to ensure its own contribution to growth at home,  to benefit from the Common Market opportunities and to participate in expanding world trade.   A modernised British steel industry will make a vital contribution to this.    This strategy will givemanagement and men, with their great tradition and skills, theopportunity to win for the industry its share of the expanding steelmarket and to assure Britain&apos;s continuing place among the majorsteel producers of Europe and the world.
