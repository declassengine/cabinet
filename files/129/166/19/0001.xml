DKAET STATEMENT ON COAL policy with permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement about the coal industry.There is real uncertainty about future prices of fuelsand an increasing awareness throughout the world of thedanger of a shortage of energy.       In the UK we must ensurethat our national energy assets are wisely used.     Lastyear, the National Coal Board lost  157m-   - They are nowlosing around  100 million a year.     Without Government aidthis would increase and could only be eliminated by massivecontraction.     We are not prepared to see such a rapid rundown.Its social and human consequences are totally unacceptable.For these reasons the coal industry must be given the opportunityto re-establish itself as the supplier of a competitive fuel -without being a permanent burden on the taxpayer.Against this background my hon Eriend, the Minister for industry, told the coal industry in August that before considering what help from public funds might be provided, theGovernment wished to know what the industry could do to help itself.As a result, the Board and the unions put to us joint proposalsfor action both &quot;by the industry and by the Government.We welcome this joint approach and the drive which the Board,with the full co-operation of the unions, are making to stimulatesales and marketing, improve quality, reduce overheads and increase productivity.    These efforts prosper and output permanshift has just reached a new record.     The unions have undertaken to co-operate with the Board in a review of the performance and prospects of pits.    The Board are also reviewing their land and property holdings to ensure that they are put to the most effective use and, if surplus to need, are sold.The industry1s joint proposals signify a determination toput their own house in order and the Government therefore have   .decided to take po\\rers to support the industry in this task.Eirst:     We intend to make a special regional grant tohelp the Board preserve jobs, especially in areas of high unemployment.   Nevertheless there will beredundancies and we therefore intend to introduceimprovements in redundancy terms, which will applyfrom to-day.   We shall see that every effort ismade to provide new jobs and we will make full useof the Industry Act and available European coal and steel community funds./Second:   ..
Second:     We intend to take powers to continue grants towardsthe Board&apos;s social costs, to contribute towards thecost to the Board of holding stocks and to coverlosses incurred as a result of special agreements with the electricity generating boards to burn extracoal.    At the same time we propose to follow thecommunity practice and give support to coking coal.Third:       We propose to write off the Board&apos;s accumulated deficit as at March ^973 and the amount by whichthe Board&apos;s capital assets are overvalued.     Thiswill considerably reduce the Board1s interest and depreciation charges.Legislation will he introduced for these purposes and aBill will be published today.   Until this becomes law any-necessary advances for purposes authorised under the Coal Actswill continue to be made from the National Loans Fund.These measures will deal with the Board&apos;s immediate financial problems and ease the consequences of any unavoidable contraction.But substantial assistance from public funds cannot be justified without effective and sustained efforts by all sides of the industryto improve its competitive position, contain costs and re-establish&apos;viability.    Indeed it is only through such efforts that theindustry will be able to take full advantage of the opportunities,not least in Europe, which the future holds.
