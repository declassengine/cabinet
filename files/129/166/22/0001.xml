ForewordThis White Paper has been prepared in the light of the recommendationsof the Seventh Report of the Select Committee on Expenditure (HC 450). TheGovernment have responded to the main recommendation in that report by providing a broad indicative assessment of the possible development of the economy over the medium term. They have also made a number of detailedchanges in the layout of the White Paper in response to other recommenda-tions of the Select Committee; these are explained in the Introduction to part II.2. The Government are publishing at the same time as the White Papera booklet entitled &quot;Public Expenditure White Papers: Handbook on Metho-dology&quot;. By giving an account of the methods used to compile the figuresfor the White Paper, and explaining the significance of the various terms which are used, this handbook (revised from time to time as necessary)will avoid burdening the annual White Papers with technical material.
Public Expenditure   General ReviewThis White Paper, the fourth in the annual series on public expenditure,is published as the United Kingdom is about to join the European Communi-ties. The years which it covers will be years of opportunity and transition.From now on we shall be taking an active and positive part in the developmentof the Communities&apos; political and economic institutions and policies.2. If our standing in Europe and the world is to be effective in all fields of policy we must ensure that our industry is strong, efficient, competitiveand enterprising; that inflation is controlled; and that the total calls on our resources for publicly financed services are kept within a rate of growth whichdoes not prejudice other objectives. We must at the same time ensure thatour society is a compassionate and fair one.3. These priorities are reflected in the programmes for public services setout in this White Paper. In addition to short term counter-cyclical measures to stimulate growth there is continuing provision for the modernisation ofindustry in the regions, and the expansion of employment. The programmesalso reflect the changing needs of our society. They include the improvementof the environment; more effective and sensitive organisation of care for those who need help, through the employment and health services and the personal social services; the expansion of education at nursery school age,with special regard to the needs of deprived areas; and more frequent reviews of social security benefits to protect the standard of living of pensioners and other recipients.4. The following Table 1.1 and chart A show how expenditure on all themain services is planned to develop between 1972-73 and 1976-77. It showsexpenditure growing at an annual average rateO), in cost terms and at constant prices, of 2.5 per cent.(2)5. Full figures for the intervening years (shown in Table 2A on page 00)show marked and intentional variations in the year to year pattern of expendi-ture. These reflect the fact that some of the most pressing needs are transient.The annual percentage increases(3) over the preceding year, at constant prices in cost terms, are estimated as follows:1972-73        1973-74 1974-75 1975-76        1976-776.2 5.3 1.7 1.8 1.40) Excluding investment grants.(2) Because counter-cyclical expenditure raises the level of expenditure in 1972-73,it may be thought appropriate to exclude it in measuring the increase to 1976-77 soas to show the underlying rate of increase. On this basis the increase would be, in cost terms at constant prices, 2.9 per cent.(3) Excluding investment grants. The figure for 1972-73 excludes refinance of export and shipbuilding credits, see paragraph 00, Notes on Methodology, page 00.

The factors which combine to produce this pattern are increased public expenditure to help reduce unemployment, and provision to meet nationalised industries&apos; deficits due to the policy of price restraint or other reasons.6. In the case of some of these expenditures, it is not possible to specifyprecise amounts to be spent year by year. In addition, unforeseen require-ments are bound to arise. In view of the potential size of some of these addi-tions, including the transient claims and those which may rise under theIndustry Aot, the Contingency reserve is higher than before throughout theperiod and particularly for the two years immediately ahead.7. Looking at the programmes in the second half of the period, whereexpansion occurs it reflects familiar and accepted considerations: increases in the number of people entitled to benefits or other social services; improve-ments in standards, within the limits of the resources which can be madeavailable; and in some cases new services of high social or economic priority.8. In considering the rates of growth for individual programmes, and the priorities between them, the Government has also had to ensure that the totaldemands on resources, phased over the period as above, would not leadto a risk of over-strain. This is a question of great importance for the manage-ment of the economy in the medium term. To judge it involves considerationof the potential growth of national resources and the development of other major claims outside the public sector, on varying sets of assumptions. the likely consequences of the public expenditure programmes for the rest ofthe economy can then be tested. The Government have explained to theSelect Committee on Expenditure that they use such an assessment in thisway; and the Committee asked in their Seventh Report that its essentialelements should be published. The Government have hitherto felt that on balance the disadvantages of publication outweigh the advantages. But inthe light of the Committee&apos;s strong recommendation they have decided itwould be right to make the experiment. Accordingly, Table 1.2 shows pos-sible patterns of resource use in the medium term.9. It will be clear from the form of the Table that an asssessment ofthis kind is not a forecast, still less a blue-print for the economy.10. The data shown are average annual changes in the main componentsof aggregate demand, in volume terms, between 1971 and 1977. They illus-trate the position by using two alternative growth rates. These are the sameas the National Economic Development Office are using in the review, corn-missioned by the Council, of the medium term projects of selected industries.Resource requirements for private investment and stock building will neces-sarily be affected by many unpredictable faotors, and two alternative possi-bilities are therefore shown for each of the two assumed rates of economic growth. In the case of the balance of payments there must similarly be considerable uncertainty about the resource implications of the need toensure a satisfactory outcome. However, in order to keep the alternativesshown down to a reasonable number variants based on different assumptions about the resource requirements of the balance of trade have not been included. The public expenditure projections are based on the programmes

set out in this White Paper, adjusted to the calendar year period 1971-77(&apos;).11. The difference between the sum of all these claims and the total output produced gives the quantity of resources that would be available forprivately financed consumption (2). If the lower of the two rates of growth ofthe economy is postulated (columns 1 and 2) and other claims were also asshown this item would be growing at a rate which should be acceptable bypast standards. Taking the higher alternative rate of growth of the economy(columns 3 and 4) the growth in resources shown as available for privatelyfinanced consumption would be larger than in the past, and should national output maintain this faster rate of growth the Government would be free to decide how best to allocate the extra resources between different claims,public and private, at the time.12. In last year&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd 4829), the growth of the pro-grammes at an average annual rate from 1971-72 to 1975-76 was also givenin terms of demand on resources. This measurement of cost allows account tobe taken of the fact that individual programmes have a varying impact on demand. The figure in last year&apos;s White Paper on this basis was 3.2 per cent.The corresponding figure for 1972-73 to 1976-77 is 3.0 per cent. But it wouldbe fairer in such a comparison to exclude counter-cyclical expenditure from1972-73. If this were done the corresponding figure would be 3.4 per cent.13. The changes made since Cmnd 4829 was published fall into two main categories. First there are policy changes, which can be grouped under main headings related to the objectives they serve; and second, estimating changesaffecting several programmes, which result from better information, more recent experience, and improved techniques. They are set out in Table 1.3below.CHANGES SINCE CMND 4829TABLE 1.3   million at 1972 Survey Prices	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76Counter-cyclical measures (additional to those in Cmnd 4829)......	277	176	12	.....\ -7Industrial and regional development policies..........	81	294	309	334Assistance to nationalised industries  ..	154	155	150	135Social security........	182	207	228	240Other policy changes......	281	261	155	127Estimating changes      ......	-251	162	403	422Total      ........	724	1,255	1,257	1,251				(^Certain items of public expenditure are directly related to the rate of economic growth, and it is therefore an over-simplification to show public expenditure as thesame whatever growth rate is assumed. However, in this exercise public expenditure is shown at the same level in both cases in order to illustrate the impact of a givenset of programmes on the resources available in the economy on alternative growthassumptions.(2)This differs from consumers&apos; expenditure as defined in the national income statistics:see paragraph 7, Notes on the Resources Table, page
14. The rest of this White Paper analyses the programmes in greater detail.
PART public Expenditure The Individual ProgrammesINTRODUCTIONChanges in format1. Apart from the new economic material referred to in paragraph 8of Part 1, a number of changes have been made, to some extent in response to suggestions made by the Expenditure Committee, in the form of someof the material presented in this White Paper. The more important of these are:(a) In Tables 2A and 2B the figures have now been extended backwardsin time, on a comparable price basis, to 1968-69, so that they presenta run of figures for four past years, the current year and four future years. This enables the reader to see immediately how future planscompare with past performance. Table 3.8, page , shows the sub-programme detail of the Tables in Part 2 for the years 1968-69 to1971-72. In the 1973 White Paper, by preserving the 1968-69 starting point, it should thus be possible to meet in full a recommendation by the Select Committee on expenditure &quot; that material should beprovided for comparison over a period of five past years.(b) In the commentaries on the individual programme tables whichcomprise Part 2 further effort has been made to expand the informa-tion about the policy objectives served by the expenditure pro-grammes under review. This is designed to meet a Select Committeerecommendation** that the commentaries should be expanded toprovide a better basis for an informed discussion of policy.A note on the figures2. Unless otherwise stated, the figures of public expenditure in this white paper are expressed at constant prices. There are however two constant priceseries which serve different purposes, each having its own significance and importance.3. The figures embodied in this White Paper are first produced on theassumption that prices throughout the period covered have been, and willremain, at the levels prevailing at the base date for the annual (1972) Survey.Such figures are said to be &quot;at Survey prices &quot;. They measure changes inthe amount of goods and services purchased by the public sector, and thusprovide an indication of the volume of services supplied (hence they aresometimes also referred to as &quot;in volume terms&quot;). They are of importance both because prospective changes in the scale of individual services are a naturalmatter of interest and because it is in terms of these figures that the pro-grammes are in practice controlled. Programmes have to be planned in termsof the underlying activities (numbers of staff employed; goods and servicespurchased), needed to give effect to Government policies. These therefore arethe figures displayed throughout the individual programme Tables in Part 2and discussed in the accompanying commentaries.4. However, the volume series implicitly assumes that, when prices rise,all prices rise equally. But in real life some prices move at different rates from* H.C.549, page xix, para. 62.** H.C.549, pages xiv-xv, paras. 44-46.
others, and the price changes which determine &apos;the cost of public expenditure as a whole tend on average to move faster than those which determine the costof private spending. Similarly, within the total of public expenditure, theprice changes which determine the cost of one programme move faster ormore slowly than those determining another, so that neither the past northe prospective relative cost of two programmes is adequately expressed bya series &quot;in volume terms&quot;. It is therefore necessary to adjust the pastout-turns and future estimates of expenditure to take account of relativechanges in prices (the &quot;relative price effect&quot;). The application of this factorproduces a series of figures &quot;in cost terms&quot; by means of which comparisonscan be made of the changing costs of different programmes and of the shareof total output which public expenditure as a whole will take in terms of theprice levels of each year. This is the series used in the Table 1.1 and Chart Ain Part 1. (It is this series &quot;in cost terms&quot; which forms the basis of the calculation of the rate of increase in the demand on real resources in para-graph 12 of Part 1.5. Tables 2A and 2B below, which show the analysis by main programme for each year from 1968-69 to 1976-77, provide the figures on the two pricebases.* The figures in Table 2A, like those in Table 1.1 of Part 1, are in cost terms (and include the relative price effect). The figures in Table 2B,like those in the succeeding individual programmes sections in Part 2, arein volume terms.*A more detailed account of the nature of the volume and cost series is given in chapter 4 of &quot;Public Expenditure White Papers: Handbook on Methodology&quot;(HMSO............)

The Defence Budget covers all expenditure by the Ministry of defence as well as expenditure by the Property Services Agency on Works for defence purposes. The objectives underlying this expenditure have been set out in successive Government Statements on Defence policy and were summarised inthe Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy 1970 (Cmnd 4521) as being:(a) to enable Britain to assume, within her resources, a proper share ofresponsibility for the preservation of peace and stability in the world,(b) to improve the capabilities of the Armed Forces, to overcome theirmanpower difficulties, and to enhance their role in the community,(c) to establish and maintain a sound financial basis on which thedevelop and carry out defence policy and plans in the years ahead.2. Britain&apos;s first strategic priority is the maintenance and improvement ofher military contribution to NATO and most of the combat units of theServices are accordingly committed to it. But Britain also retains obligationsfor the protection of her remaining territories overseas as well as certain othertreaty commitments, and is willing to play her part in countering threats tostability outside the NATO area.3. Cmnd 4521 summarised the main decisions taken in fulfilment of the objectives. These included a contribution to the proposed Five Power defence arrangements in South East Asia (which came into effect in November 1971),major equipment decisions affecting the Royal Navy and Royal Air Forceand improvements in the structure of the regular army and Territorial and army Volunteer Reserve.4. Subsequent statements have contained further decisions in pursuit ofour defence policy objectives. These include:(a) the adoption of the special &quot;European Defence ImprovementProgramme&quot; in which Britain is playing a full part (Cmnd 4592);(b) further improvements to the Armed Forces in the form ofaccelerated shipbuilding orders for the Royal Navy and additionalor accelerated purchases of aircraft for the Royal Air Force (Cmnd4829 and 4891). NATO, as the first strategic priority, was the mainbeneficiary of these improvements.5. Full details will be given in the 1973 Statement on Defence for theDefence Budget total for 1973-74 in the Table above, and the Statement willalso include an account of current plans for the Forces. The totals for the later years are, up to and including 1975-76, the figures published in Cmnd4829 adjusted to 1972 Survey prices and amended to reflect subsequentpolicy decisions and estimating changes.
6. The additions for policy changes compared with Cmnd 4829, revaluedare:(a) measures approved as part of the Government programme to stimulateemployment. These include the purchases of ships and aircraftreferred to in paragraph 4b;(b) additional costs arising out of decisions to site certain defenceestablishments in one place rather than another on regional grounds;(c) the extra cost to the Defence Budget of a new defence agreementwith Malta.7.  The estimating adjustments reflect mainly:(a) in 1973-74 only,  21 million for the extra costs arising from improve-ments in recruiting and  28 million of extra costs arising out ofpeacekeeping operations in Northern Ireland (if required, adjustmentson account of these items will&apos; be made to the Defence Budget figuresfor later years when the amounts involved can be more accuratelyquantified);(b) in each year up to and including 1975-76, a revised forecast of the incidence of expenditure on the accelerated shipbuilding programme(provision for which was made in Cmnd 4829);(c) in 1975-76, an additional  60 million following a revised assessment of the cost of the planned defence programme. (The Defence Budgettotal in Cmnd 4829 for that year was provisional.)8.  The figure for 1976-77 is provisional only at this stage.9. The 1972 Statement on the Defence Estimates explained (Chapter I,paragraph 28) the effect of abolishing the Purchasing (Repayment) ServiceVotes, for which  57 million was included in the current year&apos;s defence estimates. This and the figure for 1973-74 ( 70 million) are included in the table as estimating changes.10. Current estimates are that this change in convention will lead to increases of  70 million in 1974-75,  21 million in 1975-76 and  34 million in1976-77. The Defence Budget totals for these years will be adjusted in futurepublic expenditure White Papers when firmer estimates are available. these new accounting arrangements which provide a more accurate measure of thedemands placed on national resources by the defence programme involvehowever no change in the Defence programme itself.TABLE 2.2 OTHER MILITARY DEFENCE   million	1971-72 provisional outturn	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate	1976-77 estimate												At 1972 Survey prices						Military aid......	10-5	9-9	6-9	2-2	&apos; &apos;  2	2Allied services ..      .....	120-0	117-0	1180	119-0	123	125United States military aircraft						Purchases......	0-4	 	 	 	1;:- :&apos;&quot; -	 Repayments......	-48-1	-44-9	-42-2	-34-8	-23	-other(i)........	-6-4	-7-2	-10	-2-0	-1	-2Total......	76-4	74-8	81-7	84-4	101	116Changes from Cmnd 4829						revalued						policy changes	-2-8	+ 1-0		+0-5	- :	estimating changes Cmnd 4829 revalued ..	-17-3 96-5	-5-1 78-9	-r-0-8 79-8	-01 84-0	101	0) This incorporates national accounting adjustments and certain minor items.
Military aid. This heading covers military training assistance which provides forcourses in the United Kingdom for the service personnel of other countries,the provision of British Service personnel on loan to developing(mainly Commonwealth) countries and a small amount of police training,particularly in South East Asia. It also covers the cost of equipment and capital aid supplied to a few countries including a grant of up to  1.15 million to the Malawi Government towards the cost of building barracks for asecond battalion of the Malawi Rifles in Lilongwe.Allied services . The main items are the cost of accommodation for Ministry of Defenceheadquarters staff, superannuation for the Ministry&apos;s civilian staff, and HMStationery Office and Central Office of Information services (stationery and recruitment publicity).United States Military aircraft. Deliveries of aircraft, financed by United States credits have beencompleted.&apos; The small amount shown under Turchases for 1971-72 represents the final drawing on the credit facilities which terminated on 31 March 1972.From 1972-73 any further payments for support of the aircraft will be metdirectly from the Defence Budget.4. Repayments of the credits are included in the Defence Budget whenthey occur but since the cost has already been included under Turchases&apos; inthe years up to 1971-72, it is necessary to offset these repayments by equalbut negative entries in Other military defence. These are included under&quot;Repayments.&quot;OVERSEAS AIDTABLE 2.3   million	1971-72 provisional outturn	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate	1976-77 estimate at 1972 Survey prices a.

Aid programme (line a) includes advances from the Exchequer to the CDC net of repay-ments; the public expenditure figures (line c) incorporate the net flow of funds from the CDC to overseas countries. The adjustment (line b) represents the difference between the two figures.
1. The figures above are shown net of amortisation and at constant(1972 Survey) prices. Total overseas aid on a net basis counts towards theinternational target of at least 1 per cent of GNP for total financial flowsto developing countries which the United Kingdom Government has under-taken to do its best to reach by 1975, and has in fact attained. In 1971,total net official flows reached 0.42 per cent of GNP and private flowsbrought the total above the 1 per cent in each of the years 1969, 1970, and(estimated) 1971. Private flows are expected to continue to make up asubstantial contribution to our performance. The measures to encourageBritish private investment in developing countries, announced in 1971(Cmnd 4656), are now coming into force.2. In the distribution of the aid programme, the Government takes account of long-standing relationships such as those with the Commonwealth;but it is also seeking new directions and the make-up of the programmereflects a wide and complex range of developmental, political and economic considerations. These affect the allocation of resources between geographical areas, the modes of aid such as bilateral or multilateral capital aid andtechnical assistance, and within such allocations the nature of individual projects. Capital aid and technical assistance to individual countries are considered together to create balanced programmes.3. The allocation of the aid programme is reviewed annually. In 1973-7453 per cent of the gross planning total is expected to go to bilateral capitalaid, 18 per cent to multilateral aid and about 20 per cent to technical assist-ance. Of the balance nearly 5 per cent goes through the CDC and about  per cent goes to relieving overseas Governments of pension liabilities in respectof former members of the Overseas Services. The main change in shares corn-pared with the past is an increase in the proportion going to multilateral aid.4. British multilateral aid goes mainly to the International development association (IDA). The United Nations Development Programme and otherUN aid and relief agencies, as well as some Regional Development Banks, also receive British contributions. Multilateral aid contributions are regarded asjustified and useful when they form part of a mutual effort by a numberof donors and thus are capable of increasing total aid flows, and when theindividual institution concerned is efficient. There is no target for the totalof multilateral aid as so much depends on individual circumstances.5. Over three-quarters of bilateral capital aid in 1971 was in the formof loans (mostly interest-free) and nearly one-quarter in the form of grants.The different uses of such aid are best considered over a period of years. Overthe 5 years 1967-71,  441 million represented commitments of project aid and 352 million was non-project aid. Of the project aid 39 per cent was for economic infrastructure, 15 per cent for natural resources including agriculture,and 22 per cent for investment in social services. Projects are subject tosystematic cost benefit analysis.6. Technical assistance helps developing countries move towards self-sufficiency in skills and skilled manpower. It includes the loan of British people to do jobs at present beyond local capacity; support for the education andtraining of local personnel; and the maintenance of a flow of technical knowledge and advice of all kinds. British bilateral technical assistance in1971 included the support of over 14,000 experts and teachers and nearly2,000 volunteers in developing countries; and the training in the United
Kingdom of nearly 10,000 students and 4,000 trainees.7. It is difficult to evaluate the results of aid, whether from the UnitedKingdom or from aid donors as a whole. But it is clear that aid contributesan essential foreign exchange element to the total development effort of the developing countries and the growth over the last few years of the economies of most of these countries points to the effectiveness of the combination of overseas aid with their own resources. More rapid progress is evident insome, notably those with workable mineral resources. From Britain&apos;s pointof view it is satisfactory that in 1973-74 no independent country is likely torequire budgetary aid from Britain. Increasing attention is being paid toforms of development which offer the best employment opportunities in viewof the very serious unemployment problems which many developing countriesface particularly in their large towns.8. The policy changes from Cmnd 4829 revalued shown in Table2.3 are due to a number of factors. Of the increase of  15.8 million in1971-72,  10.7 million ( 10 million .at 1971 Survey prices) was an increase on the Cmnd 4829 figure provided to cover part of the United kingdom contribution towards the cost of relief to refugees in India and East Pakistan/Bangladesh. The balance of  5.1 million is to be carried forward and offsetin 1973-74. In 1972-73, the increase of  25 million is made up of  10 millionaddition for relief in Bangladesh and a further sum of up to  15 million tomeet other pressures on the programme. This latter amount is to be offset inequal amounts in 1974-75 and 1975-76. As pressures on the programme areexpected to continue over the next two years, additional expenditure of  15million in 1973-74 and  5 million in 1974-75 has been authorised againstoffsetting reductions of  8 million in 1975-76 and  12 million in 1976-77.9. The Aid programme totals for 1974-75 and 1975-76 set out in Cmnd4829 showed increases of 9 per cent in each year and that rate has beenprojected again for 1976-77; this rate of inorease in these later years is how-ever being applied flexibly, given the adjustments described above, in orderto accommodate variations in the anticipated incidence of disbursements.The effect of these arrangements is as follows:   million	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-771972 Survey prices Cmnd 4829 revalued Projection to 1976-77 and increases since agreed for 1971-72 and 1972-73   ........	226-4 +10-7	245-2 +10-0	257-0	280-1	305-9	333-3True level of aid programme Further excesses to be carried forward and their attribution ..	237-1 +5-1	255-2 + 15-0	257-0 -4-9-9	280-1 -2-5	305-9 -15-5	333-3 -12-0Resulting modified totals	242-2	270-2	266-9	277-6	290-4	321-3

Table 2.4 above sets out the net payment to be made by the UnitedKingdom as a result of accession to the European Communities. The pay-ments comprise two main elements. First, the United Kingdom&apos;s payments tothe Budget of the European Communities; second, certain once-for-all pay-ments to the European Investment Bank and to the European Coal and steel community.2. Our estimated payments to the Community Budget are based on theterms of accession approved by Parliament under which the United King-dom will contribute about 8J per cent of Community expenditure in 1973rising to about 19 per cent in 1977. This contribution will be financed fromthe yield from levies on certain imported agricultural products, and customsduties on other imports. To the extent that these will not meet expenditure the Community is due, from 1st January 1975, to have a proportion,equivalent to up to a 1 per cent rate, of the proceeds of a Value Added Tax.For 1973 the estimate is based on the 1973 Community Budget. In arriving at the projections for the remaining period covered by the table account hasbeen taken of the forecasts for 1974 and 1975 made by the Commission.Although some of the assumptions used in the Commission^ projections differ from our own, they are based generally on the cost of pursuing existing policies, as are the estimates in this White Paper. No account is taken ofnew policies, eg for the regions, which it has now been agreed should beintroduced within this period and from which the United Kingdom should bea net beneficiary. As a member of the Community the United kingdom will be able to play its full part in future years in determining the size and useof the Community Budget.3. In Table 2.4 above payments to the Budget are shown net of UnitedKingdom receipts from the Budget. The tables below set out the estimatedgross contributions to and receipts from the Community Budget for the UKon a calendar year and a financial year basis. In 1973-74, for example receiptsare estimated at about  70 million, of which about  45 million is expeoted tobe paid by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund(FEOGA) to the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce in respect of its activities in implementing the common agricultural policy (CAP) in the United
Kingdom. A further explanation of the operation of the CAP is given in&quot;Agriculture, fisheries and forestry&quot; (see page 29 below). Most of theremaining estimated receipts are in respect of Community contributions fromthe European Social Fund for United Kingdom schemes for training, trans-ference and rehabilitation. Certain further sums which are expected to bepaid direct to applicants and which will therefore not pass through the Con-solidaited Fund are excluded.4. The latest estimates for the period to 1977 for our contributions to,and receipts from, the Community Budget are as follows:  million 1972 Survey prices	Possible United Kingdom Gross Contribution	Possible United Kingdom Receipts	Possible United Kingdom, net Contribution1973  ..	125	60	651974  ..	165	75	901975  ..	220	85	1351976  ..	270	90	1801977  ..	325	90	235In financial year to 1976-77, the figures are:  million 1972 Survey prices	Possible United Kingdom Gross Contribution	Possible United Kingdom Receipts	Possible United Kingdom Net Contribution			1972-73	30	10	201973-74	135	70	651974-75	180	80	1001975-76	230	85	1451976-77	285	90	1955. The payments to the European Investment Bank are, first, the paid-up subscription to the capital of the Bank, amounting, at current prices, to 37.5 million payable in five equal instalments during the first two and a half years of membership; and second a contribution to the reserves of theBank, estimated at  20 million payable over the same period. The investment in the reserve funds of the European Coal and Steel Community will be  24million paid in three equal annual instalments starting from the date of acces-sion.6. All the estimates given above are based on a rate of 2.4 units of account to the  .Overseas Representation7. This expenditure includes the cost of the Foreign and commonwealth office (FCO) in London, British diplomatic and consular representation inmore than 120 countries and 7 official delegations to international organis-ations. It. covers the cost of staff (excluding those engaged on information work) as well as, their office and private accommodation abroad, and officialtravel.8. The responsibility of the Diplomatic Service for representing and promoting British interests abroad includes the handling of intergovernmentalrelations; advice on foreign policy; protecting the interests of British nationalsabroad; promoting Britain&apos;s visible and invisible exports by assisting british commercial organisations and firms and by conducting bilateral and multi-
lateral negotiations on international trade and payments; and representingHer Majesty&apos;s Government in international organisations.9. Also included in the expenditure figures is the cost of the overseas development Administration, the Passport Offices in London and other centres, and the communications organisation in support of the diplomatic service.Overseas Information10.   This covers three main elements:(i) A proportion (now 67 per cent) of British Council expenditure topromote wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the english language abroad, and to develop close cultural relations with othercountries. The Council is at present represented in 76 overseas countries, and provision has been made for some expansion of itsrepresentation. Its activities include the training of teachers of English,the promotion of the use of British books abroad, exchanges of people, assistance to overseas students in Britain and the promotion of a wider knowledge overseas of British arts. The remainder ofthe Council&apos;s expenditure including its expenditure on educationalactivities and technical assistance schemes for the benefit of devel-oping  countries carried out on behalf of the Overseas DevelopmentAdministration, is included in Overseas aid.(ii) The cost of the BBCs External Services. These broadcast in english and 39 other languages for over 700 hours per week and aim toinform the largest possible foreign audiences about Britain and thepart it plays in international trade and politics. In addition, the bbc External Services supply a large number of radio programmes in recorded form to overseas broadcasting stations and are alsoresponsible for the teaching of English by radio. The expenditurecovers both operating expenses, including programme staff and engineering costs, and also capital expenditure, much of which isallocated to modernising the operational headquarters of the BBCExternal Services. Much of the cost of the BBC Monitoring service is also included under this heading.(iii) The cost of FCO information staff and operations at home andabroad and of supporting services of the Central Office of information and the Stationery Office. The aim of Information staff and theirsupporting services is to ensure by personal contacts, the provisionof material in all media, reference services and a programme of visits to the UK, an awareness of Britain&apos;s international role and interests;to secure, by publicity abroad, understanding and support for the policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government; and to achieve a favourableopinion abroad for Britain, its business and nationals.11. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster announced in parliament on 6th March 1972 that over the period 1972-73 to 1975-76 an additional 6 million would be provided for the expansion of cultural relations with europe. As part of this programme the British Council&apos;s activities in europe will be expanded at an additional cost of about  3.5 million over four years,the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will allocate about  1.3 million overthe same period to promote exchanges, visits and conferences with Europe,and the BBC will receive an additional  50,000 a year to promote broadcastingexchanges with Europe. In addition to the expenditure which falls on Overseas
information, there will be expenditure of up to  350,000 on the &quot;Fanfare for europe&quot; and about  550,000 on the Education programme and the science budget.Other External Relations12. This expenditure comprises mainly other international commitments and subscriptions, including the United Kingdom&apos;s assessed contributions toregular budgets of United Nations organisations and of the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Council of Europe and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Secretariat costs).AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRYTABLE 2.5  million	1971-72 provisional outturn	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate	1976-77 estimate at 1972 Survey prices						Agriculture and Food						Price guarantees on Common						Agricultural Policy (CAP)						products   ,.....	119-1	162-6	135-0	1100	85	55Price guarantees on products						to which the CAP system of						support does not apply ..	34-7	40-8	41 0	390	38	37Production grants  and						subsidies including capital						grants^)......	200-4	184-3	163-9	153-8	151	150	354-2	387-7	339-9	302-8	274	242Costs  of market support						operations to implement						the CAP in the U.K. (eg						intervention buying, export						restitutionX1)	; 	14-2	51-0	54-0	59	64Total Agricultural support	354-2	401-9	390-9	356-8	333	306Other agricultural and food						policies    ......	82-6	105-9	921	93-8	86	81Total Agriculture and Food	436-8	507-8	4830	450-6	419	387Fisheries        ......	9-7	12-6	12-3	12-4	12	12Forestry........	50-4	51-3	54-5	58-4	62	66Total......	496-9	571-7	549-8	521-4	493	465Changes  from   Cmnd   4829 revalued policy changes changes due to revision of assumptions to reflect entry to e.c....... other estimating changes  ..

The format for showing expenditure on agriculture has been revisedthis year to reflect in the forecasts, for the first time, the pattern of expenditure
after entry to the e.c. in 1973. The change, as compared with the formatin Cmnd 4829, has been to sub-divide total expenditure on &quot;agricultural support&quot; into 4 groups, while &quot;Other agricultural and food policies&quot; corres-ponds to the heading &quot;Other assistance to agriculture.&quot;2. During the transitional period (1973-78) the present system ofagricultural support will need to be adapted, in accordance with the Treatyof Accession (Cmnd 4862), to conform to the common agricultural policy(CAP). For the main CAP products our existing system of guaranteed prices and deficiency payments will be gradually replaced by a system based onmarket prices supported at agreed levels by import levies and interventionbuying.3. Under the present system of agricultural support, payments are madeto British farmers to meet any difference between market prices and the guaranteed price levels which are determined in the Annual Farm PriceReviews for certain commodities. These deficiency payments will be phasedout for products which come under the CAP in the coming years as the CAPand UK prices are aligned. The present system also includes production grants and subsidies designed to encourage efficiency and improve the methodsused in agriculture. Part of this expenditure also will be replaced by the CAPmethod of support.4. The CAP system of support involves the determination by the mem-bers of the Community each year of intervention and other price levels forthe major agricultural products. Market price levels are maintained by theimposition of levies on products imported from third countries and by theactivities of Government Agencies for example through purchasing, storing,and subsequently reselling on the market. The European AgriculturalGuidance and Guarantee Fund (commonly referred to as FEOGA) reim-burses virtually all but the administrative costs of these operations. Thesereceipts are taken into account in the estimate of the net contribution to e.c.,Table 2.4.5. The quinquennium covered by the 1972 Survey shows elements ofboth the old and the new systems. The figures indicate increases in expen-diture as compared with those in Cmnd 4829 revalued. This is due in part tothe effects of the 1972 Annual Review of Agriculture and in part to the newassumptions on which these projections of expenditure during the transitional period have been based. Decisions yet to be taken, particularly about thelevel of guaranteed prices and production grants, will affect the projectedlevel of expenditure.Price Guarantees6. The Treaty requires that United Kingdom market prices be raised for certain products to e.c. levels by six steps between 1973 and 1978 andthat deficiency payments for these products be ended during this period. Pend-ing decisions yet to be taken the projections for CAP products are based onthe arbitrary assumption that deficiency payments will be phased out evenlyover the whole of the transitional period. This assumption results in a moregradual scale of savings than shown in the figures in the earlier public expen-diture White Papers, Cmnd 4578 and 4829. A continuation of deficiency round has been assumed for those agricultural products to which the CAPdoes not apply potatoes, wool and sheep.
Production Grants and Subsidies, including capital grants7. Decisions have yet to be taken on the future levels of farming grants and subsidies. These levels however will be affected by the operation of the cap and it has been assumed that the trend will be for this expenditure to decline during the transitional period.Market Support Operations8. Implementation of the CAP will entail expenditure on interventionbuying, with the associated costs of transport, storage, etc; the payment ofincentives for storage and denaturing (i.e. making agricultural produce suitableonly for use as animal feed or for industrial use); export refunds; and other assistance to producers. Import levies will be collected by HM Customs and excise and do not feature in this programme. The expenditure forecastsrepresent the net estimated cost of market intervention operations in theUnited Kingdom exclusive of contributions due from the European Agricul-tural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. Whilst this area of expenditure containsmany uncertainties, an attempt has been made to estimate the levels of activity in 1973-74 (the first full year cf operations). Thereafter the uncertainties areeven greater and a convention has been adopted which assumes that levels of activity will be constant in the succeeding three years, and that interventionprices etc. will increase evenly over the whole of the transitional period toreach the present e.c. levels by 1978. It has also been assumed that unsoldstocks at the end of each year will remain constant at the level assumed for march 1974.Other Agricultural and Food Policies9. This includes most of the other expenditure by Government Depart-ments on agricultural, horticultural and food services. The comparativelyhigh figure in 1972-73 includes  25 million for the stabilisation of sugarprices tip to the end of 1972. The forecasts reflect, so far as can be foreseen,other sundry effects of entry to the e.c.. The figures also include all theexpenditure on agricultural research in Scotland which has hitherto been shown under Research Councils, etc.Explanation of Changes10. The main revision classified as a policy change is that this year&apos;white Paper figures take account of the results of the 1972 Annual Reviewof Agriculture which was assessed at an increase of  49 million. The figuresfor 1973-74 and later years provide for the transfer of funds from the science budget (see Research Councils, etc.) in respect of the Agricultural research council and the Natural Environment Research Council, announced in theWhite Paper &quot;Framework for Government Research and Development&quot;(Cmnd 5046).11. The changes due to revision of assumptions to reflect entry to EECare explained in paragraphs 6 to 9 above.Fisheries12. The objective of this programme is to promote a stable fishing industryin the United Kingdom and at the same time to reduce the nation&apos;s dependence on imports. The main expenditure under this heading relates to subsidies for
the fishing industry and grants and loans for new vessels and equipment.Future expenditure on these depends on operating results, on the plans for capital investment which may be made by the industry and on the developingstructural and marketing provisions of Community policy. None can beforecast with accuracy.Forestry13. ,This item includes both state forestry, grants to private woodlandowners and certain services undertaken by the Forestry Authority. the forestry Commission owns 1.85 million acres of plantations. Planting was ona small scale up to 1945 but from 1950 annual planting has ranged between50,000 and 70,000 acres. Three-quarters of the Commission^ woodlands havenot yet reached the thinning stage, which begins 20-30 years from the dateof planting, and the receipts of the Commission, which come mainly fromthe sale of timber, are still low. The main element in the figures is the esti-mated net cost of the increase in growing stock of state forests; a substantial part of this is compound interest on past grants-in-aid and rises from about  34million in 1972-73 to over  49 million in 1976-77, and accounts for theincrease in expenditure over the quinquennium. About  2.3 million per annumis included for grants to private woodland owners. The annual cash require-ment, met by the grant-in-aid, decreases gradually over the quinquenniumas the receipts of the Commission increase, but the mean is about  15 million.14. In a consultative document published in June 1972 the Governmentset out the results of a review of forestry policy. In regard to state forestry,the Government concluded that the maintenance of population, through thecreation or maintenance of employment in rural areas which would otherwise be substantially depopulated should be the principal objective of future policy for new planting by the Commission and that, with this objective in mind, theright course would be to plan for a combined planting and re-planting pro-gramme of up to 55,000 aores a year. The Government also considered that more emphasis should be given to realising the recreational potential of stateforestry and to the interests of amenity. The Government took the view thatany future grant aid to private forestry should be designed to encourage pri-vate planting to follow the same wider social objectives proposed for stateforestry. The conclusions of this review are currently the subject of consulta-tions with interested bodies and have not therefore yet been taken intoaccount in estimates of expenditure.15. The consultative document also reported that the Forestry commission will in future be set a target rate of return on its (notional) capital of 3 per centin real terms. The form of its accounts is being revised to bring out its performance in relation to this target, allowance being made for plantingundertaken for social reasons which is expected to yield less than the targetrate of return of 3 per cent. As a result the amount of (notional) capital willbe substantially reduced. When these new accounting arrangements are completed they will result in revisions to the presentation of the expenditureestimates.

The above table shows expenditure collectively known as the science budget, for which the Secretary of State for Education and Science is responsible. It includes expenditure by the five Research Councils(Agricultural, Medical, Natural Environment, Science and Social Science),the British Museum (Natural History) and grants and services for scientific purposes. The Secretary of State, who had until October 1972 been advised on the allocation of this Science Budget by the Council for scientific policy will henceforth be advised by its successor body, the Advisory board for the Research Councils. Expenditure on agricultural research, scotland ,previously shown in this Table is included in the Table on agriculture,fisheries and forestry under &quot;other agricultural and food policies&quot;.2. The purpose of the research financed from the Science Budget is todevelop the sciences as such, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research,and to support higher education. It covers a wide spectrum of activity, ranging from human and animal health and behaviour through the causes of, andcures for, pollution, to the mapping of earth, sea and sky and the investi-gation of the laws of physical matter.3. The Table reflects the Governmenfs decisions, announced in &quot;Frame-work for Government Research and Development&quot; (Cmnd 5046), to transfercertain sums from the Science Budget to customer Departments in the expectation that the transferred money would be spent for the purpose ofcommissioning applied research work. The Government made it a conditionof transfer that the customer Departments should have established their centralscientific staffs. The assumption is made that the funds will be transferred from the beginning of the 1973-74 financial year. It was also decided to paythe grant-in-aid to the Royal Society of Edinburgh through the Scottish Officeinstead of through the Department of Education and Science.4. Under the terms of Cmnd 5046 the sums to be transferred to the votes of customer Departments amounted to  20 million at 1971 prices, togetherwith certain additional sums related to specific projects. Under the stagedprocedure set out in paragraph 50 of Cmnd 5046, one half of the transfer of 20 million was to be effected in 1973-74 and the remainder in equal amounts in the two following years, after which a period of stability was envisaged.About half of the total is to be transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food (Agriculture, fisheries and forestry programme), about one quarter to the Department of Health and Social Security and the scottish home and Health Department (Health and personal social services) andthe rest to the Department of Employment and the Department of Trade
and Industry (Trade, industry and employment), and the Department of the environment (Miscellaneous local services). At 1972 Survey prices and allowing for growth, the sums to be transferred, including specific sums inrespect of the Soil Survey of England and Wales and the Nature Conservancy(pant of whose functions are, subject to necessary legislation, to be transferredto a new body) are as follows:  million1973-74 1974-75 1975-7613.5 19.7 26.3These amounts appear as policy changes in Table 2.6 above, and in the programmes to which they are transferred. The residual Science Budget ofthe Department of Education and Science is expected to increase by 3.0per cent in 1976-77. The amounts to be devoted by customer departments to commissioning research from the Research Councils in that year will bedetermined separately from the DES Science Budget.5.

DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND industry. The departments estimates are presented in a different form this yearreflecting the establishment of the Industrial Development Executive (IDE),and the passage of the Industry Act, 1972, following the Governments state-ment on industrial and regional development published in Cmnd 4942. one important change is the disappearance of the General support programme asa single block of expenditure. Part of this is now the responsibility of the IDEitself; the remainder is allocated elsewhere in Table 2.7 above.2. The substantial additional expenditure required to carry out the policies of the IDE, and assistance to the coal industry account for mostof the increases shown under &quot;policy changes&quot; in Table 2.7 above.3. For a number of items in the departments programme, particularly for items within the responsibility of the DDE, the level of expenditure dependsmainly on the response of private industry. When new forms of expenditure are involved this is difficult to forecast with any precision, and the estimates inthese areas are necessarily tentative. The forecasts of expenditure given abovedo not attempt to provide for selective assistance under section 8 of theIndustry Act (see paragraph 10 below) or for any major new projects thatmight arise outside the area covered by the IDE.Industrial Development Executive4. The policies for which the IDE are responsible were announced in cmnd 4942. These are to promote and sustain faster economic growth; toencourage the expansion and modernisation of British industry; to attack thecontinuuing and serious problems of regional imbalance, and to assist industryto meet the challenge of Europe.Regional Development Grants5. Since October 1970, expenditure on machinery and plant in develop-ment areas has qualified for free depreciation. The extension of free depreciation to the whole country, in March 1972, as part of the new basicnational incentives to investment, removed this differential incentive in favourof investment in the development areas and so a new system of regional development grants was introduced to reinforce free depreciation on machinery and plant and to supersede the much more limited scheme of building grants under the Local Employment Act.6. Regional development grants will be made towards the cost of buildings and plant and machinery, principally in manufacturing industry, at the rate of22 per cent in the special development areas and at 20 per cent in thedevelopment areas. Grants will also be made at 20 per cent towards the costof buildings in the enlarged intermediate areas and, for a period of two yearsonly, in the derelict land clearance areas. (The geographical coverage of theseassisted areas is shown on the map at Annex C of Cmnd 4942.)7. The new grants will be available to firms already established in the assisted areas on the same basis and at the same rates as to incoming firms.This will encourage development from within the areas themselves and provide an incentive for improving their efficiency and competitiveness.Expenditure under the Local Employment Act 19728. Expenditure under the Local Employment Act on- building grants,and loans and operational and removal grants (now superseded by regional
development grants and by the new forms of selective regional assistanceavailable under the Industry Act) is expected to have virtually terminated bythe end of the Survey period. But the provision of land and factories for industrial use will continue.Selective Regional Assistance9. Assistance is available on a selective basis in the development and intermediate areas under Section 7 of the Industry Act 1972 to supplement the basic incentives of tax allowances and regional development grants. this assistance includes, for projects which provide additional employment, loansat favourable rates, or as an alternative, interest relief grants towards the costof finance obtained from commercial sources; and, for modernisation orrationalisation projects which maintain or safeguard existing employment,loans at broadly commercial rates where the necessary finance cannot reasonably be obtained from the market. The estimates are that expenditure will reach  75 million by 1976-77 with receipts of  15 million, giving a nettotal of  60 million for that year, but the figures are necessarily tentative sincemuch depends on the response by industry to these new schemes.Selective Assistance General Powers10. Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972 gives general powers to provide for selective assistance to industry. Financial assistance may be made availablewhere in the opinion of the Secretary of State it is in the national interest,likely to benefit the economy, and cannot appropriately be provided in anyother way. The Act provides for an initial limit of  150 million which may,by order, be increased on up to 4 occasions by an amount not exceeding 100 million. The pattern of expenditure over the Survey period cannot before seen at this stage, and no forecast has been included.Assistance to the Shipbuilding Industry11. Over 90 per cent of the employment provided by the main merchantship building firms is in the assisted areas; and assistance is being given toenable certain firms to acquire new facilities to improve their long termviability and to meet the short-term needs of the industry. Construction grantson a tapering scale are being provided under Section 11 of the Industry Act.The estimates also cover assistance to Govan Shipbuilders Limited andCammell Laird Limited and payments to the Liquidator of Upper ClydeShipbuilders Limited.Refinancing of Shipbuilding Credits12. The arrangements under which the clearing banks provide credit for home shipbuilding were revised in March 1972 (Hansard, cols. 535-7). Underthe new arrangements, the Department of Trade and Industry provide partialrefinance to the banks. Repayments of this refinance will reduce theexpenditure figures and the net amount is estimated to decline to  25 million by 1976-77. The figures for the previous years also provide for a phased take-over by the Department of the refinancing commitment assumed by the IssueDepartment of the Bank of England prior to September 1972.Other Services13. The remaining payments of grants and loans to the hotel industry inthe early years, and expenditure by the British Tourist Authority and theEnglish Tourist Board, account for about a half of the estimated expenditure
on Other services. This heading also includes provision for assistance tomineral exploration and a variety of other measures of support for theengineering industries and for industry generally.Residual Expenditure14. Provision is made for expenditure on investment grants arising fromcontracts entered into by industry before 27th October 1970. The totalexpenditure qualifying under these contracts and the phasing of the payments are still uncertain. Variations on Cmnd 4829 revalued an underspending of 95 million in 1971-72, largely offset by additions in later years are mainly due to slow submission of fully documented claims. The forecasts under this heading also allow for outstanding liabilities (and for loan repayments) taken over from the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation. An earlier realisation of some 1958-59 assets than was expected account for variations on Cmnd4829. Industrial Investment Schemes (the computers merger and assistance tothe aluminium industry) are also included.Civil Aviation Services15. The Civil Aviation Authority is charged with the regulation of airlinesand organisers of air travel; the control of the safety of civil flying generally;the operation, jointly with the Secretary of State for Defence, of air navigationservices; advising on the provision of aerodromes, and the management ofcertain aerodromes in Scotland (White Paper on Civil Aviation PolicyGuidance, Cmnd 4899) The intention is that the Authority will becomeself-supporting on revenue account; meanwhile the Government will pay atapering grant-in-aid to cover the operating deficit. In addition to this grant-in-aid ,the estimates in Table 2.7 above also include provision for theAuthority&apos;s capital expenditure, mainly on facilities for air traffic services;and for expenditure by local authorities on the aerodromes which they own.Aircraft and Aeroengine Projects and AssistanceConcorded6. The forecasts for Concorde provide for the United Kingdom&apos;s shareof the development costs and for support for the production programme.The current United Kingdom/French estimate of total Concorde development costs, announced by the Minister for Aerospace on 4 May 1972, is  970million. Production expenditure is no greater in total than was assumedlast year but the peak will be in 1974-75 rather than 1973-74.RB21117. The forecasts provide for the completion of the development of the basic RB211-22 engine and for meeting the losses which it is recognised thatRolls Royce (1971) Ltd will incur on the first 555 engines. There has been no increase during the last year in the estimate of the support costs of theRB211-22 but there has been some rephasing of expenditure on the produc-tion programme. New provision is made for the Governments contribution towards the development of the larger RB211-24 engine which was announced by the Minister for Aerospace on 7 August 1972.Other assistance18. The main item under the heading of Other assistance is expenditureon the M45H engine which Rolls Royce (1971) Ltd are developing forthe German/Dutch VFW 614 aircraft. There is also a contribution to the
financing of Shorts of Belfast and provision in 1971-72 for the advance ofworking capital to Rolls Royce (1971) Ltd. No provision is made for thebalance of the purchase price of the Rolls-Royce assets for which downpayments of  30 million were made in 1970-71.Aerospace Research and Development19. The heading includes general research and development work in industry, the universities and the Governments aviation establishments.Examples are work on the reduction of aero-engine noise and the study of future aircraft types. The heading also contains expenditure on the nationalspace programme, mainly the study and development of satellites, and theUnited Kingdom&apos;s contribution to the ESRO programme on the developmentof applications satellites for aeronautical, meteorological and telecommunications-cations purposes.Nuclear Energy and other Nuclear Expenditure20. This heading covers mainly research and development by the atomic energy Authority. It also contains provision for net borrowing of BritishNuclear Fuels Limited and other miscellaneous nuclear expenditure.21. Nuclear reactor research and development accounts for about  37million in 1972-73 decreasing to  21 million by 1976-77. The main element of the nuclear generating programme is to be the development of the sodiumcooled fast reactor (Hansard, 8 August 1972 Cols 1491-2). Over the next five years this will require additional work on component development and safety studies at a cost of  15 million. So that a decision on the interimthermal system for the United Kingdom may be made in the early part of1974 further limited development of the steam generating heavy water reactorwill also be necessary. Meanwhile the development of the high1 temperaturereactor will continue in collaboration with Europe, and the safety aspectsof the light water reactor will be explored.Other Research and Development22. The Departments industrial research establishments, which undertake work for Government Departments, other public authorities and for industry,account for most of this expenditure. There are three multi-purpose establish-ments (National Physical Laboratory, National Engineering Laboratory andWarren Spring Laboratory) and two more specialised establishments (laboratory-tory of the Government Chemist, and Safety in Mines Research Establish-ment). Much of the work by the establishments for DTI will now be theresponsibility of Requirements Boards on which the customer interest in theDepartment, in industry and elsewhere, will be represented.23. Provision is also made for grants to industrial research associations,support for the National Research Development Corporation and some extra-mural research and development. The latter includes terminal assistance tothe hovercraft industry, work on marine technology and, from 1973-74, surveyscarried out by the Natural Environment Research Council on repayment.The provision for the work by NERC has been transferred from the &quot;science budget&quot; in accordance with the policy in &quot;Framework for government research and Development&quot; (Cmnd 5046), see page 32.Export Promotion24.  The British Overseas Trade Board assumed direction of the export
promotion programme on 1 January 1972. The major part of the expenditure is on trade fairs and missions.Shipping Services25. Most of the expenditure is directed towards the improvement of safetyat sea. There are increases of the order of  2 million a year on Cmnd 4829revalued due mainly to additional civil expenditure on air/sea helicopterrescue services; and to reductions in forecast receipts resulting from the defer-ment of increases in marine survey fees.Nationalised Industries Special Assistance26. This heading covers assistance to the coal industry; compensation tothe Electricity Boards in England and Wales and to the Gas Industry inrespect of the acceleration of investment for employment reasons; and compensation to the Central Electricity Generating Board for additional costs incurred following the mineworkers strike.27. Provision has been made in the years up to 1975-76 for major assist-ance to the coal industry for which statutory authority is being sought.Administration28. The estimates provide for the staff and expenses of the Departmenfsheadquarters and regional offices, the Patent Office, the monopolies commission and the Metrication Board.DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER DEPARTMENTSEmployment Services29. This item comprises expenditure by the Department of Employment,and by local authorities on services grant-aided by the Department (eg the youth Employment Service). Also included is certain expenditure by theDepartment of the Environment on premises occupied by the Department for employment work, training services, etc. Most of the expenditure is attribut-able to the cost of operating the employment and training services. The mainpolicy increase since Cmnd 4829 arises from the development of the trainingservices and accounts for an additional  19 million in 1972-73 rising to  64million in 1975-76.30. The Government have announced that a Bill will be introduced for thepurpose (among other things) of establishing a Manpower services commission. The Commission would be given responsibility for operatingthe employment and training services through the Employment Service agency and the Training Services Agency, which are at present being set up withinthe Department.31. The Employment Service Agency is based on the proposals in tinpublication &quot;People and Jobs a Modern Employment Service&quot;. Its aim is to speed up and improve in quality the matching of individuals, both employed and unemployed, with vacant jobs in the interests of the individual, industryand the economy, and to help and guide all who are seeking work. its responsibilities will be exercised through the employment offices of theDepartment (numbering rather more than a thousand) which in 1971-72received about 2 million job vacancies and made over 1  million placings.The Agency is also responsible for providing the placing service for those atprofessional and executive level, and the expenditure estimates take accountof the decision to charge fees from 1st March 1973 to employers using the
service, to be styled Professional and Executive Recruitment, which is forecast to become financially self-supporting over the forward period. expenditure by the Department of the Environment for improved local office premisesis included in the estimates.32; The Training Services Agency will co-ordinate the work of the Indus-trial Training Boards and will assume responsibility for the much expandedprogramme of Government training (the &quot;Training Opportunities Scheme&quot;) as announced by the Secretary of State in August 1972. The Boards are at presentfinanced by levies on the industries they serve but receive grants from theDepartment for the fostering of certain types of training. A general schemefor exempting from levy firms which carry out such training as is reasonable to meet their own needs is to be introduced from 1974-75, together with arrangements for meeting from public funds the administrative expenses ofthe Boards and for finanoing by grant certain key training activities; and the forecasts include provision for these developments.33. Vocational training is provided by the Government at present mainlythrough Government Training Centres in which some 16,600 persons receivedtraining in 1971-72 compared with 12,400 in 1968-69. A throughput of 34,000is planned by 1975-76 and to make this possible the number of training placesis to rise from 11,000 at 1st April 1972 to 18,500 in 1975-76. These figurescompare with 8,400 places at 1st April 1968. Provision is also made for an estimated 15,000 training places in Colleges of Further Education and privatecolleges in the academic year 1974-75 compared with a usage of about 2,400places in the academic year 1971-72. There were 500 such training places in1968-69, and Cmnd 4829 provided for 2,000 in each of the forward yearscovered. These increases reflect growing demand and a wider range of courses of. training. Continued use is also to be made of spare training facilities inemployers&apos; establishments and the provision for 2,000 such places each year is rather more than twice the Cmnd 4829 numbers. The Training OpportunitiesScheme as a whole is expected to reach a throughput of about 70,000 traineesin. 1974-75 and significantly more in later years. The Department also providesgrants in aid for training in new and expanding firms in the development and intermediate areas and the training of about 48,000 men and women wasassisted in 1971-72.34. Improvements have been made to the Employment Transfer scheme with a view to facilitating the mobility of workers. Those in assisted areas have been helped particularly through the introduction of a  400 rehousinggrant. Special grant arrangements have been introduced for trainees who have completed an approved course of Government sponsored training under thevocational training scheme and who move to take employment in the trades inwhich they have been trained. The number of workers helped to move underthese arrangements rose from 6,721 in 1968-69 to 9,186 in 1971-72 and thenumber under the improved arrangements is expected to increase to about19,000 in 197.2-73 and thereafter.35. Occupational safety and health services (the subject of the recent report by the Robens Committee on Safety and Health at Work) include HMFactory Inspectorate and the Employment Medical Advisory Service. this latter service will begin early in 1973 and will promote a more selective and less routine supervision of the health of young persons in industry and continuestatutory medical examination of, workers engaged in hazardous processes and occupations. More generally the service will seek to identify and overcome
the causes of disease, fatigue and stress arising from work. Provision is madefor the receipt of fees from employers for certain statutory medicalexaminations.36. Specialised placing services for disabled persons are available throughthe Departments local offices and facilities for the rehabilitation of disabled persons are provided in Industrial Rehabilitation Units. Grants are made towards the provision of employment for severely disabled people in Remployfactories and other sheltered workshops. 11,675 disabled persons successfullycompleted courses in Industrial Rehabilitation Units in 1971-72 and 12,600severely disabled were employed in Remploy factories and local authority andother sheltered workshops.37. The Department makes grants towards the cost of the YouthEmployment Service to those local authorities who have elected to provide it.The future organisation of this service and the introduction of a new and more flexible system are under consideration.38. For a limited period in 1972-73 the Department is making a grant tothe National Dock Labour Board to finance a special severance scheme toreduce the number of older and unfit registered dock workers, and so relievea serious redundancy situation in various ports. The size of the grant will depend on the numbers accepting severance; provision is made for expenditureof about  24 million.39. Certain of the Departments schemes for training, transference and rehabilitation should be eligible for assistance from the European Social Fundfrom 1973, but such receipts are taken into account in the net contributions toEEC, etc (Table 2.4).Redundancy Fund Payments40. Through rebate payments to employers the Redundancy Fund meetspart of the total amount payable to employees under the redundancy payments Act. Guarantee payments are also made from the Fund to redundantworkers to cover the full amount due when the employer is in financial difficulties. About 388,000 people received redundancy payments in 1971-72.The Fund is administered by the Department of Employment and is financed by Employers&apos; contributions collected through the national insurance stamp.The figures take account of past and current experience of demands on theFund. Provision is made for guarantee and rebate payments, the cost of administering the scheme, and minor miscellaneous items.SET Additional Payments and Regional Employment Premium41. Selective Employment Tax additional payments were abolished with effect from 6th April 1970 but because payment is made in arrears smallprovision is made for belated claims in 1972-73. The regional employment premium, which is paid in respect of manufacturing establishments in thedevelopment areas, will be phased out from September 1974 in a manner andover a period yet to be decided. In the meantime a small provision has beenmade for residual claims in financial years after 1974-75.Refinancing of Export Credits42. This covers partial refinancing by the Export Credits guarantee department of advances made by the clearing banks in respect of exportsfinanced on credit of two years and over. It reflects new arrangements madein March 1972 (Hansard, cols. 535-7) to ensure the continuing availability of
finance for exports produced, in the main by the heavy capitol goods indus-tries, engineering etc. where the contracts involve heavy cash outlays, andlengthy periods of manufacture and payment. The overall volume of thisexport finance has been growing steadily for some years. The 1973-74 to1975-76 figures make provision for a phased take-over by the Export credits guarantee Department of the refinancing commitment assumed by the IssueDepartment of the Bank of England prior to March 1972.Miscellaneous Services43. This item includes most of the expenditure of the Development Com-mission and the expenditure of the Highlands and Islands Development Board;also the expenditure of the Scottish and Wales Tourist Boards, including thaton the hotel loans and grant scheme and the subsequent scheme of assistanceto tourist projects in development areas.BP Rights Issue44. The Government has taken up the rights allotted to it under the 120 million issue.Maplin Development Authority45. The Maplin Development Bill, which provides for the setting up ofthe Authority, was introduced on 30 November 1972. Table 2.7 includestentative estimates of the cost of the land reclamation which will be under-taken by the Authority during the forecast period. Most of the reclaimedland will be transferred to other public authorities, in particular the British Airports Authority and the Pont of London authority and the rest will be available eventually for development inaccordance with the Governmenfs industrial, regional and environmentalpolicies. No allowance is made in the Table for payments by other public authorities for reclaimed land nor for the offsetting receipts by the Develop-ment Authority as the timing and amount of payments are still uncertain.These transactions will, in any case, have no net effect on the total of public expenditure.

1. The capital expenditure programmes are planned so that the nation-nationalised industries are able to meet the demands of their customers for products and services in the most efficient way. The expenditure differs from that ofother public programmes, in that it is mainly determined by commercial considerations and the Government take account of this in deciding the programmes in their annual review.2. One exception to this has been the acceleration of investment in 1972-73 and 1973-74 in order to assist the employment position. The amount involved is about  160 million over the two years.3. Since July 1971 the nationalised industries have matched the CBIinitiative on price restraint. Although this decision has worsened their financialposition it has not affected investment programmes since, as the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer made clear in his announcement on 19th July, 1971, the indus-tries have been able to borrow from the National Loans Fund to financeinvestment which, in the absence of price restraint, would have been financed from internal resources. Special measures are proving necessary to safeguard the financial position of many of the industries.4. The forecasts show an increase in expenditure on fixed assets bynationalised industries to 1974-75 arising from the increasing demand fortelecommunications, the purchase of new aircraft by the state airlines, the modernisation of the steel industry, and the acceleration of projects includingelectricity power stations. From 1974-75 onwards, a lower rate of increasein the amount of investment in fixed assets is expected.5. For the nationalised industries as a whole, experience continues toshow that investment tends to fall short of the approved figure. Provisionalestimates suggest that in 1971-72 expenditure on fixed assets was nearly  200million lower than that forecast by the industries themselves a year earlierbut this exceptionally large shortfall is considered to be mainly due to thefact that the economy as a whole expanded at a slower fate than was forecast.For each year of the five years under review an allowance has been made forshortfall of  100 million. These estimates of shortfall cannot be attributed to particular industries and are subject to very wide margins of error.6. In 1971-72 capital expenditure other than fixed investment was about 150 million less than forecast in Cmnd 4829. This was due mainly to the run-down of fuel stocks during the coal miner&apos;s strike and the revision ofthe requirements of the British Steel Corporation.7. In the years 1972-73 to 1976-77 the main estimating changes result from reduced forecasts of the demand for electricity, the re-phasing andre-costing of North Sea gas projects, changes in the incidence of aircraftpurchases by the air corporations and the upward revision of the estimatedcost of the modernisation of the steel industry.8. The policy changes relate, in the main to the decision to acceleratecertain items of investment as mentioned in paragraph 2 above.FUELCoal9. After the miners&apos; strike, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industryannounced on 6 March that the Government would introduce legislation indue course to deal with the financial problems of the coal industry: (see Trade,industry and employment: nationalised industries special assistance, page
39). Meanwhile the Government has been considering joint proposals fromthe National Coal Board and the mining Unions on measures which theindustry could take to contain costs and improve productivity, as well as forGovernment help. The Board&apos;s capital investment forecasts will be reviewed in the light of measures introduced to deal with the industry&apos;s problems. Inthese circumstances, it is not possible to give substantive estimates for mininginvestment. The estimates in Table 2.8, for mainstream activities, are there-fore basically those of Cmnd 4829 revalued. However, and additional  million has been added to the figure for 1972-73 to allow for acceleratedexpenditure and for special investment needed to make good damage topits and equipment caused as a result of the miners&apos; strike. The estimates in the Table also include investment in the Board&apos;s ancillary and diversifiedactivities. An indication of the Board&apos;s recent performance is that productionin the first half of the current financial year was at an annual rate of about140 million tons.Electricity10. Major power stations require at least five years for construction. Con-sequently the level of investment in electricity generation over the next fiveyears is determined largely by the forecast peak demand for six to elevenwinters ahead, and by the margin of generating capacity to be built in excessof forecast demand to provide against inevitable uncertainties in that forecast,the breakdown of plant, delays in commissioning new plant and exceptionallyadverse weather. In 1972 the forecast demand for Great Britain in 1977-78is 63,500 megawatts, implying an annual increase of about 5-^ per cent overthe 1971-72 peak demand, but only 1,000 megawatts more than the 1971 fore-cast for 1976-77. After taking account of the order for the Ince B power station brought forward into 1972 to assist employment, the figures in Table2.8 therefore provide for only two major stations to be ordered in 1973, oneof which is to be at Peterhead in Scotland.11. About one third of the total investment by Electricity Boards is forthe reinforcement and extension of the transmission and distribution system.This is determined by the shorter-term load forecasts of two or three years ahead and again the level of investment has fallen in recent years but isexpected to rise with the growth of demand.Gas12. The demand for natural gas continues to grow; the quantity sold and used in 1971-72 was a little over 8,000 million therms compared with about,200 million therms in 1970-71. A total of 153 miles of main transmissionpipeline was completed during the year bringing the national transmissionsystem up to an operational length of 2,106 miles. The network of pipelinesfor the system as at present planned is nearing completion and more attention will now be paid to the provision of compressor stations and storageprojects to ensure maximum operating capacity and greater security of supply.In 1971-72 the appliances of a further 2.4 million customers were converted to burn natural gas direct, bringing the number of such customers to million or 45 per cent of the total.13. The total cost of conversion is currently estimated to be of the orderof  530 million and by the end of 1972-73 about half the conversions of
domestic appliances will have been carried out. This cost, which does not create gas industry assets, is to be recovered over a period through charges to the revenue account, and is not therefore treated as capital expenditure for National Accounts purposes.Steel14. Approval of the British Steel Corporation^ investment programme for 1972-73 at the level in Table 2.8 was announced by the Minister for industry on 16th December, 1971. A decision on the Corporation^ long term development Plan is expected shortly. The figures included in Table 2.8 for years after 1972-73 are therefore provisional; but they are broadly consistent with the upper part of the capacity range of 28-36 million ingot tons proposedby the Joint Steering Group as the Corporation^ capacity by 1980.Post Office15. The telecommunications capital programme accounts for over 90per cent of the total Post Office figures for the five years to 1976-77; and theamount estimated for 1976-77 is about 25 per cent more than for 1971-72.The chief objects of the programme are to expand the telecommunicationssystem to, improve the service and meet increased demand from new and existing customers. The programme within the United Kingdom covers theprovision of more than seven million exchange connections over the next five years, giving a net growth within the period of more than five millionexchange connections (compared with a net growth of less than 3 millionexchange connections in 1967-68 to 1971-72); and it increases the overallsize of the system by one third from ten million to more than fifteen millionworking connections. It includes provision for the conversion of the few remaining manual telephones to automatic working; extension of subscribertrunk dialling facilities to all customers; augmentation of trunk routes to relieve traffic congestion and to meet growth in long distance calls; and it provides for growth of connections to the telex service and in data terminals.16. For all these purposes investment will be made in new exchanges,extensions to existing exchange buildings and equipment, enlargement of localline networks to customers&apos; premises and increased cable capacity for tele-phone and other telecommunications services. Roughly one third of the investment is for exchange equipment. Other large items are customers&apos;installations, land and buildings and local and other lines. For telecommunications-cations services with overseas countries, the programme covers new andenlarged international exchanges to relieve congestion and to meet increasingtraffic.17. Expenditure on postal services will be mainly directed to the replace-ment of obsolescent buildings and vehicles, and the installation of the auto-matic sorting equipment required under the plans for mechanisation of theletter and parcel services. The essential feature of the letter plan is make thefullest use of code-sorting machinery, by concentrating sorting work in a greatly reduced number of mechanised offices. Under the parcel plan, whichis broadly similar in concept, it is proposed to concentrate parcel sorting in about 27 centres. These developments are designed to simplify the presentcomplex circulation systems and to reduce the heavy dependence of the postal business on manpower.
Airways and airports18. As in previous years most of the expected capital expenditure by theAir Corporations, which are now controlled by the British Airways Board,is on the purchase of new aircraft for replacement and expansion. BEA takethe final deliveries of Trident 3B aircraft in 1972 and have ordered sixLockheed Tristar aircraft for delivery starting late 1974, with an option for sixmore in the following year (and for a further six later). BOAC have continuedto build up their existing fleet of Boeing 747 aircraft: they expect to takedelivery of a thirteenth 747 shortly and to build up their wide-bodiedsubsonic fleet further thereafter. In addition, by ordering five Concordes they became this summer the first airline in the world to place a firm order forthis supersonic aircraft. The current figures show reduced expenditure in1972-73, reflecting a low level of purchases at a time when the profitability of world airlines has been low, and increased expenditure in ensuing yearswhen prospects are better and Concordes and Tristars are due to be delivered.19. The British Airports Authority (BAA) plan to spend  84 million overthe period 1972-73 to 1976-77 on the three London airports and at Prestwick.The bulk of this sum will be spent at Heathrow and Gatwick on projects tocater for the expected increase in traffic at these airports in the years beforethe new airport at Maplin becomes operational in 1980. The BAA have provided for expenditure of  8.4 million on developing Edinburgh Airportsubject to planning permission and to land acquisition. Three-quarters of this sum will be contributed by the Department of Trade and Industry inaccordance with the agreement by which the airport was transferred to theBAA. The BAA will also acquire reclaimed land for the Third London Airportduring the period. The total cost of the land transferred to them from theMaplin Development Authority (see Table 2.7) might amount to some  40-50million. As, however, the amounts and the timing are so uncertain, neitherthe payments by the BAA nor the exactly offsetting receipts of the MaplinDevelopment Authority are included in the Tables; the only expenditure onthe Third London Airport included in the BAA&apos;s investment in Table 2.8 isfor some work on constructing the terminal building in 1976-77.Surface transport industries20. Following the British Railways Board (BRB) deficit in 1971 and afurther worsening of their position in 1972, long term policy for the railwaysis under review. The outcome will determine, inter alia, future levels of investment. Meanwhile, the greater part of the current programme consists ofthe installation of modem electronic signalling, the replacement of old rolling stock by stock of improved design, and the laying of continuously welded rail.But tentative provisions have been included for rail links to the ChannelTunnel and to Maplin Airport (though in each case relevant policy decisions have yet to be made). The figures for 1972-73 and 1973-74 include the acceleration of over  20 million of investment with a view to creatingadditional employment.21. The BRB&apos;s capital expenditure on the London and South Eastcommuter services is treated as infrastructure expenditure and appears underSurface Transport (Table 2.10). This reflects the fact that it is judged by socialas well as purely financial criteria.22. The National Freight Corporation^ planned investment has been cutback as a result of the adverse trading conditions of 1971 and 1972 and the
continued rationalisation of the Corporation^ road haulage subsidiaries.About 70 per cent of their investment is in the replacement of lorries, trailers,and containers.23. Most of the National Bus Company&apos;s investment is in replacementbuses suitable for one-man operation. The figures reflect a small reduction inthe Company&apos;s stage carriage fleet. Demand for stage services has steadilyfallen in recent years. However, the fall in 1972 was less than in previous years and this will be reflected in the level of bus replacement. It is too soon to say whether this improvement is a temporary phenomenon.24. The British Waterways Board undertaking is to be divided under the government&apos;s proposals for Water Reorganization. The provision in Cmnd4829 revalued has meanwhile been retained with the addition in 1972-73 of 0.3 million of accelerated investment.25. Approximately 60 per cent of the 5 year programme of the Scottish transport Group is for the replacement of buses. Most of the remainder is forthe introduction by 1975 of roll-on/roll-off vehicle ferries and associatedterminals, in accordance with a statement made by the Secretary of State forScodand on 18th April 1972 about Government policy for the encouragement of sea transport to the Scottish islands.26. The Transport Holding Company is being wound up. Thomas Cookand Son Limited, its last active subsidiary, was sold for  22.5 million duringthe summer.ROADSTABLE 2.9 _   million	1971-72						pro-	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	visional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1972 Survey prices						New construction and improve-						ments:						Motorways and trunk roads ..	257-2	270-5	320-9	336-0	379	407Principal roads......	1960	230-1	234-9	238-4	240	248Other roads    ......	674	78-1	71-8	78-5	82	80Other expenditure  (including						lighting)      ......	26-6	28-5	31-3	350	36	38Total........	547-2	607-2	658-9	717-9	737	773Maintenance:						Motorways and trunk roads ..	31-3	48-7	56-6	35-4	33	35Principal roads......	49-7	58-1	590	73-5	82	81Other roads    ......	145-7	161-4	160-9	165-6	173	183Other expenditure (including						lighting)       ......	250	25-5	27-3	27-8	28	29Total......	251-7	293-7	303-8	302-3	316	328Administration:						Central government administra-						tion   ..      ......	5-5	5-9	6-0	6-1	f r?&apos;6;j	i  ,6Local authority administration	56-6	60-3	64-6	68-5	72	75Selective    Employment   Tax						paid by local authorities	4-2	4-3	4-4	4-5	5	5Total ........	865-2	971-4	1037-7	1099-3	1136	1187Changes from Cmnd 4829 revalued						policy changes......	+0-5	+ 30-0	+32-0	-f 16-9	-9	estimating changes	-190	-21-5	-23-7	4-7-9	4-10	Cmnd 4829 revalued ..	883-7	962-9	1029-4	1074-5	1135	
1. The expenditure figures in the above Table fall into 2 main groups:new construction and improvement, and maintenance; and a minor group(administration) which is self-explanatory.New Construction and Improvement: the proposed programme . The number of road vehicles in Great Britain is expected to increase from some 15-^- million to over 20 million by 1980. That is the backgroundagainst which the programme for new construction and improvement of roadshas to be set. Without an expanding programme, there would inevitably be greater congestion and delay on the roads and, for many places, increasingdamage to the environment. Investment in roads can produce appreciableenvironmental and economic gains. However, the Secretary of State hasreviewed priorities within the field of his responsibilities, and has decidedto place rather more emphasis on other aspects of the environment and,in order to make resourcces available for this, slightly to reduce the rateof growth of expenditure on roads.3. The programme for new construction and improvement coversdevelopment of the main inter-urban network (motorway and trunk roads);construction of principal roads (mainly roads of similar importance in urban areas); and local roads. The bulk of the expenditure is on major roads, and rather more than half of this is on inter-urban roads.4. The figures for inter-urban roads in Table 2.9 are consistent with theplan for an expanding trunk road and motorway programme in England whichwas announced by the Government in June 1971, and which envisages thecompletion of a 3,500 mile network of strategic trunk routes in the early1980&apos;s. The network will provide high quality roads, designed to modernstandards, between the major industrial and population centres. There is a firm programme of schemes most of which cost anything from  1 million to  10 million on which work is expected to begin within one or two years,supported by a reserve of schemes in preparation.5. Most principal roads are in towns and their planning must be related to the planning of all aspects of the urban environment. Their role must alsobe related to public transport and to measures for traffic restraint.Roads and the Environment6. Roads cannot be regarded solely in terms of providing for estimateddemand for movement. Development of inter-urban roads, including by-passand relief roads, brings about substantial environmental gains by freeing townsand villages, including many of historic interest, from heavy through traffic.New and improved urban roads are required to relieve the worst congestion in our towns and cities, and thereby to further the objective of improving the urban environment. But roads can also have a profound impact on com-munity amenities, and the Government has decided that greater importancemust be placed on their social effect. In Cmnd 5124 &quot;Development and compensation Putting People First&quot; the Government have announced their acceptance of a number of proposals put forward in the Report of the UrbanMotorways Committee, &quot;New Roads in Towns&quot; (HMSO) and have alsoannounced additional measures which will substantially diminish the damagethat roads can inflict upon the environment, and which will improve people&apos;s
rights to compensation. The cost of the measures set out in the Land Com-pensation Bill, insofar as they will affect roads, together with the cost of newdesign features, could build up to some  55 million a year in relation tothe current level of road expenditure. The immediate effect on costs ofincorporating new design features is not easy to assess; some schemes may be temporarily delayed while their design is reconsidered and the assumption isthat during the period of the White Paper, this rephasing of schemes mayoffset the extra costs. The effect of the proposals will be to provide a betterenvironment alongside new roads, but it may not be possible to build thesame mileage of roads for the same costs as previously.Roads and Economic Development7. Roads have an importance in regional development, and in assisting the growth of national development beyond the regions served by a particularroad. For example, development of routes to the major ports will helpexporters. Reflecting these priorities within the programme, the government announced in March 1972 its decision to accelerate the comprehensive improve-ment of strategic routes which serve ports of special significance for tradewith the rest of Europe or are of key importance for traffic in the industrialMidlands.8. The programme also includes expenditure (particularly on local roads and maintenance) which is useful in itself, but which is intended especially to relieve regional unemployment.Fixed Price Contracts9. The figures for new construction and improvements of major roadsin the equivalent Table in Cmnd 4829 (Table 2.9) showed the expected flow of cash payments on old and new schemes at Survey prices. Payments arise from contracts let at the price of periods prior to the current survey, and workmay extend over a period of years. Therefore projections on that basis donot consistently reflect the use of real resources. It is possible, however, toarrive at some better indication of resource use for motorway, trunk and principal road works on the assumption that contract prices reflect the levelof costs at the time of letting by revaluing them to a constant tender pricebasis, and then reducing the result to the Vote Estimate price base. Themethod requires a number of assumptions to be made which cannot bequantified with any precision. They include, for example, the extent to whichbuilders had reflected assumptions about inflation in their tender price. Thefigures for major roads in Table 2.9 above have been adjusted accordingly to reflect the use of real resources (and the expenditure recorded as anestimating change). The remaining expenditure in the Table is consideredalready to represent resource use.Scotland10. The Scottish trunk road programme continues to be closely gearedto the economic development of Scotland. The figures in Table 2.9 allow forthe completion, by the mid-1970s, of the trunk road dual carriageway andmotorway network serving the populous and industrialised areas of central scotland. The emphasis is now shifting to the modernisation of the trunk road network in the rest of the country. North Sea oil development is animportant factor in determining priorities; additional funds have already been
made available to accelerate the improvement of the main trunk routes serving the areas most immediately affected.Wales11. In Wales the major element in the Governments strategy in termsof expenditure is the improvement of the east-west communications acrossnorth and south Wales. The westward extension of the M4 motorwayis considered of crucial importance to the economy of the whole of industrialsouth Wales and the figures reflect the additional funds to be made availablefor the completion of this strategic route as quickly as possible.The Economic Appraisal of Road Schemes12. The economic value of the inter-urban road programme is based onappraisal of individual schemes, in relation to the network as a whole. TheGovernment is introducing sophisticated computer-based techniques for thisappraisal. These techniques assess the net present value of quantifiable costs and benefits to the community arising from a road scheme over a period of30 years. Quantifiable costs include construction and maintenance costs; the calculation of benefits is based on savings in journey times and from reduc-tions in accidents and in vehicle operating costs. Schemes in preparation and likely to be carried out during the 1970s are generally expected to offer ahigh rate of return, calculated as. a ratio of social benefits to costs. the calculation of the economic benefits of urban roads is a great deal more complex. One has to consider the interaction of many different routes; ofthe different modes of transport; and current and future policies on combiningroad and rail facilities, and providing for public and private road vehicles.The most promising solutions seem to lie in the development of integratedurban transport plans, involving balanced investment in, or to support, public transport as well as road construction. Much work has been done on these plans, in, for example, Liverpool, the SELNEC area, Tyneside and Glasgow.Planning the principal road programme is becoming more and more closely linked with planning investment in, and operating policies of, public transport,(See paragraph 2 under Surface transport, page 52).Maintenance13. The maintenance programme for the trunk road system includes specialexpenditure to bring the system to the initial standards proposed in the reportof the Marshall Committee. It is hoped that in England this acceleration ofwork will bring the maintenance of trunk roads to the Marshall initialstandards by the end of the financial year 1973-74, although in Scotland andWales the programme may take somewhat longer to complete. Additionally,in order to get the best value from this expenditure, extra funds were allocated for small improvements to be carried out with the maintenance operations inEngland so as to improve, for example, bad alignment, poor visibility anddrainage defects.14. Examination of the implications of the recommendations of the marshall report is continuing. In England and Wales, a broad assessmenthas been made of the work and money involved and a similar one is beingcarried out in Scotland. Discussions will take place with the Local authority associations to establish what priorities should govern the direction andpace at which work will proceed. Discussions in this field may call for revisionof figures in the later years.

The Government provide a wide range of financial assistance to public transport. The largest item in Support to nationalised industries in Table2.10 above represents the grants that are made to the British Railways Board(BRB) for unremunerative passenger services which are judged to be sociallyor economically desirable but which the Board could not otherwise be expectedto provide. These grants are expected to amount to about  62 million in1972-73. The figure for 1972-73 also includes the special grants of  27 million to BRB and  7 million to the National Bus Company to enable them tocomply with their statutory financial duty whilst ait the same time responding to the CBI initiative on prices. (As stated in the House of Commons on 27thJuly by the Minister for Transport Industries further support to the BRB willbe needed for 1972 and 1973 in addition to the  27 million included in theprovision.) Provision is also made for grants to the BRB and the british transport Docks Board towards the extra cost of bringing forward certaininvestment so as to stimulate employment. Other forms of assistance include(under Other surface transport) bus fuel grants and grants made by localauthorities towards the cost of maintaining certain rural bus and ferryservices.2. Further substantial Government assistance is provided through capital grants to local authorities and nationalised industries to encourage major improvements to public transport facilities particularly those servingcommuters. These improvements are generally based on comprehensivetransport plans for each area, in which investment in public transport is relatedwhere appropriate to major road construction. Provision has been increasedby some  45 million in the 3-year period from 1973-74, compared with theestimates in Cmnd 4829 revalued, mainly to allow for further major schemesof this kind. The investments to which the grants relate make up theInfrastructure expenditure shown in Table 2.10, and include aproved costsattributable to the Liverpool Terminal Loop and Exchange-Central Link, theelectrification of some North London rail services and of the Hamilton Circleline in Scotland, the Heathrow Link (included in &quot;Other passenger transport&quot;
in Cmnd 4829), the Fleet Line and the Borough Market junction improvement.Other provision is made for expenditure on new railway rolling stock forexample, on London Transports Northern and Piccadilly lines re-signallingschemes associated with commuter services, and for expenditure on other forms of public transport such as busways, bus lanes and interchanges.3. Bus operators are expected also to continue to benefit substantiallyfrom grants which are available towards their major item of capital expenditure,the purchase of new buses for use on stage services. This will stimulate thedevelopment of one-man operation and assist the operators in maintainingup-to-date fleets. Investment in new buses (on which grant is now paid at therate of 50 per cent) by municipal bus operators, Passenger TransportExecutives and the London Transport Executive appears under Otherpassenger transport in Table 2.10 (Grants in respect of new buses are alsopaid to the National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group whoseinvestment appears under nationalised industries capital expenditure in Table2.8).4.  The other main items in the Surface transport programme are Support to nationalised transport industries(a) BRB receive grants under section 40 of the Transport Act 1968pending the elimination of surplus track and signalling capacity which is at present a burden on their operating account. Theprovision is tapered over a five year period from 1st January 1969,reflecting the progressive elimination of surplus capacity.(b) The National Freight Corporation receive grants under Section 5of the Transport Act 1968 in respect of the deficit on their subsidi-ary National Carriers Limited, taken over from BRB on 1st January1969. This provision is also tapered over the five year period, reflect-ing the progress of the subsidiary to a sound financial footing.(c) The provision includes grants payable to the British WaterwaysBoard (BWB) under section 43 of the Transport Act 1968 in respectof essential maintenance of the Board&apos;s waterways, and on theimprovement to modern traffic standards of about 400 bridgescarrying public roads over (the Board&apos;s canals. The government&apos;s proposals for water reorganisation include the dissolution of theBWB and the transfer of its waterways functions to Regional water authorities. How the proposed transfer may affect the provisioncannot yet be foreseen and the provision is, for the. moment, beingretained under this heading at the level envisaged in Cmd 4829revalued.id) The provision also covers grants to the Scottish Transport Group inrespect of losses on the Western Highlands and Islands services.Other surface transport(a) Ports: the estimates cover investment by public trust and localauthority ports, and grants and loans to private sector ports. Theestimates include expenditure on the new dock system at Seaforthon the Mersey (amounting to  46 million by 1974-75) and a newentrance lock at Grangemouth on the Forth ( 10 million by 1974-75).(b) Miscellaneous transport services: this includes expenditure on road safety and rail research, and receipts of fees charged for services such as driving tests and vehicle tests. In recognition of the impor-tance of road safety, encouragement is being given to the County
Councils and the London authorities to implement road safetymeasures, and in the Local Government Act 1972 they are design a-ted as the road safety authorities. In due course statutory road safetyduties will be placed upon them. The rail research estimates coverassistance to the BRB&apos;s research and development programme at theRailway Technical Centre, Derby (where work on the AdvancedPassenger Train is in progress).housing table 2.11  million	1971-72 pro-visional	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate	1976-77 estimate	outturn					At 1972 Survey prices Subsidies Option mortgage......

The public expenditure estimates should be seen against the back-ground of the broad objectives of the Governmenfs housing policies whichare to secure the provision of housing in response to needs and demands. the subsidies provided by the Housing Finance Act 1972 and the Housing(Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1972 which became law in the summer of 1972 will promote these objectives in the rented sector. The new slum clearance subsidy will provide a strong financial incentive to an acceleration of slum clearance and the suitable redevelopment of cleared sites.2. In the field of owner occupation the Governmenfs aims are a high level bf\new building in the private sector, the encouragement of the sale of council houses, adequate lending facilities through local authorities in addi-tion to those provided by building societies, and special assistance throughthe option mortgage scheme.3. The improvement of suitable older houses to modern standards con-tinues as an important element in these aims, in both the public and private sectors, and in the fields of both renting and owner occupation.4. The policy changes arise from changes made during the passage through Parliament of the 1972 Housing Finance Acts, the decision to legis-late to provide allowances for tenants of furnished accommodation, the exten-sion of the Housing Act 1971, and increased environmental improvement grants. Provision has also been made for increased lending by local authori-
ties to housing associations and for additional costs on land and slum clearance by reason of the provisions of the Land Compensation Bill. Theestimating changes arise mainly from increased sales of council houses,revisions reflecting the current level of building by local authorities, more accurate estimates of improvements by local authorities, and reduced localauthority lending estimates in the light of the availability of funds from build-ing societies (partially offset by more lending on council house sales).Subsidies5. These estimates include three main elements. The first is centralgovernment subsidies in connection with the provision of housing by localauthorities, new town authorities, the Scottish Special Housing association and other housing associations; these are from 1972-73 onwards based on thenew pattern of housing finance introduced by the 1972 Housing Finance Actswhich concentrate help on the people and areas which need it most. Thesecond element is rate fund contributions. Thirdly, this entry covers centralgovernment and local authority expenditure on rent rebates for council* tenants and rent allowances for private tenants. Included here are estimates of rent allowances for tenants of private furnished accommodation, for which legislation is to be introduced in 1972-73. The figures do not however includethe contributions paid in supplementary benefit towards rent.6. The high totals for 1972-73 and 1973-74 include provision for the pay-ment of outstanding claims under the old subsidy system. The basis of theestimates for 1973-74 and succeeding years is inevitably less firm than underthe old subsidy system because a prime objective of the new system is that itshould be responsive, year by year, to the actual needs of authorities andtenants. The estimates have therefore to take account of a wide range of factors which affect the financing of local authority housing.Option Mortgages7. When the option mortgage scheme was introduced in 1968 about160,000 existing mortgagors changed to option mortgages. The number of newoption mortgages has risen from nearly 40,000 in 1968-69 to nearly 70,000a year. This reflects the strong and growing demand for owner occupation and doubtless a growing awareness of the benefits of the scheme itself. Theestimated total number of option mortgagors by the middle of 1972.wasabout 350,000.Improvements8. An essential part of the Governments housing policy is to promote the, improvement of older houses and their environment, and the conversionof suitable, properties, in both the private and public sectors. In the private sector, improvement grants (identified in the Table, and representing some30-40 per cent of the total of improvement expenditure) are available to helpowners to meet part of the cost of improvements. Grants are normally halfof the approved cost with higher grants being available for a limited period in the development and intermediate areas, under the Housing Act 1971.Loans for the balance of the costs of improvements are available from localauthorities; figures for these are included in the line for general lending. Inthe private sector there have been no significant changes in the estimatesfrom last year.
9. Local authorities are also encouraged, through Government aid, toimprove their older housing stock; estimated expenditure in this area is shown under Local authority improvement investment. Response to the Housing Act1971 by local authorities has been much greater than expected and this,together with additional expenditure expected to arise from the proposed extension of that Act for a further year, and revised estimating techniqueshas caused the estimates to increase by about  80 million in 1972-73, reducingto about  50 million by 1975-76. Although it is intended that the special arrangements introduced by the 1971 Act will not apply to works completedafter June 1974, it is expected that expenditure will continue at a high level for several years thereafter, certainly at a level above that experienced priorto 1971.10. The trend has been one of a sharp increase in the rate of approvalsfor improvement, &quot;discretionary&quot; grants (from 58,491 in 1968 to 170,816in 1971) and a decline in the standard grant approvals, (from 69,404 in 1968to 61,695 in 1971 reflecting generally rising standards. This trend is expectedto continue.Investment11. The estimates indicate the gross capital expenditure on public sector housing by local authorities (apart from improvement work), new townauthorities and the Scottish Special Housing Association and on slum clear-ance; and receipts from the sale of council and new town houses.12. The level of local authority building depends on the aggregatedecisions of the local housing authorities whose duty it is to assess localneeds. No limit is currently placed on the amount of money which a localauthority may borrow for new housing schemes and the 1972 Housing Fi-nance Acts provide the financial assistance needed to enable local authorities,especially in the areas of housing shortage, to build as many houses as they need.13. Expenditure in the early years relates largely to housing schemes put to contract in the years preceding the present review period when there wasa decline in the numbers of houses put to contract by local authorities,reflecting decisions taken by these authorities in the light of the local housingsituation. The need for large scale council housebuilding in future will arisemainly in the areas where shortage, overcrowding and obsolescence are con-centrated. The estimate of the total level of expenditure is liable to frequentrevision to take account of the periodic reassessments of the programmerequired for their area which are made by those authorities who need to buildon a substantial scale.14. Government policy is to encourage local authorities to give tenantsthe opportunity to buy their houses. There has been a substantial rise in thenumbers of houses sold by local authorities and new town authorities, from,000 in 1970 to 21,000 in 1971. The level of sales in 1972 will be considerably higher.Lending15. The main constituent in these figures is lending by local authoritiesto private individuals for house purchase, including loans made to counciltenants buying their houses on mortgage or instalment terms from localauthorities. Local authority lending to private individuals for house improve-ment is also included, together with loans to housing associations.
16. Local authorities can now make loans, without being limited byspecific quotas by central Government, to defined categories of &quot;priority&quot;borrowers. These include the homeless; people living in overcrowded condi-tions; people high on a local authority&apos;s waiting list, or displaced by slum clearance or other public authority development and whom the authority would otherwise have been obliged to rehouse; and purchasers of older andsmaller property for which it may be difficult to obtain a commercial advance.17. Local authority lending to private individuals for house purchase isadditional to lending by building societies and other commercial lenders. the gross level of local authority lending therefore is, as with other lendingagencies, conditioned by the level of demand in relation to the general avail-ability of funds. In 1971-72, when the monetary quotas for local authoritylending were removed, local authorities made about 52,400 loans to private individuals purchasing other than council houses, amounting to about  133million gross. This compares with 49,300 loans amounting to about  135million gross in 1970-71. This level of lending reflected the relatively plentifulsupply of building society funds. Both local authorities and the housing corporation lend to the voluntary housing movement. In 1971-72 localauthorities made advances of some  37 million to housing associations pro-viding housing under arrangements with them, and the Housing Corporationloaned some  11 million to co-ownership housing societies. Under the housing finance Act 1972 increased provision has been made for the housing corporation to borrow from the National Loans Fund and the Corporation^to housing associations. Compared with Cmnd. 4829 revalued the overallestimates for gross lending show increases of about  30-35 million from1973-74 onwards made up largely of a substantial rise in lending to counciltenants purchasing their houses.MISCELLANEOUS LOCAL services table 2.12  million	1971-72 pro-visional outturn	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate	1976-77 estimate at 1972 Survey prices						Capital expenditure						Public health and avoidance of						pollution              ..	317-3	354-8	367-8	380-5	396	415Improvement of the environ-						ment and&apos;local facilities	1480	217-6	249-1	215-3	198	208New Towns&apos;  industrial and						commercial development etc.	30-3	39-2	38-0	37-7	33	33Current expenditure  on  these						services       ......	519-2	535-9	582-9	592-3	608	622Research	100	11-4	17-6	22-0	24	22Total..      ..      ..	1024-8	1158-9	1245-4	1237-8	1249	1298Changes from Cmnd 4829 revalued policy changes...... estimating changes Cmnd 4829 revalued   ..	-24-4 1049-2	4-55-3 -10-4 1114-0	4-99-3 -3-6 1149-7	4-29-5 -30 1205-3	-2 -6 1257	1. Services covered by this heading embrace a wide field and are mostlythe responsibility of local authorities.
Capital ExpenditurePublic Health and Avoidance of Pollution2. These services are principally those that local authorities and statutoryundertakings have to provide in the interests of public health and in orderto combat pollution. Sewerage and sewage disposal schemes account for well over half the capital expenditure in this category. The recently publishedRiver Pollution Survey shows the considerable extent of overloading of sewagetreatment works in England and Wales, and a survey of Scottish rivers hasrevealed that in the central belt over 20 per cent of rivers are either grosslypolluted or of poor quality. To bring all discharges of sewage up to the standards which river authorities expect to impose by 1980 would involve very substantial expenditure. In addition, considerable expenditure will be requiredto avoid;  codings, improve storm overflows, replace obsolete or faultysewers, meet the needs of new housing and industrial expansion, and toprovide further rural areas with main sewers and sewage treatment cacapity.For all these reasons expenditure on sewerage and sewage treatment isexpected to rise steadily.3. About a further third of the capital expenditure on this group of services relates to water supply. Demand for water is expected to doublebetween now and the end of the century and this will require continuingexpansion of investment in water resources and water supply.4; The future level of expenditure on the remaining services in this group which include refuse collection and disposal, smoke control, publicconveniences and other public health expenditure is affected in England andWales by the new capital control procedure referred to in paragraph 9. Refusedisposal expenditure is expected to increase as more waste treatment plantsare provided, to reduce tipping. The upward movement in expenditure onsmoke control is also expected to continue as the remaining areas of thecountry with severe air pollution problems are made the subject of smokecontrol orders.Improvement of the Environment and Local Facilities5. This group of services includes the reclamation of derelict land, theprovision of parks and recreational facilities, and of administrative services,and activities carried out under the Town and Country Planning Acts, as wellas a number of minor items of expenditure such as private street works,coast protection, civic theatres and restaurants, retail markets, cemeteriesand crematoria.6. Provision has been included in this White Paper for a special pro-gramrne of work over a limited period aimed at improving the appearance of neglected and unsightly land in the priority areas in England and Wales(&quot;operation eyesore&quot;), and in Scotland. Increasing expenditure on the clearance of derelict land may also be expected in the effort to repair the damage tothe environment caused by the industrial expansion of the last century.7. This heading also includes in 1972-73 and 1973-74 provision for aspecial programme of land acquisition for resale for private housingannounced by the Secretary of State for the Environment on 27th April 1972.The figures for 1974-75 onwards include offsetting reductions for proceedsfrom sale of this land.8:. The forecasts for land drainage in Englandand Wales include expendi-ture on the Thames Flood Barrier and associated works, both interim works
required upstream and permanent works downstream of the proposed barrier.The estimates are higher than those in Cmnd 4829 revalued mainly becausethe extent of the works required has become clearer. However, detaileddesign work has not yet reached the stage where precise cost estimates canbe made.9. Most of the other services in the group are affected by the new systemof capital control introduced in England and Wales in April 1971, and forthree of the Scottish cities in the current financial year, which permits indi-vidual authorities to determine locally their own order of priorities on certain types of projects within a total annual amount. The preliminary indications are that this new procedure will lead to some changes in the future pattern of expenditure on individual services both in this programme and in othersfrom that which had been previously forecast. But the analysis has not yetbeen completed in sufficient detail for the effects to be incorporated in thepresent figures.10. However, in 1970-71, higher than expected expenditure was incurred on sports and recreational facilities and the indications are that increasingamounts will be spent as local authorities respond to local pressure to provide additional outlets for use of increased leisure time. Further stimulus would be afforded by the grants which the Sports Councils may make towards selectedprojects.11. Expenditure under the Town and Country Planning Acts accountedfor over a third the total expenditure under Improvement of the environ-ment and local facilities in 1970-71. The greater part was spent on the redevelopment of town centres on which the financial responsibility of localauthorities is limited mainly to the acquisition of land. With the continuingneed for urban renewal this high level of expenditure may be expected tocontinue.12. Local government reorganisation outside London will create a demandfor additional office accommodation to replace existing premises, some ofwhich will be wrongly sited and inadequate for the needs of the new authorities. It will take some years to meet this demand and some increase in expenditure on administrative services must therefore be expected for sometime to come.13; The total provision within this heading for locally determined expen-diture reflects the Governments view of the reasonable rate of growth on these activities having regard to the pressure for increased expenditure on the itemsmentioned above and on improvement of the environment generally, butbearing in mind also the other calls on public expenditure.New Towns&quot; Industrial and Commercial Development, etc.14. This group comprises expenditure by new town development corpora-tions mostly on acquisition of land, site works for, and construction of,industrial and commercial buildings. It is net of disposals to the private sector but includes corporations&apos; expenditure on development of town centres.Other public expenditure on new towns is grouped with the main programmes of the appropriate services.Current Expenditure15.  The figure for 1973-74 so far as England and Wales are concerned is
based on the forecast arrived at with the local authority associations in thecourse of the rate support grant settlement for that year. It makes provisionfor additional expenditure which will arise in preparation for the reorganisa-tion of local government on 1st April 1974. The Governments view in reaching the rate support grant settlement was that joint action was requiredby central and local government to keep down the increase in rates in 1973-74.The settlement therefore made allowance for a reduction of  10 million from the level of current expenditure which might otherwise have been achieved, as the local authorities contribution to this joint action. The reduc-tion in expenditure which it is expected local authorities will achieve by in-creasing operational efficiency and by foregoing improvements which are within their discretion has for convenience been set against Miscellaneouslocal services in this White Paper. In practice however the savings will be shared by all local authority programmes.16. The figures for 1974-75 and 1975-76 are also based on forecastsarrived at in discussion with the local authority associations. These howeverwill be subject to further negotiation when the rate support grant settlement for those years is made. For the following year the figures imply continuedgrowth of expenditure at broadly the rate shown in earlier years after das-regarding the temporary effect of the changeover to the new system of localgovernment. Actual expenditure over the period of the forecasts will depend upon the expenditure decisions of individual authorities in the light of therate support grant settlement for each year. The Scottish forecasts of current expenditure by local authorities are provisional since the negotiations on therate support grant settlement for 1973-74 and 1974-75 are still in progress.Research17. This heading includes all research expenditure by the Department of the environment in the environmental, building and transport fields. It coversexpenditure on the departments four Research Establishments, the transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), the Building Research Establish-ment, the Water Pollution Research Laboratory and the Hydraulics ResearchStation; on departmentally sponsored research, and on grants to research associations and other bodies. The growth in expenditure from  11.4 million in 1972-73 to  22 miHion in 1976-77 reflects recognition of the importanceof research in these fields, which account for a very large volume of public expenditure. About one third of the expenditure at the beginning of the periodrising to about one half in the latter part of the period will be incurred bythe TRRL.

The Law and Order programme covers a wide range of social expendi-ture, including the administration of justice, the general protective servicesof police, fire and the control of immigration; prisons, probation and after-care and various community services. It includes the cost of the home departments, the Legal Departments, the Houses of Parliament and the privy council. A large proportion of the expenditure on law and order is influenced by social and demographic factors which are not within the direct controlof central or local government; the determinants of expenditure are such factors as the incidence of crime, the weight of traffic, the numbers committed to custody by the courts, the work load of the courts and the incidence offires. Most of the expenditure is incurred initially by local authorities on services to which the Government contributes through specific grants or therate support grant.
Home Departments&apos; ServicesPolice2. The Government intends to continue the development of a well-manned and operationally efficient police force by encouraging recruitment,providing supporting services, and improving technological facilities, equip-ment and buildings. The forecasts assume that police strengths will rise from108,850 to about 128,000 compared with a growth of about 11,200 over theprevious 5 years. In the same period the numbers of civilians are expectedto rise from 41,700 to 56,550, including provision for an additional 5,350traffic wardens. The forecasts of civilian staff start from a base about 2,700below the assumptions in the Cmnd 4829 figures, mainly because the recruit-ment of traffic wardens was less than had been estimated.3. The forecasts provide for operational support services, and include a modest increase in expenditure on research into police methods, equipment and telecommunications. They provide for new building work at some forensicscience laboratories, wireless depots, the Police College, and some urgently needed police headquarters buildings now included in the forward programmes as the shape of local government re-organisation becomes clearer; equipment for the wireless rental scheme; the police national computer; vehicles andother equipment.4. It is difficult to allocate the increased expenditure between improve-ments and maintenance of existing standards because the crime and trafficproblems with which the police have to deal are continually expanding; but alarge proportion of the increased manpower is intended to bring policestrengths up to existing and revised establishments, and to provide for moretraffic wardens to enable better provision to be made for urban traffic schemes.Prisons5. The general aims of expenditure on the treatment of offenders reflect the need to continue the prison building programme to cater for the expected increase in prison population in a situation where existing capacity is alreadyseriously overcrowded; and to develop new methods of non-custodial treat-ment under the supervision of the probation and after-care service, taking account of their possible effect on the size of the prison population.6. The main assumptions underlying the forecasts are that the inmatepopulation will increase from 48,800 to 62,250 and that there will be anincrease of 6,050 non-industrial staff of all grades. The population forecastsstart from a lower base than was assumed in Cmnd 4829; and there has beena further recent drop in the inmate population in England and Wales belowthe revised forecasts; but it is expected that over the period the rising trend in the population will be resumed.7. The staff growth will do little more than keep pace with the expected increase in the population, so that the ratio of staff to inmates will improveonly marginally over the present ratio of 1:2.7, and there is unlikely to be a significant reduction in overtime working. In England and Wales provision isalso made for an increase in the number of probation officers seconded for social welfare work in prison establishments, and their numbers are forecast to rise from 360 in 1972-73 to 515 in 1976-77. Consideration is being givento the introduction of more ancillary workers to take over part of the routinework which does not require professional expertise, so as to enable the
probation officers to undertake more positive casework; provision is made onthe assumption that their numbers would increase from 12 in 1972-73 toabout 180 in 1976-77. In Scotland, consideration is being given to the transferof responsibility for this work to local authority social work departments.8. The capital programme, which accounts for the greater part of theincrease in forecast expenditure, has been phased so as to continue the buildingeffort put in hand to maintain starts of an average of about 3,400 new places ayear over the period. It will continue to aim to place most emphasis on the pro-vision of more adult training prisons and more young offender accommoda-tion. The programme allows for purpose built establishments, for the adap-tation of certain &quot;camp&quot; sites, and for the expansion of some existing establish-ments. Overall, the programme assumes the provision of about 14,000 placesover the period, an increase matching the expected growth in prison population.9. Despite the recent drop in prison population figures there are still about15,000 inmates sleeping two or three in a cell. If the population forecasts inparagraph 6 are realised the present capital programme is unlikely to reducegreatly the numbers sleeping two or three in a cell, although the proportionof the population doing so should fall.10. The forecast expenditure includes provision of some 5,200 quarters forprison officers including those built with new establishments, to cover the needsof new recruitment, to provide a limited number of replacements and to reducethe current backlog.Probation and after-care (England and Wales)11. The main assumptions are that the number of probation officers will rise over the period from 3,500 to just over 5,000 (compared with a growth of920 in the previous 5 years) and ancillary staff from 145 to 425. The figure ofover 5,000 probation officers allows for a greater expansion of the service andconsequentially increased training arrangements than was envisaged in theCmnd 4829 forecasts following re-examination of the manpower require-ments of the probation service as recommended by the House of CommonsExpenditure Committee (First Report, Session 1971-72, HC47). The additional cost involved has been found by some rephasing of prisons capital expenditurein the years 1975-76 and 1976-77.12. The forecasts provide for expenditure to make available some 1,650places in new adult hostels which are expected to operate under the control of probation and after-care committees. Additional provision (not previouslyincluded in the estimates) of  0.2 million in 1972-73 rising to  3.2 million in1976-77 is made for the experimental introduction and subsequent wider imple-mentation in England and Wales of new developments relating to community service, day training centres and bail hostels, as an alternative to custodialtreatment of offenders; and for after-care hostels. Additional funds have beenmade available amounting to  0.8 million over the period for the encourage-ment of voluntary social service with special reference to voluntary after-carehostels. It is assumed that there will be some 1,200 hostel places available atthe beginning of 1972-73, and that 200 additional places in voluntary hostelswill be provided in each year of the period.Fire Services13. The main assumptions are that the numbers of whole-time firemen will increase over the period from 28,400 to 30,150, an increase of 1,750 (compared
with growth of just over 500 in the previous 5 years); while civilian staff will increase from 4,350 to 5,200, an increase of 850. The latter figures include1,120 firemen and 145 civilians, respectively, to implement the recommenda-tions of the Departmental Committee o nthe Fire Service, mainly to provideimproved training. The complements of the retained (part-time) and juniorfiremen are expeoted to remain steady during the period at 16,400 and 160respectively.14. The balance of the additional recruitment figures are for the basic needsof the service in dealing with the increasing inoidence of fire and fire risks. the forecasts have been based on the assumption that, with improved pay resultingfrom the Cunningham Report, the improvements in recruitment experiencedduring 1971-72 will continue.15. The estimates from 1973-74 onwards provide for the building and run-ning costs of a central recruit training establishment recommended by theDepartmental Committee on the Fire Service.Other services16. Expenditure, which is mainly by way of grants to statutory or voluntary bodies, is shown to fall in 1973-74 and then to rise slowly over the rest of theperiod. The picture is however distorted by the inclusion in 1972-73 of 6.6 million in respect of capital expenditure of a non-recurring nature on the urban Programme (mainly for regional infrastructure), and of  7.2 million inrespect of a grant in aid to the Uganda Resettlement Board. No provision hasbeen included for the Uganda Resettlement Board after 1972-73 as it is notyet possible to estimate the expenditure for later years.17.   The main factors in the increase are:  Urban Programme of aid in areas of social need: Excluding theonce-for-all capital items mentioned above, expenditure is forecast to rise from  12.0 million in 1972-73 to  16.6 million in 1976-77. Ofthe expenditure a total of  6.9 million over the period representsexpenditure additional to that envisaged in the Cmnd 4829 figures,so as to give additional impetus to the programme.Criminal Injuries Compensation Board: The increase over the periodof  2.2 million is based on a total intake of 9,900 cases in 1972-73rising to 15,255 in 1976-77, coupled with a higher proportion of awards.18. The estimates also allow for a modest increase in expenditure on theWomen&apos;s Royal Voluntary Service, the Community Relations Commissionand the Race Relations Board; and for the first time include a notional sum for the voluntary repatriation scheme under the Immigration Act 1971.Law CourtsEngland and Wales19. Local Authorities are responsible for expenditure on Magistrates&apos;Courts, Coroners&apos; Court and other lower Courts which together representabout 55 per cent of the total expenditure on Law Courts in England andWales. About two-thirds of the expenditure on lower Courts is for day today running costs. The average growth rate of 7 per cent a year reflects the need to keep pace with the expected increase in the work load of thecourts which is closely related to the rise in detected crime. The forecast for capital expenditure includes provision for the replacement of existing court
buildings which have been taken over for use as higher courts. practically all of the forecast expenditure is required to maintain the existing standards of the service.20. For higher Courts, provision is made for a centralised building programme to fulfil the recommendation of the Royal Commission under lord Beeching that the Lord Chancellor should be responsible for ensuring that new courts are built and maintained by the central Government whereverneeded. The programme over the next 5 years is aimed at reducing the delays in Greater London in bringing cases to trial, and at ensuring thatdelays do not accumulate elsewhere. The ultimate aim is to reduce delays in London to an average of 8 weeks from the present average 24 weeks,and to provide courts elsewhere to meet the projected increase in criminal cases without lengthening the period between committal and trial.Scotland21. From April 1973 Sheriff Court accommodation will become theresponsibility of the central Government. Expenditure is expected to increase by about  1^ million over the period, following the introduction of amodernisation programme to replace unsuitable court-house buildings and bring accommodation up to the standard necessary to cope with the increasingwork-load on the court service.Legal Aid22. The object of the expenditure is to make legal aid, advice and assistance available for persons of limited means. The scope of the schemesis fixed by statute, with the result that the level of expenditure will depend onthe number of qualifying applicants.23. Expenditure is expected to rise steadily over the period, in line withthe upward trends in litigation and the general work-load of the courts. Thenumber of cases in which legal aid is granted is expected to rise by about10 per cent a year in civil cases and by about 9 per cent in criminal cases. The levels of expenditure are affected also by improvement to thegeneral facilities of the schemes. Provision is also made for the introduction in 1973-74 of the new scheme embodied in the Legal Advice and AssistanceAct 1972 which is estimated to cost  1.7 million in the first year, rising to 2.6 million by 1976-77. This represents an improvement in existing legal aid facilities.24. By comparison with Cmnd 4829 revalued, the figures show a decreaseof  2.9 million over the period 1972-73 to 1975-76, but this is due to anestimating revision to the previous estimates and does not indicate a fall-offin demand.

The Arts programme now includes expenditure on local as well as national museums and galleries. Expenditure on national libraries, the RoyalGeographical Society and the British Institute of Recorded Sound has beentransferred to the Education and libraries programme. The British MuseumLibrary is to become part of the British Library; the provisionally estimatedshare of the British Museum expenditure which is in respect of the british museum Library has accordingly been transferred to the Education andlibraries programme.Museums and Galleries2. The capital expenditure shown for the national museums and galleriesis the revalued estimate of the cost shown in Cmnd 4829 of the capital pro-gramme announced in May 1971. Expenditure for the year 1973-74 also includes the Governmenfs increased contribution to the furnishing and
equipping of the building for the Museum of London which, in accordancewith the decision announced in the House of Commons on 9th August 1972,and subject to the necessary legislation, will be  300,000. Assisted areas arebenefitting from additional provision of  1.3 million for schemes at localmuseums.3. Provision for the national museums and galleries allows for themaintenance of, and additions to, the collections. It is estimated that theintroduction of admission charges to these national institutions will producereceipts of  1 million net in a full year, of which  900,000 will be realisedwithin the Arts programme.National Theatre4. Provisions of  1.5 million (Government) and  1 million (Greater Lon-don Council has been included for the National Theatre for 1973-74. Thesefigures reflect the decision announced in the House of Commons on 9thAugust 1972 that direct expenditure from central Government funds on thenew National Theatre would be increased from  3.75 million to  5.7 million,and GLC expenditure from  4.25 million to  4.7 million. The increase in the direct central Government contribution is subject to the passing of theNational Theatre and Museum of London Bill introduced on 1st November1972.Arts Council and other arts expenditure . Capital provision continues to be made but at an increased rate toenable the Arts Council of Great Britain and the British Film Institute toproceed with the programme for Housing the Arts and Housing the Cinema.A special addition of  800,000 has been made for schemes in assisted areas,the work to be completed by the end of 1973.6. Continued provision for annual growth in current expenditure forthe Arts Council will enable the Council to increase its support for regionalactivity in music, art, drama and other fields without reducing its support forthe major national enterprises. For example the Council have made an initialallocation for 1972-73 of  700,000 for the Regional Arts Associations, anincrease of more than 50 per cent over the corresponding provision for theprevious year.7. The British Film Institute continues to encourage the appreciation offilm as an art form by supporting the development of film theatres, often in collaboration with the Regional Arts Associations and in association with the arts Council, and maintaining the National Film Archive. Provision for theNational Film School is based on the terms of grant support originallyenvisaged for the first few years of its life. Provision of  0.2 million a year ismade for the Crafts as from 1972-73.8. Provision for expenditure of  6 million has been made in 1973-74 forthe purchase of land to enable the Government to safeguard a site at covent garden for possible future development of the Royal Opera House.

This programme has been redesignated &quot;Education and libraries&quot; in recognition of the fact that it now covers national as well as local libraries.The provision for national libraries now includes the British Museum Library,which will form part of the British Library from 1st April 1973. Provision forthe Royal Geographical Society and the British Institute of Recorded Soundhas also been transferred from the Arts programme. On the other handprovision for local museums is no longer grouped with local libraries and now appears in the Arts programme. ,2. Table 2.15 above shows that expenditure on education and librariesin Great Britain is planned to rise by  482 million in the period 1972-73 to1976-77. In 1976-77 the education and libraries programme is expected to account for 14.5 per cent of all public expenditure. This growth in expendi-ture represents an increase of 3.4 per cent a year, excluding the relative price effect.3. Policy decisions on the development of certain major sectors ofeducation over the next decade have recently been announced in Cmnd 5174for England and Wales and Cmnd 5175 for Scotland. They include a sub-stantial development in provision for nursery education, allocation of furtherresources for the improvement and replacement of school buildings including
secondary schools, the acceleration of the special schools building programme,improvements in the arrangements for the in-service training of teachers and the continued expansion of higher education. All these developmentswill begin to affect the level of public expenditure during the next few years.4. Within current policies, the pattern of growth of educational expen-diture is largely shaped by demographic factors, particularly the futurenumber of pupils, students and teachers. The relevant forecasts underlyingthese expenditure projections are shown in the following table:  Thousands	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77Schools					Primary pupils^)........	5,853	5,868	5,844	5,862	5,855Secondary pupils	3,700	4,122	4,262	4,406	4,527Teachers (primary and secondary)	449	469	488	506	522Further Education studentsp)	771	759	768	802	839Colleges of Education students (3)	133	134	134	134	134Universities Full-time students	243	251	264	283	306(i)These include under fives, expressed as full-time equivalents.(2)These figures take into account the proportionate demands on facilities of full-time,sandwich, part-time and evening students and are expressed as full-time equivalents.They cover polytechnics as well as other further education institutions.(3)These figures are provisional, for England and Wales, and subject to review inthe light of decisions about the future role of the colleges of education.Current expenditure . The forecasts reflect the levels of local authority current expenditurein England and Wales for 1973-74 assumed for the rate support grant inthat year and these mainly account for the estimating changes shown inTable 2.15. In Scotland the settlement for 1973-75 is still under negotiation.6. The additional number of children under five expected to be withinthe public education sys,em by 1976-77, as provision for nursery education is developed, is estimated to be 230,000. After the initial impact of the raising of the school leaving age staffing standards in the primary and second-dary schools should improve steadily towards the target set in the two educa-tion White Papers.7. In further education a continuing expansion of the number of studentsundertaking advanced work is planned. The estimates also take account .of arise over the period as a whole in the numbers attending other courses, butthe pattern of this development will be uneven, since, with the raising of theschool leaving age, further education colleges will no longer have to cater for15 year old school leavers. As Cmnd 5174 indicates, the future role of the colleges of education in England and Wales will need to be reviewed inconsequence of the Governmenfs policy for the staffing of the schools, andthe consequential reduction in the likely requirement for training places. Nofirm forecasts can thus be made at present. Student numbers and costs shownin the Tables above assume a continuation of the total capacity of the colleges as hitherto planned. This is not intended to prejudge the outcome of any review, but to indicate the scale on which the Government intend to provide higher education places in addition to those planned for the universities, the polytechnics and other colleges of further education. Theuniversity forecasts derive from the Governments decisions on the level offinancial support for the universities during the next quinquennium, covering the five academic years 1972-77.
8. Improvement elements for non-teaching costs in schools and further education are included within the forecasts of current expenditure. Theseallow for an increase in 1973-74 of  37 million over the figure for 1971-72,with a further planned increase of  63 million by 1976-77.Capital expenditure. The capital expenditure figures are derived from the related startsprogrammes which determine the value of work authorised to begin in theyear in question. These starts programmes reflect the increased number of places required for pupils and students by the time the building work is completed.10. Besides taking account of expected changes in the school population,the primary and secondary school building programme also provides forthe developments announced in the two education White Papers. Specificprogrammes for the improvement and replacement of primary schools, arealready under way, and corresponding programmes for secondary schools,on a smaller scale, are planned to start from 1975-76. The resources allocated for these programmes allow for starts of  65 million in 1973-74 rising to 75 million in 1976-77. Provision has been made for an increase in the specialschool building programme with starts totalling  13 million in 1972-73 rising to  21 million in 1976-77. From 1974-75  18 million a year will be madeavailable for the places required in the developing provision for children under five.11. The university and further education building programmes providefor the rising student populations and allow some improvement in buildingsincluding the expansion of facilities for residence for students in polytechnics.The teacher training programme continues to provide mainly for the replace-ment of the worst sub-standard buildings.12. The capital expenditure forecasts include in the years 1972-74  51million authorised by the government to be spent on educational building,particularly schools, as part of the special programme on infrastructure inthe development and intermediate areas.13. Control of capital expenditure on the youth service and local librariesin England and Wales rests with the local authorities where it forms partof the locally determined sector of local authority capital programmes. InScotland there is central control of capital expenditure on the youth and community service and partial central control in the case of the library service.

The scope of the programme remains unchanged since last year exceptfor the inclusion of expenditure carried out on behalf of the Health Depart-ments by the Medical Research Councd, transferred from the research council&apos;s programme. Its overall objective is to secure, within the resourcesprovided, the best combination of health and personal social services to meetthe needs of the population. This implies that the services should be organised to provide comprehensive treatment and care effectively and efficiently;balanced to remove inadequacies in particular localities or particular types of care; modified as needs are altered by demographic, morbidity and socialchanges; and developed in step with public expectations of rising standards,with advances in medical knowledge and with professional awareness of tech-nological and other progress. The reorganisation of the National health service and of local government will further the development of the health and personal social services through collaborative planning.2. There will continue to be special emphasis on services for the elderly,the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and the physically disabledincluding the younger disabled requiring long-term care; and additionalemphasis will be given to services for alcoholics and homeless single people.It is also intended that family planning services provided under the national health Service should be substantially expanded in order to reduce the distresscaused by regretted pregnancies, and to help people to choose the numberof children they want and space their births in the interests of the well-being
of the family as a whole. Particular attention will be given to those whosemedical and social needs to avoid pregnancy are greatest.3. The four years to 1975-76 include the special additions made by theGovernment last year and the year before mainly to speed improvement of services for the elderly, the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped, anddevoted to a large extent to improvements in accommodation and standards of service. The figure for current expenditure in 1972-73 on other centralservices and grants includes an addition of  3 million to aid very severelycongenitally disabled children, in accordance with the Secretary of State&apos;announcement on 29th November 1972. The planned average annual rateof increase for the whole programme between 1971-72 and 1976-77 is 3.9per cent excluding the relative price effect.Hospital Services4. The planned growth rate for current expenditure on hospital services is 3.5 per cent annually during the period of the programme. This will be supplemented by savings through improvements in efficiency and redeploymentof services. Further progress will be made in reducing inequalities betweenregions, but decisions on local priorities will continue to be made by individualhealth service authorities, with regard to national policies contained in guid-ance issued from time to time by the Departments. It is estimated that about half to one per cent is required each year to maintain services at existingstandards for the growing population, the changing age structure of which isleading to an increase in the proportion of elderly people. About 2-J per centis needed for the running costs of new and improved facilities provided in thecapital building programme. The remainder of the additional resources willbe devoted to developments in services, including general improvements andmeeting unsatisfied demand. In England and Wales high priority has beengiven to bringing standard of staffing, living conditions and personal clothingup to minimum tolerable levels, where these have not already been reached,in hospitals for the mentally ill and in geriatric units, and to bringing minimum standards for the mentally handicapped up to the levels outlined in Cmnd4683 &quot;Better Services for the Mentally Handicapped&quot;. The beds to whichthese standards apply amount to 60 per cent of all occupied beds in hospitals.The acute services account for most of the remaining 40 per cent of bedsand for 95 per cent of out-patient attendances. In this area the additional resources will be devoted to improvements in the quality of the service.Further reductions are expected to be made in the time that patients wait for admission to hospital for treatment of conditions that are not urgent, and the trend over the last eight years of an average annual increase of 2.3 per centin the numbers of in-patients treated is expected to continue.5. The. main objective of the capital building programme is to securethe best deployment of available resources so as to improve the quality anddistribution of hospital accommodation and facilities rather than to increasethe total number of beds available. It involves steady replacement of oldaccommodation which is no longer acceptable by today&apos;s standards; making good shortages of facilities; adapting to demographic changes in populationsserved; providing for new patterns of services, including assessment, dayhospital and special treatment facilities (eg for mental illness and mentalhandicap); expanding and improving facilities for teaching medical students;
and meanwhile making short term improvements to old buildings until theycan be replaced.6. The keystone of the hospital service is to be the district general hospital, in which the specialist facilities of the district will be concentrated.At present, the function of the district general hospital is in many localitiesbeing carried out in older premises or in groups of existing, smaller hospitals;preferably the district general hospital will be housed on a single site. on present plans, there will be a network of nearly 300 modern district general hospitals. About 180 are now under construction or have been completed,and by the end of the 1970&apos;s the number is planned to be about 240, somefour-fifths of the centres of the future service. But as most of these hospitalswill be built in phases it will be many years before many of them can offer a service in buildings all built or improved to modern standards.Family Practitioner services. The objectives of the general medical, dental and ophthalmic services,and the pharmaceutical service, are mainly to maintain and improve existingstandards of service. It is expected that the population needing services will grow at a rate of about 0.5 per cent per annum with an increase in the propor-tion of elderly people. The annual rate of growth in the numbers of doctors and dentists is forecast to be about twice that of the population and theexpenditure figures provide for the consequential improvements in standards of service and also for the development of more effective, but generally more costly drugs.Local Authority Health and Personal Social services. The local authority health services will be transferred to area health authorities in the reorganisation of the National Health Service in 1974. Theprogramme envisages continued development, particularly in the building ofhealth centres, and also in family planning, nursing and other domiciliaryservices.9. Local authority current expenditure on the personal social services is expected to continue to grow at a higher rate than elsewhere within the overall programme. Provision is made for an average annual growth ratefrom 1971-72 to 1976-77 of 8.5 per cent. Demographic changes, rising publicexpectations of service, and the requirements placed on local authorities by legislation will call for further development of services, particularly for the elderly, the mentally ill, the mentally and physically handicapped, and for children in residential care. The reorganised local authority social servicesdepartments now responsible for the full range of personal social services arein a position to make a broad assessment of the pattern of provision bestadapted to the needs of their areas, and have already made some progress,particularly in the field of mental handicap, towards planning deployment of resources in collaboration with National Health Service authorities. Guide-lines for development of the personal social services have been formulatedand sent to local authorities together with a request from the Secretaries ofState that they should prepare plans for their social services for the decadeup to March 1983 (in Scotland for the period to March 1978), as a furtherstep towards better integrated planning of health and personal social services.Plans will give information about the extent of provision which local authori-ties wish to make over the respective planning periods, including information
about staff, premises and both capital and current expenditure. They will contribute to balanced deployment of resources for the future, and to the planning of manpower and training programmes.SOCIAL SECURITYTABLE 2.17  million	1971-72						pro-	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	visional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					Benefit at outturn prices:						National insurance:						Retirement pensions	20450	2363-0	25680	26190	2668	2710Sickness benefit and invalidity						benefit	417-0	501-0	5390	557-0	563	561Unemployment benefit1	2390	251-0	228-0	193 0	186	166Other national insurance bene-						fits........	252-0	287-0	301-0	305-0	304	304Industrial injuries benefits	1150	134-0	143-0	144-0	145	146War pensions     ......	136-7	153-1	157-6	1510	146	141Supplementary benefit	641-4	6760	644-0	6330	637	634Old persons pensions	22-9	260	24-0	200	17	14Family income supplement	3-7	80	90	90	9	9Attendance allowance	60	23-0	360	56-0	68	68Family allowances	343-7	343-0	351-0	353 0	354	356Lump-sum payments to pensioners	U    	820	 	 	 	 Administration......	2050	203-3	216-0	2190	214	216Total........	4427-4	5050-4	5216-6	52590	5311	5325Changes from Cmnd 4829						policy changes						(a) restoration of purchasing						power	.  	+ 138-7	+280-2	+280-7	+2S2	(b) other       ......	+ 1-0	+ 181-9	+207-2	+228-2	+240	estimating changes	-27-4	+S7-2	+46-S	+4S-9	+60	Cmnd 4829 (2)......	4453-8	4642-6	4682-4	4704-2	4729	(!) The figures for unemployment benefit are not to be regarded as reflecting a forecast of the levels to which unemployment will be reduced.(2) Taking account of the adjustment of administration expenditure to 1972 Survey prices-1. Social security payments are mainly transfers from those at work tothose not at work. The purpose is to provide income for those who haveretired, whose earnings are interrupted, or who have some other special claimor need, such as widowhood or war disablement. The benefits by which thisredistribution is effected are various because of the variety of individualcircumstances that have to be met. Some benefits are short-term, like sickness benefit, while others, like retirement pension, are long-term. Some benefitssuch as family allowances and attendance allowances do no more than supple-ment a claimants main income, which he gets from elsewhere. The maininsurance benefits make a basic provision which may be supplemented in a variety of ways. The bulk of social security payments is in this category. Thewhole structure is underpinned by the supplementary benefits scheme whichconsiders a claimants needs and resources and guarantees that those needswill be met when he cannot work.2. Much the most significant point about social security expenditure is itsconcentration on the elderly. Retirement pensions and old persons&apos; pensionsaccount for nearly half of all the expenditure at the beginning of the period
and more than half of it by the end. A further 8 per cent of the expendituregoes on supplementary benefits, war pensions and attendance allowance paidto the elderly.3. Table 2.17 above follows the established convention that social securityfigures do not reflect changes which may be made in the future but whichhave not yet been announced, since a decision about, for example, the amountof an increase in benefits need not be made too far in advance of the date from which an increase is to come into effect. The estimates for 1973-74onwards are therefore based on benefits at their present levels, and the table shows how expenditure will increase in 1974-75 and later years in accordancewith demographic and other factors affecting the numbers of beneficiaries,quite apart from any future changes in benefit levels.4. At the time that Cmnd 4829 was published the Government had announced its intention to review the basic retirement pension and related benefits every other year and ensure that, as a minimum, they retained their value. Since then the Government has decided that the review of these benefits,and the price-proteotion which it guarantees, should be annual instead ofbiennial, with upratings taking place in the second half of November. this commitment is put in statutory form in the Social Security Bill at presentbefore Parliament. Allowance is made under &quot;Price Adjustments&quot; or &quot;Adjust-ments to 1972-73 outturn price and relative price effect&quot; in the Tablesin this White Paper showing the total of public expenditure to take accountof the fact that benefits lose their value as prices rise and they have thatvalue restored at east November uprating on the annual pattern described above. The cost of any real improvement over and above the restoration oftheir value at any particular uprating would be a charge on the contingency reserve.Numbers of beneficiaries5. The number of retirement pensioners continues to grow. At present there are 7.8 million. By the end of 1976 there are expected to be 8.1 million.This increase is attributable primarily to the increase in the numbers of peopleover pensionable age; but it has also been assumed that the trend towardsearlier retirement will continue. Expenditure on old persons&apos; pensions, for those aged 80 or over and their wives and widows, declines over the period since, as time goes on, an increasing proportion of those over 80 have tideto a retirement pension at a higher rate.6. The number of children qualifying for family allowances will continueto grow; there are 7.1 million at present and it is expected that there will be .4 million by the end of 1976. This is because the number of births in thenext few years is expected to be greater than the number of children born 15or 16 years previously, and because the minimum school-leaving age is being raised in 1972-73. This increase in the number of dependant children affectsnot only expenditure on family allowances but also expenditure on supple-mentary benefit and various national insurance and industrial injuries benefits,since these provide increases for dependants.7. Allowance has been made for some reduction at the older workingages in the proportion of beneficiaries with adult dependants, since the upward trend in the proportion of married women in employment in recent years isexpected to continue.
8. Up to 1969-70 claims to sickness benefit showed an upward trend insickness rates, but  a reversal of this trend appeared in 1970-71. Experience in1971-72, on which detailed statistics are not yet available, seems likely to beabout the same as that in 1970-71. It is, however, premature to assume thatthe sickness rates of these two years are typical of those likely in the period up to 1976-77. Allowance has therefore been made for some increase abovethe level of recent experience.Increases and improvements9. Since Cmnd 4829 was published there has been a general uprating ofthe main benefits following the first of the Governmenfs annual reviews. Fromthe beginning of October 1972 the standard single rate of retirement pensionwas raised from  6 to  6.75 and corresponding improvements were made inrelated benefits. The increase in retirement pension more than restored thevalue which the pension had following the previous uprating in September1971 and provided a real improvement of about 4 per cent in its purchasingpower.10. There have been a number of other additions to expenditure since cmnd 4829:(i) The scope of attendance allowance for the very severely disabled hasbeen extended to bring in broadly those who need attention either by day or by night. The rate of allowance will be two-thirds of therate available to those who need attention by day and by night. this improvement is being introduced in phases over 1973 and 1974.The addition to expenditure is  11 million in 1973-74 rising to  43million in 1975-76.(ii) The qualifying income levels for family income supplement, and themaximum amount of benefit payable, were increased from April1972. Also, from April 1973 awards of the supplement will last forone year, instead of 6 months, without review on change of circumstances. In consequence the provision for the supplement hasbeen increased by  2 million.(iii) Proposed restrictions on the entitlement to unemployment benefit ofworkers temporarily suspended from their employment have been postponed. This adds  1 million to expenditure in 1972-73 and  4 million in each of the subsequent years.(iv) Special lump-sum payments of  10 are being made in December1972 to retirement pensioners in the United Kingdom and to othersover minimum pension age with comparable benefits. This adds  82million to expenditure in 1972-73.11. In comparing the new totals of expenditure with the figures in Cmnd4829, Table 2.17 shows separately the extra cost of the uprating in so far as this restored the value of benefits to what it was after the previous uprating.The cost of the real improvement in the value of benefits, and the additions to expenditure noted in the previous paragraph, are shown together as other policy changes.Social Security Bill12. The Government intends, subject to Parliamentary approval, that theSocial Security Bill should operate from April 1975. The Bill is primarilydesigned to make long-term improvements in the contribution structure ofnational insurance, to promote the development of sound occupational pension
schemes, and to set up a Reserve Pension Scheme for those who are not members of good occupational schemes. Reserve scheme pensions will notrank as public expenditure. Improvements in the benefits of the basic national insurance scheme are introduced when the need arises and the resources canbe found, without waiting for the implementation of the Social Security Bill.The Bill has therefore little effect on public expenditure. However, there willbe some small, but unquantifiable, increase in public expenditure throughrelaxation of some of the contribution tests for benefit; and an increase ofabout  2 million a year as the result of the payment of unemployment and sickness benefit at the adult rate to contributors under age 18.FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATIONTABLE 2.18   million	1971-72						pro-	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	visional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1972 Survey prices						Tax and rate collection ..	237-3	255-2	260-3	261-9	263	259Royal Mint        ......	3-1	-1-5	2-4	2-7	2	post-war credits	19-2	125-0	4-6	. _ ;	cv	_Other   financial  administration,						etc.	47-8	520	55-8	52-0	51.	51Total........	307-4	430-7	323-1	316-6	316	312Changes from Cmnd 4829 revalued						policy changes . .	+0-4	4-111-4	-8-4	-11-5	-10	estimating changes	4-7-6	4-5-3	4-11-5	4-11-2	4-10	Cmnd 4829 revalued	299-4	314-0	3200	316-9	316	Tax and rate collection. Over half the total is for the Inland Revenue with small sums forCustoms and Excise, the Department of the Environment, the Departmentof Health and Social Security and local authorities. The main reason for theincrease in expenditure in 1972-73 and 1973-74 is the build-up of an extra6,000 Customs and Excise staff to administer the value added tax. In the later years the estimates allow for an increase in Inland Revenue staff for the earnings related national insurance scheme, offset to some extent by a run-downin the numbers of surtax staff following the introduction in 1973-74 of the unified system of personal taxation.Royal Mint2. The estimates for the Royal Mint represent the cost of provision ofUnited Kingdom coin requirements, including expenditure totalling  2.million on equipping the new Mint in South Wales replacing the Tower HillMint. Estimated building costs for the completion of the new Mint, totalling 2.7 million are included in the above Table under Other financial administra-tion, etc.Post War Credits3. The peak of expenditure in 1972-73 reflects the Chancellor of the exchequers announcement on 14th December, 1971, that all post-war credits would be repaid as soon as possible, starting in April 1972. The subsequent years reflect the counter-balancing reductions.
Other financial administration4. The costs of the Department for Natonal Savings account for about40 per cent of the expenditure. This item also includes the cost of the Treasury,and certain costs incurred by the Bank of England, including the note issue,work on the management of the National Debt, and the Bank of England&apos;scapital expenditure.COMMON services table 2.19  million	1971-2						pro-	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	visional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1972 Survey prices						Accommodation (home) 						Capital expenditure	32-9	41-7	41-4	43-7	49	53Current expenditure						Departmental administration	25-8	25-5	23-3	21-9	23	26Rent........	39-2	48-2	54-4	54-9	56	57Maintenance and other run-						ning costs......	43-4	45-4	47-2	47-7	48	50Rates on Government pro-						perty       ......	54-6	57-3	58-8	59-8	61	62Total........	195-9	2181	225-1	228-0	237	248Stat ionery Office (home)-						Capital expenditure	4-4	6-6	6-9	5-1	6	10Current expenditure	38-8	39-7	42-7	45-6	47	45Total........	43-2	46-3	49-6	50-7	53	55Central Computer Agency	18-1	24-9	23-0	26-8	28	31Home publicity services	11-6	12-4	12-5	12-5	12	12Superannuation of civil servants in						civil departments      ..	106-5	113-1	116-6	121-8	128	135Total          ......	136-2	150-4	152-1	161-1	168	178Less 						Allied services (defence)	-1200	-1170	-1180	-1190	-123	-125(See Table 2.2)						Total........	255-3	297-8	308-8	320-8	335	356Changes from Cmnd 4829 revalued						policy changes	 	-	-4-0	-7-6	-12	estimating changes	-8-7	4-10-0	4-3-3	-3-5	4-1	Cmnd 4829 revalued	264-0	287-8	309-5	331-9	346	Accommodation (Home)1. The capital expenditure on this item is confined mainly to the office accommodation for the Home Civil Service. Expenditure on most other types of buildings with specialised functions (for example museums and galleries,Government training centres) is included in the appropriate programmeselsewhere in the White Paper. Since Cmnd 4829 the rents of specialisedbuildings have also been transferred to these programmes.2. The purpose of the capital works programme is to meet the need foroffice accommodation in those areas where suitable offices are not otherwiseavailable, and also to provide some replacement of rented accommodationby Crown property, thus checking the increase in the rent bill. The expenditureincludes a continuing programme of construction of local offices, for Depart-ments such as Health and Social Security and the Inland Revenue. The figures
also include provision for major headquarters buildings in the regions, forexample for the Ministry of Defence at Foxhill, Bath, as well as in London.3. Although the average of rents being paid for leased accommodation isstill low in comparison with present day rent levels the rent bill has been increasing rapidly over the years as new leases have had to be taken or oldones renewed. Rents for newly leased office accommodation have been averaging-ing about  8.75 per square foot in central London (other than the City area),about  3 per square foot in outer London and  1.30 per square foot elsewhere the constant price estimates in Table 2.19 allow for the cost of additional accommodation at present rental values but do not allow for the increased cost of future renewals of existing leases.4. The provision of maintenance and other running costs has beenreduced by about  5 million in each of the forward years compared withCmnd 4829 revalued as a result of economy measures, including improvedtechniques and equipment in these fields; in particular it is hoped to installbetter control systems for heating plant in a large number of office buildingsto secure improved performance and reduced fuel consumption.5. Since the publication of Cmnd 4829 expenditure under Accommoda-tion (Home), other than rates, has become the responsibility of the PropertyServices Agency. As has been announced, the Agency will undertake a reviewof the scope for more extensive charging for services or, alternatively, more precise attribution to user departments. This could in due course affect theamount of expenditure falling on Accommodation (Home) as opposed toother programmes.6. The only policy change affecting expenditure on Accommodation(Home) since Cmnd 4829 has been the cancellation of six Inland RevenueComputer Centres, involving capital expenditure of  4 million in 1973-74, 7.6 million in 1974-75 and  12 million in 1975-76.Stationery Office (Home)7. HM Stationery Office supplies Government departments with theirprinting, stationery and office machinery, and is responsible for the printing and in most cases the publication, distribution and sale of Governmentpublications, on which the annual turnover is some  5 million. It also suppliessome other public sector bodies.Central Computer Agency8. Responsibility for the acquisition of computers for GovernmentDepartments was transferred on 1 April 1972 from HM Stationery Office tothe new Central Computer Agency, part of the Civil Service Department.Apart from acquisition its main functions are to ensure that each projectaccords with any central plans for computers and to advise on technical and management problems. The use of computers produces improvements inefficiency and savings in staff thus reducing the cost of other programmes.Home Publicity Services9. This covers expenditure on publicity campaigns which are carriedout by the Central Office of Information for other Government departments,and which are directed principally at audiences in the United Kingdomthrough the media of press and television advertising, films and exhibitions.Related printing costs by the Stationery Office are included. The majorcontinuing campaigns allowed for are Armed Forces recruitment and road safety.
Superannuation of Civil Servants in Civil Departments10. A new Civil Service pension scheme was introduced in June 1972 withcertain features applying retrospectively to established civil servants who retired after 29th February 1972. As in the case of the scheme it replaced,the new scheme is non-funded and non-contributory except for widows&apos; and dependants&apos; pensions.11. Under the new scheme pensionability is extended to virtually all CivilServants, with preserved pensions for all staff leaving before retiring age with more than 5 years service.12. Other important improvements include the reduction of the qualify-ing period for a pension from 10 to 5 years service, calculation of pensions by reference to the best year&apos;s salary in the last 3 years instead of the average over that period, and the increase in the widow&apos;s pension from one-thirdto one-half of the husband&apos;s pension.13. The additional cost of the new scheme will be of the order of  3 million in 1972-73. Thereafter the increased cost will be partly offset by increased receipts from employees&apos; contributions for widows&apos; pensions. Thenet increase is expected to be of the order of  1 million in 1973-74 rising to  2 million in 1976-77. Superannuation costs are also expected to rise overthe forward period as the result of increases in the number of pensions in issue and in the average amount of pension payments.MISCELLANEOUS services table 2.20   million	1971-72						pro-	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	visional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1972 Survey prices						Records, registrations and surveys	23-6	16-9	16-4	16-4	14	14Broadcasting (capital expenditure) 						BBC     ..      ......	10-6	11-3	10-9	10-7	13	13IB A      ........	40	5-4	5-8	5-8	6	5Meteorological services	13-2	10-4	10-7	11-7	11	11Civil defence      ..      ..      ..	7-4	8-9	9-2	9-3	10	royal parks, historic buildings						and ancient monuments      ..	3-9	4-3	5-8	6-2	6	other miscellaneous services	41-5	40-3	41-1	39-0	46	44Total........	104-2	97-5	99-9	99-1	106	103Changes from Cmnd 4829 revalued						policy changes	&quot; 	4-0-7	+3-0	4-3-5	4-4	estimating changes	-0-6	-3-2	-0-7	+1-6		Cmnd 4829 revalued	104-8	1000	97-6	930	102	(^Provision for grants to owners of historic buildings and for contributions to the redundant Churches Fund is included in money terms and not at constant prices.Records, Registrations and surveys. This includes expenditure by several Government Departments (theOffice of Population Censuses and Surveys, the General Register Office (Scot-land), Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, and other minor Departments) anda smaller proportion of local authority expenditure. Provision is made underthe Office of Population Censuses and Surveys for the social surveys carriedout as an allied service for Government Departments.
2. Provision totalling  0.5 million is included in 1972-73 and 1973-74for an e.c. Labour Force Survey.Broadcasting (Capital Expenditure)3. Expenditure covers the capital requirements of the British broadcasting corporation (home services) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority.The Corporation and the Authority are co-ordinating separately financedprogrammes for the construction of UHF stations to transmit BBC and IBAtelevision services on 625 lines (black and white and colour). The aim is toincrease the present coverage of nearly 90 per cent attained by the UHFstations to about 94 per cent by 1976-77. The Corporation^ expenditure(capital and current) is financed by Government grant which at present consists of the whole of net licence revenue. The Authority provides transmitters to broadcast the programmes of independent television companies and is financed by the rentals charged to those companies. Following the extension of its functions under the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972, the Authority is alsoproviding transmitters to broadcast the programmes of independent radiocontractors (still to be appointed) whose rentals will finance the capitalexpenditure involved, except in the initial period for which a Government loan of up to  2 million will be provided.Meteorological Services4. This covers the cost of services provided for both defence and civil purposes. The estimates are also included in the Defence Budget (Table 2.1)and an equivalent reduction has been made in Other military defence (Table2.2) to enable the item to be shown here. The figure for 1971-72 includes thepurchase of a computer, while the increase in the level of expenditure after1973-74 is due mainly to a programme of planned improvements to the computer and associated links at outstations.Royal Parks, Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments, etc.5. This item includes expenditure on royal palaces, royal parks, ancient monuments, grants to historic buildings and other services. Expenditure ongrants under the provisions of the Field Monuments Act 1972 is estimated toreach  150,000 a year by 1975-76. As in Cmnd 4829 provision is made for increasing expenditure on ancient monuments. This is needed to cover the increasing load of work, shown for example by the scheduling of some 400additional monuments as worthy of preservation each year; it covers suchitems as an increase in the number of monuments in guardianship, and additional emergency excavation prior to the development of sites. provision is included for expenditure from 1973-74 onwards in respect of grants madeunder Section 10 of the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act 1972in connection with the enhancement and preservation of outstanding conserva-tion areas; this is estimated to exceed  1 million in 1976-77.Other Miscellaneous services. The largest single item (about  18 million in 1972-73 and  14 million1976-77) is the net lending and overseas investment of Cable and Wireless Ltdwhich is Government owned and which operates solely overseas. It providesinternational communications systems and internal telephone systems in anumber of overseas countries and provides an important link in the Common-wealth telecommunications system.
7. The remainder includes expenditure by the Civil Service Department(excluding the Central Computer Agency which is included in common services) the Cabinet Office, the Public Trustee, salaries and administrationcosts of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and Civil List annuities-ties and pensions. The estimates for 1972-73 and 1973-74 include receiptstotalling  5 million from the sale of the assets of the State Management Dist-ricts of Carlisle, Gretna and Cromarty.NORTHERN IRELANDTABLE 2.21   million	1971-2						pro-	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	visional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1972 Survey prices						Agriculture, fisheries and forestry	15-0	16-7	17-1	15-9	15	15Trade, industry and employment	86-7	113-2	108-5	103-2	73	78Fuel        ........	25-6	27-0	23-6	32-6	42	33Roads	26-3	27-7	29-5	29-6	31	31Surface transport......	60	8-3	6-9	5-8	4	housing	50-9	56-8	61-8	66-4	68	70Miscellaneous local services	30-5	34-4	34-7	33-0	30	29Law and order......	29-6	500	39-3	33-4	32	30Arts        ........	0-9	1-0	1-0	10	1	1Education and libraries	950	102-1	108-7	110-9	113	116Health and personal social services	79-8	88-7	91-8	91-5	92	96Social security    ......	139-4	149-0	152-1	154-9	159	165Financial administration	3-1	3-2	3-4	3-5	4	4Common services	4-9	5-8	7-0	6-1	7	miscellaneous services	10-2	10-5	11-9	9-5	9	9Total........	603-9	694-4	697-3	697-3	680	687Changes from Cmnd 4829 revalued						policy changes	4-1-0	4-54-4	4-56-8	447-5	4-20	estimating changes	4-1-5	4-17-1	4-17-1	4-11-7	4-19	Cmnd 4829 revalued	601-4	622-9	623-4	638-1	641	1. Table 2.21 has been compiled from estimates which are prepared bythe Northern Ireland departments, and it sets out the expenditure on pro-grammes for which these departments are responsible. It is important to note that this Table does not represent the full extent of public expenditure inNorthern Ireland. Expenditure in Northern Ireland by departments of theUnited Kingdom Government are recorded in the earlier Tables. The most significant items of this type are the cost of the army and defence generally,and that part of agricultural support that is applicable to the United kingdom as a whole. (A description of the way in which the responsibility for differentfunctions is divided is contained in &quot;Northern Ireland Financial arrangements and Legislation&quot;, Cmnd 4998).2. As a result of the Northern Ireland Temporary Provisions Act 1972the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is now directly responsible for theexpenditure of the Northern Ireland Departments. The detailed procedures which govern control of expenditure, and the underlying principles appliedhave not changed, although Parliamentary accountability is now to West-minster.3. The general principle is that for those services which have general application throughout the United Kingdom, uniform standards should prevail.The clearest example is provided by the arrangements for social services. In
other spheres, although the basic pattern of expenditure follows that in therest of the United Kingdom, the special circumstances of Northern Irelandplay an important part in determining the level of expenditure. This is particu-larly the case with regard to assistance to industry which reflects the high levels of unemployment that prevail in Northern Ireland.4. Most of the policy changes during the year occurred in the Trade,industry and employment programme. A substantial increase over the existing provision was agreed as a result of the Review of Economic and SocialDevelopment, announced in the Northern Ireland Governmenfs White Paper,Cmnd 564. It was decided to set up, for an initial period of three years, aNorthern Ireland Finance Corporation to provide up to  50 million of assist-ance to industry by way of loan, loan guarantees or the purchase of equity.Further assistance under the Review was agreed for industrial training and for employment schemes related to the Urban Renewal and Improvement Cam-paign. Secondly, an Industrial Regeneration Programme to stimulate employ-ment was announced on 27th July, 1972. Details include the setting up of adirect labour organisation for public works schemes at a cost of  3 million ayear, special employment schemes within the agricultural industry estimated to cost  8 million over 4 years, and an increase in industrial investment grants.Third, additional assistance was agreed for Harland and Wolff Limited involving-ing a substantial contribution by the Ministry of Commerce towards thecompany&apos;s proposed expansion scheme. Other smaller increases in this pro-gramme during the year included provision for a rate relief scheme in Belfast,Londonderry and Newry for traders who had suffered losses due to the disturbances, and the purchase of equity in the ICL factory in Belfast.5. Policy changes in the Surface transport programme amount to nearly 7 million and are the result mainly of increased investment for railways and harbours following the Cairncross Review and the Industrial RegenerationProgramme.6. The largest estimating changes occurred under Law and order,reflecting the continuing disturbed conditions. They are, in the main, the resultof increased provision for compensation payments to individuals and businessesfor injury and damage, and additional expenditure on police overtime andrecruiting.7. The estimates for Health and personal social services include as apolicy increase an extra  3.5 million, following on the increase of  118 million for Health and personal social services in Great Britain included in Cmnd4829; and an extra  0.5 million a year following the absorption of the MaterHospital in Belfast into the Health Service.8. The Social Security estimates are increased by some  9 million a year for 1972-73 onwards, compared with Cmnd 4829 revalued, reflecting the costin respect of Northern Ireland of the policy decision to increase the rates ofbenefit in 1972. In addition there were estimating changes in respect of social security payments in the light of revised economic and statistical assumptionsfor Northern Ireland.

Table 2.22 summarises expenditure by central Government, localauthorities and public corporations on services in Scotland within the Secre-tary of State&apos;s field of responsibility. (These figures are contained within the totals for Great Britain shown in Tables 2.5-2.16, 2.18 and 2.20.) Table 2.23gives forecasts of all current and capital expenditure of Scottish local authori-ties, including a small amount within the field of responsibility of Departmentsother than the Scottish Office. The figures in the two Tables are at 1972Survey prices, and do not include provision for the relative price effect.2. The forecasts provide for an average annual increase of about 1.10per cent between 1972-73 and 1976-77 in expenditure within the Secretary ofState&apos;s field. The objectives and main determinants of this expenditure areexplained in earlier chapters of this White Paper. The trends of expenditure inScotland are not markedly dissimilar from those for Great Britain as awhole. A factor making for divergence of trends in the early years is therelative size of the additional public works programme announced in July1971; for Scotland this programme amounts to  74 milion, two-thirds ofwhich is expenditure on educational building and roads, spread over theyears 1971-72 to 1973-74.3. As expenditure on agricultural research in Scotland is now shown underAgriculture, fiisheries and forestry; this means that, as compared with Cmnd4829, there is no longer a separate programme entry in Table 2.22 for research CouncillorsThe changes in the Scottish figures as compared with
the totals in Cmnd 4829 revalued depend particularly on additions tothe agricultural support programme in the 1972 Annual Price Review andrevised estimates of the costs of entry to e.c.; on a reduction in capitalinvesitment by nationalised industries consequent on the substitution of an oil-fired for a nuclear generating station in the programme of the North ofScodand Hydro Electric Board; on revised provision for housing as a resultof the Housing (Financial Provisions (Scotland) Act 1972; on increased provision made for current expenditure by local authorities; on provision made for the proposed New Town at Stonehouse; and on the policy changesin education announced in Cmnd 5175, and on estimated higher projectedschool populations.4. In advance of the rate support grant settlement now being negotiatedthe figures of local authorities&apos; current expenditure are provisional. About halfthe capital spending in the Seoretary of State&apos;s field of responsibility iscarried out by local authorities. The annual average increase of local authori-ties&apos; expenditure as shown in Table 2.23 between 1972-73 and 1976-77 is1.0 per cent(&apos;).(&apos;) If expenditure on the additional public Works expenditure in 1972-73 is excluded,the average annual increase becomes about 2.0 per cent for expenditure within theSecretary of State&apos;s responsibility, and 2.4 per cent for local authority expenditure.

NOTES ON METHODOLOGY1. A comprehensive handbook on the methodology used in the public expenditure surveys and in the compilation of the figures published in theannual series of White Papers has been published as a separate volumef1)-The following paragraphs are concerned mainly with those changes in classi-fication and methodology which have occurred since the 1971 public expen-diture White Paper (Cmnd 4829).Classification and coverage changes2. The following transfers between programmes reflect changes in organi-sation and reassessment of the functions of some elements of expenditure:(a) The rent of further buildings with specialised functions from common services to the relevant programmes.(b) Some expenditure on agricultural research from Research councils to Agriculture, fisheries and forestry.(c) The Torry Research Station from Trade, industry and employment to agriculture, fisheries and forestry.(d) The expenditure on the development of Maplin Sands site for theThird London Airport from Nationalised industries&apos; capital expendi-ture to Trade, industry and employment.(e) The transfers of some Central Office of Information staff to theDepartment of Trade and Industry (from Common services to Trade,industry and employment).(/) Expenditure on various research establishments (of which the building and Road Research Stations are the largest) from Trade, industry andemployment and Surface transport to Miscellaneous local services.(g) Expenditure under the Urban programme on day care centres fromHealth and personal social services to Law and order.(h) Expenditure on local museums and galleries from Education to Arts,and expenditure on national libraries, the Royal Geographical society and the British Institute of Recorded Sound from Arts to Education(now renamed Education and libraries).(/) Expenditure on the Customs and Excise computer at London Airportfrom Common services to Financial administration.(/) The Central Computer Agency from Trade, industry and employment and Miscellaneous services to Common services.3. As a consequence of the arrangements agreed earlier this year with the clearing banks, the cost of the refinance of shipbuilding and export credits,formerly borne by the Issue Department of the Bank of England, is carriedon the Votes of the Department of Trade and Industry (since August 1972)and the Export Credit Guarantee Department (since April 1972) respectively,and forms part of public expenditure. This change increases public expendi-ture as defined in this White Paper by the following amounts:  million at 1972 Survey pricesExport creditsShipbuilding credits1972-73300501973-74375951974-75350851975-76 1976-77301 23275 25350470435376257OPublic Expenditure White Papers Handbook on Methodology (HMSO).118
4.   Five items are included for the first time in the Survey coverage:(a) National Insurance Fund payments for vocational training includedin Trade, industry and employment.(b) Local authority grants to Housing Associations for improvements included in Housing.(c) Expenditure on replacement of furniture in schools etc. included in education and libraries.(d) Advances to the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd. included inMiscellaneous services.(e) Expenditure of the Northern Ireland Water Commissioners includedin Northern Ireland.These items increase public expenditure as presented in this White Paper by:  million at 1972 Survey prices1971-72        1972-73        1973-74        1974-75        1975-76        1976-7725.7 27.0 29.2 31.3 32.8 34.45. In accordance with the definition of charges given in paragraph 21of Part 1 (page 12) of Cmnd 4829 some further items of revenue, previouslytreated as taxation receipts, have been identified as charges and are now nettedoff the relevant expenditure. They are:Trade, industry and employment(a) Companies&apos; House fees(b) Space rentals at trade fairs(c) Premiums for shipbuilding guaranteesFinancial administration(d) Exchequer Office Scotland, feesMiscellaneous services(e) Companies registration (Scotland) feesThese changes reduce public expenditure by:  million at 1972 Survey prices1971-72        1972-73        1973-74        1974-75        1975-76        1976-77-4.1 -4.2 -4.4 -4.7 -4.8 -4.8Price adjustments6. Some items of expenditure notably Regional Employment Premiumsand Post-War Credits which have previously been given in cash terms inthe tables analysing expenditure in volume terms are now presented at constant prices. Certain other items such as Agricultural support, where the forwardprojections are regarded as representing a constant price series but where norevaluation had previously been applied to cash out turns or to the previous year&apos;s forward projections, are also now presented throughout on a consistentconstant price basis.7. The following table analyses the figures in the line &quot;Adjustment to1972-73 outturn prices and relative price effect&quot; into their three constituent parts for the years 1971-72 to 1976-77:

Adjustments have this year been made to the estimates of expendi-vture on new building for educational purposes, roads and Government officesso as to measure more accurately the prospective resource use implied by those estimates (see Chapter IV, paragraph 78 of the Handbook on Method-oology).Exchange rate9. Estimates of expenditure affected by the exchange rate reflect a rateof $2.60 to the  .Selective Employment Tax10. All the expenditure out turns and estimates given in this White Paper(apart from Table 1.2) are at constant (1972 Survey or 1972-73 outturn)market prices, ie they embody all indirect taxes, including Selective Employ-ment Tax, paid or payable by public bodies at the rates in force at the relevant time respectively the beginning of the 1972 Survey operation (for1972 Survey prices) and during the financial year 1972-73 (for outturn prices).The effect of this treatment is to include Selective Employment Tax payments for all years, although the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his1972 Budget statement his intention to remove this tax as from 1 April 1973.While this treatment is apparent from the Tables covering programmes with local authority expenditure in Part 2, since selective Employment Tax pay-ments by local authorities are separately identified, it applies equally to all such payments by public sector bodies. To depart from this convention andto omit Selective Employment Tax payments from the cost of the programmes to Which they relate for the years after 1972-73 would invalidate the constant price basis of the expenditure estimates and the relevant percentage rates of change.
NOTES ON TABLE 1.2: THE RESOURCES TABLE1. Table 1.2 compares competing demands on resources from differentsectors of the economy with each other and with the available supply. this line-by-line account explains what each part of the Table means.2. Line A shows, for two alternative cases, the projected growth in total available resources between 1971 and 1977 which is measured by the changein the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the period. Estimation of this change involves taking a view of two uncertain factors, viz, the growth inproductive potential and the effect on GDP of taking up the slack in the economy which existed in 1971.3. In Section B, line 1 is an estimate of the claim on resources for private fixed capital formation (excluding private dwellings) and stockbuild-ing. It excludes that part of private investment financed by public sectorlending and grants (other than investment grants) which is included under3(d). The relationship between the growth of the capital stock and thesustainable growth of output is inevitably very uncertain and for this reasontwo alternative estimates of investment are provided for each growth case.4. Line 2 is an estimate of the claim on resources for the balance oftrade (exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services).The underlying assumption here is that a surplus on current account willbe achieved sufficient to finance capital outflows and to maintain a satis-factory reserves position. A minus sign in this line implies that the balanceof trade (at 1972 prices) is smaller in 1977 than in 1971, so that a reducedquantity of resources is required for this sector; a plus sign implies the reverse. The difference between the figures for the two output cases reflects the assumption that a higher level of GDP would be accompanied by higherimports, and that exports, in volume terms, would have to rise more thanproportionately to the rise in the volume of imports if the same current account surplus is to be achieved. The estimates of resource movementsout of or into the balance of trade are inevitably very uncertain.5. Lines 3 (a) to (e) give estimates of public expenditure on presentprogrammes. Although the rates of increase given here are different fromthose given elsewhere in the White Paper, they are consistent with them,and the differences arise partly because this Resource Table compares the calendar years 1971 and 1977 whereas elsewhere in the White Paper com-comparisons are between the fiscal years 1972-73 and 1976-77, and partly becausethe resource implications of certain public expenditure items (eg Govern-ment transfers overseas) are in this Table included in the balance of trade.6. All expenditure figures are in terms of the demand they will make on resources. Lines 3 (a) and (b) represent direct demands by Government purchases of goods and services. Public investment covers gross fixed capital formation and stock building. Line 3(d) represents indirect demands.It comprises the demand effects of various forms of transfers to the private sector at home subsidies, debt interest, current grants, capital grants (otherthan investment grants) and net lending.7. Line 4 is a residual figure. It includes private dwellings (excludedfrom private investment in line 1) but excludes that part of consumers&apos;expenditure included in indirect domestic public expenditure in line 3(d).
