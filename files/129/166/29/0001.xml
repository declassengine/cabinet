HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 154 COPY NO *12 December 1972CABINETDEFAULT UNDER THE HOUSING FINANCE ACTIN ENGLANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. Only three English authorities are still in default under theHousing Finance Act.    They are Clay Cross and Conisbrough urban district Councils and the London Borough of Camden.2. At Clay Cross the District Auditor has carried out an extraordinaryaudit.    He has asked the councillors to show cause why he should notsurcharge them.    He began a hearing of their representations on7 December and at their request adjourned it until 4 January to give them more time to prepare their case.3. At Conisbrough the District Auditor has also begun an extra-ordinary audit.    The Council may resolve to implement the Act at their next meeting.    If they do so before the auditor has completed hisinvestigations, I propose to direct him not to continue with the extraordinary audit, since any loss caused by default will no longer be a continuing one and can be considered by him at the ordinary audit afterthe end of the financial year 1972-73.4. I have made a default order against Camden, as the Cabinet agreed on 30 November (CM(72) 54th Conclusions, Minute 7).    The Councilresolved on 11 December not to comply with the Order.    There is reason to believe that certain members of the Labour majority may be moved to vote for implementation if, apart from arranging for an extra-ordinary audit, I use my powers under the Act to stop the Councilsentitlement to subsidies under the Act.    A loss of the entitlement for1972-73 and for 1973-74 would create a deficit in the CounciPs HousingRevenue Account which could only be made good by an additional ratefund contribution involving an increase in the rate of about 25p in 1973-74.Most of the 1972-73 entitlement has not yet been paid.    If the whole of itwere stopped, I would ask the Council to repay some  700, 000(equivalent to a 2p rate/ which was paid in June 1972 as an advancepayment of subsidies due under the Act.1
5. To stop Camden^ entire entitlement to all housing subsidieswould be frankly punitive.    We would justify ourselves by saying thatit would be wrong for the Government to give the Council subsidies under an Act when the Council refused to carry out two of their mostimportant functions under that Act viz assessing fair rents andprogressing existing rents to fair rents.    Our opponents on theCouncil would no doubt present our action as an attack on the ratepayers,and we and  our supporters would have to make it clear to the ratepayersthat our opponents, and not the Government, were to blame for thisextra burden.    Moreover insofar as some Labour members of theCouncil are seeking a reason for climbing down, protecting theirratepayers (including council tenants) from an unnecessary burden maysupply such a reason.6. It is also possible that the militants on the Council may respondby trying to create a situation in which the Council&apos;s finances are completely disorganised eg by instructing the officers not to pay interest on debts incurred for housing, in the hope of forcing the Government totake over the Council&apos;s finances so as to maintain the viability of localgovernment and the confidence of investors.    But such, extreme actionseemj on the whole unlikely and the Councils officers may well refuseto act on instructions which would destroy the financial credit of their local authority.7. I consider that it would be right now to take very firm actionagainst Camden and to be seen to do so.    I therefore propose -i.       to send Camden a notice, as required by the Act, that Iintend to stop their entitlement to subsidies under the Act for1972-73 and, if their default continues into 1973-74, for thatyear also, but that I would have regard to any representations on this notice made to me within 21 days of its issue;ii. to follow up the notice with a direction to the districtauditor to hold an extraordinary audit of Camden&apos;s housingaccounts, as agreed by the Cabinet on 30 November;ill.       if the issue of the notice led to a resolution to implement the Act in full before the auditor had completed his investigation,to direct him to discontinue the extraordinary audit since theloss in question would no longer be a continuing one.Department of the Environment12 December 19722
