$DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 15513 December 1972CABINETBRITISH STEEL CORPORATION DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALSNOTE ON THE EMPLOYMENT IMPLICATIONS OF MAJOR OPTIONSNote by the Secretary of State for employment. The following note sets out the employment and manning implications of certain of the options for a British Steel Corporation (BSC) developmentstrategy.    It takes account of a recent discussion by officials of myDepartment with BSC officials.2 .        This discussion was undertaken following certain revisions of earlier figures which were considered by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy last week.THE BSC STRATEGY3. Under any strategy available to BSC there will have to be substantialclosures particularly in the earlier part of tiis decade, to get rid of obsoleteplant including many open hearth furnaces.    Those already announced will result in manning reductions of some 23,000 as compared with bsc&apos;s labour force at March 1972 (229, 000).THE PREFERRED STRATEGY4. bsc&apos;s preferred strategy, which involves an early expansion at PortTalbot and commitment to a new steel plant probably at Teesside, can adoptto an  &quot;upper&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; path depending upon the actual course of demandfor steel products.    The &quot;lower path&quot; would assume a demand for liquidsteel equivalent to 33. 1 million tons in 1979-80 and, since capacity elsewheremust be reduced to make way for the new plant, this involves the closure by1980 of the following major plants:-Gross Job LossCorby (Ncrthants) 6,100 Shotton (N Wales) 6,450Consett 5,000 Cleveland (Teesside)      2,350Shortly afterwards there would in addition be a further major closure atNormanby Park (Scunthorpe) and some closures at Templeborough(Sheffield).copy NO
5. Notes on these places are at Annex.    The consequences of closureat certain of these plants notably at Shotton, Consett and Corby could andprobably would have grave employment implications,6. These closures would, under the bsc&apos;s preferred strategy, bepartly balanced by the proposed new plant at Teesside (gross addition tojobs;  said to be 5, 800 by the end of the decade and 6, 800 ultimately), bythe expansion at Port Talbot (1, 700 new jobs) and by certain other minorexpansions.7,        If, under bsc&apos;s preferred strategy, demand turned out to beunexpectedly high, justifying the &quot;upper path&quot;, certain of the closureswhich would occur by 1980 under the &quot;lower path&quot; would be delayed by ayear or more.    This applies particularly to the closure at Consett.OPTION B8. This option is roughly as follows:1. It assumes that demand will be about 33 million tons liquidsteel equivalent in 1980-81 (ie, the view of demand is a little morecautious than in the preferred strategy, lower path).2. The expansion projected for Port Talbot would be much more modest, involving an increment of jobs of 400 as compared with1,700.3, There would be no commitment now to a new steel plant.4.        In the absence of this commitment, the plants referred toat paragraph 4 would remain open throughout this decade and beyond.5, In particular, new investment in steelmaking capacity wouldtake place at Shotton which would guarantee the continued existenceof that plant for the foreseeable future,6, There would be no bar ultimately to the building of a new plant at Teesside or elsewhere. The extent to which this wouldinvolve the closure of existing plants would depend on the courseof demand.9. No doubt, in the end, the real difference between the preferredoption and Option B is that a six-plant industry might ultimately emerge,including Shotton as well as the five heritage plants.    The path towards this outcome would, however, be more deliberate and certainly not lessflexible for capable of adjustment than the preferred strategy,OVERALL MANNING IMPLICATIONS10.       The figures recently re-presented by the BSC for the overall manningdifferences between the available options show an overall net difference injob loss terms between Option B and the &quot;lower path&quot; of the preferredstrategy as being 3,000 in favour of the former.    This difference contrasted with a difference of 9, 000 or more emerging from earlier papers.    the revised BSC figures have now been examined carefully by my officials inconjunction with BSC.
Ho        It emerges from this joint examination that the overall manningdifferences between the two options is, on the interpretation of eventsmost favourable to the preferred strategy, of the order of 5,500-6, 500by 1980-81.    It is in fact probable that the net manning difference betweenOption B and the preferred strategy by the end of the decade is nearer tothe figures formerly advanced by BSC than those in their revisedcalculations.12.       On this basis, the two compare as follows:Minimum Net Job Loss to 1980-81 as compared with 1972Preferred strategy (lower course): 47, 500Option B 41, 500The difference would be substantially greater if account were to be taken of the closure of Normanby Park just after 1980 and, of course, thepreferred strategy involves the closure of the plants mentioned inparagraph 4.M V MDepartment of Employment12 December 1972
(secret)annex note ON CERTAIN PLANTS CLOSED OR PARTLY CLOSEDUNDER THE BSC PREFERRED STRATEGYShotton (N Wales)Job Loss:  6,450,  out of 12,550.Male unemployment rates:  3*^%  (November)BSC accounts for h.3% of male employment in thearea.    The future of the other major employers in the area   (Hawker Siddeley and Courtaulds)is open to some doubt.Corby (Northants)Job loss:  6,100 out of 12,200Male unemployment rates:  3.k%  (November)This job loss would represent one third of the male jobs in Corby, with multiplier effects on services  employment in the New Town - alreadyan unattractive location compared with MiltonKeynes, Northampton and Peterborough.Cleveland (Eston:    Teesside)Job loss:  3v500, plus 35200 to occur in anycase by 1976 in Eston in steelMale unemployment: Teesside 8.2%  (November)This closure of a relatively modern ARC plantwould only occur if] the new complex is built at Teesside.    This reduces the net advantage to the area of a new plant.Teesside is threatened not only with closuresin steel and with the further erosion of theDurham coalfield to the North East,  but also with massive reductions at ICI Billingham.So far the area has not been markedly successful in attracting new jobs;  North sea oil fromEkofisk may bring some relief.Normanby Park      (Scunthorpe)......     Job loss:  3,250Male unemployment rates: 2.7%This job loss will coincide with further losses of some 3)000 due to rationalisation in the area;but will be partly compensated as the new Anchorplant expands.(secret)
(secret)Consett(Durham)Job loss:  5,000 out of 5,500Male unemployment rates:  9.2% (November)Consett is very isolated- and already seriously affected by closures in the Durham coalfield.The jobs at risk amount to 2k% of male employment inthe area.    A steel closure at Consett would represent a miniature social disaster,  given theproblems of nearby Tyneside and Teesside.Notes1All the above plants except Corby are in assisted areas.Consett is in an SDA and Teesside neighbours one.2Job losses quoted above take no account of associated joblosses in service industries.12 December 1972
