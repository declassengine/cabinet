DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTb 0CP(7?) 148 COPY NO11 December 1972CABINETHOUSING (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS) (SCOTLAND) ACT 1972DEFAULT BY LOCAL authorities memorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandL I seek to advise the Cabinet of the course of action I propose toadopt should a local authority fail to comply with the requirements of a default order which I have made.2, The proposals in my memorandum CP(72) 134 were agreed on30 November (CM(72) 54th Conclusions, Minute 7) and, on 1 December,I made default orders in respect of Glasgow Corporation, Lanark CountyCouncil, and Falkirk and Kirkcaldy Town Councils.    these default ordersgave the authorities concerned 14 days in which to take the first steps tosecure implementation of the orders.    Lanark County has now decided to implement The Act but Glasgow Corporation voted (by a majority of 53 to48) to continue defiance, and by 15 December I wish to be in a position totake action immediately in relation to Glasgow and either of the other twoauthorities which fails to take the necessary steps.3. There are two alternative courses of action:-1. the Lord Advocate can apply to the Court of Session on mybehalf for an Order requiring the specific performance of the stepsspecified in the default order; or .        I can make a further order rendering exercisable by myselfsuch housing powers of the local authority as may be necessary to implement the rent rebate and rent-fixing provisions of the 1972 Act.4. After consultation with the Lord Advocate, I am satisfied that 1 isthe course to be preferred.    It is a well understood procedure and onewhich, when adopted earlier this year in relation to the selective schoolingissue in Glasgow, produced not only the desired court order by alsocompliance by Glasgow Corporation.    On this occasion, there has sofar been no indication that any local authority will seek to advance any grounds on which the appHcation to the court would fail.    It seems to usto be appropriate that, when elected local authorities have openly defiedan Act of Parliament, the courts should be invited to uphold the rule of lawby the most direct means available.    One test case in the Court of Session1
might possibly settle the question for most, if not all, of the remaining18 authorities.    If a Court of Session Order were ignored, it would benecessary for the defaulting authority to be brought before the Court, whichwould then deal with the authority as it thought fit.5. Course 2 may seem politically more attractive in the short term,but it might prove neither quicker nor more effective in practice.    Thelocal authority might either obstruct the Secretary of State (leading to theneed for further default procedure and eventual court action) or5alternatively, they might leave the Secretary of State to fix new rents and then acquiesce in tenants not paying (or even encourage them not todo so), thus transforming the issue into one between the Secretary ofState and tenants&apos; associations.    This course thus offers a determinedlocal authority two very clear methods of continuing to frustrate the implementation of the Act, and could also place the Secretary of state in an exposed and difficult position from which it might also be difficulteventually to withdraw.6. My colleagues will wish to note that I propose, if this becomes necessary, on or as soon as practicable after 15 December, to seekenforcement of default orders in the Court of Session.G scottish Office11 December 1972
