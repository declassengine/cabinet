DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government cp(72) 135 COPY NO28 November 1972   QCABINETCOAL policy note by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. At the meeting of the Cabinet on 2 March (CM(72) 1.1th Conclusions,Minute 3) my colleagues agreed interim measures to meet the national coal Board&apos;s (NCB) deficit for 1971-72.    We also agreed that parliament should be told that the Government intended in due course tointroduce legislation to deal with the financial problems of the coal industry.2. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy has reviewed the options open to us to moderate the contraction of the industry, easeharddhip for redundant miners, and maintain supplies of coal at a leveladequate to meet future uncertainties.    They approved my proposals for:a. The cancellation of about  475 million of the NCB&apos;s debt to the Exchequer.b. Recurrent grants of about  170 million a year of which themost important are:i. A regional grant of  70 million a year.ii. Redundancy payments of about  30 million a year.iii. Compensation to the electricity generating boardsfor burning surplus coal (the precise sum to be agreed between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and me).3, The Committee agreed that legislation should now be introduced togive effect to these proposals, and I shall submit a draft Bill to theLegislation Committee shortly.    They also agreed that I should make astatement in Parliament before the Bill was introduced, and invited me,in consultation with the Home Secretary, to submit the draft to the cabinet for their approval.1!
4. Our proposals may seem over generous to some of our suppliersand in preparing the statement I have Aimed at a presentation which byemphasising the vital importance of the industry s own contribution on costs and productivity, will go as far h\3 we can to disarm criticism.    i hope to arrange with the Lord President to make this statement inParliament on Tuesday 5 December;  and seek my colleagues approvalof its terms.P w department of Trade and Industry28 November 19722
DRAFT STATEMENT ON COAL policy with permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement aboutthe coal industry.Last year, the National Coal Board incurred a deficit of 157M, mainly because of the costs of industrial action.    the continuing costs of the Wilberforce settlement mean that theBoard*s losses are still running at around  100 million a yearand, under present arrangements, this would increase further.Under present conditions, the industry could only eliminatethese losses by a massive contraction.Against this background my Hon Friend, the Minister for Industrytold the coal industry in August that before considering what assistance from public funds might be provided to meet theirserious financial situation, the Government wished to know what action those in the industry were able to take themselvesto secure its future.   As a result, the two sides of theindustry - management and unions - put to us joint proposalsfor action both by the industry and by the Government.Yet, at the same time, there is an increasing awarenessthroughout the world of the danger of a shortage of the sources of energy.   We in the UK are fortunate in having large reserves
of coal in addition to the more recently discovered fields of oil and gas in the North Sea.   We must ensure that thesenational assets are wisely used and that the coal industryis given the opportunity to reestablish itself, as the supplierof a competitive fuel without being a permanent burden onthe taxpayer.The Government welcomes this joint approach and the drivewhich the Board, with the full co-operation of the unions,are making to stimulate sales and marketing, improve quality,reduce overheads and increase productivity.   These efforts arealready bearing fruit and output per man shift is approachingrecord levels.    The unions will co-operate with the Board ina joint review of the performance and prospects of pits.   TheBoard are also carrying out a systematic review of their land and property holdings to ensure that these are put to themost effective use and if surplus to operational requirements are sold.The Industry&apos;s jointly agreed proposals express a determination to put their own house in order and the Government therefore have decided to take powers to enable us to support theindustry in its future task.First:       We intend to make a special regional grant to help theBoard preserve jobs especially in areas of high unemployment.   Nevertheless it is acknowledged that
there will need to be further redundancies and wetherefore intend to introduce improvements inredundancy terms.   We shall see that every effort ismade to provide new jobs and funds will be availablefor this under the Industry Act.   We shall make themaximum possible use of ECSC funds available forthese purposes.Second:     We intend to take powers to continue grants towardsthe Board1s social costs, to contribute towards thecost to the Board of holding stocks and to cover lossesincurred as a result of special agreements with theelectricity generating boards to burn extra coal.   Atthe same time we propose to follow the practice inthe European Coal and Steel Community and give support to coking coal.Third:       We propose to write off the Board&apos;s accumulated deficitas at March 1973 and the amount by which the Board&apos;scapital assets are at present overvalued.    This willconsiderably reduce the Board&apos;s interest and depreciationCharges.Legislation will be introduced for these purposes.   In themeantime any necessary advances for purposes authorised under theCoal Acts will continue to be made from the National Loans Fund.
The Government measures I have outlined will deal with the Board&apos;s immediate financial problems, moderate the contraction of theindustry and ease the social and human consequences of thatcontraction.   The coal industry&apos;s contribution to establishing a viable position is vital.   Assistance from public funds on thescale indicated cannot be justified without effective and sustained efforts by all sides of the industry to improve itscompetitive position and contain its costs; indeed it is only-through such efforts that it will be able to take full advantage of the opportunities, not least in Europe, thatthe future holds.
