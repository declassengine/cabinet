S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 129 COPY NO   g g21 November 1972CABINETCIVIL LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY - PROPOSEDROYAL commission memorandum by the Lord chancellor. The Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the ministers principally concerned, to examine certain detailed matters arisingfrom their decision that a Royal Commission should be set up to considerthe basis of liability for personal injury (CM(72) 52nd Conclusions,Minute 4).2. I have now consulted the Ministers concerned and the conclusionswe reached are as follows.TERMS OF REFERENCE3. We propose that the Royal Commission^ terms of reference shouldbe on the lines of the draft in the annex to this memorandum.    They go into some detail, since after discussion we concluded that very short terms ofreference would be dangerously wide, and in particular might seem to open the way to a state insurance scheme.4. It is desirable that one of the matters to be considered by the RoyalCommission should be whether there ought to be a right of action in anunborn child.    Since, however, this is a matter with important legalimplications we concluded that it should at once be referred to the law commission as a separate issue in the expectation that the latterJs report would be available in time for it to be taken into account by the RoyalCommission, whose terms of reference would be sufficiently wide toenable them to do so.    This would need to be made clear in any announcement.COMPOSITION5,        A Royal Commission of 14 or 15 members, including the Chairman,seems suitable.    The Chairman should be a judge and the membershipshould include representatives of the legal profession in England and scotland, two persons from the insurance field (one of them an actuary),a doctor, an economist, representatives of the Confederation of BritishIndustry and the Trades Union Congress, a distinguished retired publicservant and suitable lay representation.    At least one member - possiblyone of the laymen - should be a woman.
6* We considered, but rejected,, the suggestion that Members ofParliament should be included in the membership,FORM AND TIMING OF ANNOUNCEMENT7, We propose that the announcement of the decision to appoint a royal Commission should be made by the Prime Minister in a statement at the end of Questions.    It would be preferable for this to be done inadvance of any debate on the Opposition Motion about thalidomide children,though it would have to be emphasised that no recommendations made bythe Royal Commission would be of direct help to the children or theirrelatives.    The Queen&apos;s approval would of course have to be securedbefore any announcement was made.FUTURE ARRANGEMENTS8, We concluded that the Ministerial group which met under my chairmanship should remain in being and that it would need the supportof a corresponding official group, one of whose tasks would be toco-ordinate the preparation of the Governments evidence to theRoyal Commission.    It was suggested that the Treasury might bethe appropriate source of at least part of the Royal Commission5sown secretariat and the Ministerial group have invited the Lord privy seal, in consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to work outdetailed arrangements and to report back.9. I invite my colleagues to agree to the above proposals.H of St MLord chancellor s Office21 November 1972CQNFJPSN TIA!.
