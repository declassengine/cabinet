this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 146 COPY NO     b i11 December 1972CABINETCIVIL LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION FOR personal injury:   PROPOSED ROYAL commission memorandum by the Lord chancellor, At their meeting on 23 November the Cabinet invited me, inconsultation with the Ministers principally concerned, to consider whether any changes were desirable in the proposed composition and terms ofreference of the Royal Commssion, having regard particularly to the need to avoid a State insurance scheme;  and also to prepare for considerationby the Cabinet the draft of a statement by means of which the government might announce at the appropriate time the decision to set up a RoyalCommission (CM(72) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 4).    I have now consulted the Ministers concerned and our conclusions are as follows.STATEMENT2. We propose that the statement announcing the decision to set up a royal Commission might bj on the lines of the draft in the annex to thismemorandum.    The only point other than those noted below to which I need draw the Cabinet&apos;s attention is that my colleagues and I concluded that it would be tactically preferable for the point that the Government hasserious reservations about any State insurance scheme to be made in replyto supplementary Questions.    It is therefore not referred to in the draft statement.TERMS OF REFERENCE3, Subject to the insertion of the words &quot;to what extent&quot; in the first line of the draft terms of reference, we think that the draft which was previously considered by the Cabinet (Annex to CP(72) 129) is satisfactory.The terms of reference would accordingly read as indicated in the third paragraph of the draft statement.
COMPOSITION4, I consider that Lord Pearson would be a very suitable chairman andI have ascertained informally that he would be willing to undertake the taskif invited to do so.    My colleagues and I think it desirable that the name ofthe chairman should, if possible, be announced as part of the statement that a Royal Commission is to be set upaNEXT STEPS5. We propose that the statement announcing the decision to set up a royal Commission should be made before the House rises for the christmas Recess,    Thereafter my colleagues and I would prepare proposals for submission to the Cabinet for the Commission^ detailedmembership.H of St MLord Chancellor&apos;s Department11 December 1972
ANNEXROYAL COMMISSION ON CIVIL LIABILITY AND COMPENSATIONFOR PERSONAL INJURYDraft Statement for the Prime Minister1. With permission, I should like to make a statement about thequestion of civil liability and compensation for personal injury.2. The Government have been considering proposals made from timeto time in the past, which are now particularly relevant in the light of theReport of the Robens Committee on Safety and Health at Work and inconnection with the recent concern over the thalidomide cases,, that thereshould be an inquiry into the basis of civil liability in the United kingdom for causing death or personal injury. It is the Governments view that a wide-ranging inquiry is required into the basis on which compensation should be recoverable.3. Her Majesty The Queen has been pleased to approve a recommendation that a F-oyal Commission should be established with thefoliowii^g terms of reference:To consider to what extent,, in what circumstances and by whatmeans compensation should be payable in respect of death orpersonal injury (including ante-natal injury) suffered by anyperson -a. in the course of employment;b. through the use of a motor-vehicle or other means oftransport;c. through the manufacture, supply or use of goods or services;d. on premises belonging to or occupied by another;  ore. otherwise through the act or omission of another wherecompensation under the present law is recoverable only on proof of fault or under the rules of strict liability,having regard to the cost and other implications of the arrangementsfor the recovery of compensation, whether by way of compulsory insurance or otherwise.4, Her Majesty has also been pleased to approve a recommendation that the Chairman of the Royal Commission should be the noble and learnedLord, Lord Pearson.    I hope to announce the names of the other membersbefore long.3
5. The House will have noticed that the terms of reference require theRoyal Commission to consider in what circumstances and by what meanscompensation should be payable in respect of death or personal injurycaused in a number of different ways.    Injury suffered in the course ofemployment is included (as the Robens Committee recommended) and sois injury suffered through the use of a motor vehicle or other means oftransport.6. The Royal Commission will also have to consider the question of liability for injury suffered through the manufacture, supply or use ofgoods or services.    Hon Members will observe that this will enable theCommission to consider the principles governing the award ofcompensation for injury caused by the administration of a drug such asthalidomide, though X must make it plain that no recommendation theCommission may make could have any retrospective effect so far as anycauses of action are concerned which may have arisen in the past.7, One of the difficulties which arose in the thalidomide cases was whether there is a right to recover compensation in respect of ante-natalinjuries.    My noble and learned Friend, the Lord Chancellor, has asked the Law Commission to consider the matter, and I understand that theCommission expect to be able to report in the course of next year.    Asimilar request has been made to the Scottish Law Commission by my rt hon and learned Friend the Lord Advocate.    The Royal commission should thus be able to take into account the report of the Law Commissionson this aspect of the matter and any action which Parliament may havetaken on it in the meanwhile.11 December 19724
