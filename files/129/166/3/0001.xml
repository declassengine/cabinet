HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 128 COPY NO        (3 fj21 November 1972CABINETREPORT OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON delegated legislation (THE BROOKE COMMITTEE)Memorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure have been considering the recommendations made in the Report, published duringthe Summer Recess, of the Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation underthe chairmanship of Lord Brooke.2. The Brooke Committee&apos;s principal recommendations, summarised at paragraph 143 of their Report and reproduced as an annex to thismemorandum, are for the establishment of two new Parliamentarycommittees:a. A joint Scrutiny Committee of both Houses to combine thefunctions of the present Special Orders Committee of the Houseof Lords and the Statutory Instruments Committee of the House ofCommons.b. A House of Commons Standing Committee to consider the&quot;merits&quot; of statutory instruments referred to them by the House.3. The proposed Joint Scrutiny Committee would have the function of checking the technical propriety of all statutory instruments now subjectto scrutiny by the Special Orders Committee or the Statutory InstrumentsCommittee.4. The proposed Commons &quot;Merits&quot; Committee would consider allaffirmative instruments that were referred to it on a Government Motion(such Motions being subject to a blocking power of 20 or more Members),and all negative instruments against which prayers had been tabled unless it were either agreed otherwise through the &quot;usual channels&quot; or 20 or more members objected.    Debate in the Committee would be on a &quot;take note&quot;basis.5. The recommended establishment of these two new ParliamentaryCommittees is generally in accord with Ministerial proposals made to theBrooke Committee in evidence given by the then Lord President and theLord Privy Seal last May.1
6. The main advantage of a Joint Scrutiny Committee will be that itwill avoid the present duplication of the work done by the two committees which it will replace.    The setting up of a Commons Standing Committeeto consider the &quot;merits&quot; of statutory instruments will, it is hoped, help to relieve the pressure on Floor time for the debate of affirmativeinstruments and also of prayers, which at present frequently go undebated.The absence of sufficient opportunities for debating prayers is a cause ofconsiderable concern in the House.7. The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure concluded,however, that certain detailed proposals made by the Brooke Committeeshould be resisted.8. In particular, it is intended to reject, so far as the House ofCommons is concerned, the recommendation that the Standing Orders ofboth Houses should provide that no affirmative Order could be taken on the floor until it had been considered by the new Joint Scrutiny Committee.There is already a comparable provision in the Lords; but acceptance ofthis proposal in the Commons would effectively give the Joint ScrutinyCommittee a potential blocking power, which might be exploited to bringpolitical pressure on the Government.    It is, however, the intention toensure in practice that the Joint Scrutiny Committee normally has anopportunity of considering affirmative Orders before they are taken on the floor of the Commons.9. It is also proposed to reject the proposal that the &quot;Merits&quot;Committee should consider all statutory instruments which have been specially brought to the attention of the House of Commons by the JointScrutiny Committee.    The functions of the two Committees are quiteseparate, and it is not clear what further advice could be given by a&quot;Merits&quot; Committee on a matter which is, by definition, a question of thetechnical propriety of an instrument.10.        Of the detailed proposals it is intended to accept, I would draw theattention of colleagues to the proposal that prayers which are blocked1 from consideration by the &quot;Merits&quot; Committee (under the procedure outlined inparagraph 4 above) might be debated after 11, 30 pm on a &quot;take note&quot;Motion, subject to not more than one such debate on any one night and atime limit of lj hours.    Whilst this may, on occasion, lengthenproceedings in the Commons and inconvenience the Minister and othersaffected, the Committee considered this a desirable further opportunity forthe House of Commons to debate statutory instruments which had arousedcontroversy.    It would be a reasonable corollary to the proposed blockingpower which, without such provision, might lead to the denying of debate on a prayer either in the &quot;Merits&quot; Committee or on the Floor.    I would,however, propose to commend this proposal to the House as being in thenature of an experiment.2
11.        It is not proposed to adopt either of the Brooke Committee^other suggestions for allowing extra time for debating delegated legislation in the House of Commons, namely the setting aside of certaindays for the debating of prayers or the reservation of 10. 00 pm to 11. 30on Supply Days.12.        The Brooke Committee is being set up again this Session,    It isexpected that it will now concentrate its enquiries on the general structure of delegated legislation and the possibilities of reducing the number of separate procedures.13.        The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure felt thatthe Cabinet would wish to be aware of their conclusions.    Unless, however,any of my colleagues would wish to have this matter further discussed,in which case I should be grateful for advice by Tuesday 28 November,I propose to arrange, in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, for our conclusions to be made known to both Houses at an early opportunity.J privy Council Office21 November 1972rnMcmcMTi a iwUNrmcNTIAL
