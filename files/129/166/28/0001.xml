CHAPTER 1 -introduction.     We were appointed on the 7th day of July 1972 underSection 70 of the National Health Service Act 1946 to inquire into the cause of the fire at the cold harbour Hospital,Sherborne, on the morning of the 5 July 1972 and the action taken including the adequacy of the fire prevention arrange-ments, and to report to you thereon.2.    Letters were written to the Royal College of Nursing,the Confederation of Health Services Employees, the WessexRegional Hospital Board, the Coldeast and Tatchbury MountHospital Management Committee, cold harbour Hospital,Mr Stoddart, and Mr Rawles indicating that we proposed to commence proceedings on the 17 July 1972;   we consideredthat these authorities or persons might be affected by the inquiry.    The date of the opening of the inquiry was announced in the press both national and local.   The Treasury Solicitormade staff available to assist the Committee and counselwere appointed to appear for the Committee.3. We opened the inquiry with a preliminary hearing inthe Assembly Hall of cold harbour Hospital on the 17 July1972. We announced the form that the inquiry would takeand the procedure that would be followed at the publichearing. Applications for representation were then madeto the Committee. We did not refuse representation to any party who applied for it either on this occasion or later.4.   At the conclusion of this preliminary hearing theChairman asked Mr Rawles to consider his position and asa result an application was made at the beginning of theproceedings on Wednesday the 19 July by Mr Stewart that heshould appear on behalf of Mr Rawles: this application was granted.
5.     We announced our intention to hear all the evidence in public with one exception.    The exception was thatdetailed evidence of the history and medical conditionsof the patients in the ward would not be made publicunless such evidence became relevant to the terms ofreference of the Committee.   The Committee decided thatsome of the evidence of this nature should be made public and this was done by means of a statement by the Chairmanat the beginning of the proceedings on 17 July 1972.6.     After the preliminary hearing we adjourned to the19 July 1972 and we then sat to hear oral evidence in theAssembly Hall of the hospital, which provided good accommo-dation for legal representatives, the press and the public.We heard evidence on the 19, 20, 21, 24, 25,  and26 July 1972.   On 27 July 1972 we heard closing speechesby the legal representatives, the final one of which was by counsel for the Committee.7. We adopted a procedure which has been used at manyprevious inquiries in particular the Aberfan, Hixon andRonan Point inquiries.Mr Jonathan Sofer, senior counsel for the Committee made an opening statement about the is sues likely to be involved and the evidence as it was then known.   We indicated thatlegal representatives might follow this with a shortopening address which should be confined to putting forwardtheir own client&apos;s point of view about any suggestions which Mr Sofer had made about them, and we granted anapplication that such opening address might be made duringthe course of the evidence, having in mind the short time which was available to all legal representatives to considerthe case of their own clients.   Witnesses were called andexamined in chief by counsel for the Committee save that,by arrangement between counsel, witnesses put forward by
an interested party were examined in chief by their owncounsel.   All witnesses were open to cross-examination by all parties.    Before   witnesses were called in each and every case statements which they had made either to the police or to the Treasury Solicitor were circulated.   We consideredthat time would be saved by treating such statements asthe basis of the evidence in chief of the many uncontro-versial witnesses and we adopted this course following the precedent of the Griffiths Tribunal on Ronan Point.9.     The Dorset and Bournemouth Constabulary prepared afile of 152 statements by the 17 July 1972 which was madeavailable to us.    This was of the greatest assistance andwe would like to acknowledge the efforts made in thisdirection by the Chief Constable and his Force.    From thedate of the appointment of the Committee and throughout the hearing of the oral evidence the staff of the treasury solicitor, led by Mr Graham Sills, interviewed witnesses,took statements, and collected copied and distributeddocuments, and we would wish to pay particular tribute to them.10.     We visited the scene of the fire independently andtogether, and we were taken through the whole hospitalby Dr Hucker, the Physician Superintendent.11.     We were provided with a comprehensive fire report bythe Dorset Fire Authority which again collected together the evidence and provided valuable analysis and commentsupon this aspect of the inquiry.    This is in addition tothe valuable evidence given by the Chief Fire Officer andhis assistants.    Experiments were also carried out by theJoint Fire Research Organisation, Boreham Wood, andevidence given of the results.12.     We decided to hold a preliminary hearing on the 17 July1972, and to hear the oral evidence there-after, because weRESTRICTED6
were aware of your anxiety to deal with the matter withthe utmost dispatch, bearing in mind the possible needfor further safeguards as soon as possible and the strain on the cold harbour Hospital staff.   We thought it importantalso to act speedily because of the danger of vital witnessesbeing unavailable at this time of the year.    The resultof our actions of course meant that we were not able toprepare the course of the hearings as we would have done if we had had all the evidence at our disposal at thebeginning,  but any disadvantages that may have arisen through this were far outweighed by the advantages.    As we have indicated above everyone co-operated to this end and noobjection was raised by anyone nor was any adjournmentasked for.    We have considered a large number of documents in additional-n to hearing the oral evidence but we do notthink it is necessary to set them out in detail as theywill be referred to in the report where relevant.
CHAPTER 2THE HOSPITAL AND THE NURSING ORGANISATION13.    cold harbour Hospital is part of the Coldeast andTatchbury Mount hospital group which includes sixhospitals and seven hostels.    The management structurelay, nursing,  and medical is orthodox.    The hospital management Committee holds two of its regular meetings at cold harbour Hospital each year.    The Works and engineering Sub-Committee also meets at cold harbour three times a year;  and there is a roster which entails a ,visit by two Members of the Hospital Management Committee every other month.    Responsible to the Group Secretary there isat cold harbour Hospital a Hospital Secretary and there isalso a Hospital Engineer responsible to the Group Engineerfor all engineering and building work carried out by thehospital staff.    There is a Group Fire Prevention Officerwhose responsibility extends over the whole Group,although many duties connected with fire preventiondevolve upon the Engineer&apos;s staff.14.    The actual number of nurses employed on 4 July was133,  10 short of the establishment.    This shortage was partly due to a policy of being more selective in thequality of new nurses.    Thirty nurses (11 trained and19 untrained) were allocated to night duty: we considerthat this number was reasonable both in total and in the proportions of qualified and unqualified nurses on dutyat night, but in the hospital as a whole the proportionof unqualified nurses is too high.15.    The ratio of nurses to petients over-all was then1:  2.6 and although this is higher than the national average Coldharpour contained a higher than averageproportion of high dependency pttients.    With the upgradingof the wards the number of nurses needs to be increased and the proposed establishment would make about another13 nurses available for night duties.8
16.    The Senior Nursing Officer, Mr Dainty, is in controlof the nursing services of cold harbour Hospital and is responsible through the nursing hierarchy to the group&apos;sChief Nursing Officer for the efficient administration ofthose services.    Mr Dainty has, reporting to him direct,four nursing officers one of whom, Mr King, controls thenursing services at night.17.    The unit to which Winfrith ward, together with three other wards, belongs is controlled during the day by anursing officer, Mr Norman,  and by a charge nurse,Mr Stoddard, by night.    Mr Stoddard was responsible for supervising the work of Mr Rawles, who was in charge ofWinfrith ward on the night of the fire. )18.    On the medical side Dr Hucker is the PhysicianSuperintendent and Consultant Psychiatrist with respon-sibilities not only for the whole of this hospital but,also, for three hostels at some considerable distance fromthe hospital plus a thirty bedded ward in a general hospital.    Dr Hucker is fully committed but the fact thathe is the only consultant means that he must of necessityspend a great deal of his time in cold harbour Hospital.Moreover, he lives within the grounds of the hospitalwhich is,  therefore,  subject to his close personal super-vision.    He is supported by one whole-time registrar(Dr Glenn, who is in immediate charge of Winfrith wardwhich she visits more than once on most days) and thereis also a part-time (9/11th) registrar, two part-timeassistant psychiatrists,  and cover from the localpartnership of general practitioners for physicalillnesses amongst patients at weekends and at night.19.    The responsibilities of the various officers seemgenerally to be in accordance with current practice butthere is one respect in which responsibility is not entirely clearly defined: on  the question of responsibilityfor deciding whether the doors in Winfrith villa were to
be locked or unlocked Mr Dainty, Senior Nursing Officer,stated that this would be a matter^br discussion betweennursing and medical staff - a multi-disciplinary decision.Subsequently it was made clear that the final decision was,in fact, for the doctor to make.    But Dr Hucker, in his evidence, seemed to imply that the decision on whetherdoors were to be open or locked was left to the nurses-on duty in the ward and it did not appear that he wasaccurately informed at the relevant time of the exact&apos;,situation as regards the locking or unlocking of the doorson Winfrith ward at night,  or of the defective lock onthe north door.20.    In general, the co-operation between medical and nursing staff appeared to be at a high level and multi-disciplinary consultation at all stages appeared to be the rule.    There were regular meetings of the day staff,  and   , .minutes of these meetings were circulated   but this wasnot the case with the night staff.    The relatively small number of night nurses made it extremely difficult forsuch meetings to take place and there was a lack ofcommunication between Mr Dainty and Mr King, while Mr Kingdid not regularly attend meetings between the SeniorNursing Officer and the nursing officers.21.    It appeared that the Group Fire Prevention Officerhad given an adequate amount of instruction in fire prevention and fire drill to the nursing staff and had carried out an adequate number of fire evacuation drillsin the months leading up to the disaster.22.    Indeed the number of drills carried out in thehospital as a whole were in excess of the numberrecommended by Hospital Technical Memorandum 16 but theproportion of night drills was low.    There had not beena fire drill in the new Winfrith villa although one hadbeen arranged for 6 July.    We consider that more nightdrills are necessary, particularly in a ward of this nature where the partitioning and the physical and mentalcondition of the patients raise great problems of evacuation.RESTRICTED10 I
23.    The Group Fire Prevention Officer, Mr James, saidthat more than half of his time was spent on maintenanceof fire equipment and we consider that he had not suf-ficient time to carry out his instructional dutiesproperly.24.    During our consideration of the organisation of thehospital and the nursing a serious aspect of the firerisks,  and indeed other risks, became apparent.    Manyhospitals of this type,  the larger ones even more than&quot;the smaller, have to look after a number of psychopathicpatients who are liable to commit arson,  violence, rape,suicide, self-injury, or sexual or homosexual acts whenat large,  and who, therefore, require security of varying degrees.    In some cases this can be provided by closemedical and nursing supervision, presuming the nursingstaff establishment is sufficiently generous.    In other cases, however, the security has to be provided byphysical means, and this means locked wards and lockedairing courts.    In a hospital like cold harbour, and perhaps even in a group the size of Coldeast andTatchbury Mount, there are not sufficient patients tojustify provision of a &quot;security&quot; ward and, in any case,there is nothing more inhumane than confining a small group of patients for long periods to a single lockedward without access to the social rehabilitative and recreational activities of the hospital.    Such patientsare by no means inaccessible to treatment but while theirpsychopathic disability remains severe they need securityof a type provided in the special hospitals; that is tosay a secure hospital in which all the patients have access to the communal life and all the therapeutic and recreational facilities of the hospital.    Sufficientaccommodation of this nature is not at present available.25. These patients have, therefore, to be housed in theordinary hospitals for the mentally handicapped and theyhave to be housed in those wards which have the highest
number of nursing staff.    They are unsuitable for housing in wards catering for the severely physically handicappedand this explains why it is still necessary in manyhospitals like cold harbour to contain a number of psycho-pathic patients in a ward which houses, for the most part,patients who are severely mentally handicapped and severely mentally disturbed although not usually danger-ous.    F6r these latter patients the ward does not have tobe locked,  even at night.    If there is a suitable fenceround the airing court this will prevent these &quot;low-grade&quot;patients from wandering and if they do walk out of theward they can easily be brought back, especially if theairing court is well lit at night.    Moreover, those liableto wander can be put to sleep in the area nearest to the night nurse&apos;s station and moved into a more remote partof the ward as they wander less.    If Winfrith ward hadhoused only patients of this type the ward could have beenunlocked, the doors vould have opened by simply turningthe handle and evacuation would have been much quicker .and easier.    It is, of course, easy to arrange mattersso that the ward can be opened from the outside only bya key, which would eliminate the anxieties of some nursesabout intruders.    But the ward contained patients whowere a danger to the community.    It therefore needed tobe locked,  and full security measures needed to be takento prevent these patients from escaping or from acquiringa means of   ignition and to prevent damage to orexploitation of other patients.    In fact,  an uneasycompromise resulted for the dangerous patients were allowed to mix with patients from the neighbouring wardwho had free access to matches, the front door of theward and the fire doors were never locked, and no steps were taken to secure the door on the northern side whoselock had been faulty for some time.    So the dangerouspatients were free to acquire matches, or to get out and do mischief; whereas the non-dangerous patients who were unable to look after themselves in a crisis were,effectually, locked in.RESTRICTED1 2
26.    If these dangerous patients are to be kept in a wardwith other patients who are not dangerous then either the dangerous patient has to be &quot;specialled&quot; ie kept contin-ually under observation day and night, usually by a relayof nurses, or he has to be kept locked in a single room or&apos;a separate part of the ward; or the whole ward has to belocked and this is cruel both to him and to the otherpatients.27.    We conclude that it will be much easier to achieveadequate fire prevention arrangements for wards housinghigh dependency mentally handicapped patients if suchpsychopathic patients can be housed elsewhere under special arrangements so that they can be subject to the requisitedegree of observation.
THE CONSTRUCTION AND UP-GRADING OF WINFRITH VILLA28.   A plan of the up-graded Winfrith Villa is at appendix D.    Room numbers in this and subsequentchapters refer to that plan.29*    The hospital was built in 194.O/41  to a design whichwas used for a number of similar establishments and was intended for use as a Naval Auxiliary Hospitalspecialising in orthopaedic cases.   The layout consists of an administrative block with a colonnade runningnorth which has single story wards on each side of it.There was a separate block to the south east which was used as accommodation for the staff of the Naval Hospital,namely the Sick Berth Attendants.   The new Winfrith villawas part of that building and it was originally designed as &quot;barrack room&quot; accommodation to house a large numberof men under war time conditions.   The walls are brickand concrete with a concrete floor and a roof made of pre-cast concrete slabs.   There were two blocks joined bya passage way off which the bathroom and lavatoryaccommodation ran.30.    In order to follow the policy of the hospital management Committee three wards in the hospital had beenup-graded to provide a more domestic atmosphere for the patients with two objects:    first to improve their conditions,  and secondly to assist their recovery in sofar as this could be achieved.31.   The improvement of Winfrith Villa was the mostsophisticated and advanced effort that the ManagementCommittee had made and it began with an interchange ofideas between Dr Hucker (the Physician Superintendent),Dr Johnson (the Chairman of the Management Committee) and
a number of experts on the alteration of this kind ofward.32.   At this stage it was accepted,  as it must be at every stage, that any improvement creates a dilemma.    Inevidence Dr Johnson said that the Management Committeehad &quot;been bedevilled by overcrowding&quot; and had beendesperately anxious to bring the living quarters up tosome standard by turning the open ward living quartersinto something more homely.   All concerned were anxious toprovide a more domestic atmosphere, to provide lockerspace for the patients to keep their own clothes, to splitup the large spaces by partitioning, to furnish the wardswith better articles and better colours,  and yet tomaintain security both in respect of the safety of the patients and the public and from the point of view of fire.   Dr Johnson said with regard to this,  &quot;It was a continuing dilemma.   We were dealing with people who wereunreliable and yet we had to try and make their conditionsof life more ample, and we knew every time we were up against fire risks that we were consciously aware of allthe time&quot;.33.   The ideas for the up-grading of this ward were discussed from an architectural point of view inDecember 1969 and January 1970,  and a preliminary drawingwas produced which indicated,  albeit in a skeleton form,the provision of partitions to split the ward up intocubicles.    This drawing and the decisions of that meeting were conveyed to the fire brigade,  and the advice of the fire brigade about the suggestions was contained in aletter of 12 February 1970.   The relevant part of this letter, which is of the utmost importance, is item 8 under&quot;Conversion of Blocks A and B into living quarters&quot;.    It
reads:    &quot;there is no indication on plan of the fireresisting standard which can be achieved by partitionedwalls and doors.    Internal surfaces to walls, ceilingsand space dividers should conform to class  &apos;Of inrestriction to the surface spread of flame&quot;.34.    The Committee draws the conclusion from that letterthat after its receipt the architect to the Board knew that the advice of the fire authority was that any spacedividers or partitions or separating materials put intothe ward to achieve a more domestic atmosphere should beClass f0&apos;.    In addition to the advice of the fireauthority, the architect to the Board had the guidance of hospital Design Note 2, published by the Ministry of health in December 1965* where paragraphs 62-64 deal withinternal linings and finishes from the point of view ofthe use of combustible materials.    It is right to saythat there is no provision there for partitions;    thereason seems to be that this is a note which concerns&quot; allhospitals of every kind and the writers did not envisagethe special  requirements of hospitals such as cold harbour.Nevertheless, in paragraph 64 it is advised that wallsshould have the same standard as escape routes, namelyClass &apos;0&apos;  and we consider that in this context &apos;walls?includes partitions or space dividers.   This refers backto paragraph 63 which says that the standard required isthat they should be non-combustible in accordance with the definition set out in that paragraph.35.   Mr Guest, Assistant Regional Architect to the Board,prepared a scheme on 30 June 1970 in accordance with thedecisions of this meeting, and subsequently a sketch plan was prepared in August 1970.    That scheme and plan did notspecify materials.   But in evidence Mr Guest in answer tothe question &quot;What do you understand by the words
&quot;partition walls and doors and space dividers&apos;, what doyou understand by &apos;space dividers&apos;  in relation to thatplan which you prepared in August 1970?&quot;    said &quot;I wouldunderstand in general terms that space dividers would bewhat appear to be walls formed of storage cupboards andlclothes lockers which would not go the full height ofthe room:    other divisions would surely be full height,full partitions&quot;.36.    On 19 August 1970 Mr Roland Greenen,  a partner inthe firm of Jadkson Greenen and Down of Winchester, net the  Board&apos;s architect and subsequently his firm wasappointed as consultant architects to this scheme.   Hewas given a verbal brief which included the thinkingand research which had already been done and in which themain thought was on the therapeutic benefits of thiskind of up-grading.   He visited cold harbour Hospital andsaw what had been done in the women&apos;s ward and hevisited other hospitals where similar but less extensivework had been achieved.   He was told that in the newward there would be constant staff attendance and he said in evidence that that was a factor which influenced histhinking.   When asked the question,  &quot;Was the question ofthe fire risk emphasised or not?&quot;, He answered &quot;Not assuch,  indeed the point was made that within reason some extra hazards could be accepted, not particularly withfire, but perhaps with security, perhaps with patientcontrol, with this kind of development&quot;.37.   The consultant architects then began to prepare their plans and to carry out the work for which they had beenappointed, and on 9 October 1970 there was a meeting atwhich Mr Purdy of the Dorset Fire Brigade was present.The Committee considers that there is no doubt that theonly fire risk matters discussed at the meeting were theposition of fire resisting and egress doors and the separation of Winfrith from the other half of the building
by a 4&quot; building block wall.   We are satisfied that atthat meeting no questions were asked and no advice wasrequested about the standard of the space dividers orpartit ions.38.    The consultant architects submitted plans whichwere agreed by the Board&apos;s architects,  and work commenced in the beginning of 1971.    These plans proposed the useof plasterboard for most partitions although there wasto be hardboard in some places.    If plasterboard had been used throughout so far as the partitions were concernedthen the standard  advised by the fire authority, namelyClass &apos;0&apos;,  in their letter of 12 February would have been achieved.    Plasterboard was not specified throughoutfirst because the consultant architects were never shownor given a copy of the letter of 12 February 1970 and secondly because,  as Mr Greenen very frankly said in his evidence,  in view of his b rief and what he had seen inthe wards which had been partly up-graded he did notconsider the divisions in the new ward to be structural,but regarded them as part of the furniture and fittings.39.   The specification and the requirements in the Bill of quantities as to plasterboard were considered at ameeting on the site in July 1971.    The only person present on behalf of the Board&apos;s architect was the MechanicalClerk of Works.    At the meeting Mr Hood,  an assistant tothe consultant architects, suggested the plasterboardmight be vulnerable to kicking and other behaviour fromthe patients and that hardboard should be substituted.In August 1971 at a later meeting this was agreed,  and meanwhile Mr Greenen for the consultant architects didaccept and adopt this.    The consultant architectsbelieved that the hardboard and covering fabrics specifiedwere all of at least Class 1  standard, but did not
appreciate that the various combinations would reducethe standard to that found by the experiments of theJoint Fire Research Station, namely Class 2 and Class 4.The only indication that the Board&apos;s architect had ofthis alteration, unless it was passed on to him by the      -Clerk of Works, was a copy of the minutes of that meeting forwarded to him by the consultant architects.There is no doubt that these alterations, which inevitably meant reduction of the standards of thematerial so far as surface spread of flame was concerned,were never discussed with the fire authority and their advice about it was never asked.    The work was completed and the building handed over to the Board inthe Spring of 1972:    they accepted it as satisfactory and according to the plans and specifications.    The Boardthen installed furniture and fittings of the following,nature:-   metal divan beds with wooden headboards and Vside rails, bedding to the standard of the Department,plywood wardrobes,  and cotton rugs and curtains.40.   Most of this material is highly flammable and none of it was specially treated to improve its flameresistance.   A major consideration in this respect sofar as the bedding is concerned is the frequency oflaundering, which is far greater in this type of ward thanin an ordinary general hospital:   bed linen can be of    /low flammability, but present methods of achieving this! vare not entirely satisfactory.    The policy of theDepartment as one would expect provides for these types of articles being supplied throughout the country on alarge contract and no special standards were imposed inthis case.41.    There were two hose reels in the building:    one inthe dormitory itself on the south wall between the linencupboard &apos; 63&apos; and the window,  and one on the day side
or the fire door on the wall outside the store.    Next tothe latter there was a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher.There were three fire alarm operating points:    one on the wall outside the store &apos;55&apos;, one just to the east of the fire door and on its dormitory side, and one just inside thefront door in the entrance hall.    Mr Rawles used the automatichose from the reel just by the fire door and it workedsatisfactorily.    The fire alarm that was used was theone just on the dormitory side of the fire door andthis also operated satisfactorily.20
A NARRATIVE OF EVENTS ON 4/5 JULY UNTIL THE FIRE WAS REPORTED42.   At about 20.30 hours the day staff were relieved by the night nursing assistant Mr Rawles.   He had experience of this work when at this hospital for seven months in 1959, andthen at St Augustine&apos;s Canterbury for 18 months to 2 years.He returned to work as a night nursing assistant at thishospital in August 1970.   He was not given detailedinstructions, written or otherwise, but was with an experienced charge nurse for one night on his return.   Onthe night of the fire, 4/5 July 1972, his immediatesupervisor was Mr Stoddart, a charge nurse of greatexperience who had worked in this field since 1935.  some37 years.    Mr Stoddart was in charge of four wards andMr Rawles expected to be visited by him about four timeseach night.   The night nursing officer in charge of thehospital was Mr King, who would visit each ward   between21.30 and 22.30 hours, and again before turning over to theday staff in the morning.   Other visits to wards by himduring the night would be irregular.43.   When Mr Rawles came on duty most of the patients were already in bed, but six or seven were still in the day room.Those who were still dressed were able to undress and get into bed by themselves.    They were all in bed by 22.30 hours.From then on Mr Rawles would be at his desk or patrollingthe dormitory.   At about 00.30 hours he had to change andbath a patient, which took about 25 minutes.    Just after he had returned to sit down at his night station, probablyjust after 01.O0 hours,Mr Rizzutti and Mr Lanza came fromYetminster next door fco relieve him for his break.44.    During the night each nurse has a break of fortyminutes and for this period he is relieved.   The chargenurse Mr Stoddart had relieved in Yetminster to allow that
nurse to relieve in Winfrith because the patients inYetminster needed less attention and this was easier for mr Stoddart from the physical point of view.45.   Mr Rawles went to Grove for his break and returned toWinfrith at about 01.50 hours.   While at Grove he used hiscigarette lighter and that is the last time that he canremember having it in his possession.46.   Mr Rizzutti and Mr Lanza left Winfrith at about 01 .55hours and walked the short distance to Yetminster.   Theyspoke to and relieved Mr Stoddart who left Yetminster at02.10 hours.   This is a time about which the oral evidence was to some extent in conflict but we accept the recordmade by Mr Rizzutti on a piece of paper and in his NightRegister.47.    Mr Stoddart went to Winfrith and allowing for hiswalking ability he must have arrived there by 02.15.Meanwhile a patient in Winfrith who occupied the singlecubicle &apos;6oT passed Mr Rawles sitting at the night station and went to the WC next to the bathroom &apos;44&apos;.   After 3 or4 minutes Mr Rawles took the patient back to his cubicleand walked back along the south wall048.    In doing so he passed and looked into &apos;51&apos;,  &apos; 52&apos;,and  &apos; 53&apos;* noticing nothing unusual either by smell or sight.We are satisfied that the fire had not started by then andlooking at all the evidence we find that this time was not later than 02.18 hours.49.   There is a conflict about the time when Mr Stoddartcame to the night station where by then Mr Rawles wassitting.   Again looking at all the evidence we cannot accept that this was as late as 02.30 hours and we find
nurse to relieve in Winfrith because the patients inYetminster needed less attention and this was easier for mr Stoddart from the physical point of view.45*   Mr Rawles went to Grove for his break and returned toWinfrith at about 01.50 hours.   While at Grove he used hiscigarette lighter and that is the last time that he canremember having it in his possession.46.   Mr Rizzutti and Mr Lanza left Winfrith at about 01.55hours and walked the short distance to Yetminster.   Theyspoke to and relieved Mr Stoddart who left Yetminster at02.10 hours.   This is a time about which the oral evidence was to some extent in conflict but we accept the recordmade by Mr Rizzutti on a piece of paper and in his NightRegister.47.   Mr Stoddart went to Winfrith and allowing for hiswalking ability he must have arrived there by 02.15.Meanwhile a patient in Winfrith who occupied the singlecubicle &apos;6o&apos; passed Mr Rawles sitting at the night station and went to the WC next to the bathroom &apos;44&apos;.   After 3 or4 minutes Mr Rawles took the patient back to his cubicleand walked back along the south wall048.    In doing so he passed and looked into &apos;51&apos;*  ,52&apos;,and &apos;53&apos;j noticing nothing unusual either by smell or sight.We are satisfied that the fire had not started by then andlooking at all the evidence we find that this time was not later than 02.18 hours.49.   There is a conflict about the time when Mr Stoddartcame to the night station where by then Mr Rawles wassitting.   Again looking at all the evidence we cannot accept that this was as late as 02.30 hours and we find
that this time was 02.20 hours.    They exchanged a sentenceor two and both left the dormitory with the intention ofMr Rawles making a cup of tea in the kitchen.50o    The dormitory was unattended from then until a cry orshout caused Mr Rawles to go back there.   At about 02.30hours Mr Rizzutti passed the kitchen window of Winfrithon his way back from examining the annexe to Yetminster andsaw Mr Rawles and Mr Stoddart in the kitchen.51.    It was between 02.20 hours and the cry or shout at02.50 that the fire started, and probably nearer the formerthan the latter.   The cry or shout from the dormitory washeard by both Mr Rawles and Mr Stoddart in the kitchen,and Mr Rawles ran straight to the dormitory.   As he turnedright from the corridor, on looking along the south wall he saw a fire directly ahead of him,  &quot;blue and yellow flames,but very difficult to assess how far along&quot;.52.    He turned straight round,  went to the fire alarm bythe fire proof doors,  and smashed the glass, calling toMr Stoddart as he did so.    He returned to the entrance ofthe dormitory,  taking with him the automatic hose from thereel just outside the fire proof doors,  but found that hecould not get into the dormitory because of the smokewhich had   by then reached the entrance and the area ofthe night station in strength.
ACTION TAKEN TO DEAL WITH THE FIRETHE RESULTS OF THE FIRE53.    As near as can be determined, the fire began at about02.30 or very soon after, probably in the cubiclesmarked  &apos;51 &apos; ,  &apos;52&apos; and  &apos;53&apos; on the plan.    It is now impos-sible to know what was first ignited: it may have beenbedding, but, for reasons which will be touched on later,there is an alternative possibility that it was the contents of one or other of the two wardrobes at the foot of thebed on the east side of cubicle &apos;53&apos;.    If this was so, thewardrobe door remained at least partly open.    For the first20/25 minutes the fire must have developed steadily, flamesincreasing in height from a few inches to the full height of the wardrobes and screens and spreading to adjacentcombustible material: very large amounts of heat and smokewould collect at ceiling height and spread outwards underthe ceiling.    At the same time, carbon monoxide would beevolved into the room and begin to sink, collecting in thespaces formed by the partitions.54.    The first sign of the fire that came to the notice ofanyone in authority was when one of the patients shouted,probably at about 02.52 when the fire had been burning for about 20 minutes, and this shout was heard by Mr Rawlesand Mr Stoddart in the kitchen.   We have established thatit was quite difficult to hear sounds in the ward from that point, even with the fire door half open, and this was probably not the first shout that was uttered.    The two menarrived at the dormitory threshold very soon after, and itis evident that the night station area - the part of thedormitory opposite the entrance - was relatively unaffectedeven at that time, at least at head height; there would besmoke and heat at ceiling height.   When Mr Rawles looked to the right - that is, down the south wall, he could seefire; it seemed to him to be concentrated on that walltowards the ceiling.    It is not conceivable that this could
have been the main body of fire there being little to burnat that point: he probably saw the reflection on the walland ceiling of the main body of fire in the cubicle oppositethe south door.    The fire itself would be hidden from himby wardrobes and partitions, and indeed the only position from which the fire could have reflected in the way suggestedwas opposite the &quot;doorway&quot; into cubicle *52/3&apos;, which iswhere the two wardrobes were that were referred to in theprevious paragraph.55.   When Mr Rawles reached the steps for the second time,he was armed with the hose with water issuing but could getno further.    This was only a minute after his first entryso there must have been a marked development in theeffects of the fire during that time: this is quite possible,since the fire would make advances from time to time byreaching some new combustible material.    The heat andsmoke had evidently reached down to head level by now(25 minutes from outbreak) even up this end of the dormi-tory; the atmosphere would probably produce unconsciousnesswithin a minute or two, at that level.56.   At about this juncture, four things would have been required to retrieve the situation: to give the alarm, to contain or extinguish the fire, to open the escape doorsand to lead or urge the patients through them.    The first,Mr Rawles had done promptly, but the fire had got such ahold by this time that the other three were impossible.He was attempting the second without success: neitherman could reach the escape doors to achieve the third;they could not reach patients other than those near the steps, and in any case few patients were conscious at this time and many were already dead.    Even at this stage itis possible that a resolute attack on the fire by a firemanwith the hose reel might have contained it, but this could have made little difference to the occupants ofthe room.    Perhaps realising this, the two men then ran
out of the villa by the front door, up through Yetminstervilla and round to the north door.    Here they were joined by Mr Sales, Mr King and others: Mr Sales opened the northdoor and gallantly entered the ward no less than three times to rescue patients, and the latter were being attendedto.    At about 03.01, due almost certainly to the openingof the north door, a development occurred in the fire whichput an end to any further entries into the dormitory byanyone other than the fire brigade.57.    The fire had been developing steadily, involving moreand more combustibles, but its growth could only takeplace at a rate determined by the supply of oxygen.   although there was some access of air through the open top windows,this growth had been steady rather than fierce.    Duringthis period, many combustible materials had reached atemperature at which they gave off flammable vapours withoutfinding enough oxygen to allow them to flame.    The openingof the north door admitted oxygen on a large scale, which enabled a vast amount of these vapours to ignite at thesame moment.    This (the phenomenon known as &quot;flashover&quot;)marked the transition from a developing fire to a conflagra-tion, in the course of which most of the patients&apos; burninginjuries were suffered.    None of them could be consciousat the time, and few could still be living.    The firstarriving fire brigade crews reported (at 03.10) that mostof the inside of the dormitory was on fire.    However, todeal with the actions of the fire brigade it is necessaryto go back in time.58.    Mr Rawles had broken the glass of the fire alarm justafter 02.50; the alarm worked perfectly, showing a light and sounding a buzzer on the indicator board in Studlandvilla.    Mr Musgrave, on duty there, sent through the callto the exchange by 999 at 02.56;  at the same time hesounded the siren and, after speaking to the fire brigade
control at Weymouth at 02.58 &quot;in a calm voice&quot;  (as was reported) rang by internal telephone to Winfrith villa to confirm that it was a true fire call.    Calls on the 999system go to Dorset Fire Brigade Control at Weymouth for technical reasons arising out of the interaction betweenthe automatic telephone system and the fire brigademobilising system: Sherborne firemen are called out by&quot;pocket alerters&quot;  (akin to a paging system) which areactuated by a radio signal from equipment at Sherbornefire station; this equipment is in turn operated by a signalon a system known as &quot;VF System A&quot; from Weymouth control.When Weymouth received the cold harbour call, the key to sound the Sherborne alerters was operated (at 02.58), andthe requisite signal duly went to Sherborne:    the radiosignal from there to the alerters, however, did not operate.There was a means of checking out the signal to Sherborne,which was not in fact used, but this would not have revealedthat the alerter signal had not gone out.    The only wayof knowing this at Weymouth was by failure to receive a message from Sherborne that the appliances were mobile, andthere was a lapse of time while this was awaited; the controlroom was, of course, extremely active at this time.   Whennothing had been heard from Sherborne after five minutes,a call was put through as part of a standard checkingprocedure to Mr Hicks, Station Officer in charge of Sherborne,at his home to ask whether his alerter had operated.    Onhis reply in the negative, the call-out procedure was repeated and worked correctly, at 03.03.    The Sherborneappliances were mobile more or less together at 03.08 and arrived at the hospital at, 03 . 09.   As we know, they foundWinfrith dormitory almost completely involved after flash-over, and members of the hospital staff were attending topatients after abandoning their rescue efforts.    Of the36 occupants of Winfrith villa, 30 had perished.27
59.    The Sherborne crews, aided later by crews from Yeovil,Wincanton and elsewhere, broke into the east end of thebuilding, put into operation the standard breathingapparatus procedure and began to remove the victims andknock down the fire.    Conditions were undoubtedly punishingin the extreme: flaming was finished by about 03.19, butthere was very great heat in the building for some time.When Mr Roberts, the Dorset Chief Fire Officer, arrivedat 03.45? he ordered all windows still intact to be brokenand this quickly accomplished the removal of heat and smoke.From this time onwards the fire was disposed of except fordamping down and turning over the debris.60.    The characteristics and behaviour of the fire maybe taken to have been normal for the circumstances inwhich it took place.   Had it been found within five minutesof its inception, some dangerous and difficult momentswould have ensued, but it is probable that it would havebeen controlled, and patients would have been rescued, thoughit is difficult to be sure that there would have been noloss of life.   As it was, the lapse of time created an impossible situation, in which those concerned carried out their duties in so far as they were able, and indeed insome cases showed great gallantry.    The alarm arrangements were adequate and worked well; the fire equipment was in good order; the fire brigade attendance was prompt afterthe initial delay; the mobilising of resources was prompt and adequate.    Fire-fighting operations were highly efficient,and indeed tribute must be paid to the early crews fortheir resolute work.    In speaking of the fire itself there-fore, there were few weaknesses compared with the strengths,but we would offer the following comments on those we didobserve:a.    The delay in calling out Sherborne had little or no effect on the result of the fire, but is a serious28
matter none the less in fire service mobilisingterms.   We are satisfied that the fire authority is taking it seriously, and indeed has begun action whichwill remove the risk of a repetition.b. When staff from other parts of the hospital ranto Winfrith villa on hearing the alarm, there was noorganised effort to open the locked doors.    The fire brigade crews had to force a padlock to enter thecompound and could only force their way into the eastdoor with difficulty.    In other circumstances thesedelays might have been critical to the saving of life,and should be avoided by prior consideration in theframing of fire routines.c. It is likely but not certain from the evidencethat one leaf, if not both, of the fire-resisting, self-closing doors in Winfrith villa was wedged open onthe night of the fire and perhaps on other nights.We cannot say that this had any effect on this occasion,but, in the case of a fire of different origin, itmight have had serious consequences.29
30THE CAUSE OF THE FIRETHE CAUSE OF THE IGNITION OF THE FIRE61.   We decided how the fire was ignited by elimination.First we considered the possibility of an electrical faulthaving caused either a spark or over-heating leading toflame.   We are quite satisfied that this was not the casebecause the electrical installation was new, the wiringwas covered in non-combustible material,  and after the fire it was found that all the miniature circuit breakershad tripped thus working as they were intended to.Immediately after the fire it was widely reported thatspokesmen for the hospital had reported Mr Rawles assaying he had seen a blue flash.   This naturally gave riseto speculation about the cause of the fire being electricalbut in his evidence before   us Mr Rawles said &quot;There wereblue and yellow flames but as such; as a blue flame onexplosion there was nothing of that nature&quot;, and also when asked by the Chairman &quot;It has been recorded that bothDr Hucker and Mr Dainty said you had told them that yousaw a blue flash&quot; he replied &quot;I did in actual fact meanblue flame&quot;. i62.   We next considered the possibility of the cause havingbeen the contact of a lighted cigarette,  or burning material from it, with bedding.    In this connection we heard evidencethat smoking was forbidden in the dormitory for patients orstaff although Mr Rawles admitted that he smoked on occasionsat his night station.    He denied however that he had smokedthere or anywhere else in the dormitory that night,  and we accept that evidence.   There is no evidence that any patientsmoked in the dormitory that night.   The evidence of the fire Research Station&apos;s experiments shows that the onlylikely way for a cigarette and bedding to have been the cause
would have been if the cigarette had been burning in afold of bedding,,    In an experiment such a situationresulted in flame after 46 minutes 50 seconds but therehad been extensive smouldering before that.    Bearing inmind our findings as to the timetable in chapter 5 weeliminate this possible cause.63.   Enquiries showed that no quantities of low flashpoint liquids were present in the ward.64.   This led us to the cause having been the lighting ofa flame.    When Mr Rawles left the ward with Mr Stoddarthis cigarette lighter may have been left there.   There werepatients in the dormitory who had threatened to cause firesand who had caused fires.   That night Mr Rawles hadreprimanded one patient for being rude to him and orderedhim to bed earlier than the others.    It is certain that on1 July three patients had been in possession of   matches,while on 3 July patients had been discovered smoking on anexcursion in circumstances which raised the inference thatone or more of them were in possession of some means of lighting cigarettes.    It is therefore possible that a patientwas in possession of such means when the dormitory was leftunsupervised.   During this unsupervised period the fire began,at the latest by 02o34 hours.   By a time somewhere within a minute or two of 02*54 hours the fire was burning to such an extent that smoke prevented Mr Rawles from entering thedormitory from the corridor.65.   Looking at the evidence as a whole and the above facts in particular we consider that the cause of the fire wasthe lighting of a flame by a patient while the dormitorywas unsupervised and that such flame was in contact withcombustible material.   Whether or not the patient was responsible for his act would depend upon medical opinionof the condition of the particular patient and cannot therefore be determined.
FACTORS AFFECTING THE SPREAD AND EFFECTOF THE FIRE ONCE IGNITED(a) The period of time for which the dormitory was left unattended.(b) The standard of the surfaces of the partitionsfor spread of flame namely Class 2 and Class 4.(c) The large number of wooden wardrobes of a class 3 standard.(d) The cotton bedding and curtains.
CHAPTER 7THE ADEQUACY OF FIRE PREVENTION ARRANGEMENTS67.    In considering the adequacy of the fire preventionarrangements we believe that it will be most helpful ifwe set out what fire precautions would be adequate inour opinion and then report any short-comings that we find.68.    The question of adequacy must be considered as awhole.   As was said many times during the oral hearings,one aspect cannot be divorced from the others and theresult must be a system incorporating checks and balances.A high fire risk in one direction which is unavoidablemust always be compensated by some other factor.69.    The risk of rapid spread in the villa must be keptdown to an acceptable level,  and this affects the choice of materials for equipping and furnishing it.    It isessential that the partitions or space dividers, and indeedall the vertical surfaces in the room, should be of thehighest practicable standard as far as surface spread offlame is concerned.    It is quite possible in our opinion to construct them of class &quot;O&quot; materials,  and this mustbe done.   When we refer to these structures we accept thatif a class &quot;0&quot; surface is not suitable for the use of pinsit may be necessary to superimpose suitable areas of limited extent which may be made of class 1 material as opposed to class &quot;O&quot; ;    but we think that it would bepossible to find some alternative method of securingdecorations which will maintain class &quot;0&quot; standards.70.    So far as the furniture is concerned the ideal wouldbe to use only non-combustible materials.   Whenever thismatter was raised we were met with the objection thatthis would detract from the domestic atmosphere;   we were
unable to accept this point of view,  as we believe it possible to create furniture which would be, if notnon-combustible,  at least highly flame-resistant.71.    In this case the wardrobes were varnished plywood(a class 3 surface) and this is a lower standard than was acceptable.    The beds, on the other hand, had littleenough wood in them and were acceptable.   The same considerations apply to the bedding.    In order to achieve the best standard it would be necessary to avoid the useof cotton wherever possible,  and to treat all thebedding chemically as we were told could be done.Bearing in mind the comfort of the patient and the laundryproblem we consider that the bedding supplied was satisfactory and that the high fire risk involved by its use must be accepted and catered for in another way.   Thesame does not, however, apply to the curtains, whichcould very well be of material treated to give lowflammability, and indeed there may be many materials usedin soft furnishings which might with forethought be exchanged for others of better quality in this respect.Low flammability in soft furnishings, bedding, and curtainsis difficult to achieve, but development is possible and indeed imminent in this field, and every effort must bemade to develop and test improved materials for these purposes.72.   All the above matters depend to a very large extent in their adequacy or inadequacy on the principle ofconstant attendance.    This is the most important aspect of the fire prevention arrangements, and the whole of theevidence convinced us that in Winfrith as it wasconstructed and occupied it was not possible for one nightnurse to maintain constant attendance.   He was required,so it was said, to leave the dormitory to inspect therest of the villa, although we do not accept that thiswould be necessary very often during the night.    He was
also required to leave the dormitory to bath patients or take them to the WC but there is a bathroom immediatelybeside the dormitory,  the open door of which is only about 3&apos; from the desk of the night station.   However, ifhe is bathing a totally dependent patient and anotheremergency arises he is in grave difficulties because he cannot leave one for the other.   We think it is reasonablefor him to expect a hot drink from time to time himself,and we accept that it is essential for him to providehot drinks for the patients:    as Winfrith was constructedhe had to leave the dormitory and go beyond the fireproof door to do this.73.   Constant attendance from the fire prevention point ofview could not therefore be achieved as the maximumacceptable period from ignition to discovery is five to six minutes,  and we find that the attendance on the night of the fire was not adequate in this respect.    Even if mr Rawles had only left the dormitory for the minimumamount of time a fire could have been started in the way that this fire was started, but the extent of the fire and the consequent casualties were due to the length oftime for which he was absent.   Mr Stoddart in his positionas Mr Rawles supervisor should not of course have allowedthis prolonged absence.74.   Adequate &apos;constant attendance&apos;  could be achieved byan increase in staff, say one extra night nurse betweenYetminster and Winfrith.    Instead of the night station inthe dormitory there could be a room where&apos;63* and &apos;64&apos;noware similar to those in the colonnade.   This room wouldhave a sliding glass viewing panel through which directobservation could be maintained over the &quot;highest risk&quot;patients.    In it the night nurse could talk to a patient,staff member or on the telephone without disturbing theward.    He could make himself or his patients a hot drink
and,  if he must and if it were permitted by the hospitalrules, he could smoke.    Even so, bearing in mind theproportion of epileptic patients and the inevitablebathing and changing of patients each night we do notthink that a single night nurse would be really adequate.If it were not possible to provide an additional whole-time nurse for night duty,  arrangements should be madefor the nurse to summon help from a neighbouring ward at very short notice when necessary.75.    If the exit doors from the ward did not have to belocked, evacuation would be much easier.    Doors neednot be locked except for the dangerous patient and thewanderer.    If patients of either, or both, of these groups have to be housed in such a ward without physicalmeans of security, then the need for extra nursing staff,as suggested above, becomes more pressing.    There areparticular difficulties in the evacuation of patients ofthis calibre and it is not possible to wake all the patients and take them out of the ward quickly enough.We consider that some system should be adopted whereby the   staff   who come to the fire as a result of theinternal alarm should be taught some drill to enable themto take some part in the evacuation.   This system must include arrangements for the opening of locked doors fromthe outside.76.    The instructions in fire prevention and fire drillis the next aspect and it is difficult to set a standard,because it is not a matter of time spent on this, but amatterof the standard reached in fact.    In this case, thiswas adequate but we consider that the duties placed onthe Group Fire Prevention Officer were too heavy and thatextra staff,  and probably additional training of existing staff,  is needed to carry out these duties adequately.
The fire equipment was adequate and satisfactory.77.    Finally, we would emphasize again a need for the fire prevention arrangements to be looked into as awhole and for stringent precautions in one directioncater for high fire risk in others.37
CHAPTER 8CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS78.    There follows a summary of our conclusions andrecommendations with reference to the paragraphs in whichthey are discussed in the text of the report.1.     The cause of the fire was the lighting of a flameby a patient (paragraph 65).2.      This happened in the area 151 *,   &apos; 52&apos;,  and &apos;53!  onthe plan (paragraph 53).3.      The night nursing assistant Mr Rawles was absentfrom the dormitory for a much longer period than is acceptable and the charge nurse Mr Stoddart should nothave allowed this  (paragraph 73)-4..      The spread of the fire was accelerated and its effect made more serious by the materials used in thepartitions  (paragraphs 66 and 69) the furniture (paragraphs66, 70, and 71) and the bedding and curtains  (paragraphs66 and 71 ).5.      Once the fire had been discovered everyone in thehospital acted promptly and in some cases with gallantry(paragraph 60).6.     The actions of the Fire Brigade were efficient and effective (Paragraph 60).    The failure of the alertersystem to act the first time did not affect the situation(paragraph 60(a)).7.     The patients who died were already dead or unconsciousthrough asphyxia and carbon monoxide poisoning before theywere burned (paragraph 57).
8.    The policy of the Regional Hospital Board, theHospital Management Committee and the hospital staff that the patients should live in a more domesticatmosphere and the principles which they followed to achieve this are entirely good.    The means of carryingout this policy must achieve it and at the same timeprovide the highest standard of safety.    In other words the wards must be designed to the requirements ofthe &quot;client&quot;,  (for practical purposes the medical and nursing staff) and the architects and suppliers offurnishings of all kinds must meet these requirementswith safe materials, subject to adjustment of therequirements by agreement   (paragraphs 31-32 and 68-71).9.    There is a need for more specialised securityaccommodation for patients who threaten securitythrough fire raising or other proclivities (paragraph 27).10.    The maximum period during which the dormitory shouldbe left unattended is five to six minutes from the pointof view of fire risk, and the provision of more nursesand the construction of an observation room provided withfacilities for making hot drinks must be considered.The risk for epileptic patients will also be catered for if this is done  (paragraphs 73 and 74).11.    If the system cannot ensure that the unattended period is limited to five or six minutes then we are forced torecommend the provision of universal automatic firedetection by smoke sensors.12.   Whatever can be achieved in other directions, Class&apos;0&apos; materials must be used for vertical surfaces: ward-robes are no less important from this point of view thanwalls (paragraph 69).     .
13.    In order to evacuate patients in this mental and physical condition a drill must be designed and taughtto the whole staff so that when they respond to theinternal alarm their efforts can be most efficiently used(paragraph 75).14.    The present position where the Fire Authority isonly able to advise is not satisfactory but will be curedwhen Hospitals are &quot;designated&apos; under the Fire PrecautionsAct 1971.    We are aware that other considerations will haveto be taken into account in the timing of such an order butwe hope that it will be made without unnecessary delay.15.    The duties of Group Fire Prevention Officer are too much for one man and we recommend that more man power bemade available for these duties either within the groupor within each individual hospital (paragraphs 23 and 76).16.   There was a lack of communication between the seniornursing officer and the night nursing officer and the night staff about developments, alterations, and instructions from the medical staff.   We think thatregular meetings should be held, whatever the inconvenience,so that all the staff understand changes in procedure and structure (paragraph 20).17.    Everyone must be made aware of the need for fireresisting self closing doors to be kept closed and all such doors should be marked with this requirement.    the closing mechanism should be adjusted so as to avoid therisk of injury to patients (paragraph 59(c)).18.    The policy of locking doors by day or night shouldbe kept under review on a ward by ward basis (paragraphs59(b) and 75).

cold harbour HOSPITAL FIREThe Secretary of State for Social Services (Sir Keith Joseph):1.     With your permission, Mr Speaker, and that of the House, I should like to make a statement on the Report of the Committee of inquiry into the fire at cold harbour Hospital, Sherborne, Dorset, on July 1972, when 30 mentally handicapped patients so tragicallylost their lives.   I should like to pay tribute to the committee under the Chairmanship of Mr Desmond Vowden QC for the thorough and expenditious manner in which they carried oat the inquiry.   TheReport is being published today as Command Paper 5109.   Copies areavailable in the Vote Office.2.    Publication of the report had to be deferred because, in viewof certain of its findings, I thought it right to refer the papersto the Direotor of Public Prosecutions.   The Director has now decided that the evidence does not warrant criminal proceedings against any person.3.    The Committee of Inquiry finds that the night staff were absentfor a much longer period than is acceptable; and that the spread ofthe fire was accelerated and its effeot made more serious by the materials of the partitions and furnishings in the ward, the specification for which had been altered in some respects withoutthe consequential effect on the standard of fire resistance havingbeen fully appreciated.   The Committee considers that the firealarm arrangements were adequate and worked well; that the actions of the fire brigade, once alerted, were efficient; and praisesprompt and brave action taken by the hospital staff once the firehad been discovered.   The Report makes various recommendations on fire precautions and other matters.   Some of these apply specifically to cold harbour Hospital; others are of more general relevance.4*    I accept - and so does the Chairman of the Wessex regional hospital Board - the findings of the Committee of Inquiry as to the causes of the fire.   The Committee&apos;s general recommendations arebeing urgently studied and meanwhile I have asked all hospital authorities to review their safety measures in the light of theReport.   My right hon Friend, the Home Secretary, who is responsibleRESTRICTED1
for the Fire Precautions Act 197*5* has agreed that, as recommended inthe Report, the designation of hospitals tinder that Act should now proceed as soon as practicable.5.    The Report records full approval of the policy that mentally handicapped patients should live in a more domestic atmosphere, andthe principles followed at cold harbour to achieve this.   It stresses,however, that the highest standards of safety must also be provided.These two objectives are inherently in conflict but I am seeking to reconcile them as nearly as practicable.   No one would wish to go back to the dismal old institutional designs and furnishings whichused to be the rule in hospitals for the mentally handicapped.   Thatenvironment was bad not only for the patients, particularly for thepreparation of those who will return to the community; it was alsobad for the morale of staff.   I am therefore reviewing the department sguidance to hospital authorities, taking into account research intoflame-retardant materials and consulting my right hon Friends, the secretaries of State for the Home Department and for the Environment.6.    The Report also refers to the need for more specialised securityaccommodation for patients who present a risk to others, and to thedanger of leaving wards with such patients unattended for more thana very short time at night.   The specialised medical and nursingcare required for patients who may be a risk to themselves or othersmay take various forms,   including either separate accommodation or special supervision in accommodation shared with other patients.   EyDepartment have a working group considering what further guidance is needed in the provision of such accommodation.   I have meanwhileasked all hospital authorities to review staffing levels and supervision, including night care, in wards where such patients arehoused with others who are not oapable of looking after themselves.I have also asked hospital authorities to consider in this reviewwhat instructions should be given to nursing staff to ensure thatthey are under no doubt what is ezpeoted of them in such matters as leaving wards unattended at night for more than a very few minutes.2
7.    My right hon and learned Friend, the Secretary of State for Vales,has taken similar action on the general recommendations in the report,in relation to those hospitals within his responsibility.8.    With the best will in the world it is not possible to guarantee that such appalling accidents as that at cold harbour will never occuragain; but we are determined that the lessons learned at such cost atColdharbour will not be forgotten.5
