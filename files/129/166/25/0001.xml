DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S government cp(72) 150 COPY NO w *12 Decetabsr 19 72CABINETCIVIL SERVICE manpower memorandum by the Lord Privy seal. The Cabinet agreed on 8 August (CM(72) 40th Conclusions, Minute 8)that there should be a comprehensive effort to achieve greater efficiency inthe Civil Service, with the objective of reducing the forecast staffrequirements for each Department by 1 per cent per annum, cumulativeover three years beginning with the current year 1972-73,    Ministers incharge of Departments were invited to arrange for a Minister to be givenresponsibility for seeking such staff savings in consultation with theParliamentary Secretary, Civil Service Department (Mr Baker),2, The Parliamentary Secretary has visited Ministers and although there will be some further discussions the initial exercise is essentiallycomplete for 1972-73 and 1973-74e    Some worthwhile savings have been promised and the effort has stemmed the tide of increases that wasthreatening to overwhelm us.    Before it was made the forecast totalstaff requirement (non-industrial and industrial) for 1 April 1973 had increased from the 705,000 in the Estimates to 717,000.    The requirement for 1 April 1974 had increased from 718, 000 in the Public Expenditure survey committee (PESC) forecast to 728,000,    These requirements have beenreduced as follows
1 April 1972496, 370*194, 013*690,383*1 Apcll 1973       1 April 1974Non-industrialRequirementReductionRevised estimateIndustrialRequirementReductionRevised estimateTotalRequirementReductionRevised estimate* = Actual totals522, 5112, 611519, 900194,5632,115192,448717, C744, 726712, 348535,4217, 326528,095192,3754,059188, 316727, 79611, 385716, 411Details are tabulated in Annexes A and B,3, I think it unlikely that staff will be recruited fast enough to reach the estimate for 1 April 1973, but any shortfall will be carried over intonext year.    This means that we still face an increase of 27, 000 in non-industtial staff over the next year or so which will bring total numbersat 1 April 1974 to a figure nearly 15, 000 higher than in July 1970,    In viewof the efforts which Ministers have made personally to reduce requirements,I must accept this demand and approve 1973-74 Estimates on this basis,subject to the usual detailed scrutiny.    The large increase involved, towhich will be added any demands to meet new commitments such as thesecond stage of the counter-inflation policy, is likely to revive political criticism in the summer of 1973 which will have to be met04. Nevertheless, the efforts we have made have had the useful resultof avoiding further Increases of 4, 700 in the April 1973 requirement and11,400 in the April 1974 requirement - equivalent to financial savings ina full year of about  9 million and  20 million respectively.    These savingshave been achieved as a result of the personal interest which Ministers havetaken in the search for economies and in the imposition cf taut control.    Iam grateful for their co-operation and hope that they will continue to takea close personal interest,5.        I ask the Cabinet to agree that:i. The Ministers in Departments who were given responsibilityfor seeking staff savings should be given a continuing responsibilityfor the improvement of efficiency and the control and forecasting of manpower requirements.ii. These Ministers should meet their Establishment Officersregularly to probe with them any proposals to increase staff and anyscope for reductions.    It should be the practice to consult the seministers at the formative stage before making changes in policywhich make significant increases in manpower demand.
iii.       The Parliamentary Secretary- Civil Service Department,should discuss with the appropriate Ministers those Departmentalmanpower forecasts in next yearfs PESC return which showsignificant increases or otherwise merit discussion.6. Continuing work on control and efficiency is essential in the interestsof economy, but it will not be sufficient to prevent the increase in numbers required to cope with additional tasks and demographic growth.    Significantreductions can be achieved only by shedding functions or by majorrationalisation of management,    The programme of managementreviews approved by the Cabinet on 16 March (CM(72) 16th Conclusions,Minute 5) will afford good opportunities for reviewing both the functionsof Departments and the efficiency of the systems whereby they controlmanpower,    The first review has just begun in the Scottish Office and i hope soon to settle the two or three Departments which should come nextin the programme.7.        I ask the Cabinet:i. To note that I propose to approve the 1973-74 Estimates onthe basis set out above (paragraphs 2 and 3);  and to settle a programme of management reviews (paragraph 6).ii. To agree to the continued participation of Ministers inthe improvement of efficiency and control of manpower (paragraph 5).J civil  Service Department11 December 19723
