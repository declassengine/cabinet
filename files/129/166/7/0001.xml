)OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT65CP(72) 132 COPY NO27 November 1972CABINETDEFAULT IN ENGLAND ON THE HOUSING FINANCE act memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment, On 26 October the Cabinet agreed to review this week the position on default under the Housing Finance Act (CM(72) 52nd Conclusions,Minute 3).2. Since then the number of English authorities who are stillsubstantively in default has been reduced from eight to five.    Barrow-in-Furness County Borough and Bed worth Urban District (UD) are likely to resolve formally to implement the Act within the next week or two.    Theposition in regard to the remaining three authorities is as follows.3. A default order was made against Clay Cross UD on 13 november and an extraordinary audit of their housing accounts began on 23 November.They are very unlikely to respond to the order.    But the audit is likely indue course to lead to a surcharge of over  500 on the non-implementingmembers of the Council and to their disqualification.    Ifk as is possible,every member of the Council is eventually disqualified, the County council could appoint persons to form the district council until new councillorsare elected.    Those appointed would be entitled to implement the Act,If the disqualifications took place after 31 December 1972, no electioncan take place to fill the casual vacancies arising on the existing districtcouncil unless an order were made to make the existing district a parishof a new district.    In that case an election could take place after the order was made, ie some time from the middle of 1973 onwards, and thecouncillors so elected would form the existing urban district counciluntil 1 April 1974.4.        A default order was made against Conisbrough UD on 22 November.If there are no early signs of a response to the order, I propose to issue a direction for an extraordinary audit.    A number of councillors are knownto be in favour of implementation and there is a reasonable chance that thecouncil may be induced to implement by these measures.5. The London Borough of Camden have implemented the Act as far asrent rebates and allowances are concerned, but have refused to assess fairrents for their dwellings or to increase rents in October by the required
average of 85p per week.    They have accordingly received a notice that a default order against them is being considered.    They will be making oralrepresentations early this week.    If, as seems likely, they show no signsof putting matters right, I propose to issue a default order against themand to follow it up, if necessary, by a direction for an extraordinary audit.Camden are entitled to more housing subsidies for 1972-73 under the Actthan under the superseded legislation.    In their case my power to reducethe subsidy entitlement following a default order may prove to be a powerful veapon, and, if they prove obdurate, I might wish to proposeits use.    I would in any case defer the half-yearly payment of housing subsidies which Camden would normally receive in December if they arein default at that time.6.        I invite the Cabinet to agree that:1. I should issue a direction for an extraordinary audit againstConisbrough UD if the response to the default order is unsatisfactory,2,        If the London Borough of Camden continue to be recalcitrant,I should made a default order against them and, if necessary, followit up with a direction for an extraordinary audit.3,        I should report on the position again if there are substantialdevelopments, and in any case as soon as practicable after christmas.G r department of the Environment27 November 19722
