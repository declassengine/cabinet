;IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT68CP(72) 127 COPY NO21 November 1972CABINETREPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON PARLIAMENTARYQUESTIONSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. We need to announce the Governments reactions to therecommendations made in the Report by the Select Committeeon Parliamentary Questions which was published shortly beforethe Summer Recess.    My two predecessors as Leader of the Housewere successively Chairmen of that Committee,2. The Select Committee was set up following a report in the Sunday times that civil servants in the Department of the Environment had prepared a &quot;bank&quot; of draft Questions on housing matters, with a viewto their being tabled by Government Members for Oral Answer when theSecretary of State for the Environment was &quot;top&quot; for Questions.    The thenSecretary of State made a statement to the House of Commons concerningthese allegations on 13 December 1971.    The Select Committee was givenwide terms of reference so that its consideration of the &quot;Question bank&quot;issue could be set within the wide context of a review of Question Timeprocedure generally.3. The Report has been considered by the Ministerial Committee on parliamentary Procedure;  and the Annex to this memorandum lists therecommendations which, in the view of the Committee, should be accepted and those which should be resisted04. My colleagues will wish to give careful consideration to therecommendation concerning the future practice with regard to thepreparation of Parliamentary Questions by civil servants (Annex,paragraph 10).    The Select Committee recommended that &quot;it is notthe role of the Government machine to seek to redress the Party balanceof Questions on the Order Paper, and civil servants should not in future be asked to prepare Questions which have this object&quot;.5. The view of the Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary procedure was that whilst this recommendation was not entirely satisfactory, theGovernment should accept it on the grounds:-
a. That in so far as nothing less would have secured theagreement of the majority of the Select Committee, it is, fromthe Governments viewpoint, the most favourable conclusion thatis likely to be generally acceptable to the House.b. That rejection of the recommendation might revivecontroversy over an incident in which there is now little interestsC That it forms part of a package which has the objective ofincreasing the opportunities for more individual backbenchers toget oral replies to genuine Questions and therefore of arrestingthe decline which has taken place in the quality and value of question Time.6. The Committee were satisfied that the proposed limitation on the role of civil servants could be accepted without conceding anyfurther restriction on the assistance given to Ministers by civil servants.They noted that the Select Committee had specifically distinguished betweenthe use of &quot;inspired&quot; Questions to enable information to be given to theHouse and the preparation of a &quot;bank&quot; of Questions for use as a meansof redressing the Party balance of Questions,7, As regards the Select Committee&apos;s other recommendations, Iwould draw my colleagues&apos; attention to the proposal to reject both theextension of Prime Ministers Question Time on Tuesdays (Annex,paragraph 12) and also the introduction of a new Friday Question Time;and to the proposal to accept the experiment in the rationing of Members&apos;Oral Questions, counterbalanced by the introduction of a system of&quot;priority&quot; Written Questions to which Members would be entitled toa Ministerial Answer by a specific date (Annex, paragraph 8)0    I believethat the latter two proposals, taken together, would be to the advantageboth of the majority of Members and of the Government.    The remainingrecommendations are of a minor nature.8, I seek the agreement of my colleagues to the proposals made in the annex to this memorandum, and to their announcement to the House ofCommons,J privy Council Office20 November 1972
