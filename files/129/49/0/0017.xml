THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1952.confidential. (52) 1729th January, 1952Copy No.cabinet government OFFICE ACCOMMODATIONMemorandum by the Minister of works wish to call the attention of the Cabinet to the amount of accommodationoccupied as offices by Government Departments and to the possibilities of makingconsiderable savings in this field.There are three ways in which reductions can be made (1) Existing staffs can be concentrated in new buildings. There would bebig savings from this but they must wait until the needs of defence and housing have been met.(2) Important economies can be made by better use of the space we have.(3) Staffs can be reduced.Post Office, the totals in respect of staff using officeExcluding the accommodation are19381951NumberAccommodated120,000310,000Floor SpaceSq. ft.19,000,00041,000,000A p proximateCost per Headper Annum 4080The floor space occupied at present is divided between the followingpremises:  TotalSquare No. of feet PremisesLondon OnlySquare        No. of feet Premises15,000,000 122,000,000 y4,000,000 J10,0005,500,0008,000,0002,300,0002431,256548Crown Offices ...Leased   .....RequisitionedSome 30,000 persons are accommodated in the requisitioned premises.2. It was hoped that of the 4 million square feet under requisition when we took office 1 million would be released as buildings now going up were completed.This has become less likely since the Defence Programme will call for additional accommodation. As a result many owners and tenants, who looked to a Conserva-tive Government to give them back their properties, are going to be disappointed.3. The public would accept this situation more readily if Departments were seen to be making the best use of the space they have. I believe that quite smallsnippets off the fringe of Government staffs, backed up by re-arrangements of accommodation, would allow considerable numbers of buildings to be released.I therefore submit a list of possible savings:  (1) The amalgamation of certain Departments. These are issues of Govern-ment policy. I understand that large economies are looked for from the amalgamation of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Transport.41791
(2) Joint use of local offices-Even without amalgamation savings could bemade if, for. example,: the Ministries of Labour, National Insurance,and the Natibnai Assistance Board&quot;, whosebwdrk is in the same field,would agree in principle to share accommodation in their local offices.This question is being examined by the Government Organisation..,,.;,.v,4 Committee. .,.. ,    . , .....(3) A review of the accommodation devoted to registries, training, libraries,welfare, and other ancillary services. Of the 10 million square, feet .of office space used by London Headquarters staffs, nearly. 2 million square feet is taken up by such activities. The Civil Service, like the Forces,easily grows a tail every so many extra staff require a pay clerk,registry clerk, training and welfare amenities all calling for space,furniture, light and heating. .Registries and records are making a growing demand for spaceand equipment. The Ministry of Works spends on behalf of otherDepartments about  200,000 a year on some 13,000. filing cabinets, someof which, for security reasons, are made in sheet steel. As an example of what can be done my Department has in recent months combed itsregistries for defunct files. Seventy-nine tons of paper have been sent tobe pulped, 80 cabinets given up and a quarter of a mile of rackingemptied. .       . :;        \ ,(4) More economical use of space generally.-$met the war stricter standardshave been laid down, giving the number of square feet per person,under which only very senior staff were to be allowed rooms to them-selves. But Departments have made so many cases for special treatmentthat nothing like the hoped-for result has been achieved. If in spiteof the admitted difficulties the agreed standards were put into force,a saving of as much as 10 per cent, is still possible in Headquartersoffices in London. Most of the premises held on requisition for thesestaffs could then be released. Although less is possible in local offices- there is further scope for saving in the Regional Offices.4. I recommend that an extra effort to save space should now be made. Butexperience shows that this will only be successful if Ministers are willing to givepersonal attention to this disagreeable task. If my colleagues would find it helpfulI would send to each of them a list of premises which I consider might be given upby a certain date. In focussing attention on particular buildings and parts of buildings.which might be released I would take into account both the staff reduc-tions now under consideration and the extent to which Departments are now makingthe best use of their space. Action of this kind would.cause inconvenience andmean some extra Work for my Department but should more than pay for itself insavings in money and buildings.:- M   ffi^Si D..E,Ministry of Works, S.E. 1,29th January, 1952.
