W. 1. ,11TH JANUARY, 1952.ANNEXTelegram  of 11th January, 1952, to the Secretaryof the Cabinet from the Permanent Secretary,Ministry of DefenceMy immediately preceding telegram gives text of paperbeing circulated to Cabinet on Service Estimates as result of examinationcarried out between Lord Swinton and Service Ministers.   The Chancellorof the Exchequer is in agreement with it.2. In revising their Estimates Departments have had special regard to the views expressed by the Prime Minister at the recent discussions.In particular :-(a) The total for all production has been increased from the 551 millions proposed in the Prime Minister^ Note to  582. 8 millions,including an increase of about  22 millions ( 8^- millions for the admiralty and the balance for War Office) in the figure of  440 millions suggested bythe Prime Minister for total expenditure in the metal industries.Wl. 4/)7i2/5&apos;-S!   loom.  4-51   \\&apos;A. &amp; Co.

(b)  1^.75 millions is restored for Admiralty productionlargely for anti-submarine and mining and anti-mining craft andequipment.   This restoration should avoid the need for any cancellingof contracts.(c) The War Office provision for production has been increasedover the Prime Minister^ provisional figure by  16 millions.   This takes account of the Prime Minister&apos;s direction that -(i)  Tank production should be given priority;  and(ii) Advantage should be taken of the easier textile position, and generally avoids cancellation of contracts.(d)  1 million has been added to the provisional figure for theair programme, partly on account of later and more optimistic forecasts forjet aircraft.   The present provision should enable the Air Ministry to obtainall the modern aircraft which the Ministry of Supply think it likely that theywill be able to produce.(e) The works programme has been adjusted in part in orderto enable the Air Ministry to make better progress with the airfieldprogramme.3, It will be necessary for the Cabinet to reach decisions onthe paper at a meeting arranged for 6.30 p.m. (United Kingdom time)on Monday next.   The Estimates will go for proof and further adjustments inany substantial number of subheads would be difficult.   It would not be entirely impossible at a later date arbitrarily to add a global sum to amain subhead.   But it would not be easy to relate any such adjustment to other items.4, The Minister of Health thinks that you will wish to showthis message and the Cabinet paper to the Prime Minister in Ottawa incase there are any points which he wishes the Cabinet to bear in mindwhen dealing with the matter.
