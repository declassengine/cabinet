% CONFIDENTIAL73C.(52) 40 COPY NO^15TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETFUTURE OF THE COUNCIL OF europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have been giving some thought to the difficult problems relatingto the Council of Europe.    Here are some reflections.The movement for unity in Europe, which led to the creation ofthe Council of Europe, is now flowing along two main streams:  the atlantic Community, a wide association of states which, without formalsurrender of sovereignty, is achieving increasing unity of purpose and action through the machinery of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation;the European Community, a small group of states which are moving towardspolitical federation by the progressive establishment of organisationsexercising supranational powers in limited fields.2. The Council of Europe is stranded between these two streams.Many members of the Assembly feel despondent about the future ofStrasbourg and some are prepared to admit that, in its present form, theCouncil of Europe is out-of-date and superfluous.    In an attempt toacquire &quot;limited authority but real powers&quot;, the Assembly has produced adraft new statute of the Council of Europe, which will be on the agenda atthe next session of the Committee of Ministers.     This transforms whatis now a purely consultative body into a quasi-federal institution withlegislative and executive powers and the right to be consulted by member governments on certain matters within its competence.    It would there-fore be difficult for us to remain in the Council of Europe if the new statutewere adopted.3. A more promising future for the Council of Europe would lie in aremodelling of the organisation so that its organs could serve as the institutions of the Schuman Plan, the European Defence Community and any future organisations of the same structure and membership.    Theadvantages would be:-(a) the Council of Europe would be given valuable workto do;(b) the reduplication of European bodies would be avoided;(c) the Schuman Plan and the European Defence community would be provided with ready-made machinery.The position of the members of the Council of Europe who are not membersof the Schuman Plan and the European Defence Community would have to be worked out between all the Governments concerned.
Re commendation4, I therefore suggest that I should be authorised: -(a) to propose to my fellow Foreign Ministers on the Committeeof Ministers that the Council of Europe should be reconstituted to permit the Committee of Ministers andthe Assembly to become institutions of the Schuman Plan,the European Defence Community and any future Europeanorganisations of the same structure and membership;(b) to discuss the position in the reconstituted Council ofEurope of countries which are not members of the organisations mentioned in (a) above.A,E,Foreign Office, S.W.1,15TH FEBRUARY, 1952
