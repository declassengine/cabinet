(THIS- DOG U MEN T-IS-THE -P ROPER T-Y OF HIS- -BRrH?ANN IG-MA J-EST-Y-^S-GG-V-ERNMEN-T-)SECRETC0 (52) 11 COPY NO.   C JT21ST JANUARY, 1952CABINETTHE SUDAN - EGYPTIAN CLAIM TO SOVEREIGNTYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on the 17th January, 1952, the Cabinet agreed (C.C.(52) 4thConclusions, Minute 5) that I should circulate to them a memorandum setting out a suggestion which I made for going some way towards meeting king farouk&apos;s claim to be King of the Sudan,2, The suggestion which I have in mind is that we might tell king farouk that, if we were able to reach an agreed settlement on the defenceproblem with his Government, we would be prepared to make an agreed statement with the Egyptian Government on the following lines(a) We recognise the need for friendly relations between Egypt andthe Sudan, and it is the common aim of Egypt and ourselves thatthe Sudan should attain full self-government within 1952,(b) The Egyptian legislation changing the title of King Farouk to&quot;King of Egypt and the Sudan&quot; and enacting the outlines of theConstitution for the Sudan should remain on the Egyptian statute book, but its effect should be limited by points (c) and (d) below.(c) Pending the attainment of full self-government, the present administration in the Sudan should continue;  thereafter theadministration of the Sudan should be in accordance with theconstitutional arrangements which will be made in connectionwith the attainment of self-government, pending the final deter-mination by the Sudanese of their future status.(d) Provided that the representative organs of government in the Sudanapproved, the determination of the future status of the Sudan shouldbe accomplished by means of a plebiscite, and the conditions under which such a plebiscite should be held should be deter-mined by an International Commission appointed for the purpose byagreement between the British and Egyptian Governments.(The International Commission might also declare the result ofthe plebiscite, and approve the measures taken to give effectto the decision which results therefrom.)3. Whatever we say must be compatible with our pledges to the Sudanese,namely, to support the Governor-General in his efforts to produce a constitution for the Sudan providing for self-government by the end of 1952and to ensure that the Sudanese people shall be able to exercise their right toself-determination in complete freedom thereafter.   Provided that king farouk!s claim to sovereignty was strictly limited in its practical effect as proposed above, there seems no reason to consider that the fact that we did not actively contest his right to call himself King of the Sudan wouldconflict materially with the Sudanese right to self-government and self-
determination.   The underlying conception of such a statement of principleswould be that we and the Egyptians had agreed to differ about the Egyptianclaim during the interim period before Sudanese self-determination,and that thereafter the Sudanese would of course be free to unite themselves with Egypt under the common Crown, or to choose independence, or to apply for membership of the British Commonwealth.   (Incidentally, I imagine that one consequence of this would be that we should no longer try to influence other countries against receiving or accrediting Ambassadors withcredentials referring to King Farouk as &quot;King of Egypt and the Sudan&quot;;  weshould not, however, ourselves do this,)4* I am aware that this scheme may have certain disadvantages.   Therewould be a certain ambiguity a,bout our position, and we might have to makeit clear, if we were pressed for a public explanation, that we ourselvesdid not in fact recognise King Farouk&apos;s title and that we were in fact doing no more than agreeing to differ.5, This might not satisfy the Egyptians,   On the other hand, it mightupset the Sudanese, who can hardly be expected to understand nicedistinctions concerning the Egyptian claim to sovereignty, and who mightreact, as they did to the announcement of the Bevin/Sidky draft protocol in1946, by making disturbances.   Furthermore it is arguable that a specific reference to the recent Egyptian legislation would focus attention on this legislation and revive the heat engendered by its passing.6, Nevertheless, if we are to reach agreement with Egypt over defence problems, it seems certain that we must do something to meet king farouk&apos;s claim, since he is the person upon whom we must principally rely inorder that there may be in office an Egyptian Government able and willingto negotiate with us over defence.   Moreover, it is desirable that we shouldbe able to convince the Americans that we are willing to make at least a gesture in this matter.   The proposal which I have outlined seems to me the minimum likely to achieve these ends.  As far as the Sudanese areconcerned, it has the advantages that -(a) it preserves intact the present administration free from Egyptianinterference and allows them to proceed towards self-government;and(b) it provides them with a further guarantee, over and above what wehave already given them, that they will be free to choose their ownfuture in due course.7. I have asked the Governor-General of the Sudan and H. M. ambassador in Cairo for their comments.   If my colleagues agree, I should like, in the lightof these comments, to discuss this idea first with the United States Government,Thereafter 1 should consider whether to instruct H, M, Ambassador in Cairoto put it to King Farouk, at the same time as he puts forward suggestions for breaking the deadlock over defence.8. I attach a note on the legal and political situations as they affectthis problem.A.E.Foreign Office, S, W01. ,
ISANNEXA. Legal PositionIt cannot be contested that, before the Mahdi revolt, the Khedive ofEgypt possessed the Sudan as part of the territories that he held under thesuzerainty of the Ottoman Porte,  At that date the Ottoman Sultan was the sovereign of the Sudan, exercising his ultimate sovereignty through theKhedive of Egypt, his vassal.2, At the present day there are three doctrines about sovereignty over the Sudan, all of which are arguable, namely:(1)     That, after the successful Mahdi revolt, the Ottoman Sultan and egypt lost all the title to the Sudan that they had previouslypossessed, and the Sudan was either independent or res nullius.The Sudan was conquered in a joint British-Egyptian expedition.The Condominium Agreement provided for joint administration and made no provision about ultimate sovereignty at all, andtherefore, since there was no ultimate title in existence and merely an arrangement for joint administration, the sovereignty,like the administration, is joint.(2)    That the Ottoman-Egyptian title to the Sudan never lapsed but theSudan was re-conquered to recover the Sudan for Egypt, butthere was an Agreement that the administration should be joint.Under this doctrine Egypt is the ultimate sovereign of the Sudan but is bound by an Agreement for joint administration.(3)    That the Ottoman-Egyptian title to the Sudan did not lapsecompletely after the Mahdi revolt, and the Sudan was re-conqueredin the name of the Khedive, and the Condominium Agreement was merely an Agreement for joint administration.   The ultimatesovereign of the Sudan was the Ottoman Porte but, in the first world War and as a result thereof, the Ottoman Porte ceased to be the suzerain of Egypt and the United Kingdom, as the protecting Power, took the place of the Ottoman Sultan as theultimate sovereign of the Sudan.   In 1922, when Egypt was firstgiven independence, the United Kingdom reserved the questionof the Sudan and therefore kept the title to ultimate sovereigntywhich it had obtained by a successful war from Turkey, butremained bound by the Condominium Agreement for joint admini-stration with Egypt.   Thus, the ultimate sovereign of the Sudanis the United Kingdom.3, While all these three theories are arguable, I am advised thattheory (2), that Egypt is the ultimate sovereign of the Sudan, is the onewhich would be most likely to be upheld by an international court, and the reference in the draft Sudan protocol of the Sidky-Bevin Treaty to the unitybetween the Sudan and Egypt under the common Crown of Egypt can be quoted in the submission of this view since His Majesty&apos;s Government were not in aposition at that time in any way to affect the status of the Sudan without consultation with the Sudanese and therefore could only have made this statement if they believed it to represent the existing status of the Sudan.The first view is that which has commonly bee n put forward by the UnitedKingdom, the third view has, so far as can be traced at present, never beenput forward officially at all.
1B.    Political situation, The promulgation of the 1948 Ordinances by the Governor-General,with the approval of the British Government, has in fact modified theposition since the Bevin/Sidky agreement in 1946, with its reference to the&quot;unity between the Sudan and Egypt under the common Crown of Egypt&quot;.The majority of the Sudanese today hope to secure full self-government through an all-Su.ianese Council of Ministers and an all-SudaneseLegislative Assembly by the end. of 1952;  thereafter they hope to determinetheir future status,   The reca/ii action of the Egyptian Government in passing legislation which changed the title of King Farouk to &quot;King of egypt and the Sudan&quot;, and which laid down the outlines of a Constitution about which the Sudanese were not consulted and which retained the essentialsof control in Cairo, has deepened Sudanese suspicions of Egyptianintentions.   At the same time, the Sudanese, while noting the assurancescontained in my statement of 15th November last, are somewhat apprehensivelest we may nevertheless do a deal with Egypt at their expense, in order tosecure a settlement of the defence question.   They are, moreover, doubtfulwhether we are really determined, or able, to introduce early self-government.   They welcome the Egyptian purported abrogation of the condominium Agreement, but as a result they are wondering wheresovereignty over the Sudan may be said to reside.   Furthermore, they aredivided among themselves about the political future of the Sudan and about the constitutional steps to be taken before self-government can beachieved.   In these circumsts.nces some of them have a vague hankeringafter some form of international supervision, perhaps by a United nations commission, until self-determination becomes possible, which wouldguarantee them against any possibility of a deal by us at their expense orany delay in the attainment of self-government.
