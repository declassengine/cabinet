THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MA.!ESTY&apos;S- GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1952SECRETCopy No. I UC. (52) 1525f/i January, 1952CABINETDEFENCE PRODUCTION PROGRAMME: DEFERMENT OF CALL-UPOF EX-APPRENTICESMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the Cabinet on 29th November last invited me to consider, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, the desirability of a limited measure of defer-ment for ex-apprentices employed on essential parts of the defence production programme which would be seriously delayed by the calling-up of these men(C.C. (51) 13th Conclusions, Minute 2). I have considered this problem with thethree Service Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply. Weare agreed that (a) if it were practicable to define sufficiently narrowly theex-apprentices eligible for deferment, and (b) if there were any prospect of being able to prevent widespread extension of the concession, it would be to the advantageof our defence plans as a whole to retain in industry a limited number of ex-apprentices who would normally go into the Forces. We are not, however,agreed that either of these conditions is attainable, and I accordingly submit thequestion to the Cabinet for decision.2. The Ministry of Supply has asked for the deferment of the calling-up of ex-apprentices in all skilled trades employed by the principal firms engaged on thefour following branches of work (but not those employed by sub-con tractors toprincipal firms:  (i) Guided weapons and the latest types of aircraft  ... 750(ii) The machine-tool industry    .......,.      ... 650(iii) Ministry of Supply research, development andindustrial establishments, including the R.O.Fs. ... 250(iv) Important radar projects       ............ 600The ex-apprentices concerned are men who have received at least five years&apos;comprehensive technical training, towards the end of which both engineer and craftapprentices have specialised in a skilled trade in these branches of the engineering industry and, indeed, form an essential part of the production team.3. The Services can make full use of all the skilled men available for call-up from certain engineering occupations (for example, the general fitters). Theycannot use all of those becoming available from some other occupations (forexample, draughtsmen, tool-room workers and skilled machine-shop workers) instrictly corresponding Service trades, though they can adapt them to other Servicetrades where their specialised skill cannot be fully used.The Ministry of Supply agree that the Services should be allowed to take thoseof the ex-apprentices whom they require as tradesmen, and whose skill they canfully use.   They also agree that no man should be compelled to accept deferment.Approx. numbersper annum2,250 -41769b
2Allowing for this and for a proportion of medical rejections, the actual number ofdeferments for the Ministry of Supply would be reduced to between 1,200 and 1,300a year..4. The Ministry of Supply case is that the firms and Ministry of Supplyestablishments concerned are finding it impossible to recruit the skilled labournecessary to meet their production commitments. As a result, the production of machine tools is being delayed and this in turn will aggravate the present delay in theproduction of aircraft, tanks and radar for the Forces, which is itself largely due to shortage of skilled labour. The defence production programme is generally ateither the design or &quot; tooling-up &quot; stage, at which the rate of progress dependsmainly on maintaining the flow of drawings and maintaining and expanding thecore of fully skilled craftsmen on to which semi-skilled men can be built as newlines of production come into being. For this purpose, these men are especiallyvaluable because their training has naturally been biassed towards the needs of the branch of industry and establishment in which they have been trained. This applies to those in occupations which are common to the engineering industry as a whole and all the more so to those in occupations peculiar to these sections of industry.Men recruited from other branches of industry, if they could be found, would allneed a period of adaptation for perhaps six months before they could be fully effective.5. The Admiralty support the Ministry of Supply and ask, in addition, for the deferment of calling-up of the following ex-apprentices:  A pprox. numbers in questionper annumDraughtsmen in all establishments (Government or private) engaged on Admiralty rearmament work        350Shipwrights employed in the Royal Dockyards pro-vided, if not already employed at Portsmouth, theyare prepared to move there       ,........ 100450Electrical requirements are at present the pace-maker over a very wide field of Naval production and these are being held up in the drawing offices of theAdmiralty because of a lack of draughtsmen, which all efforts have failed to overcome. The shortage is, however, by no means confined ,to electrical require-ments. It is almost as acute in the ship construction and engineering fields both inthe Admiralty and in private firms. Among the ships suffering delay are aircraft carriers and coastal minesweepers. As regards the shipwrights, the modernisation of H.M.S. Victorious was started at Portsmouth in October 1950 in order, more quickly and cheaply than could be done by new construction, to ensure that theNavy would be able fully to deploy the planned future strength of modern naval aircraft. At least 300 more shipwrights are required immediately and a further200 during the next twelve months if the time set for completion by October 1954 is to be met.6. Allowing for medical rejections, the total number of men for whomdeferment is applied for is accordingly of the order of 1,500 out of about 23,000ex-apprentices in engineering and metal-working occupations who become availablefor calling-up annually. (Over the last two years, there has been practically noreturn flow of skilled men from the Forces to industry on completion of nationalservice. A return flow is just beginning, which may amount, in this field, tp about16,000 this year, and will increase gradually thereafter to about 23,000 in two orthree years&apos;time.)7. The Air Ministry supports the proposals of the Ministry of Supply andthe Admiralty.8. Against these proposals there are the following two serious objections;Any further breach in the principle that the heavy obligation of national service in peace-time is one to be discharged by all fit young men alike would inevitablymake it more difficult to maintain general public support for peace-time conscrip-tion, without which we^coMd not get within sight of maintainpig Forces large enoughto meet our needs. With the sole exceptions of the basic industries of  pal-mining
and agriculture and a few highly qualified scientists, this principle has up to nowTteen rigidly observed.The second objection is this: while we are all agreed that, if the door to defer-ment in manufacturing industry is opened, it is important to prevent it being pushedwide open, it is my view, supported by the Secretary of State for War, that it islikely to prove impossible to prevent this, even if it is opened only to the relatively small extent proposed. In view of the general shortage of skilled labour, manyemployers in the engineering industry engaged on work of national importance,e.g., for export, would certainly be able to make out an equally good case fordeferment and the Ministers responsible for this production would doubtless feel bound to support them. There is already strong pressure for the deferment of someoperating grades of railway workers, supported by the Ministry of Transport, andit would be well-nigh impossible to resist this if once a concession were made tothe engineering industry. The agricultural industry is also agitating for moredeferment. If the door were once forced wide open, this might have disastrous resultson the whole policy of call-up, and would certainly have such an effect on thenumbers available for the Forces that it would be impossible to keep them reason-ably well manned. The Forces are already short of man-power, and there might then be no alternative but to increase, once more, the period of whole-time nationalservice to be served by the men who were called-up. ,9. If the scheme could be limited to draughtsmen and possibly one or two more highly skilled occupations (or, better still, to particular individuals), the riskof a catastrophic extension of the concession would be somewhat reduced, and thatrisk might be accepted, but I am most apprehensive and the Secretary of Statefor War shares my view, about the dangers involved in a scheme covering a wider range of occupations. The Secretary of State for Air, on the other hand, takes the view that the production programme for modern aircraft, especially modernfighters, is running so much behind schedule that, despite the danger which herecognises of a breach of the universality rule, on the grounds shown the Ministryof Supply&apos;s proposals ought to be accepted as in the best interests of defence. TheFirst Lord of the Admiralty shares this view, and holds, as regards the naval pro-duction affected by his proposals, that it is more important to avoid further delay in the provision of new ships or up-to-date equipment than to have even severalthousand more men under arms in the immediate future. The Ministry of Supplyconsider that it is not the occupation so much as the nature of the defence work being done, as defined at paragraph 2, which sets a clear limit to the concession.To restrict the scheme to a few selected occupations would detract substantiallyfrom its value, because all skilled trades concerned are inter-dependent and form part of a production team. They are, however, anxious to make deferment con-ditional upon Ministry of Labour technical investigation in each case, thus ensuring that there would be no abuse of the concession.10.   Decisions are required on the following alternatives:  (a) In view of the shortage of skilled labour which is delaying certain vitalparts of the defence programme, should the present administration ofthe National Service scheme remain unchanged in order to avoid anyfurther breach in the principle of universality?(b) Should the demands of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Supply for the deferment of all ex-apprentices working in the sections of industry andon the special projects mentioned above be granted in full, subject to the agreed proviso that the Services should have those whose skill can be fully used by them?(c) Should an even more limited scheme confined to a number of designatedprojects of the highest importance and to a few selected special occupa-tions of the highest skill be worked out, subject to the same proviso asin (&amp;)?W.
