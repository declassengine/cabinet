Printed for the Cabinet. February 1952SECRET v      Copy. No. ? 8C. (52) 49\9thFebruary, 1952CABINETTHE REPORT OF THE TEMPORARY COUNCIL COMMITTEE OF THENORTH ATLANTIC council memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe. purpose of this paper is to acquaint my colleagues with recent develop-ments in the Temporary Council Committee (T.C.C.) of the North Atlantic treaty organisation and to inform them of the action on this report which I propose totake at Lisbon. I attach (1) A brief prepared by the Mutual Aid Committee on the T.C.C. Report(Annex A).(2) The draft text of a resolution prepared by the T.C..C. for submission tothe North Atlantic Council at Lisbon (Annex B).There may still be changes, particularly in the military clauses (paragraphs 2to 11) of this resolution, but they are unlikely to be substantial.2. For the reasons explained below, I would propose to accept this resolution on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, subject to certain important reservationsexplained in paragraph 8 of Annex A which I would make in a statement for the record at the Council meeting..The Present Position3. Twill deal briefly with the present position, which is fully explained inparagraphs 1 to 9 of Annex A. The plan of action set out in the T.C.C. reportof 18th December was endorsed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It was felt thatin an election year there was no prospect of securing a larger American contri-bution. An increase was indeed not proposed by the T.C.C. This plan of action is now subject to. important qualifications, largely because France&quot; is unable toprovide the forces required of her and partly because other countries, notablyCanada and Belgium, are unwililng to make the financial contributions demandedof them by the T.C.C. This is made clear in a supplement to their report whichthe T.C.C. will present to the North Atlantic Council at Lisbon and whichsummarises the comments of the NA.T.O. countries on the report. The N.A.T.O.Fowers are therefore faced with a new situation.The Alternatives4.  There are three courses open to the N.A.T.O. Powers, namely:  (i) To adhere to the T.C.C. programme and refuse to accept excuses for non-performance of stipulated defence efforts.(ii) To ask the T.C.C. to recast their programme on the basis of the contri-butions which particular countries are actually prepared to make.(Hi) To accept the T.C.C. programme subject to reservations to cover thedifficulties in the way of its execution.41874 -      &apos; &apos;   , ... B
5. Course (i) does not offer any prospects of success. Belgium and Canadaare unlikely to withdraw their refusal to increase their efforts. The inability ofFrance arid Italy to fulfil their shares is caused by economic difficulties which theT.C.C. recommended should be largely solved by United States aid. But this aidhas not yet been forthcoming to an adequate extent.6.  Course (ii) would.be militarily and politically unacceptable because-(a) the revised programme would be no answer to the military threat (whichis constant) and would focus attention on the military risk, without-     .       suggesting the means to overcome it.(b) The T.C.C. report, although it is a secret document, has received consider-able and favourable publicity. It is generally regarded by the public- and by Congress as having solved the problem of combining adequatedefence with economic possibility. To admit now that the whole basisof the report had been invalidated would be open to serious poiitica!objection, especially in its effect on Congress and future appropriations.7- Since course (i) cannot be successfully followed at Lisbon and course (ii)would be militarily and politically unacceptable, only course (iii) remains, open.The problem was submitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself at theend of January on the basis of the information then,available. After consulting the Prime Minister, we decided that T.C.C. should be guided to report on the linesof course (iii), and with our authority a United Kingdom paper to this effect wastransmitted to the T.C.C. on 29th January. The T.C.C. agreed and the Resolutionat Annex B is the result.The Resolution8. In its present form the resolution advocates the adoption of the forcetargets and standards worked out by the T.C.C.&apos;s own screening and costing staff and recommends that these &quot;should be adopted as firm goals for 195,2, as provi-sional goals for 1953 and for 1954 and beyond as goals to be used for planning purposes to guide the early actions required to make possible the achievement of. these targets.&quot; It recognises, however, that &apos;&quot; many financial and other problemsremain to be solved before the goals can be fully met.&quot; It will probably state (the phrase is still under discussion in the Military Committee at Lisbon and is to be .reconsidered by the T.C.C.) that the T.C.C. programme &quot; provides militarily accept-able progress towards the effective achievement of an adequate deterrent force&quot;and it recommends the adoption of the programme. The military risk will remain,but this may be offset by the development of new weapons. In case the programmecannot be fulfilled, the resolution calls upon the Military Committee to work out asystem of priorities so that those forces most urgently required can be formed and equipped first while the creation of other units can be delayed. The-whole situationmust in any case be reviewed again in the Autumn, and annually thereafter. Theresolution also enumerates many of the conclusions of the T.C.C. report and makesdetailed recommendations about the action which should be taken to ihake themeffective.The Risks9. The difficulties in the way of carrying out the T.C.C. programme, whichalthough enumerated in the resolution may not be fully understood by Congress,will almost certainly result in a considerable slowing down of the N.A.T.O.rearmament programme. -There is therefore a risk that when this slowing downbecomes apparent, criticism will be levelled against the European N.A.T.O.countries in Congress. But this is a risk which is inevitable whether or not thereport is accepted.The Advantages10. The resolution as it stands will provide a basis on which the technique of reconciling defence needs with the capabilities can be developed after Lisbonboth inside and outside N.A.T.O.; this development may in time induce congress to consider more sympathetically the need for a larger United States contributionto N.A.T.O. defence, not only directly but also through the United States foreignaid programme. Moreover, provided that the position of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment is made clear to the Council at Lisbon, the Resolution does not commit theUnited Kingdom to a defence programme or any course of action which might laterprove unacceptable.:
Conclusion11. Given the basis on which the T.C.C. report was written, and the arguments for adhering to it (see paragraph 3 above) the.resolution prepared by the T.C.Cis the best that can be hoped for at Lisbon. I would accordingly propose to confirm the decision taken on 29th January, to endorse the T.C.C. report and therefore.toaccept the resolution subject to the comments and reservations in paragraph 8 ofthe brief at Annex A which I propose to make in a statement for the record at theNorth Atlantic Council. &apos;A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,\9th February, 1952.ANNEX AREPORT OF THE TEMPORARY COUNCIL COMMITTEE(Brief for Lisbon Meeting of the North Atlantic Council)The North Atlantic Council at Ottawa recognised that a gap existed in N.AT.O. between stated military needs and the economic capacity available for defence. The T.C.C. operation was an attempt to reconcile military needs with&quot; politico-economic capabilities.&quot; The gap has existed for some time and in theabsence of any attempt to bridge it, N.A.T.O. planning inevitably lacked realism.The fact that the reconciliation has been attempted and is proposed as an annualevent in future is, therefore, an important step forward.2. The United Kingdom participated in this operation with two objectives.First, we knew in advance that the only source from which N.A.T.O. could get a significant addition to defence resources was the United States. We hoped that theT.C.C. Report might provide a basis on which Congress would agree to increase her economic and military aid to Europe. Secondly, we wanted the operation to result in a build-up of N.A.T.O. defence forces which made the most efficient use ofthe available men and material and improved their readiness for combat.3. We hoped to get our first objective by the technique of testing each country on the politico-economic limitations to their effort. Thus, the declaredlimits (accepted by the T.C.C.) on the United Kingdom effort were shortage of steel and our balance of payments deficit. The other N.A.T.O. countries, with less validlimitations, were all, with the exception of Portugal, asked to increase their defenceefforts. The United States defence effort was, on the other hand, not limited by any economic factors. But, while the test of economic limitation was appliedto all other partners, the United States did not submit to it and maintained that hereffort was already so big that no increase was politically possible.4. Our second objective was to improve the efficiency and readiness of theavailable forces. This result should have followed from the proposals of theT.C.C&apos;s Screening and Costing Staff, proposals which General Eisenhower hasstrongly endorsed. It is true that the planned build-up of forces recommended bythe S.C.S. will not meet the full military requirements by 1954. But it provides a sound basis for progress by providing a plan of forces targets arid standards to beadopted as firm goals for 1952, as provisional goals for 1953, and as goals to be usedfor planning purposes for 1954 and beyond to guiis the early action that isrequired to make possible the achievement of these targets.5. Unfortunately the validity of this plan has now been threatened by theindication (not actually included in the French comments to the T.C.C.) that theFrench forces which will be ready in 1952 will have to be substantially reducedunless France gets increased external aid and by the inability or refusal of many ofthe other N.A.T.O. countries (notably Belgium and Italy) to agree to the increasedexpenditures recommended by the T.C.C.41874 &apos; ;- .  b 2
&apos; ;-6, We must therefore face the fact that not only has the T.C.C. operationfailed as a lever for increasing the United States external effort in 1952; but also it, is&apos;now doubtful whether we have got our military, objective of balanced forces in readiness in 1952. On, the other hand, the T.C.C. Report has received publicityfrom General Eisenhower and others as a &quot; miraculous &quot; success. Politically, itwould be impossible to declare it a failure and while it has not produced theimmediate results that we hoped for, it does provide a basis for continuing workwhich may produce more favourable results in the future than were possible thisyear, an election year in the United States. The Report does mark a significantadvance in United. States participation in the N.A.I\0. partnership. They took the lead in organising and guiding the discussions- they are as fully committed as anyother N.A.T.O. country to the plans for building up the forces.to meet, the N.A.T.O,requirements. Although they barred increased, appropriations in 1952,Mr. Harriman has indicated informally that the possibility is not excluded of anincreased United States effort in 1953 and after..7. The previous Government undertook the  4;700 million defence pro-gramme on the assumption that arrangements would be made in N.A.T.O. for the equitable sharing of the defence burden. In fact, they relied on obtaining externalaid if it was established that our defence programme involved us in more than ourfair share of the total N.A.T.O. defence effort. The concept of burden sharing hasbeen generally accepted in N.A.T.O. and the T.C.C. have reaffirmed the concept inparagraph 4 of their Supplementary Report. But, for the reasons given above, theT.C.C. operation has failed to put the concept into practical operation. In fact, theUnited States are distributing the aid so far voted by Congress not on any burden-sharing principle, but on their own judgment of the needs of each country. TheUnited Kingdom share of this aid is a fraction of our uncovered dollar deficit.8. The United Kingdom must therefore face the fact that burden sharing has so far failed as a practical method of safeguarding our economy against the impact of defence. Nevertheless, this failure,does not necessarily mean that the burden-sharing concept is dead since there is some prospect of it being applied more effectively in the future by developing the technique of testing countries on theirpolitico-economic limits. It would in any case be difficult politically to admit thatwe had abandoned hope of an equitable sharing of defence burdens. We should,therefore, not only continue to emphasise the importance of this principle, but alsopress for its practical application.9. The T.C.C. have completed their work in Paris by. providing the north atlantic Council with the attached draft Resolution under which the Council, while recognising that the achievement of the plan is subject to some important qualifica-tions, in particular those relating to finance, accept and endorse the T.C.C. Report,and direct the N.A.T.O. Governments and Agencies to take the further action bothin military and economic fields required to put it into effect. The draft Resolutionwill serve as a useful basis for future work in N.A.T.O.10. United Kingdom Ministers are therefore recommended to endorse theReport and the terms of the draft Resolution. It is also recommended that ourendorsement of the Resolution should be supported by the following commentsdesigned to make the United Kingdom position clear, both as regards the N.A.T.O.defence effort as a whole and as regards our share in that effort:  (i) We welcome the T.C.C. Report as a most important step towards the for-:mulation of an effective N.A.T.O. defence plan and we accept the buildsup of forces recommended by the T.C.C. as a sound basis for planning.(ii) We are ourselves determined to carry out the T.C.C. recommendations to the best of our ability but the implementation of our defence pro-gramme is dependent on economic circumstances, the most important of which is now our balance of payments difficulties. The recent retard-ing of our defence effort will not materially affect our military contribu-tion to N.A.T.O; in 1952.(Hi) We welcome the recognition in paragraph 111 of the main Report of &quot;thefundamental point, namely that the European defence programmes... - cannot be carried out unless sufficient dollars are somehowfound.&quot; We undertook our  4,700 million defence, programme on theassumption that there would be an equitable sharing of defence burdensin N.A.T.O.-an assumption that still stands. The present position is
: that unless we are able to cover our gold and dollar deficit by the middleof this year, the United Kingdom defence programme will be not onlyretarded but imperilled by the risk to our whole economy;(iv) We also welcome the recommendation in paragraph 15 (b) of the Resolu-.tion that an appropriate balance should be achieved between the.com-components of the mutual aid made available. We,need flexibility in the division between end-item and economic aid arid in the administrationof each component. The present rigidity in the administration of eco-nomic aid is already seriously hampering us in our efforts to obtainquickly the dollars which have been allotted to. us.(v) We attach.special importance to the recommendation in paragraph 13(c)of the Resolution that vigorous action should be taken to increase production of scarce raw materials, especially coal, steel and non-ferrous metals, to achieve greater economy, in their use and to channel them tothe most essential uses. Even with the promised steel imports.from theUnited States, we shall continue to need increased supplies of steel fromthe Continent to maintain our defence effort.. We recognise the iihport-ance of British coal to the economies of the Continental european countries and, as far as practicable, we are taking action without delay to put into operation the findings of the T.C.C. on coal, for example by increasing exports to Europe.(vi) It is impossible for us to make any further contribution to infrastructureas suggested in paragraph 10 of the Resolution if this involves any commitment on us to provide foreign exchange. -(vii) We welcome the proposed review of the defence, effort of N.A.T.O nextautumn and annually thereafter as advocated in paragraph 17 (b) of theResolution.(viii) We also urge that, as proposed in paragraph 16 of the. Resolution, an earlystudy should be made of the burden of maintaining the proposed forces during the later stages of the build-up and when the build-up is complete.These comments, which do not constitute any amendment to the Resolution, areamplified in the Appendix to this brief.appendix summary OF UNITED KINGDOM VIEWS ON THE DRAFTRESOLUTION1. General. We must acknowledge that the reconciliation between. amilitarily acceptable plan and the capabilities of member countries is.far from complete. But the North Atlantic Council Resolution at Ottawa of 19th Septemberdid not expect the T.C.C. to complete the job, but only to analyse the issues involvedin it. Given the time available and the fact that this is the first attempt, remarkableprogress has been made. The T.C.C. have established a technique on which thework can be continued and further progress made.2. Military. (a) The military paragraphs of the draft Resolution (para-graphs 2-11) are now being consideredby the Military Committee at Lisbon andwill probably be amended after discussion with the T.C.C. before the Council meets.As a result of these discussions, there may be supplementary&apos;comments, which Willhave to be put to. United Kingdom Ministers at Lisbon.(b) S.C.S. targets. These are covered by paragraph 2 of the draft resolution and are acceptable to the United Kingdom subject to the provisos in (c) below.They are prefaced by the qualification at the beginning of the paragraph that&quot; Many financial and other problems remain to be solved before the goals, can be fully met,&quot; mainly in order to meet the French reservation.(c) United Kingdom military contribution.-V/e can accept in general theforce contributions suggested for the United Kingdom by the Screening and CostingStaff, subject to the detailed provisos set out in the United Kingdom comments onthe Report of the Screening and Costing Staff (TCC-CC/2 Addendum No. 1 of25th January). (These provisos include among others the point-to which much importance is attached by the War Office-that the United Kingdom cannot/provide. Airv lt]6Z or
six divisions and two brigade groups in Europe by M * 30 as they have been asked.The United Kingdom-can only provide four divisions and two brigade groups byM +30; the remaining two divisions..wiil hot be available for operations untilM -f- 60-^M +90 ov/ing to the necessity for post-mobilisation training.) The retardingof our defence effort as a whole will not materially affect Our military contributionto N.A.T.O. in 1952.^^531id) Value of the United Kingdom defence effort-Our maximum effort forthe three years up to mid-1954 was declared to the T..C.C. as  5,078 million. TheUnited Kingdom comments on the main body of the T.C.G. Report (TCC-CC/2Addendum No. 2 of 2nd February) gave warning that our defence. programme would have to be retarded: This has been reinforced by the statement by the PrimeMinister in Parliament on 5th February that it was inevitable that the programme should be spread over a somewhat longer period than was originally planned. It isnot yet possible to assess the effect of retarding the programme on the figure of 5*078 miljioh. (If any question is raised on the effect of the 1952-53 service estimates on our previously declared effort it could be said that the revised total for the year 1952-53 may be  150 million less than the figure of  1,731 milliongiven to the T.C.C. in October last year.)3. Infrastructure-United Kingdom Ministers will certainly have to refer tothis subject which is bound to attract considerable attention. and discussion atLisbon. The difficulty is that (b) and (c) of paragraph 10 of the draft resolution,while not actually committing any individual country to contribute, might well be read as committing us to some contribution either as an addition to our militaryburdens or in substitution of some item of military expenditure which might .begiven up. It may well, be that neither of these possibilities is open to us. our balance of payments difficulties make it impossible to add to our liabilities for financing expenditure on the Continent. Therefore, the limit of what we can doin the way of a contribution to the third slice of infrastructure is our contributionto the cost of such infastructure as may be located in the United Kingdom viz., theCanberra airfields; and this may well be regarded by the United States and othersas inadequate. This important point is being made the subject of a separatesubmission to Ministers.4:  Economic conditions. These are dealt with in paragraphs 12 to 15 of thedraft Resolution. The principal items for comment are:  ,&apos; (a) Economic expansion. We agree with the emphasis placed on the needfor general economic expansion as the basis on which N.A.T.O. rearmament canbe carried out. But this should be coupled with a warning against the danger ofthinking that the progress of the last few years can be automatically continued particularly in view of raw materials shortages and the competing claims of defence on industries producing investment goods. Under the heading of raw materialsthe United Kingdom attaches special importance to 13 (c) of the draft Resolutionrequiring vigorous action to be taken to increase production of scarce raw materials,especially coal, steel and non-ferrous metals, and through adequate conservationand allocation measures, achieve greater economy in use and channel them tothe most essential uses.As regards coal, we recognise the importance of British coal to the economies of the Continental European countries. We are doing our best to put the T.C.C.findings into operation and we have in fact agreed to increase our exports in 1952by 2 million tons, although this will increase the difficulties of consumers in theUnited Kingdom. A separate brief is being prepared.On steel, we want to establish our claim to increased supplies of importedsteel hot only from the United States but from the Continent to maintain our industrial output at a level which can enable a full defence effort to be kept up.This part of the draft Resolution will give the required authority for us to partici-pate in action now proceeding in other organs of N.A.T.O. with the object ofchannelling supplies of Continental steel to the most essential uses and away from.-inessential uses in the United States and elsewhere. A separate brief is being prepared on the United Kingdom approach to the N.A.T.O. steel discussions,(b) Internal financial stability. We should endorse the general finding(embodied in paragraph 13 (a) of the draft Resolution) that the successful implement-tation of defence plans depends on the achievement of a sufficient degree of internalstability by all the N.A.T.O. countries. In the United Kingdom the importance ofthis is fully realised. The Chancellor stated in Parliament on 29th January thatall pur efforts will be brought to nought unless we are successful in dealing with
the problem of inflation. He went on to say that the interest of the balance ofpayments, which are paramount to this country, make it essential to introduce theappropriate Budget at the earliest possible date (4th March) and thus complete the third stage in the operation which he began last November.ic) Dollar balance of payments (see paragraph 15 of the draft Resolution).-We attach great importance to the recognition by the Committee,:in paragraph 111of the main Report of. the &quot; fundamental point, namely, that the European defence programmes proposed in this fceport cannot be carried out unless sufficient dollarsare somehow found, both over the period as a whole and as and where they are needed year by year.&quot; . . .      -The salient point is that the maintenance of our defence effort depends uponpur gold and dollar deficit being covered by the middle of 1952. So far the measures taken by the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth Sterling Area have not succeeded in closing this gap and the external support in prospect from the UnitedStates is insufficient and unlikely to be received in time. If we fail to close the gap, the United Kingdom defence programme will be riot only retarded but willstop with the collapse of our whole economy. -We should also welcome the reference by the Committee to the need forflexibility to be maintained in the administration of funds provided by the UnitedStates under the Mutual Security Act. The present rigidity in the administrationof these funds is seriously hampering our efforts to obtain quickly the economic aid which has been promised to us. Flexibility, especially in the division of fundsbetween economic and end item assistance, is essential to ensure the best use of available funds. The point is developed in more detail in paragraph 16 of theUnited Kingdom comments on the main body of the T.C.C. Report (TCC-CC/2,Addendum 2).The United Kingdom balance of payments position is dealt with more fully in a separate brief.id) Economic burden of maintaining the proposed forces during the later stages of the build-up and when the build-up is complete. Paragraph 16 of thedraft Resolution directs the appropriate N.A.T.O. Agencies to study this problem.It is made more serious by the decision to extend the completion of the programmebeyond 1954, so that after 1954 Europe must face the combined burden of build-up and maintenance. It is important that this study should be carried out quicklybefore Europe finds itself committed to expenditure on building Up larger forcesthan it can maintain. (The background to this part of the Resolution is the indica-tion given by United States representatives that after 1954 external aid must stopand Europe must maintain her defence forces out of her own resources.).5. Technique and procedure.-Jhe N.A.T.O. organisation required to carryforward the work initiated by the T.C.C. is the subject of a separate brief. Butin the context of theT.C.C. Report it would be useful for United Kingdom ministers to stress the value of the new technique devised and operated by the T.C.C. onthe economic side, viz., the assumption that each country should make a defence effort up to the limit of its capabilities and should be tested on the factors thatare said to limit its capacity. The T.C.C. operation has so far failed to devise ascheme for the practical application of the equitable burden-sharing principle.Nevertheless we welcome the reaffirmation in paragraph 4 of their supplementary report of &quot; the principle underlying N.A.T.O. that there should be an equitable .sharing of the joint defence burden.&quot; We should emphasise that our defence effort was undertaken and commitments incurred on the expectation that defence burdenswould be equitably shared. What is urgently needed is not only the reaffirmationof the principle, but the will to put the principle into practical effect.6. Annual review. Paragraph 17 ib) of the draft Resolution proposes thatthere should be a comprehensive annual review of the requirements for building and maintaining adequate strength on a realistic foundation of politico-economic capa-bilities, and that the first review should be completed in the autumn of 1952. we welcome the proposal for an annual review of military programmes since we regard this as a useful means of ensuring that all the N.A.T.O. countries are being, pressed to undertake their maximum effort.
ANNEXBDRAFT RESOLUTION FOR NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL ONTEMPORARY COUNCIL COMMITTEE REPORT PREPARED BY THETEMPORARY COUNCIL COMMITTEEPROVISIONAL TEXT(Subject to final consideration by the T.C.C. in Lisbon on 17th February)Whereas, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has, from its inception,been developing programmes for the creation of adequate defensive strength essen-tial to the maintenance of peace and freedom, and has been, in accordance with article 3, implementing these programmes through national efforts to build upforces, and through mutual aid. including the extension of assistance freely under-taken to each other in the form of economic resources and military equipment; andWhereas, the North Atlantic Council at its meeting in Ottawa on 19thSeptember, 1951, authorised the establishment of a committee to prepare an analysis of the issues involved in reconciling on the one hand the requirements of externalsecurity, in particular in fulfilling a militarily acceptable N.A.T.O. plan for thedefence of Western Europe, with, on the other hand, the realistic politico-economiccapabilities of member countries; andWhereas, in accordance with this resolution the Temporary Council Committeehas completed such an analysis and prepared a report thereon dated 18th December,1951, as well as a supplementary report dated 8th February, 1952, to which areannexed the comments of the North Atlantic Treaty Governments,Therefore, the North Atlantic Council 1. Agrees that it is necessary to promote by every means the development ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and its Military Commands as operationallyeffective bodies; andInvites Governments and directs N.A.T.O. Agencies and Commands, in con-sultation with national Governments and within their respective authority, to take as a matter of urgency all steps necessary to ensure the continuous developmentof the operational effectiveness of the Organisation, and to report progress to theCouncil at regular intervals.2. While recognising that many financial and other problems remain to be solved before the goals can be fully met,Resolves that the force targets recommended by the T.C.C. be adopted asfirm goals for 1952, as provisional goals for 1953, and for 1954 as goals to be usedfor planning purposes to guide the early actions required to make possible the achievement of these targets.3. Resolves that the achievement of the forces recommended for 1952 willprovide an increased deterrent to aggression; that the plan of action laid downin the T.C.C. Report provides a militarily acceptable method for the effectiveachievement of an adequate deterrent force in Western Europe based on a sound economic structure in the North Atlantic Community.4. Resolves that the general method of N.A.T.O. programming proposedin the T.C.C. report be adopted: namely, the determination of the maximumeffective forces which can be achieved in the short-term, and the definition of the steps which must now be initiated to achieve a progressive build-up to militarilyacceptable force levels.- 5.-[a) Resolves that the force targets recommended by the T.C.C. representa build-up which would greatly facilitate the eventual achievement of the forcerequirements made available to the T.C.C., these requirements being subject to future revision. ....(b) Notes the assumption of a substantial German participation in the buud-upthrough forces in a European defence community as well as contributions byGermany in other ways.
6.-(a) Recognises that, on the basis of estimates of requirements made avail-able to the T.C.C., there remains a military risk after the force build-uprecommended by the T.C.C. has been achieved;ib) Notes that the T.C.C. Report and other N.A.T.O. studies to date hivehot taken into account in detail the effects of certain new weapons and techniques;and. , i y     ;  *    &quot; &apos;   &apos;Recommends that as it becomes possible, these effects should be more definitelytaken into account in determining the risks, the force requirements, and theorganisation of N.A.T.O. forces. .7-(a) Resolves that the T.C.C. recommendations with regard to the readinessand effectiveness of forces and economy in use of resources are basically sound, that each country should do its utmost to implement them, co-ordinating implement a-tion with the appropriate Supreme Allied Commander with respect to forcesassigned or earmarked to his command;ib) Adopts, the S.C.S. standards of readiness of forces as a means of measuringprogress for calendar year 1952;(c) Directs that the Military Committee undertake further studies to fix the standards for subsequent years in order to ensure the readiness of the greatest possible number of units from resources available and improve continuously thestate of readiness of military forces.8. (a) Approves the revised directive of the Standing Group (Annex A)*and revised terms of reference of SACEUR (Annex B) ;*ib) Invites nations to take all possible action to enable SACEUR to fulfil theresponsibility and authority placed upon him under his revised terms of reference; .(c) Stresses the importance of the closest possible liaison in the area of hisexpanded responsibilities between SACEUR and the appropriate nationalauthorities; and Id) Directs the Military Committee to continue to review arrangements for mutual support between different N.A.T.O. commands within N.A.T.O. areas and between them and national military commands with a view to maximum economy of force and military effectiveness.9. id) Directs the Military Committee, in consultation with major N.A.T.O.commands, to devise and put into operation a system designed to ensure that thehighest priority is given to the most important units and activities (including theprovision of infrastructure) and that less important units and activities receive lowerpriority, this system, to be based on the accepted concept of the provision ofcollectively balanced N.A.T.O. forces; andInvites Governments to take fully into account in the build-up of their forces the guidance so provided; and (b)) Directs the Military Committee to establish immediately a system of priorities for assignment of major items of equipment, which should be related topriorities in the development of other elements of the military build-up in N.A.T.O.countries and in Germany, such a system of priorities to be based on the principleof priorities as between commands being established by the Military Committeeand priorities within major commands by the Commander concerned, andInvites Governments to take these priorities fully into account in the provisionof equipment;(c) Directs the Military Committee and the major N.A.T.O.
