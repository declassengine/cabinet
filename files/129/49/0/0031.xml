Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1952SECRET Copy No.C. (52) 31%th February, 1952CABINETGERMAN CONTRACTUAL settlement memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in my memorandum C. (51) 24 of 20th November, I drew my colleagues&apos;attention to a draft Agreement on General Relations negotiated by the UnitedKingdom, United States and French High Commissioners in Germany with theGerman Federal Chancellor. This draft establishes in broad outline the changesin present occupation arrangements, which would accompany a German contri-bution to defence. It was, with very minor amendments, provisionally approvedwhen M. Schuman, Mr. Acheson and I met Dr. Adenauer in Paris on 22ndNovember.   The final text is at Annex I.2. Since that date, the Allied High Commission has continued negotiationswith the Federal Government on the Conventions and other detailed undertakingsthat are needed to complete the settlement. It had been hoped that this workmight be completed before the Lisbon meeting of the North Atlantic Council, butthis has not proved possible. I attach as Annex II a statement showing theproposed form of the settlement and the position reached on each issue. Muchhas been successfully accomplished in these complex negotiations. But the con-ventions are not yet complete, nor have they been brought to the point at which only a small number of vital points are outstanding, on which Ministers might hope to reach final agreement before Lisbon. Work has been particularly retardedon the difficult subjects of a German financial and economic contribution to defence and of war criminals. Nor has agreement yet been reached on the question of security controls over German rearmament.3. Progress on these and other questions has in the last few days beenretarded by the repercussions of the French Governmenfs decision to appoint an ambassador in the Saar and of the German Governmenfs decision to raise thequestion of the association of the European Defence Community, of which germany is to be a member, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, of which she is not a member. The flurry caused by these events will, I hope, subside beforethe Lisbon meeting. But it has increased the already serious difficulties facing boththe French and the German Governments in securing the approval of theirParliaments for the German defence contribution and therefore for the Germancontractual settlement, since both must enter into force together. French publicopinion is disturbed over the possible revival of nationalist tendencies in Germany.German public opinion is not unanimous that German rearmament and conscrip-tion should be accepted. It is sensitive about the effects of such a decision on theprospects of German reunification and suspects that Germany is being asked tocontribute to the defence of the West without equal status. The whole programme has therefore reached a critical phase. The situation will, I hope, become clearerafter the, debates on foreign affairs in the Bundestag and the French Chamberwithin the next week.4. In spite of these uncertainties, Lam satisfied that our present policy is onthe right lines, and is indeed the only way (a) to bring Germany safely within the41840 b
Western community, and (b) to provide the West with adequate defences againstthe Soviet threat.   I am arranging to meet M. Schuman and Mr. Acheson ijlLondon next week to review the situation and see how far we can remove at leasfsome of the main obstacles before the meeting of the North Atlantic Council inLisbon.   If we find that it will help us to reach the necessary decisions, we shall probably invite Dr. Adenauer to join us during our tripartite conference.5 The eventual entry into force of the contractual arrangements will involveimportant changes in our representation in Germany. In particular, the UnitedKingdom Element of the Allied High Commission will be transformed into a british embassy. It will then no longer be possible to recover Foreign Office Deutschmarkexpenditure out of Occupation Costs. The future Embassy staff will have to be farsmaller than even the present reduced Control Commission. Reductions will bemade by transferring responsibilities to the Germans under the contractual arrange-ments, or to our armed forces or by giving up certain work altogether. This will entail certain risks. We shall, in particular, not have staff in Germany to organisean airlift to Berlin, should this again become necessary; nor directly to exercise theEmergency Powers which we shall be reserving under the Agreement on general relations. In our present economic situation, we have to accept these risks. i hope they can be mitigated by increased reliance on the German authorities andon our own armed forces. I feel that my colleagues should be aware of theposition.A. E.Foreign Office, SWA,Sth February, 1952.ANNEX I22nd November, 1951,Draft Agreement on General RelationsPreamble &apos;.,Whereas a peaceful and prosperous European community of nations firmlybound to the other free nations of the world through dedication to the principlesof the Charter of the United Nations can be attained only through united support and defence of the common freedom and the common heritage;Whereas it is the common aim of the Signatory States to integrate the federal republic on a basis of equality within the European Community itself includedin a developing Atlantic Community;Whereas the achievement of a fully free and unified Germany through peaceful means and of a freely negotiated peace settlement, though prevented for the present by measures beyond their control, remains a fundamental and common goal ofthe Signatory States; &apos; &apos;Whereas the retention of the Occupation Statute with its powers of intervention in the domestic affairs of the Federal Republic is inconsistent with the purpose ofsuch integration; 1Whereas the Three Powers are therefore determined to retain only such specialrights, the retention of which, in the common interest of the Signatory States, isnecessary in regard to the special international situation of Germany;Whereas the Federal Republic is determined to maintain a liberal-democraticfederal constitution which guarantees the rights of the individual and which isenshrined in its Basic Law, and has developed free and responsible politicalinstitutions;        _ -;Whereas the Federal Republic shares with the Three Powers a determination to abide by the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;    .Whereas the Three Powers and the Federal Republic recognise the new relationship established by these Conventions and the Treaties for the creation of
Article II1. In view of the international situation, the Three Powers retain the rights,heretofore exercised or held by them, relating to (a) the statiqning of armed forcesin Germany, and the protection of their security, (b) Berlin, and (c) Germany asa whole, including the unification of Germany and a peace settlement.2. The Federal Republic will refrain from any action prejudicial to these rights and will co-operate with the Three Powers to facilitate their exercise.Article III1. The Federal Republic agrees to conduct its policy in accordance withthe principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and with the aimsdefined in the Statute of the Council of Europe.2. The Federal Republic affirms its intention to associate itself fully with thecommunity of free nations through membership in international organisationscontributing to the common aims of the free world. The Three Powers will supportapplications for such membership by the Federal Republic at appropriate times.3. In their negotiations with States with which the Federal Republic main-tains no relations, the Three Powers will consult with the Federal Republic inrespect to matters directly involving its political interests.4. At the request of the Government of the Federal Republic, the Govern-ments of the Three Powers will arrange to represent the interests of the federal republic in relations with other States and in certain international organisationsor conferences, whenever the Federal Republic is not in a position to do so itself.Article IV fr 1. The mission of the armed forces stationed by the Three Powers in theFederal territory will be the defence of the free world, of which the Federal republic and Berlin form part.. 2. The Three Powers will consult with the Federal Republic in so far asthe military situation permits, regarding the stationing of such armed forces in theFederal Republic. The Federal Republic will co-operate fully, in accordance withthis Convention and the related Conventions, in facilitating the tasks of such armed forces.3. Except in case of external attack or imminent threat of such attack, theThree Powers will obtain the consent of the Federal Republic before bringing into* There will eventually be inserted here a reference to the European Community for Coal andSteel and the European Defence Community.t This Article should also, in the Allied view, include a reference to whatever provisions arelater agreed upon regarding restrictions on other military activity and regulation of production and research for military purposes.41840 B 2an integrated European Community as essential steps to the achievement of their^common aim for a unified Germany integrated within the Western Europeanv^Community;*Now therefore, the United States of America, the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland, and France, on the one hand (referred to hereinas the Three Powers), and the Federal Republic of Germany, on the other, have entered into the following Convention to set forth the basis for their new relationship:Article I1. The Federal Republic shall have full authority over its domestic and external affairs, except as provided in this Convention.2. The Three Powers will revoke the Occupation Statute and abolish theAllied High Commission and the Offices of the Land Commissioners, upon the entry into force of this Convention and the Conventions listed in Article VIII(called herein &quot; the related Conventions &quot;).3. The Three Powers will thenceforth conduct their relations with the federal republic through Ambassadors who will act jointly in matters the Three Powersconsider of common concern under this Convention and the related Conventions.
its territory, as part of their forces, contingents of the armed forces of any nationnot now providing such contingents. J4. The Federal Republic will participate in the European Defence community in order to contribute to the common defence of the free world.1. In the exercise of their right to protect the security of the armed forces stationed in the Federal Republic, the Three Powers will conform to the provisionsof the following paragraphs of this Article.2. The Three Powers may proclaim a state of emergency in the whole or anypart of the Federal Republic if they find that the security of the forces &quot;isendangered by an attack on the territory of the Federal Republic or Berlin, orby subversion of the liberal-democratic basic order, orby a serious disturbance of public order, orby a grave threat of any of these events,and that the Federal Republic and the European Defence Community are unableto deal with the situation.3, &apos; Upon the proclamation of a state of emergency, the Three Powers may take such measures (including the use of armed force) as are necessary to maintainor restore order and to ensure the security of the forces.4. The proclamation will specify the area to which it applies. The state ofemergency will not be maintained any longer than necessary to deal with theemergency.5. The Three Powers will consult to the fullest extent possible with theGovernment of the Federal Republic before proclaiming a state of emergency and while the state of emergency continues. They will utilise to the greatest possible extent the assistance of the Federal Government and the competent german authorities.6. If the Three Powers do not terminate a state of emergency within thirty days after a request by the Federal Government to do so, the Federal Governmentmay submit a request to North Atlantic Council to examine the situation and consider whether the state of emergency should be terminated. If the Councilconcludes that continuance of the state of emergency is no longer justified, theThree Powers will restore the normal situation as promptly as possible.7. Independently of a state of emergency, any military commander may, if his forces are imminently menaced, take such immediate action appropriate fortheir protection (including the use of armed force) as is requisite to remove thedanger.8. In all other respects, the protection of the security of these forces is governed by the provisions of the related Convention.1. The Three Powers will consult with the Federal Republic in regard to theexercise of their rights relating to Berlin. The Federal Republic* will co-operate with the Three Powers in order to facilitate the discharge of their responsibilitieswith regard to Berlin.2. The Federal Republic will continue its aid to the political, cultural,economic, and financial reconstruction of Berlin, and in particular will grant it suchaid as set out in the annexed Declaration of the Federal Republic (Annex III ofthe present Convention).!* The reference to &quot; Lander &quot; here and elsewhere has been deleted on condition that theFederal Government submits an official legal opinion to the effect that where, in a treaty or agree-ment executed by it, the Federal Republic assumes an obligation to take specific action, the Landerare also obligated to take the same action, even though not specifically mentioned in the treaty or agreement.. t At or before the effective date of these Conventions, the Three Powers intend, as far as thesituation in Berlin permits, to relax the controls in Berlin.. If this has not already been accomplished,the Three Powers will, by letter to Berlin and the Federal Republic, state their intention to do sopromptly.Article l&apos;article VI
Article VII1. The Three Powers and the Federal Republic are agreed that an essentialaim of their common policy is a peace settlement for the whole of Germany, freelynegotiated between Germany and her former enemies, which should lay the founda-tion for a lasting peace. They further agree that the final determination of the boundaries of Germany must await such a settlement.2. Pending the peace settlement, the Three Powers and the Federal Republicwill co-operate to achieve, by peaceful means, their common aim of a unifiedGermany enjoying a liberal-democratic constitution, like that of the Federal Republicanism-lic, and integrated within the Western European Community.3. The Three Powers and the Federal Republic agree that a unified Germanyshall be bound by the obligations of the Federal Republic under this convention and the related Conventions and the Treaties for the formation of an integratedEuropean Community, as adjusted according to their terms or by agreement of theparties thereto, and shall likewise be entitled to the rights of the Federal Republicunder these Conventions and Treaties.4. The Three Powers will consult with the Federal Republic on all othermatters involving the exercise of their rights relating to Germany as a whole.Article viii the Three Powers and the Federal Republic have entered into the followingrelated Conventions which will become effective upon the coming into force of thisConvention:(List)Article IX1. There is hereby established an Arbitration Tribunal which shall function in accordance with the provisions of the annexed Charter.2. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes arising between the Three Powers and the Federal Republic under the provisionsof this Convention or any of the related Conventions, which the parties are not ableto settle by negotiation, except as otherwise provided by paragraph 3 below or in the related Conventions.5153. Any dispute involving the rights of the Three Powers referred to in ArticleII, or action taken thereunder, or involving the provisions of Article V, paragraphs1 to 7 inclusive, shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Tribunalor of any other tribunal or court.. Article XThe Three Powers and the Federal Republic will review the terms of thisConvention and the related Conventions (1) Upon the request of any one of them, in the event of the unification ofGermany or the creation of a European federation; or(2) Upon the occurrence of any other event which all the signatory Statesrecognise to be of a similarly fundamental character.Thereupon, they will, by mutual agreement, modify this Convention and the relatedConventions to the extent made necessary or advisable by the fundamental changein the situation.&apos; Article XI1. This Convention and the related Conventions shall be ratified by the sig-natory States in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures. the instruments of ratification shall be deposited by the signatory States with the Gov-ernment of the2.   This Convention shall come into force immediately upon:(a) the deposit by all the signatory States of ratifications of this convention and of all the Conventions listed in Article VIII; and(b) the coming into force of the treaty relating to German participation in western Defence (European Defence Community).* The form of this exception may be subject to revision upon completion of the negotiationsof the individual Conventions.41840 b 3
3. This Convention and the related Conventions shall be deposited in th^f^Archives of the Government of the which will furnish each sig-natory State with certified copies thereof and notify each such State of the date ofthe coming into force of the Convention and the related Conventions.IN FAITH WHEREOF the undersigned representatives duly authorised there-to have signed this Convention.Done at this        day of , 1952, in the English, Frenchand German languages, all being equally authentic.ANNEX IIContractual Settlement with the German Federal republic the settlement will consist of the Agreement on General Relations (seeC (51) 24 of 20th November, 1951) and of subsidiary Conventions, whose titles andsalient features are outlined below:  1. Convention on Rights and Obligations of the Allied ForcesThis is in fact a catalogue of Allied rights, rather than obligations. We are seeking to obtain rights going far beyond those accorded to N.A.T.O. forces inN.A.T.O. countries, basing ourselves on the large contingents we have in Germany.The Convention enumerates collective rights of the Allied Forces (carefully avoid-ing financial issues) and details the legal status of individual members of those forces and their dependants. From the United Kingdom standpoint, the three most diffi-cult issues here have been: -(a) Criminal Jurisdiction over DependantsUnder the United States and French Service discipline legislation, but not under our own Army Act, dependants of members of the armed forces inGermany can be tried by Military Courts on criminal charges. In the absenceof any amendment to the Army Act, we shall be obliged to allow GermanCourts jurisdiction over our dependants. The practical effects of this will belimited, since very few cases in fact arise.(b) Security Offences against Allied ForcesThough this subject has given much trouble, there is likely to be a satis-factory compromise under which Allied Forces will have defined rights of arrestand interrogation of security suspects; their trial and punishment will bearranged also in a manner satisfactory both to Allies and &quot;Germans.(c) German Service organisation the Germans insist on a &quot; civilianisation &quot; of this body of some 50,000German auxiliaries which the British Army of the Rhine has used on a variety of non-combatant duties, as a means of economising British man-power.With the entry into force of the European Defence Community, a change inpresent arrangements in this field is unavoidable. But we are negotiating toensure that transition takes place over a period and is effected with the least possible detriment to the fighting efficiency of B.A.O.R. The loss of this man-power would mean that we should have either, to reinforce B.A.O.R. to fillgaps created or to reduce the number of&apos;fighting units in B.A.O.R.2. Convention on German Economic and Defence ParticipationAfter prolonged delays caused in the first place by Allied differences and there-after by German efforts to avoid any direct contractual obligations to the three powers in this field, the negotiators are now down to brass tacks. But there is somuch detailed and contentious work still to be done that no complete result can beexpected until after the Lisbon meeting. The main points to be covered are:  (a) Agreement on the size of an equitable German financial and economic con-tribution to Western defence-now being assessed by the three N.A.T.O.&quot; Wise Men &quot; sitting in an informal capacity, but by the same criteriaas they have applied in appraising efforts of N.A.T.O. countries.
(b) Apportionment of German defence contribution between the continuedfa support of Allied forces in Germany and the European Defence Com-munity. The Allies wish to secure payment of all their essential expen-ditures on troops in Germany during the next financial year and thebest possible undertaking to contribute to their maintenance thereafter.This is the most important single issue for the United Kingdom in these nego-tiations, since as much as  150 million a year in foreign currency is at stake.Satisfactory results here are more essential to the United Kingdom than to theUnited States (whose resources are greater) or to France (whose troops, as part ofthe European Defence Community, will soon be subject to alternative financial arrangements). Inter-allied unity has so far been maintained on the satisfactory basis of the decision I reached with M. Schuman and Mr. Acheson in Rome last november that the maintenance of Allied forces in Germany should in the coming year be the first charge on the German defence contribution. But the germans will naturally try to reduce their total contribution and to make the raising of theirown contribution to the E.D.C. their first care.3. Convention on Acts and Certain Interests of the Three Powers and the Transferof Certain Responsibilities to the Federal RepublicThis Convention will consist of a number of Parts, each dealing with a separatesubject. The matters treated are:-Part I. General ProvisionsThere are certain outstanding problems here connected with recognition ofvalidity of Allied acts and judgments (including enforcement of the latter), guaran-tees of non-discrimination for persons who have supported the Allied cause:immunity of Allied officials from suit in respect of past official acts; winding up of present Occupation Courts.  These should, however, be capable of solution.Part II. Deconcentralion and Decartelisation of IndustrySubstantial agreement has been reached with the Federal Government andthe outstanding points, which mainly concern the duration of Allied agencies for coal, steel and chemical reorganisation, should be settled shortly.Part III. Internal RestitutionThis will provide for continued operation of Allied laws under which Nazipersecutees can claim return of identifiable property of which they were despoiled.Difficulty has arisen over the assumption by the Federal Government of liability for awards against the Reich. No figures are available to show how much theFederal Government might have to pay. Closely connected with this question,there is a dispute regarding the constitution of the Supreme Restitution Court, thisis likely to be raised at the tripartite Ministerial meeting. The difficulty herearises from American insistence that there should be a preponderance of Alliedjudges.Part IV. Compensation for Victims of Nazi PersecutionA corollary of Part III, again raising the problem of liability for claims againstthe Reich. We hope to be able to surmount the outstanding difficulty over com-pensation for non-German victims of Nazi persecution, in particular displaced persons of Polish or Baltic origin,Part V -External RestitutionReturn of property removed under duress from territories Under german occupation. This part is almost agreed.Part VI. ReparationA number of details are still under consideration, notably: -;(a) A proposed statement by the Federal Government that, while they do not accept the legal basis of the Allied reparation policy, they do not pro-pose to dispute its effects.(b) The extent of compensation for German owners of external assets taken as reparations.   The Allies have, in &quot; Safehaven&quot; Agreements with
Spain and Sweden, undertaken to ensure 100 per cent, compensation.The German Federal Government contends that, on political, coif&quot;&quot;stitutional and financial grounds, it cannot accord this. This point nPlikely to be discussed at the Ministerial Meeting.Part VII. Displaced Persons and Refugees-     Agreed.Part VIII. Claims against GermanyRequired to bridge the gap between relinquishment of reserved powers and conclusion of the Agreement on German external debts now being negotiated inLondon Conference on German Debts. No major obstacle foreseen.Part IX. German Claims against Foreign Nations or NationalsThe main subject still under consideration is the post-hostilities waiver ofGerman claims against the Occupying Powers or their nationals. This should notbe a major difficulty.Part X. Foreign interests the main question still under consideration is the United Nations exemption from capital taxes to pay for the war (Lastenausgleich); this shows no signs of earlysolution. Substantial British commercial interests, e.g., Shell, Unilever, &amp;c, are involved. So are Benelux and other foreign interests. This is another point likelyto be discussed at the meeting of Ministers.Part (still un-numbered). Civil AviationProvides for phased transfer to German hands of present Allied responsibilities -ties: also for guarantees regarding conditions under which operating rights will be afforded to foreign carriers. The Germans will be free to operate civil airlines.The points outstanding on the Convention itself are not likely to prove majorobstacles, but the related question whether the Germans may construct civil aircraft is much more difficult see paragraph 7 below.Part (still un-numbered). Special Facilities to be Granted by the Federal Republicto the Embassies and Consular and Civil Establishments of the United King-dom, United States and FranceWe are seeking transitional arrangements regarding the use by future diplomatic and consular establishments of the three Powers of certain movable and immov-able German public property now used by the Allied Occupation authorities andthe continued use of certain private property now requisitioned. The Conventionwill provide certain facilities for construction of new premises, &amp;c. Details are offinancial importance to Her Majesty&apos;s Government and will be the subject of hardbargaining. This is not, however, likely to become a major obstacle.Part (still un-numbered). War CriminalsWe consider this subject should be covered by a part of this particular Con-vention. Proposals approved by the Cabinet in C. (51) 33 are still under discussionwith French and United States representatives in Germany and no requirement has yet been put to the Germans.The main points on which our views are not shared by the United States andFrench Governments are (a) our proposal that the Clemency Board should include a neutral member;(b) the function of the Board.  We hold that it should take decisions whichwould be binding on Governments. The Americans and French atpresent contend that it ought only to recommend to Governments. Thiswould impose a possibly embarrassing responsibility on AlliedGovernments at a time when custody will have been transferred to theGermans. The issues involved are mainly political and they are likely,    :   ; to be referred to the Meeting of Ministers.Charter of the Arbitral Commission for Property Rights and Interests in GermanyThis will be a separate instrument establishing an Arbitral jurisdiction to dealwith disputes arising from the implementation of the Foreign Interests and External
Restitution parts of the Convention. Other Governments will be free to accede to( pis convention, binding themselves to give effect to its decisions in return for theadvantages of access to its jurisdiction. Virtually agreed.4. Charter of the Arbitration TribunalThis lays down details of the Tribunal established under Article IX of theAgreement on General Relations (C. (51) 24). It will be composed of three Allied,three &quot; neutral&quot; and three German members and will have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes arising between the three Powers and the Federal Republic out ofthe operation of the settlement, except that the exercise of our &quot; reserved &quot; powersrelating to Berlin, German unity and the security of our forces is explicitly excludedfrom its competence. Agreed, except for one awkward point concerning enforce-ment of decisions involving enactment of new legislation.5. Declaration on Material Aid to BerlinBerlin, as one of the Allied &quot; reserved &quot; subjects, is not covered by the Conven-tions but the Federal Government will, in a separate declaration, affirm their readiness to afford material aid to Berlin in specified ways, and thus to support theposition of the three Powers in the Western sectors of the city. No major difficultyforeseen.6. Allied Security guarantee in order to meet the situation arising out of the end of the Allied occupation,the three Powers will reaffirm the New York guarantee to treat an attack on theFederal Republic or on Western Berlin as an attack on themselves. The text,provisionally agreed in Paris last November, is attached as Annex III.7. Control of German Armaments industry the three Occupying Powers have a responsibility to the other N.A.T.O.countries arising out of the Brussels meeting a year ago to prevent Germany frommanufacturing armaments covered by the so-called &quot; N.A.T.O. safeguards.&quot; Theseare (a) atomic, biological and chemical weapons; (b) long-range missiles;(c) military aircraft; (d) naval vessels other than minor defensive craft; (e) heavymilitary equipment. If maintenance of all these items is not practicable, they mustexplain the position to N.A.T.O. On French insistence we have so far triedunsuccessfully to get the Germans to agree to include these prohibitions in thecontractual settlement (with heavy military equipment whittled away to propellentsand gun barrels of over 105 mm.). The German view is that the position is already covered by the draft European Defence Community Treaty, under which theE.D.C. countries will not be permitted to manufacture war materials, except withthe approval of the European Defence Commissioner. The Germans, who are inno sense eager to abandon profitable exports for arms manufacture, insist onequality of treatment in principle. They consider that French requirements willbe met effectively without involving discrimination against Germany. They saythey will not object to the European Defence Commissioner refusing to permitGermany to produce certain types of strategic armaments (e.g., those underheadings (a)-(d) above), on the grounds of her exposed geographical position.They are prepared to give formal assurances to us and to the Americans that theywill regard their E.D.C. commitments as also binding towards us. Effective liaisonarrangements between E.D.C. and N.A.T.O. could then be worked out to coverour needs.A solution of the German armaments problem on the lines proposed byDr. Adenauer within the E.D.C. would not cover civil aircraft, which the three powers agreed, on United States initiative, at the Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting in washington in September 1951, should also be prohibited. The Amercans nowfavour an E.D.C. solution on the lines suggested by the Germans but hithertoresisted by the French; they wish, however, to remove civil aircraft from theprohibited list. We have hitherto attached importance to this particularprohibition. Our position has, however, been considerably weakened by therecent United States move and the Chiefs of Staff are being consulted with a. viewto a separate submission to the Cabinet.A solution will almost certainly have to be found outside the contractualsettlement and the question will have to be discussed at the meeting of Ministers.
ANNEX III ISecurity Guarantee&quot; On the occasion of the entry into force of the conventions establishing a new basis for the relationship between France, the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates of America on the one hand, and the Federal Republic of Germany on theother, the Three Powers:  (a) Declare that they consider the integrity of the Federal Republic and Berlinan essential element of the peace of the free world.(b) Reaffirm they will treat any attack against the Federal Republic or Berlinfrom any quarter as an attack upon themselves, and(c) Declare that they will maintain armed forces within the territory of theGerman Federal Republic and Berlin for such time as they deem neces-sary, having regard to their special responsibilities in Germany and theworld situation.&quot;
