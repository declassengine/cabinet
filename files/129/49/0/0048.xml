&apos;(TIHS DOCUMENT- IS-THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNI-G MAJES-TY?S GOVE-RNMENT)confidential.(52) 48 COPY NO.   ^ &amp;18TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETATOMIC ENERGY SECURITYMemorandum by the Home secretary on 29th December, 1951, the Cabinet (C.C.(51) 22nd Conclusions,Minute 2) invited a Committee consisting of the Colonial Secretary, theMinister of Housing and Local Government, the President of the Board ofTrade, with myself in the Chair, to examine a submission about security arrangements made to the Prime Minister by the Permanent Secretary tothe Treasury; and to exchange views on it with the Prime Minister on his arrival in the United States.2, The aspect of this submission which we were concerned with wasa new security procedure proposed for detecting possible Communists in very secret posts in the Civil Service.3, Until recently reliance was placed solely on &quot;vetting&quot; by theSecurity Service,    Vetting means that the Security Service checks theman&apos;s name against its records, making outside enquiries if the recordneed to be elucidated or brought up-to-date.    If the man is not in theSecurity Service records, he is regarded as safe for employment.364. We think that this procedure should be supplemented for a limitedrange of posts involving access to vital secrets, including in particularaccess to classified atomic energy information.    These posts numberabout 14,000, including 11,000 in the Atomic Energy Division of theMinistry of Supply,5. The new procedure is of a positive and open character.    The man-himself is to be required to declare whether he has any Communist associated -ations, and other persons who know him are to be asked whether he hassuch associations.6, The enquiries are to be based on a questionnaire which staff(including candidates for appointment) will have to fill in.    It will includenationality, previous employment and other antecedents.    Characterreferees are to be given, and the questionnaire will include a questionspecifically designed to force the man to admit any Communist association.7. In the light of the replies the Department will consider what further enquiries it should make before deciding whether the man is anentirely suitable person to be employed on exceptionally secret work.x The details of this procedure have never been published though the part played by the Security Service has been mentioned in Parliament,
8. We thought that the new procedure should be introduced and recommended accordingly to the Prime Minister, then in America,On his instructions, we arranged accordingly.    The announcement was generally well received, and staff interests in the Civil service as a whole do not object in principle.    But they have raised some points which, with our comments, are set out in the Annex to thisme mo r andurn.9o We ask the Cabinet -(1)    To endorse what we have already done;(2)    to agree that the points raised by the staff should bedealt with as we propose in the Annex.D.M.F0Home Office, S.W.1,18TH FEBRUARY, 1952.
The points raised by the staff on the procedure, and our recommendations, are:-(i)  Can a Trades Union official make representations, includingappearing personally before the Minister, about the reliability of aman whose case has been to the three advisers?   &quot;We should not agree to personal appeals being made to Mini-ministers about these individuals, and we understand that the point willnot be pressed.   Representations may be made in writing to theMinister,(ii)  Can we delete from the questionnaire the item asking for particulars of brothers and sisters ?We can agree.   The information will not be used by the security service, and the Foreign Office say that the Americans will not object.(iii)  Can we alter the wording of the key question16 (iii)  from&quot;Do you belong, or have you ever belonged, to any body associatedwith or generally supposed to be connected with or in sympathy withthe Communist movement?&quot;to&quot;Do you belong, or have you ever belonged, to any body associatedwith or in sympathy with the Communist movement?N. B.   In answering this question you should take into account notmerely your own belief but also the sort of opinion which is generallyheld of the body in question, even if you do not endorse that opinion. &quot;This modification is designed to meet the staffs objection that thefirst version imposes an unreasonable requirement on the man who cannot be expected to know what bodies are generally to be connectedwith the Communist Party.We can agree.  Again this will not bother the Americans, and theSecurity Service say that the number of liars we shall catch will notbe affected.(iv)  Can we make the staff admit convictions for serious offences only?(The questionnaire as now drafted asks for all offences,)We should not agree.   Nobody can define a serious offence, and minor offences might be useful background.(v)    Can we agree to reveal sources of information where these are notSecurity Service ?The object of the staff in making this request is to discourageinformers,,   We cannot agree.   Character referees must be able togive information confidentially, and we cannot afford to discouragevolunteering of information that might lead to the discovery ofunreliables in very secret posts.x    The three advisers are two retired civil servants and one retired Trades Unionofficial;  Their task is to advise the Minister whether or no a prima facie chargeof unreliability is justified.    The Minister does not have to accept their advice.
(vi) Will the Cabinet issue a directive compelling departments to accept on reposting, evon at great inconvenience, staffremoved from secret work as unreliable0We do not recommend compliance0   Posting seemsinappropriate for a Cabinet directive, and can be dealt with only by co-operation between the Treasury and the Departmentsconcerned.
