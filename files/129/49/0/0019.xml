(THIS-D QGLPMEN-T-IS THE-P^G^ERT-Y-G^-HIS-BRIT^NN^confidential.(52) 19 COPY NQ.JX-&apos;1ST FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETTHE NAVAL DISCIPLINE bill memorandum by the Attorney-General and theSolicitors-GeneralCertain of the First Lord&apos;s proposals in his paper C(52) 18appear to us likely to give rise to considerable controversy in the House ofCommons.   We desire, therefore, to draw attention to the following points.10   Composition of Naval Courts Martial(l)    The First Lord&apos;s proposal means the rejection of a main recom-mendation by the Pilcher Committee.   Their Report (Cmd. 8094, paragraphs53 - 59) shows that they were fully aware of and rejected the argumentsnow advanced for confining membership of Naval Courts Martial to executive officers.(2)    All the members of the Pilcher Committee agreed that officers of thenon-executive branches, officers of the Royal Marines and of the Reserveswere not less competent than executive officers to arrive at a proper conclusionas to the guilt or innocence of the accused.   (Cmd, 8094, paragraph 55),(3)    The Committee with one dissentient recommended that the majoritycf the Courts should be executive officers, in view of their particular quali-fications and the part their experience enables them to play in determining the correct sentence: that where suitable officers were available a minority of the Court should be selected from non-executive officers (excluding Chaplainsofficers of the Royal Marines and of the Reserves,They did not recommend that two members should normally benon-executive officers but they expressed the opinion that the governingconsideration should be the selection of the most suitable officers irrespective of the branch or unit to which they belong.   (Cmd. 8094, paragraph 64).(4)    The Committee recommended that a Captain who had decided not to award a summary punishment but to remand the accused for court martial,should no longer be under a duty to prosecute the accused, a member of hiscrew, before the Court Martial.   (Cmd, 8094, paragraph 95).   This unanimousrecommendation has been rejected (Cmd. 8141, page 22).(5)    The conduct of such a prosecution by a Captain before a Court con-sisting solely of his fellow executive officers appears to us difficult to justifyon the arguments put forward in the First Lord&apos;s memorandum,   The pilcher committee&apos;s recommendation was made in order that the administration ofjustice in the Navy might appear to be and in fact be widely based.   Theadoption of their recommendation would be some safeguard against any idea that the primary function of Courts Martial is to impose sentences heavier thanthose which can be imposed summarily.
(6)    As under the Pilcher Committee&apos;s recommendation, the executive officers would, if they agreed, over-rule the other members both as toverdict and sentence, we should find it difficult to argue that the changethey proposed might have ill effects upon discipline.2*    Death PenaltyWe feel it will be very difficult to justify the increase for certainmutiny offences of the maximum punishment of two years&apos; imprisonmentto death, particularly when the maximum penalty for offences which may bemore serious is being reduced from death to imprisonment,,3.    MutinyThe proposed definition of mutiny is considerably wider than thatcontained in the Manual of Military Law, in that it includes a combination&quot;to impede the performance of any duty or service&quot;.   This is intended tocover a combination of service men to &apos;go slow1.We agree that this extension is justifiable, but it will need careful handling in the House,L.H.R.E.M-BRoyal Courts of Justice, W, C. 2.,1ST FEBRUARY, 1952.
