(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 35 COPY NO,12TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETLEGISLATIVE programme memorandum by the Minister of HealthAs a result of the adjournment of Parliament due to the death ofHis Majesty and of the early Budget, there will not be time unless the session is unduly prolonged to complete a large part of the legislative programme approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 11th December(C.C(51) 16th Conclusions, Minute 2) and I feel that I should bring thesituation to the attention of my colleagues,2, Excluding the time required for discussion of the Budget and theSecond Reading of the Finance Bill, for the business of Supply, and for a defence debate, cmly twelve days are available for public business before easter;  and the business for two of these has already been announced.At least one of the remaining ten will be required for the opposition motion on Foreign Affairs, and one other in completing urgent Bills atpresent in progress.    This leaves only eight days free for other legisla-tion up to Easter,    And if the rest of the Session continues as originallyplanned, with the usual recess at Easter and a longer recess of seventeenclear days at Whitsun, the total time available for legislation from Easteruntil the Summer Recess is not likely to be more than sixteen days,making in all twenty-four unallocated days from now until the summer,3. On the best estimate which can at present be made, all the time available will be taken up by the Bills which have already been introduced and the following Bills, which are essential or to which some degree of urgency is attached:-Post Office and Telegraph (Money)Army and Air Force (Annual)Civil ListIsle of Man (Customs) (formal)New TownsCinematograph Films (Loans)Insurance Contracts (War Settlement)German ClaimsDistribution of German Enemy PropertyAgriculture (Tillage Subsidy)
ISOOn these assumptions no time before the Summer Recess can be found for the following Bills:&quot;Agricultural Safety-Irish Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Land TrustFood and DrugsCivil DefenceForeign Visiting ForcesGeneva ConventionsRoyal Irish Constabulary Widows&apos; PensionsAdministration of JusticeIndustrial InjuriesFood and Drugs (Scotland)Law of Succession (Scotland)Lands Valuation (Scotland)Deer PoachingHerring IndustryIron and SteelMonopolies and Restrictive PracticesMarine and Aviation Insurance (War Risks)Motor Vehicles (International Circulation)Road HaulageHousingHousing (Scotland)Naval DisciplineReserve ForcesAtomic EnergyHire PurchaseSome of these Bills have already been approved by the legislation committee:  those underlined were mentioned in the King&apos;s Speech, butare still not ready for introduction.4. If the Session is not extended, it thus looks to be impossible to enact the Bills mentioned in the King&apos;s Speech,    The Second Reading ofthe National Health Service Bill could be taken before the Budget and thefinal stages after the Budget but before Easter; or, alternatively, theSecond Reading could be postponed until after the Budget.    In either case,it would seem to be impossible for the Bill to be passed by the House ofLords in time to collect the charges for which it provides before 1st june and about  4 millions of the estimated savings will be lost,5. It is hardly worth while depriving Private Members of their rightsand privileges on Fridays, since Fridays are difficult days upon which totake contentious Government Business.    It may be necessary, therefore, to cut down the Whitsun Recess and for Parliament to meet early in the autumnfor some weeks in order to pass the Iron and Steel Bill, the Committee stage of which could not be taken during the summer unless Parliament sits lateinto August.    To take a contentious measure in the autumn wills however,delay the opening of a new session.6. If the Cabinet feel that, in order to ensure the passage of the Ironand Steel Bill, Parliament should sit for some weeks in the early autumn and that the Whitsun Recess should be cut, it might be possible to introduce a number of measures (which could not otherwise be passed) such as theAgricultural Safety Bill, in the House of Lords at an early date and to con-sider them in the House of Commons in the autumn.    There appears to belittle prospect of major measures other than the Iron and Steel Bill beingpassed this Session, even if it is decided to have such an extension.Ho C,Ministry of Healthy W01,12TH FEBRUARY, 1952,, -2-
