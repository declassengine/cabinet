(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)*    CONFIDENTIALf -C.(52) 268TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETTHE STONE OF SCONEMemorandum by the Lord Chancellor andthe Secretary of State for ScotlandBefore the late King&apos;s death we had been proposing to bring beforethe Cabinet the question of the Coronation Stone,    The queen s accessionnow gives this matter a new importance and urgency,2, The Stone is at present in the custody of the Dean of Westminsteras head of the governing body of the Abbey, but it has not been put back inthe Coronation Chair since it was stolen on Christmas Day, 1950,30 In December, 1951, the Dean of Westminster approached us with a request that the Government should announce their intention soon in regardto the Stone, and said that he was most anxious that it should be replaced inthe Chair without delay.    We recommend that this should be done at an appropriate date after the Funeral of His late Majesty,COPY NO.4, Although the early history of the Stone of Scone is disputed^ theLord Chancellor has no doubt that the right of disposal of the Stone is aprerogative right of Her Majesty which she can exercise unfettered by the charter or statutes of Westminster Abbey.    But we both take the view thatHer Majesty should be advised, as a matter of constitutional propriety, toact on the advice of Her Ministers in regard to its disposal.5, The theft of the Stone in 1950 was strongly condemned by allresponsible people in Scotland as well as in England and Wales,    At thesame time, there is a body of opinion in Scotland which would welcome thereturn of the Stone to that country.    It is true that the General Assembly ofthe Church of Scotland decided last year to make no recommendation on thesubject.    But a proposal made during the debate on Lord BrabazonTs motion in the House of Lords on 9th May, 1951, that the Stone should be returned to scotland and be brought down to Westminster for each Coronation ceremonyattracted at that time some support.    Against the adoption of that proposal,however, is the argument that the Stone has been in the Abbey for 600 yearsand has now acquired from its use at Coronations an Imperial significancewhich makes it appropriate to keep it in the Abbey where the Coronationtakes place.    We think that this argument should prevail.60 We consider that nothing is to be gained by postponing a decision about the disposal of the Stone.    On the contrary, we should avoid having anycontroversy about the Stone at or about the time of the Coronation,    Beforethe Stone is put back, however, it might be desirable to sound the Oppositionas to their attitude to this course.    The Governmenfs intention to advise her majesty in this sense might thereafter be stated byway of Question and answer in Parliament,7, We have had the benefit of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s advice and heagrees with our recommendations.SIMONDSJBS.8TH FEBRUARY, 1952,
