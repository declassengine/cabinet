(THIS-DOC-UME-NT IS -THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJES T- Y &apos;S- G O V E RMMENT)-confidential.(52) 6 COPY NO._   &quot;16TH JANUARY, 1952CABINETKOREA:   WINTER CLOTHINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WarWINTER CLOTHING1. At a meeting of the Cabinet (C.C.(52) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 1)on 14th January, 1952, I was instructed to circulate a report on the provisionof winter clothing for British troops in Korea, for consideration on17th January.   I give below a brief summary of the steps which lead up to thepresent position and I attach as appendices factual statements in regard tothe present situation.2, In 1946 the War Office began developing a new type of waters-resistingand wind-proof combat clothing which, after the addition or removal ofcertain extra garments, would be suitable for wear in all climates.   The newwinter clothing now being issued in Korea is the result of six years1 research and trial.   When operations first started in Korea aj.1 British troops were issued with Finnish pattern winter clothing which was satisfactory.   Thereis, however, no doubt that the new combat clothing is an immense improvement,3, As soon as the trials had proved, that the new combat clothing was satisfactory, the War Office, on 6th January, 1951, ordered sufficient for15,000 troops, including maintenance.   The Army Council approved the pattern of the new clothing on 20th March, 1951,   Subsequently it was decided that sufficient should be ordered for large scale unit trials to take place in korea and that as soon as possible provision should be made to cover the whole ofour forces in that theatre,   A further order for clothing for 10,000 troops,including maintenance was therefore placed on 27th April, 1951, giving a totalwell above the anticipated order of battle, which at present time is approximately 18,000,   The Ministry of Supply had considerable difficulty in placing these large orders with the trade, especially as the time available for production was short if the suits were to be issued to troops in Korea beforethe winter began in November,4, By the middle of August it was apparent that these orders would not becompleted in time.   In a telegram dated 5th September, 1951 (Appendix A)the War Office gave the British Commonwealth Force a forecast of deliveries of the new clothing.   It pointed out that it would not be possible to deliver inthe theatre sufficient to meet a full scale issue to the whole force beforeJanuary or February 1952, and that in the meantime the first deliveries could beissued to fighting units for user trials,5, At the beginning of the winter in November, 1951, the whole force was issued with the Finnish pattern.   As the new type combat clothing arrivedincreasing numbers of fighting troops were issued with it.   It is consideredthat recent complaints may be mainly due to the fact that two types of clothingare in issue in Korea and that one is much better than the other,-1-
BOOTS6. During the winter 1950/51 Finnish boots were issued.   These provednot to be entirely satisfactory and it became apparent that a new boot wouldhave to be designed.   This was done and orders were placed in April, 1951,for 54,000 pairs.   At this time the design was not firm and deliveries did notbegin until August.   By 2nd December there were 25,000 pairs in the theatre, more than enough for the whole force.SIZES - CLOTHING AND BOOTS7. Provision of the new clothing was made in accordance with the normalsize estimates.   These were, however, modified by a special provision(over 10%) for men between 5 ft. llins. and 6 ft. 2 ins, to meet the needsof the Australian and New Zealand contingents.   It is thought that the .complaints in regard to sizes had been due to an attempt to make a large scale issue of the new clothing before the full supplies had been received.All demands for special sizes received from Korea, if not already dispatchedby sea and in transit have been sent out by air.   At the present time all suchdemands have been met with the exception of 200 pairs of outsizes in bootswhich it is anticipated will be delivered by air before the end of January.SPACE HEATERS80 For essential cold weather accommodation stores the CommonwealthForces have always by arrangement depended on American supply.   the initial demand for 3,000 was, by agreement with the War Office, placed on25th July, 1951,   1,500 were issued in October.   The Americans have sincestated that they are themselves short of these heaters and that the scale of issue to the Commonwealth Forces is the same as that for their own troops.These heaters are not made in this country and the War Office had no reasonto anticipate that the Americans would be unable to produce the numbers required.   An additional 1,200 have now been released to our forces butthey require burners which we are informed will be available in the nearfuture.REPORTS FROM KOREA9. The Engineer-in-Chief was on tour in Korea as late as 16th december and was asked specifically to enquire into the winter clothing situation. he reported &quot;It is clear that there is no problem and everyone is well satisfied with the quantity and quality of the clothing available, &quot;THEATRE STOCKS10,        In Appendix B is a statement showing the stock position of criticalitems of winter clothing in the theatre at various dates.   With the new suit,for cold weather wear, a middle parka is essential.   The production ofparkas has always been most difficult and deliveries have thereforelagged behind the other articles.   Stocks of the latter have always been greatly in excess of the number of parkas.   For this reason the figures given in Appendix B relate to parkas only.A.H.War Office, S.W.1. ,16TH JANUARY, 1952.
APPENDIX AWar Office Telegram of 5th September, 1951On basis of types of clothing used last winter you should have sufficient stocks for all your commitments.  Appreciate that BootsFinnish pattern were not satisfactory.   New pattern ankle bootsconsequently developed here and we are endeavouring to sendmaximum quantities as soon as possible.   Unlikely, however,that you will receive at PUSAN more than 12,800 by end October.Your plans for issue should be drawn up accordingly,   Hope to sendfurther 7,00.0 to arrive PUSAN early December making total 20,000which should suffice for all purposes.   Our calculations show you should receive sufficient mukluks with insoles and sufficient socksduffle for all purposes by early November,   There may be delays in providing some minor items of underclothing, etc,, modifiedfrom patterns used last year, but this should not cause difficultyas older patterns should be available initially.COMBAT CLOTHING.  Intention was to provide sufficient CombatClothing for large scale experiment under fighting conditions incold climate and shipment of all items has started.   By earlyNovember you should have sufficient Combat smocks for fightingtroops and sufficient Combat trousers, hoods attachable and innertrousers for issue to all troops actually in Korea,   For coldconditions, however, a middle parka is an essential part of theCombat suit.   It will be impossible to supply more than 3,000 toarrive PUSAN by end October,   You should therefore only startexperimental use of Combat clothing with selected major unitswithin the available numbers of middle parkas.   Cannot ship middleparkas by air owing to large weight involved and shortage of cargo aircraft.   Shipment of all items Combat Clothing to meetyour strength of approximately 19,000 cannot be completed toarrive sooner than January or February, 1952,Request you report immediately if you anticipate unacceptabledifficulties.
