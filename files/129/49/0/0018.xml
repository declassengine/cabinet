THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF fflS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  government- - Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 1830?/z January, 1952THE NAVAL DISCIPLINE bill memorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltySummary of recommendations or points for decision:  (a) I recommend that a Naval Discipline Bill be introduced as soon as its texthas been cleared by the Legislation Committee (paragraph 2). Priordecision is, however, required on the following issues of policy.(b) Composition of Naval Courts-Martial.-l propose that membership shouldcontinue to be restricted to officers of the Executive Branch notwith-standing the majority recommendation of the Pilcher Committee infavour of admitting officers of other Branches (paragraphs 3-5).(c) Death penalty for offences other than mutiny and desertion to the enemy. I ask for approval for the changes outlined in paragraph 8 (a).(d) Death penalty for Mutiny. I recommend that death should be themaximum penalty in war or on active service for participation in mutinywithout violence otherwise than as a ringleader, and for failure to useutmost exertions to suppress such a mutiny (paragraph 8 (b)).(e) Death penalty for desertion to the enemy. I ask the Cabinet to decide between the alternatives set out in paragraph 8 (c) (v).(/) Statutory definition of mutiny. I ask the Cabinet to endorse the definitionproposed in paragraph 9.(g) Fines for Officers. I recommend that the Bill should provide for the intro-duction of fines as a punishment for Naval officers in time of war (para-graph 12).2. The Bill is completely drafted apart from details depending upon the cabinet&apos;s decisions on the major points of policy outlined below. Its purpose isthreefold: to give effect to decisions on the major recommendations of the pilcher committee on the administration of justice in the Navy (Cmds. 8094 and 8119),to facilitate the working in the Navy of the appeal system which is to come intoforce shortly and to modernise many provisions of the Naval Discipline Act.Membership of Naval Courts-Martial3. The majority of the Pilcher Committee (First Report, Recommendation 6)proposed that all officers of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and the Reserves(except Chaplains) over twenty-one and of or above the rank of Lieutenant, R.N.,should be eligible to sit as members of courts-martial. One member signed a minority report in favour of continuing to restrict membership to officers of theExecutive Branch of the Royal Navy.4. The Board of Admiralty have considered this recommendation with thegreatest care on several occasions, but its Naval members have throughout remainedunanimous in the view that to admit non-executive officers to membership of courts-martial would be a mistake which could not improve the administration ofjustice in the Navy and might have ill effects upon discipline.5. The Bill as drafted limits membership to officers of the Executive Branch,but admits Reserve officers of that Branch. The arguments in favour of that policy are shown in Appendix I.41796 b1 copy No. * *CABINET
The Death Penalty.&apos; 6. The three Service codes have always differed widely in the maximum Vpunishments for certain similar offences and it is not at present practicable toco-ordinate them thoroughly without an unacceptable reduction of certain maximumpunishments in one code or an equally unacceptable increase in the maximumpunishments for similar offences in another. On the death penalty, however, theHome Affairs Committee thought the three Service codes should be brought broadlyinto line.7. For over twenty years the Naval Discipline Act has differed from theArmy and Air Force Acts in prescribing the death penalty for certain offences(e.g., sleeping upon watch in the presence or vicinity of the enemy). Some amend-ment of the death penalty provisions is unavoidable unless these disparities are tocontinue; and the opportunity has been taken to review the whole position.8. The detailed effect on the Naval Discipline Act of the death penaltyprovisions for Service offences which I propose is shown in Appendix II. In broad outline it is as follows:  (a) Death Penalty for Offences other than Mutiny and Desertion to the Enemy(i) The mandatory death sentence is abolished.(ii) Death is replaced as a maximum sentence by imprisonment exceeding two years in those cases where the lower maximum isalready prescribed for similar offences in the Army and Air force acts, and also for certain other offences, if committed throughcowardice. I understand that the Secretaries of State for Warand Air intend to downgrade death penalties in their Acts for offences corresponding to these latter offences.(b) Death Penalty for MutinyThe maximum penalty is reduced in the Bill from death to imprison-ment exceeding two years for a number of mutinous offences (seeAppendix II, Sections 1.1 and 12). I understand that the Army and AirCouncils are prepared to downgrade their corresponding penalties. Inthat event, the three Service codes will be broadly in line in regard tothe death penalty except for (i) desertion to the enemy (discussed below)and (ii) the existing Naval offences of joining in a mutiny not accom-panied by violence, otherwise than as a ringleader; or failing to useutmost exertions to suppress such a mutiny. At present the Army andAir Force Acts would expose to the death penalty a man guilty of offences corresponding to those at (ii) above, but the maximum underthe Naval Discipline Act is imprisonment not exceeding two years.The other Services have proposed, and I agree, that here we should come into line by introducing in the Naval Discipline Bill the death penalty as the maximum for these offences when committed in time ofwar or on active service and, in the case of failure to suppress, whencommitted out of treachery. The Army and Air Force Acts would thenbe amended so as to remove the death penalty for the same offenceswhen committed in other circumstances.The concept of &quot; active service &quot; would be a novelty in the naval discipline Act, but the definition that I propose to adopt follows thatin the other two Acts as closely as the different circumstances of theNavy allow.(c) Desertion to the Enemy(i) In. the Naval Discipline Act the maximum punishment for desertionto the enemy is death, and for desertion in other circumstances,imprisonment exceeding two years. In the Army and Air Force Actsdesertion on active service (whether or not to the enemy) formerlycarried liability to the death penalty, but this was abolished in 1930after a free vote in the House of Commons against the views of theArmy and Air Councils of the day.(ii) The Service Ministers recently considered these differing penaltiesin an endeavour to bring the three codes more into line. Duringthe late war the Army in particular found that the absence of the death penalty for. desertion on active service was a severe handicap,since convicted deserters secured removal from the risks of the
front line if their sentences were not suspended, and many whosesentences were suspended promptly deserted again. On purely military grounds, therefore, the Secretaries of State for War andAir would welcome restoration of the (maximum) death penalty for desertion on active service. This would mean restoring the death penalty in the Army and Air Force Acts for a much wideroffence than the Naval offence of desertion to the enemy. TheArmy and Air Force regard desertion to the enemy as a much less serious problem, as it rarely occurs and, when it does, could becharged as a treasonable offence carrying the death penalty, ifthe deserter proceeded to serve with, or give assistance to, theenemy.(iii) An endeavour to reintroduce the death penalty for desertion on active service in the Army and Air Force Acts would probably meet with some opposition, especially if it were misconstrued as directed to the needs of the current Korean campaign, and this might applyeven if it were limited specifically to desertion to the enemy. If itis-considered politically undesirable to incur this risk, the services could continue to differ by the retention in the Navy of the death penalty for desertion to the enemy, since the Naval discipline act will inevitably continue to differ in many smaller matters fromthe Army and Air Force Acts.(iv) If, nevertheless, the Cabinet consider that the Services must comeinto line on this point and that reintroduction of the death penaltyinto the Army and Air Force Acts is politically impossible, then there is no alternative to the abolition of the special provision fordesertion to the enemy in the Naval Discipline Act.(v) I therefore ask the Cabinet to decide between the followingalternatives:  (1) Maintenance of the present position, which means retention-tion in the Navy of the death penalty for an offence not capitalunder the Army and Air Force Acts, or(2) Reintroduction into the Army and Air Force Acts of amaximum death penalty for desertion on active service, thusreviving a capital offence (desertion on active service) which iswider than the corresponding capital offence in the Navy, or(3) Introduction into the Navy, at the same time as reintro-duction into the Army and Air Force, of the capital offence ofdesertion on active service. This would mean for the Navy repeal of the specific offence of desertion to the enemy, but a new death penalty for desertion on active service, or(4) Introduction of desertion to the enemy as a capital offenceinto the Army and Air Force Acts. This would not solve theproblem outlined in sub-paragraph (ii), or(5) Repeal of the specific offence of desertion to the enemy in the Naval Discipline Act.Definition of Mutiny9. Both the Pilcher Committee (First Report, Recommendation 60) and its predecessor, the Army and Air Force Courts-Martial (Lewis) Committee (Cmd.7608, paragraph 133 (v)) recommended that an attempt should be made to defineby law the offence of mutiny. All three Services have hitherto worked on the definition in the Manual of Military Law, which states:  &quot; The term &apos; mutiny &apos; implies collective insubordination, or a combination of two or more persons to resist or to induce others to resist lawful military authority.&quot;The Service Departments are agreed that it would be most unwise to whittle downthis definition, and that a statutory definition is desirable. The following definitionis proposed after consultation with the Law Officers:-&quot; &apos; Mutiny&apos; means a combination between persons subject to Service law to overthrow, resist or disobey lawful authority in any of His Majesty&apos;s forces or in any armed forces co-operating with any of His Majesty&apos;s forces, or toimpede the performance of any duty or service in any such forces; and for the41796 b 2
purpose of this definition &apos; Service law &apos; means the Naval Discipline Act, mili-tary law or the Air Force Act.&quot;This definition is in terms wider than that in the Manual of Military Law because it provides specifically for mutiny against lawful authority in armed forces co-oper-ating with this of His Majesty. This is a very necessary provision in view of the close integration with allied armed forces in modern warfare. The new definition isnarrower in that it avoids using the words &quot; collective insubordination,&quot; which are open to a very wide interpretation.10. Even so, the proposed definition may encounter some opposition since the lewis Committee considered that &quot; mutiny &quot; was capable of too wide an interpre-fation in present-day conditions. They may have envisaged a restriction of theworking definition in the Manual of Military Law; but this would not be acceptable to the Service Departments.11. I understand that if a definition on the above lines is approved, the secretaries of State for War and Air will seek to enact a similar provision in theArmy and Air Force Acts.Fines for Officers12. The Pilcher Committee (First Report, Recommendation 40) proposed thatfines, recoverable from pay, should be introduced as a punishment for naval officers. This recommendation was based on the absence of an adequate punish-ment for misconduct in time of war by temporary officers, on whom the presentpunishments, which may weigh heavily on permanent officers, have little effect. the lewis Committee (paragraph 179) recommended that a penal rate of pay shouldbe introduced for Army and Air Force officers. The Army and Air Councils areagainst this recommendation, but would not object if the Admiralty accepted thecorresponding recommendation of the Pilcher Committee. In order to reduce the discrepancy between the Service codes which would thus occur, I propose that the punishment of fines for Naval officers to be introduced by the Bill should be avail-able in time of war only. It is only fair to officers joining the Reserves in peace-time that they should be able to see, in this dormant statutory provision, to what further disciplinary sanction they would be subject if called up in war.J. P. L. T.Admiralty, S.W. 1,30//7 January, 1952.
APPENDIX IMembership of naval Courts-MartialThe following considerations have led the Admiralty to (oonctede that it wouldbe a mistake not to continue to restrict the membership of courts-martial to officers-of the Executive Branch:  A wider held of selection should not be adopted out of a desire for apparentuniformity merely because the other Services have no corresponding imitation.The whole structure of the Navy is different. The ship is a much more intimateand self-contained unit than the regiment and, for -the maintenance of properdiscipline, requires a greater concentration of powers of command and punishment.Naval officers of the Executive Branch are given wider powers of summary punish-reassessment  than Army and Air Force officers, with the corollary that Army sm&amp; Air force courts-martial deal with a much wider range of offences than Naval courts-martial,which are, generally speaking, much more serious affairs.(2) The system in force in the Army whereby one member of the accusedscorps must normally sit on the court is not recommended by the Pilcher committee itself for application to the Navy. The Committee considers that a court with arepresentative character is undesirable (First Report, paragraph 59).(3) While a court-martial fulfils the dual functions of judge and jury, and granted that non-Executive officers would be quite capable of performing the latterfunction, it remains true that, with few exceptions, long experience in the main-tenance of discipline, investigation of offences, and assessment of punishmentbelongs exclusively to the Executive officers.(4) In the course of that experience, which starts at an early age, executive officers acquire the instinct of putting themselves in the position of defendingcounsel. They obtain a deep insight into the working of the minds of accusedratings, so that they, and only they, can ensure that the accused is able to do&apos;himselffull justice.(5) The Pilcher Committee offered no criticism of the results of the existing arrangements. The admission of non-Executive officers would certainly not improve the standard of justice dispensed by courts-martial; it would merely reduce thenumber of members of the court trained and experienced in every aspect of its duties. The Committee&apos;s proposed changes, therefore, would produce no practicaladvantage and might well have disadvantages.(6) Ratings are thoroughly used to the concentration of the power of punish-ment in the Executive Branch. They would probably not welcome participation of officers of other branches in that power as represented by courts-martial, andmight conceivably regard it with some mistrust.(7) It is important to maintain the prestige and position of the ExecutiveBranch, since its members bear the whole responsibility for military command and fighting the ship and, consequently, for the lives and safety of the men.(8) In certain circumstances the Pilcher Committee recommendation that two members of the court should normally be non-Executive officers would be difficultto put into practical effect. There are extremely few officers of the non-ExecutiveBranches above the rank of Commander in the seagoing Fleet. The Supply Branchwill have plenty to do in carrying out the functions in relation to courts-martialalready allotted to them, and in time of war the senior officers of the engineering and Electrical Branches will usually be fully occupied when the ship is in harbour.Except therefore when suitable non-Executive officers can be made available fromshore, it would be hard, especially in war, to find two non-Executive officers of adequate rank to sit on the court when the accused himself was a high-rankingofficer.(9) Although Royal Marine officers may sit as members of Army courts-martial, to admit them to membership of Naval courts-martial would have littlepractical effect, because it is very rare for a Royal Marine officer of adequateseniority to serve afloat. A Royal&quot; Marine officer serving ashore could not normallysit on a Naval court-martial, because he would usually be subject to the army act.
APPENDIX II (\Capital OffencesThe following table shows in Column 4 the effect, if any, on the Act of theprovisions in the Bill affecting the death penalty in respect of offences other thanoffences against the civil law of the country. Only those offences for which the death sentence is prescribed in the Act or the Bill are shown against each section.The table deals with amendments affecting punishments only, and does not purportto show that, merely in the process of bringing the code up to date, what are in formnew capital offences are created by the Bill, e.g., under S.2 by an amendment to coverpersons in command of aircraft as well as persons in command of ships. InColumns 3 and 4 the punishment shown is the maximum except where it is statedto be mandatory. &quot; Imprisonment&quot; means imprisonment exceeding two yearsexcept where otherwise stated:  12 3 4NAVALDISCIPLINE ACT,SECTIONOFFENCE2 (a)     Misconduct in action by a person in command:If acting traitorouslyIf acting from cowardice3 Failure by officer to pursue enemy orassist friend, or improperly forsakinghis station:If acting traitorouslyIf acting from cowardice4 Delaying  or   discouraging  action   or service:If acting traitorouslyIf acting from cowardiceDeserting post &quot;1 in presenceSleeping    on Vor vicinitywatch        J of the enemy5 Failure by a person other than a Com-manding Officer to use utmost exertionsto carry orders of superior officers into execution when ordered to prepare for action or during action:If acting traitorouslyIf acting from cowardice6 Spying for the enemy   ......      ...7 Holding traitorous correspondence with&quot;or giving intelligence to enemyFailure to disclose information receivedfrom enemy    ...      ...      ...      ...Relief of enemy with supplies   ...10 Taking part in mutiny accompanied byviolence or threat of violenceFailure to use utmost exertions to sup-press or prevent such mutiny, actual or intended, if acting traitorouslyInciting to such mutiny, whether actual or intended......      ......11 (a)     Taking part as a ringleader in mutiny notaccompanied by violence or threat of violence:In war or on active service ...Otherwise     ...      ......Taking part in such a mutiny otherwise than as ringleader:In war or on active service ...PRESENTMAXIMUMPUNISHMENTDeath (mandatory)DeathDeath (mandatory)DeathDeathDeathDeathDeath (mandatory)DeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathlyDeath f(c)Imprisonment notexceeding 2 years(c) (d)PROPOSEDMAXIMUMPUNISHMENTDeathImprisonmentDeathImprisonmentDeathImprisonmentImprisonmentDeathImprisonmentDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathImprisonmentDeath
