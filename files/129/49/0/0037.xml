13TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETEXPORTS OF FINISHED STEELMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn paragraph 8 of C.(52) 27 there is the following statement about exports of finished steel:-&quot;Our ability to export steel is of immense importance bothin bilateral trade negotiations and to our relations with the Commonwealth.&quot;We need not emphasise the long term importance to this country of main-taining its position as a major exporter of steel&quot;.My colleagues may like to have the following information about finished steel exports in 1952.2. The fundamental position is that although these exports arevaluable in themselves (they should earn us well over  50 millions thisyear) and of great importance in the long term, they are primarily exportednow to help to secure our vital imports and to supply the essential needs ofthe Commonwealth.3. The present plan is that exports (other than tinplate and supplies for the oil companies overseas) will be limited in 1952 to 1,215,000 tons.This is over half a million tons below the level of exports in 1950 and100,000 tons below the reduced level in 195L4. These exports cover a very wide range - extending from materialslike wire, rails and sleepers to special steels and precision tubes which havea very high conversion value.   They cannot be thought of as homogeneousproducts like ingots.5. In 1952 steel exports will go to the following main markets:-x(a) Special European markets - 277,000 tonsWe have agreed to send steel to this amount to Sweden, Norway,Finland, Denmark, Portugal and the Netherlands on what is virtually a barterbasis - i. e. in return for undertakings to supply vital raw material and foodrequirements, such as iron ore, pitwood, ferro alloys, zinc, pyrites, tungsten3newsprint, oils and fats and other food.   Given the limitation on our coal exports steel is practically the one indispensable bargaining factor availableto us if we are to secure these essential needs, which are in urgent demandthroughout the world,,x     In addition 25,000 tons is being reserved for possible negotiationswith Argentina._--11-----confidential. (52) 37 COPY NO.   (jj
(b)  Commonwealth countries (other than Canada)  -  696,000 tonsThe chief recipients will be Australia (about 200,000 tons)New Zealand and South Africa (about 80,000 tons each) and the Colonies(about 185,000 tons).   We have been under great pressure to maintaindeliveries in 1952 on at least this scale, which broadly represents only65% - 70% of what was sent to these markets in 1950,   Here again it is essentially a case of our having to send Commonwealth countries theirvital needs (often required for defence purposes or for the production andtransport of raw materials and foodstuffs) in return for the basic imports which we draw from them.(c) Canada -  150,000 tonsThis is a market of quite special significance.  At the particularrequest of the Canadian Government we sent over 200,000 tons there in 1951,much of it material required for Canadian defence production and thedevelopment of natural resources (oil, non-ferrous metals, etc,).   Mr. Howeasked us to maintain deliveries at as high a figure as possible in 1952 and has expressed warm appreciation of what we propose to do.   The exports will pay us real dividends in the form of Canadian goodwill over our rawmaterial requirements from the Dominion.(d) Other markets  -  67,000 tonsThese comprise all European markets apart from the six countries mentioned at (a) above, all South American countries (exceptArgentina) and all the Middle Eastern countries.   The amount mentioned is little more than a quarter of what was supplied last year.   As in the case ofCanada many of these markets are of great long term interest to the steelindustry and we have been warned that there is a real risk that unless some additional steel can be made available in the near future these marketswill be permanently lost to our competitors.   Many of these countries are important suppliers of goods which we need and we are likely to find thathere also our ability to supply steel will be a determining factor in their willingness both to sell essential requirements to us and to import from usconsumer goods for which we are most anxious to find markets.P.T.Board of Trade, SB W, 1.,13TH FEBRUARY, 1952.
