WiL-15TH FEBRUARY,  1952CABINETINDUSTRIAL BUILDINGNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate acopy of a minute which he has received from the President ofthe Board of Trade about the building of factories,(Signed)    NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15TH FEBRUARY,  1952.PRIME MINISTER FROM PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADECapital Investment in 1952 inBoard of Trade industries.     Investment limit the limit set (C.C.(51) 20th Conclusions, Minute 3)for the Board of Trade is  2k millions.    It is estimatedthat (allowing for increases in building costs) over  2kmillions would be spent on existing projects already inprogress and, broadly, no new job can start without stoppingan equivalent amount of work already licensed.    It is likely that about  10 millions of new licensing will be unavoidableto cover absolutely essential projects and statutory require-mentso2,     Building SteelShortage of building steel will, however, probablyrestrict building even more.    In the first quarter it wasnecessary to divide 10,61+0 tons among projects which demandedabout 1(.0,000 tons.    The allocation for the second quarter isnot yet settled, but it is expected to be about 17,500 tonsagainst a demand for 36,000 tons.3,     Distribution of SteelMarry jobs in progress are therefore going without steel and coming to a stopo   Steel for new projects can only befound at the expense of those in progress,    I attach a listof some of the projects which are in jeopardy, most of whichwill evidently have to go without steel.   A number of other important projects are having to proceed slowly with much less steel than they need.k*     Tests AppliedCases are judged on their probable contribution towardsdefence, increased exports (particularly to dollar markets),the saving of imports (-particularly dollars), the alleviation
of basic needs (e,g. raw materials), or marked technicaladvances and new products of importance to our economy. .It is on these tests that, in my opinion, the John Deereproject is not sufficiently important to be given a place the programme,,Board of Trade,Horse Guards Avenue, S.Wol*,lhTH FEBRUARY, 1952.
