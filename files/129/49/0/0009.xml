THIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY  OF HIS   BRITANNIC MAJESTY?S&apos; Government p ...... ,   .Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1952SECRET - copy no.    7QC (52) 9 &quot;)9th January, 1952CABINETSERVICE ESTIMATES  1952-53WORKS SERVICES .Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterIn giving general approval to the Service Estimates for 1952-53 as set out inmy paper C (52) 4 the Cabinet invited me to examine again the possibility of some further reduction in the total provision of  129-05 million for works services.I have now gone into this question in a good deal of detail with the departments and I am setting out my conclusions in this note.2. For the reasons set out in this Memorandum I do not believe that it is practicable to obtain any substantial economies in the methods the Services intend to employ in carrying out their respective works. I am also satisfied that, subjectto the possibility of relatively small savings in using existing storage in place of build-ing new storage, the works programmes of the Services are necessary concomitantsof their production and operational programmes. If it is desired to make further reductions in the Service estimates, I think the only way of doing this is to imposearbitrary estimating cuts on the figures for works services, basing these cuts onthe expectation that some of the Services will not be able to spend on works thefull amounts now standing in the estimates. A further justification for a cut ofthis kind in the Air Ministry&apos;s estimates may be found in the possibility that theUnited States may agree to pay for a larger share of the work undertaken on afifty-fifty basis for the United States Air Force. The estimates at present stand 3 - 3 million higher than the saving the Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped tomake. If it is decided to make arbitrary cuts in the estimates, I think that atleast half should fall upon the Air Ministry, whose works programme is much the largest, and the other half should be divided between the Admiralty and theWar Office.I now give the results of my detailed investigation. IStorage3. Of the Admiralty provision for storage, amounting to  1 - 8 million, the onlyquestionable item is the proposed new Victualling Store at Botley to serve thePortsmouth base. This scheme was approved last May, and the total estimate isnow nearly  800,000, of which it is proposed to provide  200,000 in 1952-53 and 300,000 in 1953-54. The scheme has undoubted advantages from the point ofview of efficiency and economy in administration. But it is an example of the type of storage requirement which might conceivably be met by other means. Ifit is decided, for instance, to run down stockpiles, a contribution to the Admiraltyrequirement for Victualling Store accommodation, and to similar needs of theother Services, may be thrown up. It would be wrong to rate the possibilities of economies in this direction high. The Ministry of Works have acquired a gooddeal of storage accommodation for the Ministry of Food. If food stockpiles weredrastically reduced, some of this would be redundant. But this accommodation isin small lots widely dispersed. This exactly suits the Ministry of Food, but it iscorrespondingly inconvenient and uneconomical for Service Departments, who needtheir stores concentrated in large depots with easy access.   I suggest, however, no41745
2final decision should be taken to proceed with the Botley Scheme until alternative!possibilities have been further explored. This investigation could be quickly doneby the Admiralty and the Ministry of Works. I would have suggested the samecourse for Army storage of stores and spares. But I understand that all the Armyexpenditure under this head is on building which has already been started. It wouldbe uneconomical to stop this; but the War Office should not undertake any new building commitments for this purpose without prior consultation with the Ministryof Works.4. The biggest storage item in the War Office estimate is  1-3 million for,the storage of tanks. At first sight it might be argued that this storage is unnecessary, as tanks in reserve for an army in the field are left in the open. Butthey are continually serviced and looked after by military personnel. There isno possibility of finding personnel to do this if reserves of tanks in this country are left in the open; and the War Office maintain on practical experience that the deterioration would be serious and that the tanks would not be ready for servicewhen wanted. I find this argument convincing and I could not recommend thatthis item should be cut out.Housing5. As regards barrack accommodation, there is very little provision by anyof the Services for new work to provide new barrack accommodation in place of old-fashioned and dilapidated structures: there is, in fact, a considerable slowing-down in the programme of barrack modernisation, as is appropriate to ourimpoverished condition. There is a good deal of work to be undertaken in pro-viding entirely new accommodation for personnel at new or expanding stations,but this is inescapable and in general the building will be in temporary types of construction.6. As regards married quarters, I accept the need, on grounds of recruiting and morale, to continue with the present policy of meeting the married man&apos;s requirements so far as is reasonably possible. Subject to the usual examination in detail, therefore, the general scale of provision should stand. The standards of construction, moreover, are not on the whole extravagant. Housing for ratingsand other ranks is broadly in line with Local Authority standards; and, if, as Iunderstand, officers&apos; quarters tend to be rather bigger and better than comparablecivilian houses, I am sure that the necessary economies will be effected as a resultof.the current discussions between the Treasury and the Service Departments.Airfields7. I have examined the Departments closely on the standards adopted forthe construction of runways. As regards bearing strength there can be no hard and fast rule: the subsoil conditions are examined closely in each individual caseso that the minimum provision need be made. There are theoretical formulasrelated to subsoil conditions and construction materials, the all-up weight of theaircraft, &amp;c.; but in addition practical tests are invariably carried out on the site withspecial machinery designed for the purpose. No useful comparison can be madewith runways at the manufacturers&apos; works; these are designed for unladen aircraft,which are later flown off to R.A.F. aerodromes for their testing under operationalweights. Even so, the Air Ministry standards are, if anything, rather below thoseadopted by British manufacturers; and they are not extravagant in relation tothose of comparable civil airfields both at home and in America. I am satisfiedthat the Air Ministry are not adopting excessive precautions: indeed they arenow deliberately modifying the theoretical safety factor in initial construction,trusting to the maturing strength of the cement to cover this margin of safety inthe course of time.8. As regards length of runways, the general standard is 2,000 yards forFighter stations and 3,000 yards for stations to be equipped for Washingtons(B. 29&apos;s) and Valiants. I am satisfied that these standards are reasonable; andit is satisfactory to note: (a) that Canberra bombers are to be accommodated tothe Fighter (2,000 yards) standard and (b) that the 1952-53 programme providesfor only three airfields to be constructed to the Valiant standard (3,000 yards). Ihave enquired about the very heavy cement requirement for the airfield construction programme, but the Ministry of Works confirm that in their view there will be noinsuperable difficulty on this score.
9. I am less wholly convinced about the Admiralty proposals to constructrunways at two stations in excess of the R.A.F. Fighter standard, one of 3,000 yards and one of 2,500 yards. It is arguable that their runway requirements on landneed not be greater than those of the R.A.F. (even if, as in these cases, all the pilotswill be under training). I think that this question should be further examined andI commend it to the consideration of the Minister of Defence.10. In general, I am satisfied that the size and nature of the airfield, pro-grammes are reasonable in the circumstances. The programmes are not outrunningthe latest forecasts of aircraft deliveries indeed they are slightly behindhand.The plan of work is ambitious, but a substantial discount for shortfall has alreadybeen made and I have no evidence to justify a further cut, on the intrinsic merits of the case.Overseas11. Apart from married quarters, the main expenditure arises (a) from.A.T.O. commitments and (b) from the problem of deployment in the Middle East.12. (a) N.A.T.O. CommitmentsThe War Office have provided  5 million for the new base and lines ofcommunication (through Antwerp instead of through Hamburg) required tosupport our Forces in Germany. Work has already started, by agreement withthe Belgians who are contributing the land and 20 per cent, of the cost, and the commitment seems inescapable. (I recommend, however, that, even if fundsprove to be available, no work should be done in 1952-53 on the married quarters which we are pledged to construct as part of the bargain with the belgians.) The War Office have also provided  250,000 for work in connectionwith a base at Leghorn, with a forward area near Venice, required to supportour troops in Austria and Trieste in war: work on this has not yet started. Ithink we should be clear that the substantial expenditure involved on an italian base is quite essential on strategic grounds and having regard to our economic difficulties.13.-(b) The Middle EastBoth the War Office and Air Ministry have large schemes of construction in Cyprus towards which they have provided  500,000 and  250,000 respec-tively in 1952-53. The Air Ministry also contemplate heavy expenditure on airfields and ancillary construction at various stations, some existing and some new, in Aden, Jordan and Iraq for the deployment of Canberra squadrons to be formed in the next year or two. There can be little doubt that con-siderable expenditure of this type will be required in the Middle East in thefairly near future. But I suggest that consideration of particular schemesinvolving long term permanent construction should await a general review of middle East policy. Moreover, even if it is confirmed that these projectsmust be undertaken, it may be that in the immediate future, when it is so important to reduce overseas expenditure, it would be wiser policy to delaystarting work, although a later start might mean a somewhat higher costdue to an intensified rate of building.Maintenance14. The total of maintenance expenditure at home and abroad for all three services amounts to some  26 million. Any substantial reduction in maintenance expenditure, however, means neglect of existing assets and is therefore wastefulin the long run. I do not recommend it.General Conclusions15. As a result of my review, I am satisfied that the Departments have madegenuine and strenuous efforts to reduce to a minimum the works expenditure which,to a very great extent, is an inescapable concomitant of the rearmament programme.The Admiralty have been particularly modest in their demands. It follows fromthe detailed examination I have made that I can find little or no slack which canbe taken up in the estimates, and that the Works Programme does no more than
match production and operational requirements. The only substantial reductionwhich can be made is by an arbitrary cut of the kind I have, suggested in paragraph 2.I should, however, refer again to,the  7 million net in the Air Ministry&apos;s estimateon account of work for the United States Air Force. In the greatly improvedatmosphere of our relations with the United States and the willingness of the UnitedStates Government to find ways and means to help us, I suggest it would be reason-able to re-open the fifty-fifty agreement and ask the United States to carry thewhole or at any rate the larger proportion of the expenditure.SWINTON.Office of the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster, S.W. 1.\9th January, 1952.
