(52) 31) summarised the present positionconcerning a German financial contribution to defence.   I should, however,like to draw my colleagues particular attention to one further long-term aspect of this question,2. The Cabinet will remember that I reported to them in my paper C0 (51) 15 of 13th November, 1951 (see especially paragraphs 3-5 and paragraph 13 of the Annex) that a gap was certain to arise between(a) the total amount which the Federal Republic could be expected to spendon defence and (b) the cost of building up German armed forces and thelocal support of Allied forces in Germany,   While at that time it was uncertain whether such a gap would arise in 1952-3, there was no doubtthat it would occur during 1953-4.   It was agreed that we should,nevertheless, enter into negotiations with the German federal government, in conjunction with the United States and French Governments;,but that we should make clear that we did so on the understanding thatwe were not prepared to accept any additional burdens ourselves,3. I explained our position to Mr, Acheson and Ma Schuman duringthe tripartite discussions on Germany in Paris and Rome last november and was able to reach agreement with them on a basis for negotiation with the Federal Government which protected our position for 1952-3.The instructions which the three Governments issued to the Allied high commission in Germany laid down that they should seek an undertaking from the Federal Republic to cover the costs for 1952-3 of the supportof Allied forces stationed in Germany, it being agreed that these would be confined to defence costs and reduced to the minimum compatible with.military efficiency.   In view of the uncertainty regarding the longer term future, we were not able to reach any firm decisions regarding the later period.   But we agreed that we should seek an undertaking fromthe Federal Republic that it recognised a continuing obligation in respect ofthe support of the Allied forces in Germany and of its contribution to theEuropean Defence Community (E, D, C, ),4, As I explained in Annex II to C. (52) 31, the negotiations on thissubject are still in a comparatively early stage,&apos; I hope, however, that weshall be able to achieve a satisfactory agreement which will provide for thelocal costs of our forces in Germany in 1952-3 being met from the german financial contribution.   There has not yet been discussion of the detailed estimates of the Allied forces and we shall no doubt have arguments aboutindividual items in them.   I do not, however, believe that the germans will challenge the principle that the local costs of these forces in thefirst year should be met, either directly by the Germans or indirectly fromtheir contribution to the E.D,C,
5. I feel9 however, that I should warn my colleagues that this yearrsgrace for 1952-3 is unlikely to be repeated in full or perhaps even in partin later years.   There are still too many uncertainties for me to forecasta financial balance-sheet for 1953-4.   But, on the assumption that our negotiations with the Federal Republic are brought to a fairly earlyconclusion and that the ratification of the ensuing Agreement and of theTreaty setting up the European Defence Community, which is to come intoforce simultaneously with it, are not unduly delayed, German forces should be growing fairly rapidly by 1953-4.   This will mean that theGermans will be incurring increasingly substantial expenditure not onlyon the pay and accommodation of the members of the forces but also on providing equipment for them   Although it is our intention that certainprohibitions should still be maintained over the German armaments industry (see paragraph 7 of Annex II to C.(52) 31), there will, provided the European Defence Commissioner agrees, be a wide range of equipment which can be made in Germany and on which production may by then begetting into its stride.   Indeed, from other points of view it is desirablethat this should happen, both in order to reduce competing Germanclaims on United States aid under the Mutual Security Programme butalso because Germany, so long as she is not devoting part of her industryto arms production, has a competitive advantage over us in foreign trade which is bound to add to our own external difficulties.   The situation mayby 1953-4 be such that the cost of the German forces will absorb thegreater part, if not the whole, of the German total financial contribution to defence assessed on the same basis as that applied to the NATO Powers.6. I shall, of course, do my best to ensure that the local supportof our forces in Germany is met from German funds for as long aspossible.   Events may occur which will falsify my prediction and enablewhatever arrangements are made for 1952-3 to continue longer.   I do notthink, however, that we can count on this.   I would, therefore, like mycolleagues to realise that there is a likelihood that in 1953-4 we shallnot be able to secure any substantial German contribution to the localcosts of our forces.   It is, I suggest, too early to consider now whether weshould seek to avoid the financial consequences for ourselves of this change in the situation, by military redeployment, by seeking furtherUnited States aid or by cutting the local costs of our forces in Germanybelow what is now considered to be necessary for military efficiency,or by a combination of these methods.A.E.Foreign Office, S, W. 1.,13TH FEBRUARY, 1952.-2-
