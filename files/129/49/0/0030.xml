confidential. (52) 30\2th February, 1952CABINETSTEEL PRICES IN THE UNITED kingdom note by the Prime minister circulate, for consideration by the Cabinet, a minute from the Ministerof Supply recommending an immediate increase in steel prices in the UnitedKingdom.This question was previously discussed by the Economic Policy Committeeon 23rd January, 1952 (E.A. (52) 6 and E.A. (52) 2nd Meeting, Minute 3).W. S. C.10, Downing Steet, SWA,\2th February, 1952.Copy No. 6 IPrime Minister from Minister of Supply1. You asked me over the telephone for a note on the result of myfurther talks with Mr. Hardie about steel prices.2. In considering the proposed price increases you have rightly been concerned with the possibility that our critics might say (a) that these increases were being made against the advice of the Cor-poration which considered that the additional costs could be absorbed by the industry^ profits, and(b) that the rise in prices was due to the extra quantities of expensive steelwhich you had obtained from America.3. On 6th February I asked all the members of the Corporation to meetme in order to clarify their position. I asked them to agree a factual statement as to what were the increased costs and the increased profits. The CorporationPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1952
went away and had a meeting by themselves. Later in the day they came back and informed me that,they, were agreed-(a) that in 1952 the,eosts of the industry (including the cost of equalising!the price of imported steel and raw materials) would amount to 56 million without making any allowance for the additional half; million tons of steel obtained by you in America or  70 million ifthe cost of the additional half million tons were included; and(b) that the profits of the industry (including all extraneous engineeringactivities and premia on exported steel) for the year ending30th September, 1951, had risen by about  11 million as comparedwith 1950.4. Having obtained their confirmation of these facts, I asked them toagree that in the circumstances it would be reasonable to increase prices to an extent sufficient to yield an additional  56 million, leaving the balanceof  14 million required to cover the cost of the extra half million tons of steelobtained by you in America to be met out of the earnings of the industry.I then left them to have a meeting of the Corporation on their own to consider this proposition. When I returned to the meeting about an hour later,Mr. Hardie informed me that the Corporation were agreed that (assuming theGovernment were not prepared to meet the cost of imported finished steelby means of an Exchequer subsidy), steel prices should be raised by  56 million.Mr. Hardie added that the decision of the Corporation had not been unani-mous, and made it quite clear that he himself had been out-voted by hiscolleagues.5. In addition they agreed the text of a draft statement, which I sub-mitted to them, to be issued with the new price order, if this should be approvedby the Cabinet (Appendix A).6. Bearing in mind that at our meeting a month earlier Mr. Hardie, afteragreeing price increases subsequently repudiated the Minutes, I insisted onthis occasion that the Corporation should not leave until the Minutes had beentyped and signed by them.7. You will see from the above that the new prices which were drawnup before your Washington talks on the earlier assumption that we would receive only some 500,000 tons of steel from America:-(a) are now formally agreed by the Corporation, and(b) have not been increased to cover the additional half million tons which you obtained in America.8. In these circumstances I hope the Cabinet will authorise me to go ahead and issue the new price order as soon as possible.9. I am sending a copy of this Minute to the Colonial Secretary, theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the paymaster-General.Ministry of Supply,9th February, 1952. -.   r
APPENDIX ADraft Press notice the Minister of Supply has made Orders, to come into effect from, increasing the controlled maximum prices of iron and steel.The increases are due partly to the rising costs and greater volume of imported steel and raw materials and partly to higher costs at home (wages,transport, coal, coke, fuel oil, scrap, &amp;c).The Government have decided to maintain the policy adopted by theprevious Government of averaging the prices of imported and home-producedsteel. While the Iron and Steel Corporation adhere to the view which they expressed to the late Government that the extra cost of imported finished steelshould be borne by an Exchequer subsidy and should not be included in homeprices, they agree that the additional costs of other imported materials should,like increased home costs, properly be charged against the prices of steel pro-duced in this country.The full increase in costs is not, however, reflected in the new prices nowannounced, the Minister having decided, in agreement with the Iron and steel corporation and the Iron and Steel Federation, that a proportion of the extracosts should be met out of the profits of the Industry. If allowance were madefor the full rise in costs, average prices would be increased by about  5 a ton,whereas the new prices provide for an increase of about  4 a ton, therebyleaving about  1 a ton to be borne by the steel industry.Typical examples of the total price changes are:  Basic pig-iron   ...Soft basic billetsSheet and tinplate barsHeavy sections ...Plates (N.E. coast, &amp;c.)Light sectionsBright steel bars...Present	Revisedbasis price	basis price   s. d.	   s. d.11 15   6	12 10   021 11   6	25  4  621 16   0	25   3   623 15   6	27 17  025   6   6	29 14  027   1   0	31   5   637  6  0	42  7   3
