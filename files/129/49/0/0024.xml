confidential.(52) 24 COPY NO.   f6TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETPUBLIC OBSERVANCE OF THE KING&apos;S FUNERALMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer held a meeting tonight with the Home Secretary, the Secretaryof State for Scotland, the Secretary of State for Co-ordination ofTransport, Fuel and Power, the Minister of Health, the Minister ofLabour and National Service, and the President of the Board of Trade.This paper records our recommendations to the Cabinet.2. Attached at Annex A is the official statement issued by the HomeOffice in 1936 about the observance of King George V&apos;s funeral,3. This gave considerable discretion and practice varied.    Somebusinesses, mainly in London, closed for the day, others, e. g. the banks,closed between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. , while in many factories only a twominute silence was observed.    All Government establishments, on theother hand, were, somewhat inconsistently with the general sense of theHome Office statement, closed throughout the day.   The schools were also closed.4. We can see no reason why Government establishments, includingdockyards and industrial establishments in all parts of the country,should be closed while a different practice is pursued by industry generally.    Nor do we see why the schools should be shut.    We thinkthat the right course would be a general observance of a two minutessilence and we attach at Annex B the draft statement which, subject to approval by The Queen, we recommend might be issued.5. While it would not be necessary to say so in the public announce-ment, we recommend that Government establishments on the line of routeof the funeral procession should be closed to the public.6. We recommend these arrangements irrespective of whether thefuneral is held on Friday, the 15th, or Saturday, the 16th, although from some points of view we see some advantages in the latter date.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,
