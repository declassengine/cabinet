(T.HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTYlS GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.     ^ ICABINETAMENDMENT OF THE GOLD COAST constitution memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies wish to seek my colleagues&apos; advice on certain proposed amendments to the Gold Coast constitution.2. I will outline briefly the history behind the present constitution.There is a deep fund of goodwill in the Gold Coast towards the UnitedKingdom and the British connection is highly valued.   The aim of all political parties is full self-government within the Commonwealth - notoutside it.   But nationalist feeling is strong and has been rising rapidly in strength since the war.   It was the Governments failure properly to assess the strength of nationalist aspirations, and to retain the confidence of the people and the initiative for ordered constitutional advance 8 thatwas the root cause of the riots and bloodshed of February/March 1948;though there were economic and social discontents also,3. The Watson Commission, which enquired into the disturbances9recommended outside its terms of reference in August, 1948, a number of constitutional changes and reforms.   It was thought fit to publish this document and the then Government agreed in principle with the objectives of the main recommendations but decided that they must first be consideredby representatives of the Gold Coast people.   Hence the establishment towardsthe end of 1948 of the Committee on Constitutional Reform under mr. Justice Coussey, which consisted entirely of Africans,   This committee presented a report in August, 1949, which was accepted in broad outlineby the Government the following October.   The existing constitution embodiesthe results of Coussey&apos;s work.4, A new Governor, Sir Charles Arden-Clarke, was appointed in the summer of 1949.   He dealt firmly and successfully with an attemptedchallenge in January, 1950, by the Convention People&apos;s Party to the con-stitutional proposals which took the form of a demonstration of &quot;positive action&quot; for the immediate grant of &quot;Dominion status&quot;, and his action hadthe&apos;support of responsible Gold Coast opinion.5, The present constitution came into force at the beginning of 1951,It provides for a Legislature consisting almost entirely of directly or indirectly elected African members and an Executive Council (equivalent toa Cabinet) consisting of the Governor as President, three ex-officio members(at present senior European officials, namely the Chief Secretary who isMinister of Defence and External Affairs, and the Ministers of Finance and justice), and eight African Ministers appointed from the Legislature by theGovernor in his discretion but subject to a favourable resolution of theLegislature.   The Executive Council is the principal instrument of policy;the Governor is required to consult it on all important issues, and must actin accordance with its advice unless he considers it expedient in theinterests of &quot;public faith, public order or good government&quot; not to do so.confidential.(52) 289TH FEBRUARY, 1952
1196, The constitution also provides for a &quot;Leader of government business&quot; in the Legislature who is chosen by the Members of theExecutive Council from among their own number.   He ranks in precedencejp^after the Governor and Chief Secretary.   The present Leader is Dr. KwameVJ/jNTkrumah, whose Convention People&apos;s Party took office after winning a large majority at the elections last February.7. The following changes are proposed:-(a) The title of Leader of Government Business should be changed to Prime Minister.(b) The Prime Minister would be chosen by the Governor in his discretion but submitted to the Legislature for its approval.(c) The Executive Council should have the alternative title of theCabinet.(d) The Prime Minister should rank, in Cabinet, next in order ofprecedence after the Governor (of Officer administering theGovernment) and would preside in Cabinet in his absence.(e) The Governor would act after consultation with the Prime Minister,not in his sole discretion, in nominating for the Legislature^approval the African Ministers and in assigning to themresponsibility for Departments.8. I wish to emphasise that these changes are essentially changes of namerather than of substance:  they do not go materially beyond recognisingwhat is already the de facto position in the Gold Coast.9. Dr. Nkrumah was in prison fourteen months ago for seditionand incitement to riot in the &quot;positive action&quot; campaign.   Though he wouldnot be the first Prime Minister in a Colony - Malta has had a Prime Ministerfor twenty years - he would be the first Negro Prime Minister in theCommonwealth,   Dr. Nkrumah and the Executive Council recently showedsome signs of being run off their feet by the back benchers of the party,though they now appear to have regained control.10. Moreover, if these changes are made in the Gold Coast, there maybe repercussions elsewhere in the Colonial Empire.   In Nigeria the newfederal constitution has got off to a good start.   Nevertheless, the politiciansin the West, and possibly also in the East, may feel impelled to press thatNigeria or at any rate the West and East should follow the Gold Coast lead.But the Governor, who has flown here for consultation, tells me that theconservative North would be resolutely opposed to any further constitutional advance for a long time to come (as would he himself) and that he wouldresist such pressure, though he cannot of course be sure of being able to doso successfully.   Apart from Nigeria, the grant of the title of Prime minister in the Gold Coast might lead to an immediate request for a similar titlein Jamaica which already has a Ministerial system.   Trinidad is unlikely to want a Prime Minister.   It is unlikely that any other Colony will beaffected.11, In these circumstances, I decided to call home the Governor of theGold Coast, Sir Charles Arden-Clarke, for consultation and I had a longmeeting with him.   He has a reputation of being one of the aces in the ColonialOffice pack.   He has certainly handled the Gold Coast constitutional development in a masterly fashion: he has obtained a great personal hold over Dr, Nkrumahand the African Ministers and has eased the delivery of the new constitutionthrough its birth pangs.   When I saw Sir Charles Arden-Clarke his advice-2-
could hardly have been, clearer.   He said:I     (a) that if this titular concession were made there was at least a chanceof delaying further constitutional changes in order to allow timefor the African Ministers to gain a further sense of responsibility and knowledge of government, and time perhaps for an opposition party to develop;(b) that if we did not make these concessions he did not think hecould hold back demands for self-government and Dominion statusnow.   The platform slogan upon which Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s party won theelection was ^self-government now&quot;; and it has now been adoptedby his rival, Dr. Danquah, who does not lose any opportunity of attacking him for abandoning it.   If we refused he saidsubstantial numbers of troops would be required to keep thecountry quiet;(c) that developments in Libya and the Sudan had increased the pressureand quickened the tempo of demands for further constitutional advance.Such advice, coming from so resolute, experienced and sagacious a governor would give pause but this is not all.12, Last year my predecessor had an interview in London with theGovernor and Dr. Nkrumah when the project was discussed of calling him&quot;Prime Minister&quot; and of the Governor appointing Representative ministers in consultation with him.   Legally and literally what the Secretary of state said could be construed as not being a pledge.   Morally and practicallyI consider he gave a pledge and it was so read by both the Governor and dr. Nkrumah.     To go back on it now would not only be to repudiate aBritish bargain but would inevitably lead to the inference that Her Majestylsnew Government were determined to alter their policy with regard to theGold Coast.13, If, on the other hand, we make concessions, there is at least a chance of a policy of ordered progress by successive stages beingsuccessfully pursued,14, I should add that if the leading Gold Coast Minister has the title of &quot;Prime Minister&quot; it does not mean that he has any right, any more thanthe Prime Minister of Malta, to be invited to meetings of the commonwealth prime Ministers.15, I therefore with great reluctance, but without any doubt or hesitation,have to recommend to my colleagues that the concessions in paragraph 7should be granted and the consequences accepted. If politics is the art ofwhat is practicable this course is justified.16, I conclude by saying that no guarantee could be given that these stepswill lead us to where we want.   All that I can guarantee is that not to take them will certainly lead us to where we do not want.O.L.Colonial Office, S. W. 1,,
