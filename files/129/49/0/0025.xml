I was also invited to provide information about the precedents for raising funds for such memorials by public subscription,,    In. thepast funds have been raised by this means only for regimentalmemorials.    For example, the Calais Memorial to the Green Jacketswas erected with funds collected among the regiments.    TheCommission have power under their charter to receive donations andbequests though they have only received  4,000 to  5,000 altogether.However, the Imperial War Conference in June, 1918, agreed that no public appeals should be made for funds.3. I now invite my colleagues to decide whether the commission should proceed with the more modest memorial or whether funds should be provided or obtained by public subscription for a nationalmemorial.COPY NO.A.H.War Office, S.W.1,
