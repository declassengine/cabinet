CABINET

EGYPT AND THE SUDAN 

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs 

I attach for the information of my colleagues the record of a conversation which I had with Sir Cecil Campbell, President of the British Chamber of Commerce in Cairo, on the 15th February. This is relevant to my paper C(52)43, which is being taken under Item 2 of our Agenda on the 18th February. 

A.E.
.&quot;    Sir Gee LI Campbell oexae to see me this afternoon.He is President of the British Chamber of Commerce in,Cairo,end has spent his whole life in Egypt.-    He said he wished,to impress upon me how totally different was the presentsituation to anything he had ever known in Egypt.     Hewould frankly confess himself as frightened by the newatmosphere.     Everybody in the Egyptian Government wasacting under fear.     We oust have no doubts as to the weakness of All Maher?s position.     ,2.     In reply to a question from me, he said that in his view the Egyptian Army r;rs not reliable.     The seniorofficersTiad been smeared by the failure of the Palestine.campaign and the corruption and shortage of equipment whichhad been, revealed.     The younger officers were not anti-British, and it was there that the chief, hope lay.     Theywere disgruntled with the-King and with the Commander-in-Chief, but they had a. professional pride and they wanted tobuild up an Egyptian army.     Anything we could do in that respect would be most vrlu-ble.     The decent youth inEgypt did not know where to turn for leadership.3.      I observed that the Army had proved loyal to the Xingin the hour of crisis when he had called for itsintervention.     Sir Cecil Campbell would not accept this..Ee said- th&quot;t Ha has Pr.eh&quot; had, after a. long struggle withthe King, been persuaded, to declare martial lav/.     He was by no meaiis convinced that the r-rmy would have respondedlb the same way to a direct call from King Farouk.h.     Sir C. C-mpbell said that there wan no improve .;entwhatever in the- attitude of Egyptians to Europeans sincethe recent riots.     That was an illusion;    so was the idea that the Wafd. had been discredited by what had happened.If elections In Egypt were held under condition? that wereeven remotely free, the Wafd would romp home to-day.     the trouble was that there was no political force to-day inEgypt except the Wafd.5.     Iti a. further - reference to the -..ruy, Sir C. Campbell saidthat Fouad Sadck, who had done-extremely well in palestine and was a strict disciplinarian and friendly to us, was thebest hope for the future.     On his return from the Palestinecampaign, Pouad Sadek had been very out-spoken and said thatthe campaign had been a scandal and the equipment embezzled.He himself Was an honest man, but on account of his frankcriticism King Fa.rouk,unfortunately did not like htm.6t     Sir C. Campbell said that he had seen the Egyptianambassador last night..  - Like all Egyptians, ^anr Pasha wasterrified of the outlook and had said that he gave the.Government three weeks and the monarchy five weeks.     WhileSir C. Campbell did not himself share this view, he did thinkthat the situation was desperately criticali     He said that   .King Fnrouk. was.&apos;unpredictable and also unpopular.     There hadbeen no enthusiasm whatever, over the birth.of the son.     The-  /Palace
Pr.lc.ce had not even dared to risk illuminrtions, and the crowd merely joined in obscene jests during the public holiday.7,     I ac.it thr.t all thlo was a gloomy picture not inconsistent in&apos; fundn.nentr.ls irith what H,ii. Arabnssc.dorin Cairo- hod reported but printed in darker colours. &apos;Whet would Sir Cecil Campbell have us do in theseconditions?     He .snid that some concession must be givento All Maher if he ben to survive at all.     It seemed tohim that a certain reduction-in the number of our troopsin the Canal Zone, which he presumed would not be unwelcome to us, could be a, token of confidence that &apos;would help in the opening of negotiations.     If we wereto couple this&apos;with a, deel ration that we were determined to equip and. strengthen the Egyptian Army, this would .give encouragement to the better type of officer endmight just enable the situation to be held.     He was not himself convinced - though .he realised this was not amatter for his judgment - that we would be wise to try tonegotiate r. Treaty to replace that of 1936.     He doubted .whether the present Government had the necessary authorityto put it through if one wore concluded.     It might be&apos;that they would, not want a Treaty, but would prefer some  .-declaration of where we stood and what our intentions were.8.     I said that this might be even more difficult for us,since our eventual purpose was to bring an internationalarrangement into being for the Canal Zone.     ITor did I-see how we could meet the Egyptians in respect of the Sudanin such a declaration.     Sir Cecil Campbell, like everybodyelse who speaks of Egyptian opinion, was emphatic that someaccount&apos; must be taken of Egyptian aspirations in relationto the Sudan.     Ke argued that v/e had never challenged theauthority of the Egyptian crown end that the Governor-General had always been nominated by the Egyptian King..He also said that, in 1946 he understood that the Law iOfficers had given an opinion, that sovereignty over the /Sudan still resided in the Egyptian crown.     I replied thatwe had never challenged the position of Egypt under the condominium, and that it was Egypt herself who had torn upthat agreement and the Treaty of 1936.     I should be quite ready to go back to the state.of affairs under the Condominium,but I could not admit even the symbolic suzerainty of theEgyptian crown over the Sudan without riots and troubles inthat country.     I was not prepared to transfer the state ofaffairs that existed in Egypt into the Sudan.     Sir C. -Campbellexpressed some doubts as to whether Sudanese opinion really -felt, so strongly in the matter.     I told him of evidence givenby American officials of high repute who had recently been inKhartoum.     This appeared to impress him, but he repeated thatthe position was one of the utmost urgency in Egypt and of the &apos;.gravest danger.     It was quite possible for what had occurred,a few weeks ago in Cairo to be repeated on- a larger.scalethroughout Egyptian cities.     As far as he could see, the. only,hope was to build up All Lahcr and give the Army confidence.He hoped some understanding might be arrived at about the Sudan:otherwise there might be.no alternative between the totalabandonment of our position in Egypt and the withdrawal-of the civilian population on the one hand., and the total occupation, ofijhe country on the other.
