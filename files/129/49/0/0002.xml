THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS   britannic  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1952CONFIDENTIALCopy No.   7 QC. (52) 23rd January, 1952CABINETNORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL: MEETING IN ROME,24th-28th NOVEMBERMemorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsTogether with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Air, I attended the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Rome.After consultation with them, I circulate the following note for the information ofthe Cabinet.2. The Rome meeting of the Council was not expected to take any majordecisions and did not do so.. It was essentially a stock-taking intermediate meeting.3. The two main problems of N.A.T.O. at present are first, how to relatethe economic possibilities of N.A.T.O. countries to N.A.T.O. military require-ments and, secondly, how to obtain a German military contribution to western defence within a reasonable time. The first of these problems is in the hands ofMr. Harriman&apos;s Temporary Council Committee in Paris and the second in thoseof the Paris Conference on the European Defence Community. Neither of these bodies was ready to submit a final report to the Council, which accordingly could do no more than have a very general inconclusive discussion on both topics.Economics of Defence4. The Council received reports from the N.A.T.O. military authoritiesshowing first the magnitude of the Soviet threat; secondly, the present state ofN.A.T.O. forces; and, thirdly, the increase in those forces necessary to meet the threat. These reports were explained orally by General Gruenther, GeneralEisenhowers Chief of Staff, who presented forcibly the military case for increasedforces and the need for a German contribution if Western Europe was to be madedefensible. The Council then heard a report from Mr. Harriman on the workof the Temporary Council Committee, in which he did no more than indicate ingeneral terms the sort of recommendations it might make. Finally, the council was addressed by General Eisenhower, whose speech was more political than military. He repeated his plea for European unity and his belief in the need fora European Army with German participation. At M. Lange&apos;s suggestion, it wasagreed that as much as possible of the information which had been laid before ministers should also be made available to national Parliaments.5. There was not much discussion on this subject. The upshot of the meeting was to bring the Council face to face with NA.T.O.&apos;s military requirements andto make clear what forces were immediately available to meet those requirements and what additional forces were needed to fill the gap. The Council was given a warning that at its next meeting it will have to decide bow far these require-ments can be reconciled with the economic and political possibilities of theindividual N.AT.O. countries.41691
German Questions6. The Council heard reports from Mr. Acheson on the progress of thepolitical discussions between the occupying Powers and the German federal government, and from M. Schuman on the work of the Paris Conference on theEuropean Defence Community. There was no discussion in the Council on thefirst of these questions, on which Mr. Acheson, M. Schuman and I had reachedprovisional agreement at our meeting in Paris with Dr. Adenauer. This was on lines foreseen in my memorandum C. (51) 24 of 20th November and marks only an interim stage in negotiations which are still proceeding in Germany. On thesecond question the emphasis at Rome was on the need for speed in concludingthe work of the Paris Conference. The Americans were impatient of further delay and. insisted that in view of the urgent military need for a German contribution,the Conference must present a definitive report with concrete proposals to the next meeting of the Council. The French were reluctant to be thus hustled. the benelux countries, for their part, were clearly frightened of what they were lettingthemselves in for in joining a European Army and made an ineffective attempt toget the Council to endorse an appeal to other N.A.T.O. countries (i.e., the twoScandinavian Powers and ourselves) to join, too. The general feeling was that thisquestion could not be allowed to drag on indefinitely and. that a decision one way or the other must be taken by the Council at its next meeting. The Councilaccordingly passed a resolution expressing the hope that it would receive a definitivereport from the European Army Conference at Lisbon in February. Meanwhile theMilitary Committee have directed the Standing Group to call for a report fromS.H.A.P.E. on the military effectiveness of the proposals so far made by theEuropean Army Conference.7. Besides these two major issues, the Council discussed a number of militaryquestions, submitted by the Military Committee, which had met before the Council,and also a report by a special committee set up to consider the development ofthe non-defence aspects of N.A.T.O.  .MiMtary Questions8. Military questions were referred initially by the Council to a Committeeof Defence Ministers and some useful work was done in this smaller gathering,The Defence Ministers&apos; recommendations were subsequently accepted by theCouncil.9. On the question of a Supreme Commander, Atlantic (S.A.C.L.A.N.T.),the Secretary of State for Air made it clear that the United Kingdom must reserveits position. Mr. Lovett, the American Secretary of Defence, and his canadian and Norwegian colleagues were evidently reflecting the views of all the otherN.A.T.O. countries when they expressed the hope that the United Kingdom mightbe able to accept a Supreme Commander, Atlantic, and to join in setting up thisCommand before the next meeting of the Council.10. The proposals for a N.A.T.O. Command in the Channel and SouthernNorth Sea and the appointment of Admiral Sir Arthur Power as Allied Commander-in-Chief, Channel and Southern North Sea, were approved; but no decision has yet been taken to announce them.11. The Defence Ministers, and subsequently the Council, took note of progress Reports on &quot; Command Arrangements in the Mediterranean and theMiddle East &quot; and &quot; Standardisation of Small Arms and Small Arms Ammunition.&quot;Neither of these subjects was ripe for consideration by the Council and it was satisfactory, from our point of view, that no significant discussion took place on either of them.&quot; Privately the Canadian Minister of National Defence pressed foran early decision on small arms as Canada is intimately affected on the supply side.Non-defence Aspects of N.A.T.O.12. Mr. Pearson, the Canadian Foreign Minister, presented an interim reportfrom the Council Committee on the non-defence aspects of N.A.T.O., of which heis Chairman. The report outlined various questions which the Committee hadbeen studying, such as the movement of labour from one N.A.T.O. country toanother (to which the Italians attached particular importance), the development ofN.A.T.O. co-operation in the social and cultural fields, &amp;c, and asked permission
for the Committee to continue its work. The Council approved the report without much discussion and we may expect some concrete recommendations from theCommittee at the Council&apos;s next meeting.Organisation of N.A.T.O.13. Another matter which was only briefly discussed in the Council but was much canvassed in the corridors, was the need for some reorganisation of the presentN.A.T.O. machinery. The Council meeting itself was an unwieldy affair withthirty-six Ministers round the table and two or three hundred advisers ranged behind them. The atmosphere was that of a public meeting more than of a conference,and many Ministers were obviously inhibited from speaking their minds in such aa vast gathering. No practical proposals were put forward, but it was generallyunderstood that this was a matter which would have to be examined in the interval before the next meeting of the Council.Upshot of the Meeting14. \ye did not expect the meeting to achieve results and it did not do so. Onthe other hand, it was valuable for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaryof State for Air and myself to meet our N.A.T.O. colleagues, and we were ableto have some useful discussions on the side with the Americans and the French onsuch matters as Korea, the Middle East and South-East Asia.15. I was also able to reach agreement with Mr. Acheson and M. Schumanon instructions to be given to the Allied High Commission in Germany regardingthe basis on which they should begin negotiations with the Federal Government onthe financial aspects of the German defence contribution. These instructions tookfull account of the inability of the United Kingdom to accept any additional financial burden in connexion with the support of our forces in Germany, on which I made our position clear in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet (CC (5.1) 8th Con-elusion, Minute 2).16. It was the Americans who insisted on having this intermediate meeting,and they turned up in force with a contingent over two hundred strong, led byMr. Acheson, Mr. Lovett and Mr. Snyder. They did not seem unduly disappointedat the absence of results. We can therefore hope that as a result of their personalcontacts they will, on their return to Washington, be able to assure Congress thatall is well with N.A.T.O. If the meeting achieved that much, it was not in vain.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,3rd January, 1952.
