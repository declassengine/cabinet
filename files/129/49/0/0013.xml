My reasons for suggesting this change are as follows:-(a) from the formal standpoint it is undesirable that an essentiallycivil vote should be distorted by comprising military expenditure to the extent of some 35%;(b) in principle the Departments which bear the main responsi-bility for framing the policy for a particular service - inthis case the War Office and Air Ministry - should bear thecost.    Only thus can due economy be ensured;(c) the need for all defence expenditure, so far as possible, to be viewed as a whole in terms of relative priorities against the background of our general economic position;(d) the struggle in Malaya is but one facet of the world-widestruggle against Communism and its successful conclusion isclearly an imperial interest.    It is quite unrealistic torepresent it as a purely local disturbance.2, My proposal seems to me to be important not only from the formal standpoint but as a means of yielding some measure of economy,although initially it would doubtless be necessary to make a suitableadjustment in the total sum allowed for Army and Air Force Votes,3. I ask my colleagues to agree that the military expenditure inquestion should be transferred from Civil to Defence Votes and that this change should be effected in the estimates for 1952/53.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,
