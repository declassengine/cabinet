(THIS DOCUMENT TS-THE PROPERTY-OF HER BRITANNIC MA-JEST Y-l-S GOV-ERNMENT)Cj confidential.(52) 27 COPY NO. Jq312TH-FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETSTEEL EXPORT prices memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Minister of supply the Prime Minister has asked us to report whether thiscountry has been exporting steel at a price well below that charged by many of its competitors, and possibly even lower than the price we arepaying for United States steel.   This matter has been examined inconsultation with representatives of the Iron and Steel Federation, andour conclusions are set out below,2. Prices of steel exports are not controlled by the Government,They are determined by the steel industry solely on commercial grounds.3U It is true that, in the fairly recent past, we have been sellingpart of our exports of steel at prices lower than world prices foe comparable items, and also below the cost of some of our imports ofsteel.   But this was due to special circumstances.   During 1950 the steelposition became much easier, and the industry entered into substantialexport contracts at prices which were then reasonable, and, indeed, above those quoted by some of its competitors.   Early in 1951 the Governmentrestricted severely exports of steel, with the result that these contractscould not be fulfilled in time, and exports have had to be made underthem at low prices during 1951,   Part of these orders is still outstanding.4, In April, 1951, the late Government urged the steel industryto put their export prices up to the world level so far as possible, havingregard to their own judgment of their long term commercial interest.The industry undertook to do this and the industry&apos;s present policy is to charge what the market will bear, subject to existing contracts.   About300,000 tons remain outstanding on the contracts at lower prices.   It wouldnot be practicable to vary these contracts now,5, The price of our steel imports from the United States, if we take the landed cost of the steel when received here, is  19 to  20 a tonabove the corresponding price of home produced steel for sale in the home market.   From sources other than the United States steel is being importedat slightly higher prices than this.6. Considering our steel exports as a whole, we are currentlyreceiving on the average a price which will exceed the average pseice in thehome market, after the proposed new prices are introduced, by about  20 a ton.,7. On our American imports of steel, therefore, we get a slightnet advantage from the transaction in terms of the steel itself.   On our othersteel imports we get very little direct foreign exchange advantage on the steel itself.   But in both cases we make a balance of payments gain in that weimport cruder forms of steel and export more finished forms.   We get paid for converting the steel and also for freight charges.-1-
8, The indirect advantage of these imports is, however,enormous.   Without them we should either have to reduce our exportsof steel still further, or to reduce our use of steel at home for defence,exports of metal goods, or essential investment.   The cost of our home produced steel would be still greater if the steel finishing industry hadto run at a level far below its capacity because of lack of steelB   our ability to export steel is of immense importance both in bilateral trade negotiations and to our relations with the Commonwealth.   We need notemphasise the long term importance to this country of maintaining its position as a major exporter of steel.9. We are satisfied that, in general, the steel industry is not now charging less to foreign buyers than its competitors, except thatthere are certain foreign markets which the steel industry is not enteringwhere higher prices might be obtained.   This is because from a nationalpoint of view it is more desirable to send the steel to markets on whichwe rely for essential imports.   There are also cases in which foreign competitors can offer early delivery, and thereby command a fancy price.These are the only exceptions to this general proposition.10. The present position, therefore, appears satisfactory, butit may well be fluid.   Arrangements have therefore been made for thisquestion to be reviewed at fairly short intervals, in conjunction with the steel industry.   The Ministry of Supply will be responsible for initiating these reviews.R.A. B.P.T.D.S.12TH FEBRUARY, 1952
