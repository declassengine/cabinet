77-(T-HIS DOGm/E-N-T- IS--T-]RT-of HIS-^RI-TA JN4G MA-J^TY-^GGV^RNMEN-T-)-O.secret (52) 12COPY NO._23RD JANUARY, 1952CABINETHOUSING PROGRAMME:  SUPPLY OF SCARCEMATERIALSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancasterOn 28th December the Cabinet invited me to report on the implications of the Housing Programme on the requirements of scarcematerials (C.C.(51) 20th Conclusions, Minute 3(3)).   I have examined theprogramme with all the Departments concerned and the following are the implications as nearly as we can see them.1.    Timber(a) The programme will require an additional 90,000standards in 1952 at a cost of approximately  9 millions and an additional120,000 standards in 1953 at a cost of approximately  12 millions;(b) The additional timber required can only be made available by additional imports, by reducing commercial stocks, or by raiding the strategic stockpile.   It is impossible to find the additional quantitiesrequired by savings from other uses.W  Imports.  If the additional timber is imported, about one-thirdof it might come from North America.   Though the f9o0b, price in America is cheaper, the freight is higher and the landed costin sterling of American and European timber is about the same.The timber trade must have authority to buy this timber at latest by the end of July, but earlier if possible.   Because of thefurther increase in requirements in 1953, it will be necessary toincrease imports in 1952 by more than the additional actualconsumption in that year.   Altogether an additional 90,000standards will have to be imported in 1952 at a cost of about  9millions, and in order to meet the 1954 requirements it will benecessary to import an additional 120,000 standards in 1953 at a cost of about  12 millions.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that the present figures of our reserves show that hopes of increased softwood imports to provide an allocation above thepresent level cannot be entertained at present.   If additional imports have to be envisaged later, unpleasant sacrifices may benecessary to balance these purchases.(ii) Commercial stocks. If these were reduced to an inadequate levelserious internal distribution difficulties would arise, which wouldcertainly delay the housing programme.   This has been proved by recent experience.   If the working stock is reduced below 300,000standards at the middle of the year, distribution will become
precarious now that we are operating a six months1 licensing system, which has been found to be a necessary adjunct of therestoration of private trade in softwood,   I regard areduction of commercial stocks as impracticable.(iii) Strategic stockpile.   This is an important stockpile because timbercannot be easily or quickly transported in large quantitiesin war time.   Nevertheless, if we cannot increase importsa draw on the stockpile is, in my view, the only way of finding the timber.   It is the only alternative to importing more timber,or building fewer houses.(c) The timber estimate in sub-paragraph (a) above is based onthe assumption that Scotland will not press their demand to use timber forfloors, except on sloping sites, which is the British practice.   This limiteduse of timber floors requires an additional 4,000 standards of timber;but it has the countervailing advantages that it saves 2,500 tons of steelreinforcing rods and reduces the cost of a house by about  20,2.    Steel(a) The Ministry of Housing must have authority to continue tobuild flats in London and some large cities where they are the only practicalform of housing.   But flat building will be limited to the existing level of20,000 flats a year.(b) For house and flat construction it is estimated that the require -ments of steel would be 78,000 tons in 1952, 81^000 in 1953 and 85,000 tonsin 1954.(c) The requirements of steel for war and sewerage on housingsites are estimated at 9,250 tons in 1952, rising to 12,000 tons in 1954.This steel must be provided to fulfil the housing programme, but it will mean a considerable slowing down in general water and sewerage schemes.I cannot hold out much hope of increasing the total allocation of steel for water and sewerage this year.   It looks as if the demands of defence, exports,and the basic industries will absorb all the extra steel we shall get from america,(d) The requirements of steel for gas on housing estates andassociated main extensions will probably be of the order of 5,000 tons in1952, rising to between 7,000 and 8: 000 tons in 1954.   In addition the gasauthorities use substantial quantities of cast iron, much of which is closely related to housing needs,(e) The requirements of steel for housing fitments (including metalwindows, cooking and heating apparatus, locks and hinges, plumbing, etc.)are estimated to be 149,000 tons of steel of all kinds in 1952, 168,000 in 1953and 194,000 tons in 1954,   The requirement for housing in 1952 will be about,000 tons more than for the 200,000 houses in the previous programme.This is likely to be the worst bottleneck.   The steel for housing fitmentsis included in the Ministry of Works allocation of &quot;Steel for BuildingMaterial Industries&quot;,   It was impossible to give the Ministry of Worksmore than 70,% of their aggregate claim under this head in the first quarterof this year;  and I see little prospect of being able to do much better in thenext quarter, having regard to the increased requirements for defence and exports,(f) Every effort is being made to economise in steel in the design of new buildings, but these economies cannot be effected in work already started and cannot, therefore, affect the demand for steel in 1952,-2-
3,    BricksThe number of bricks required for an additional 30,000traditional houses is about  00 millions.   The additional number of bricksrequired in 1952, therefore, will be at least 600 millions and in 1953 atleast 1,200 millions.   It may be that the additional net demand will actuallybe more because some of the houses completed in any one year will have tobe started in the preceding year.   In 1951 the brickmaking industry produced6,000 million bricks and the Minister of Works considers that, under themost favourable circumstances, the industry may produce 6,800 millionbricks in 1952 and 7,200 million bricks in 1953.   To do this the industry must be assured, in particular, of adequate and regular coal supplies,additional labour, houses for key workers where needed, and credit facilities.   We should also bear in mind that steel shortages in otherparts of the building industry may create additional demands for bricks.The supply position, therefore, is going to be tight, and we must be careful not to let loose too much demand   from other kinds of building work.4,   CopperThe other scarce material on which housing will make someincreased demand is copper.   The full programme, of 300,000 houses, needs12,000 tons of copper.   Copper looks like succeeding steel as our next headache.Civilian use is already drastically curtailed; but even so it will take us all our time to meet the requirements of defence and other essential uses,Rhodesian output is temporarily slowed down for want of coal.   This will mean keeping demands from other countries for our copper within very strictbounds.   But we ought to be able to satisfy the housing programme,5.    labour I should also make a reference to the possible scarcity of skilled building labour.   The Minister of Housing agreed at the cabinet meeting on 28th December that the labour force engaged on housing should notbe increased above its present level.   There will, however, be labour problems in particular areas, and these will not be confined to questions as betweenfactory building and housing, but will be between all the other building workgoing on in the region, including defence and housing.   It is worth consideringagain whether it would not be in the interest of the housing programme aswell as that of other urgent building if a co-ordinated regional building control covered starting dates for houses as well as all other building work.This ought to be helpful to the housing programme if the regional controlhad a directive to speed up and increase housing wherever possible withoutinjuring the essential needs of defence and vital industrial requirements,SWINTONTreasury Chambers, S.W.I. ,23RD JANUARY, 1952.
