Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    6 6C. (52) 44 . g\%th February, 1952CABINETSTEEL PRICES IN THE UNITED kingdom note by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate the attached minute submittedto him by the Colonial Secretary on 14th February.NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, SWA,mh February, 1952.Prime Minister from Colonial SecretarySTEEL PRICES IN THE UNITED kingdom as requested I held a further meeting on this question on 4th February, withthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Paymaster-General and the Ministerof Supply. Sir Andrew Duncan was also present; and the Minister of Supply was accompanied by his Permanent Secretary, Sir Archibald Rowlands. As a resultof this further discussion all the Ministers present were satisfied that a good case had been established for increasing steel prices in this country by  4 a ton, and thatthis increase could be defended against criticism. It was agreed that I should submitthis conclusion for your approval.On 6th February the Minister of Supply held a further meeting with the Ironand Steel Corporation, as a result of which the Corporation have now acceptedthese price increases and agreed that they may be announced as carrying their concurrence. This has been reported to you in a minute by the Minister of Supply,which has now been circulated to the Cabinet (C. (52) 30).2. From the economic point of view, the Ministers who went into this on your behalf are all satisfied that these price increases are justified. And, from thepolitical point of view, the situation has been greatly eased by the fact that theCorporation are now prepared to support the price increases. I would therefore recommend the Cabinet to approve these price increases when the matter comesbefore them this evening.I should like, however, to draw your attention to the points made in thefollowing paragraphs.3. In discussing this question we have all been seriously handicapped by the lack of agreed figures for the profits earned by the industry during.the past year.In my view it is most unsatisfactory that Ministers should be asked to settle theprice of the product of a nationalised industry without having before them properinformation about its past profits. Moreover, it is important for this purpose that ministers should have a proper analysis of the profits made by the engineeringsections, as well as the steel-making sections, of the industry.  Much depends on41864
the price ac whicr the steel is passed from one section of the industry to the other.Does the engineering side receive it at,a price fixed by. the Ministry of Supply, atcost, at cost plus overheads, or at the world price? If it were received at cost, thiswould represent a hidden subsidy to the engineering sections of the industry. TheCabinet should, I think, insist that on any similar occasion in the future agreedfigures of profits shall be available so that the Government may have a firm basis for fixing prices.4. Many of the other figures which entered into our calculations have also been subject to almost kaleidoscopic change. Take, for example, the cost of. UnitedStates steel. In Washington you were told that this would be about  10 a ton abovethe British price. At our first meeting with Sir Andrew Duncan, he said that the differential would be between  30 and  35 a ton. At our next meeting this figure had become about  24 a ton (viz. between  25 and  26 a ton for finished steel, and between  22 and  24 a ton for semi-finished steel). I see that in the paper on steelexport prices (C. (52) 27) it has now become  19- 20 a ton.Again, as regards exports, Sir Andrew Duncan admitted at one of our meet-ings that British steel was in some cases being exported at a figure slightly belowthe world price with a view to preserving our long-term export markets. But I see no reference to this in the paper which the responsible Ministers have now circu-lated on export prices (C. (52) 27).No doubt all these differences can be explained; but they certainly make itdifficult for Ministers to find a firm basis for calculation.5. Whatever the true price of the American steel, we are all agreed that noone can argue that you made a bad bargain in securing a larger allocation of it.Without it both our exports and our defence programmes would have been setback seriously, and it would have been worth paying an even higher price toavoid this. If you had not obtained this additional allocation the Iron and steel federation would have had to go into the market, in the United States and else-where, for whatever additional steel they could buy; and they would certainly havehad to pay an even higher price. Moreover, if we obtain all the United Statessteel allocated to us and absorb its higher cost into our prices, Britain will still beselling steel at a lower price than any of her steel-producing competitors.6. In any event, in computing the increased costs which are to be compensatedby increased prices, no account has been taken of the additional 500,000 tons ofUnited States steel allocated as a result of your visit to Washington. It willnot, therefore, be possible for anyone to say that the increases in British steel price is due to the higher cost of the steel which you obtained from the United States.  -7. It was our object to ensure that some part of the increased costs were carried by the industry out of its profits. My colleagues and I agreed, in our discussions, that the increased import costs should be covered by equalising prices;.&apos;but that some part of the increased cost of home production should be borne bythe industry: The arrangement which the Minister of Supply has now made withthe Corporation does not conform with this view. He has agreed that the wholeof the increased cost of the additional 500,000 tons of United States steel shall beborne out of the profits of the industry; and it is estimated that, if the whole ofthe 500,000 tons is in fact imported, the industry will have to carry a cost of 14 million out of its profits. The whole of the increased costs of home production will presumably be passed on to the consumer.This arrangement certainly has the advantage of enabling us to say that thewhole of the increased cost of the additional steel which you obtained from the:United States during your visit to Washington will be borne by the (nationalised)industry, and that no part of it will fall on steel consumers in this country. Butit is the Iron and Steel Federation which has to see that we get as much as possible of our additional allocation, and it may be asked whether they have a sufficient:incentive to put. their back into this effort under an arrangement which means \ that every ton they buy over the original 500,000 tons will have the effect of diminishingtheir profits. Moreover, it was one of our objects to check, in a basic industry, thecurrent tendency of producers to suppose that increased costs can be passed onautomatically to the consumer in the form of increased prices. This object hasriot been secured by the arrangement made by the Minister of Supply.     \Colonial Office,), &apos;&apos;V\&apos;!,;    &apos; .   --. &apos;f&quot;..      ,   , \,&apos;      ; \4lh February, 1952. . :,    :.- &quot;:   ,, - -^&quot;;:U   , ,&apos;     -1
