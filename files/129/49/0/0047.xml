Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 7 QC. (52) 47   . -   yllith February, 1952CABINETTHE SAARNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues a despatch from Sir O. Harvey(Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris) on France&apos;s policy towards the Saar. I draw their particular attention to paragraph 7 of the despatch.A. E.Foreign Office, SWA, .. 18th February, 1952.Despatch of 12th February, 1952, from Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in ParisIn my despatch No. 505 of 3rd November last on French foreign policy I mentioned the Saar as an example of France&apos;s failure to draw the logical&apos;corise-quences of her German policy. Recent events in connection with thai territoryhave fully borne this out.2. The Saar question had been for some time quiescent, so much so that last October we and the Americans tried to persuade the French to profit by thislull in order to reach a quiet settlement on the subject with the Germans.M. Schuman did not take this hint, and the lull continued. If no settlement couldbe achieved this was the next best thing. The Germans were the first to break it with Dr. Adenauer&apos;s announcement early in January that he intended to bringthe question up at the Council of Europe. This caused comparatively little stirhere. The French Government seemed to be damping down press comment, andit&apos;was therefore with some consternation that the United States Embassy learneda few days later of French intentions to announce a change in the status of their representative in the Saar. Mr. Acheson had already told M. Schuman iastNovember that he hoped no such step would be taken while the contractual agree-ments of the European Defence Committee were still under, negotiation, and the-United States Embassy here made every attempt to prevent an announcement ofthe change at this juncture. I was also instructed to intervene in the same senseon 26th January,.but by that time the harm had been done. On the precedingday the Council of Ministers had decided that M. Grandval was to be known infuture as head of the French mission in the Saar, with the personal rank ofAmbassador. Unfortunately the Quai d&quot;Orsay gave this out in such a way as tosuggest that a diplomatic mission was being set up, with M. Grandval as Ambas-ambassador accredited to the Saar.3. The German reaction to this announcement was violent, and indeed perhapsout of proportion to the change which had been made. French counter-reactions to this raised the temperature of Franco-German relations just when the debatesoh the European Army required that it should be lowered. But M. Schuman, when.His Majesty&apos;s Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires saw him on your instructions on 31st January,seemed unwilling to take any action to undo the harm which had been done. nor was he much more forthcoming during the talks which you had with him duringyour visit to Paris on 1st and 2nd February, and he refused to allow any reference41871
to the Saar to be made in the communique published at the end of that visit. Neyer-theless he reaffirmed France&apos;s position about the provisional nature of the Saar.regime, in terms sufficiently clear for you&quot; to be able to send reassuring messages to Dr. Adenauer.. ( 4. The Germans at first showed signs of refusing to be consoled, but thenadvanced for the first time in concrete form certain ideas which had been in theair for some weeks past about the possible &quot; EurOpeanisation &quot; of the. Saar. when these ideas were put to the French Government their acceptance of them washedged about with such conditions (continued economic attachment of the&apos; Saarto France, and Saar autonomy) as seemed, likely to do more harm than good with german opinion, and my United States colleague and I tried to persuadeM. Schuman to withdraw these conditions. He did in the end agree to water them down slightiy by admitting that they were not necessary pre-conditions for theopening of a negotiation. Indeed, M. Schuman insisted to me that the wholeexercise was on an unofficial and exploratory basis, that there was no question ofthese being ultimata, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the American Govern-ment were in no way committed by the exchange of views which were taking place.The offer was finally made to the Germans in this form shortly before the bundestag debate about the European Defence Community. There the matterrests for the moment.5. This whole episode shows how liable this relatively minor question is to- poison the whole area of Franco-German relations, and what a danger it constitutesto the programme of European unification. Neither side comes well out of it, eachof them exploiting each other&apos;s unreasonableness and pressing on the sore spots.Of German motives it is not for me to speak. French motives have been variouslyinterpreted. M. Schuman&apos;s explanations of his Governments actions struck myUnited States colleague and myself, as embarrassed and sometimes contradictory,e.g., when he said almost in the same breath that M. GrandvaPs immediate nomina-tion was essential for budgetary reasons and that it would not have been honest for him to have held it up until after the debate in the Bundestag. None of the reasons which M. Schuman advanced seem really adequate to explain his action in taking,at this particularly critical time, a step, which was bound to lead to difficulties withGermany over the much more important problem of the European Army! an explanation widely offered here is that the action was due to certain elements in.the Quai d&apos;Orsay which are strongly anti-German in feeling and far from enthusiasticabout the Schuman and Pleven Plans, M. Monnet undoubtedly believes this, andM. Raymond Aron hinted at it in an article in the Figaro when he spoke of the timing of M. Grandval&apos;s appointment as &quot; badly-or perhaps too well-chosen.&quot;It is certainly true that there are many people in the Quai whose attitude to theEuropean Army is best described by these lines: -&quot;Thou shalt not kill, but needst not striveOfficiously to keep alive.&quot;-They would not perhaps have deliberately sabotaged the Pleven plan, but theymight well have let M. GrandvaFs promotion go forward in the knowledge that itsannouncement at this particular juncture was bound to damage the European Armynegotiations. It is true that the appointment was approved by the Council ofMinisters, but here again the misleading form in which it was first announced bythe Quai seems slightly sinister. -6. In France&apos;s German policy there is always a conflict for influence overM. Schuman between M. Monnet on the one hand and the officials of the Quaid&apos;Orsay on the other, and it now looks as if the latter are in the ascendant.M.Pleven&apos;s departure from the Government has. deprived M. Monnet of muchof his influence, and the long letter about German affairs which M. Schumanaddressed to Mr. Acheson on 30th January is clearly inspired by ideas very different from those which prevailed when M. Pleven and M, Monnet between them were exerting a strong influence over M. Schuman.7. For the moment the situation seems calmer, and it may be that when the debate here and the Lisbon meeting is over it would be possible to resume in aless heated atmosphere an exploration of the proposal to Europeanise the Saar.This seems the most hopeful suggestion which has so far emerged for dealing withthis troublesome question. But it would in my opinion be too soon to press on with it now; for the next few weeks, the less anybody says about the Saar the better.
