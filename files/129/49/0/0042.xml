CONFIDENTIALC0(52) 42 COPY NQ016TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETGERMANY: ATTITUDE TO REARMAMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 7th February I circulated to my colleagues in C0 (52) 23 a brief review of certain long-term internal trends in Germany,    I thinkmy colleagues may also be interested to see the attached letter fromthe High Commissioner describing the German state of mind on the rearmament question.    The important point Sir Ivone Kirkpatrickbrings out is that the overwhelming majority of the German people are at present opposed to German rearmament and those who favourit regard it as a necessary evil.    The motives behind this view arevery mixed but on the whole they are respectable.    Sir Ivone Kirk-patrick&apos;s letter gives the background to the recent Bundestag debate on the German defence contribution in which the Federal Chancellor&apos;smajority was smaller than that which he secured last month on the schuman Plan,I see no reason to dissent from Sir Ivone Kirkpatrickrs general conclusion.A. o.hj,Foreign Office, SoW0l,
Letter of 6th February, 1952, from the United kingdom high Commissioner in Germany to the Foreign office i should like to send you in this letter a few reflections on theproblem of Germany^ military contribution, not because I wish you to do anything about them but because I feel that it may be useful to you if I cansucceed in shedding light on the German state of mind.As you know, German public opinion is ill-informed, confused andbewildered.    In addition, the issue is bedevilled by internal party politics.But in addition to these factors, our negotiations are hampered by what Ishould describe as a fundamental difference of approach.    Let me, in apossibly over-simplified form, define the difference as follows:-1. Our heart tells us, although our reason may not, that the germans are a fighting race, who should entertain no intrinsic objection to bearingarms.    We believe that they should understand that their own security isat stake, that there is a justifiable lack of confidence in Germany abroadwhich we can reasonably ask them to assuage, and that in short we are justified in putting a certain number of strings on German rearmament.The Germans, on the other hand, feel that we are asking for a very bigsacrifice, namely unpopular military service, much larger financialburdens, and considerable risk in the initial period.    Consequently the bundestag and the German people cannot reasonably be expected, inaddition to paying the price of this sacrifice, to pay the price of acceptinga large number of heterogeneous allied demands running from restitutionto the perpetuation of allied measures for the deconcentration of german industry.    On the contrary, Germany as the party in the transaction whichis being called upon to tread the path of sacrifice, might legitimately lay down conditions.2. When we talk of associating Germany with the west, we are to a smaller (Washington) or larger (Paris) degree conceiving an operation intwo stages.    The first stage in which Germany, so to speak, works herpassage, and a second stage in which she attains full membership of our association.    The Germans, on the other hand, think that association withthe west means full and equal membership now.    The Chancellor arguesthat success or failure in the whole operation depends on mutual confidence.If we place the Germans on probation for a period, we are demonstratingour lack of confidence.    There will consequently be no mutual confidence,and as a result our relations will never reach a point at which full member-ship of the association v/ill become a practical possibility.    In other words,our only chance of success is to take our courage in our hands and stake onthe success of the operation.    Half measures will invite certain failure.The difference of approach which I have attempted to outline above in admittedly over-simplified terms has had its impact on all our negotiations.And now I should like to say an additional word on the question ofGerman reluctance to rearm.    I sometimes wonder whether the fact ofGerman reluctance, although it is recognised in England and elsewhere,is really appreciated because it is so completely out of harmony with german tradition and with our experience after the first world war,    Butit is a fact that the vast majority of the German nation are standingshivering on the brink of rearmament although I believe that if they couldbe induced to take the plunge, they might well find that they enjoy the bathe.This is an odd state of affairs, especially at a time when we notice that theGermans are showing so many of their old characteristics and faults.    Butit may help to illuminate the problem if I try to describe the various groupswho are opposed to rearmament and the grounds on which they oppose it.
05&quot;First there are the women, who are pacifists at heart and wish atany cost to prevent their sons ever being called upon to go into battie0Allied to the women is the pacifist section of the Evangelical Church,    AsNiemoller says:   &quot;The Church&apos;s duty is to bridge the gap between East and west, as it is better to obtain peace through pastors than war throughpoliticians,, &quot;   Secondly, there are the students in the Universities,,    their confidence has been undermined by the events of recent years,,    Theirattitude is cynical, they are politically apathetic and opposed on selfishgrounds to interference with their careers.    Then there is a fairly largesection of opinion which has its counterpart in France,    These peoplebelieve that Germany has tried to become a World Power twice and has failed under conditions much more favourable than are likely to arise in thefuture.    They are sick of war, sick of the burden of Empire, entertain nolarge nationalist ambitions and would be quite content if Germany could ekeout a tolerable economic existence without having to take sides with either the eastern or western giant.    If the Russians came, they would have tocompound as best they could; a.nd this would be better than another war on german soil.    Next come the people who genuinely fear the return of theGerman Generals to public life,,    They are mostly to be found in the ranks of the SPD (Brauer is one) or in the Trade Unions,    But there are some inother parties, even the FDP.    For example, Gilchrist tells me that atStuttgart many of the FDP are of this way of thinking.    Then come the pro-tagonists of German unity who claim that Adenauer is putting the cart beforethe horse and that the proper policy is to achieve German unity first and then to consider rearmament.    According to them the rearmament of western germany will postpone unity until the Greek Kalends.    Therefore it is abad policy.There are also opponents of rearmament who have no reputablemotives.    These of course include the Communists and those elements whoon various grounds dislike any association with the West,    Then come what i term the exporters.    That is to say, those people who believe thatGermany&apos;s proper course is to take advantage of the present situation to capture overseas markets.    After this has been done Germany would be ina much more powerful position and could decide the terms on which shewishes to offer us her collaboration.    Lastly there are the blackmailers.They say that the Allies maltreated and disarmed Germany even to the extentof blowing up airfields, air-raid shelters, docks8 etc., long after the existenceof the Russian peril was openly recognised in western countries.    TheAllies, they claim, should bear the consequences of their own folly and it istherefore reasonable for Germany to say that she will make no military con-tribution unless the honour of the German army is restored, unless the war criminals are released, unless all controls on German industry are lifted,unless complete equality of rights is given, unless the bombing of Heligolandor alternative targets stops, or unless satisfaction is given to some particu-lar vested interest with which they are concerned.All the groups enumerated above when added together constitute a formidable proportion of the electorate.    What have we got to set on theother side?    Only a few professional warriors, who would like to resume the profession of arms, and that section of the population which, whilst dislikingGerman rearmament, is prepared to accept it as part of a satisfactory generalarrangement because, from motives of Germany&apos;s self-interest^ they believe in association with the West.    But it is noteworthy that these people in theirappeals to the electorate take the line that military service represents a
sacrifice which, they explain, must be endured on wider grounds.    In a word, whilst there are many who regard German rearmament withgreat repugnance, there are very few who would welcome it for its ownsake.What conclusions should we draw from all this ?    In a senseno particular conclusion, because we have been told the facts often enough.Nevertheless it will do no harm if in handling the various individualproblems as they arise we constantly keep the facts in mind.   As I have said before, we are taking a calculated risk in attempting to associateGermany with western defence; and once we have decided to take this risk we must pay regard to the state of feeling here as elsewhere, showimagination and not recoil from the consequences of our own action,&quot;II faut vouloir les consequences de ce que l&apos;on veut, &quot;
