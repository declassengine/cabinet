NEGOTIATIONS WITH EGYPT ON DEFENCE AND THE sudan memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsWe have now to consider upon what basis we should try to secure the resump-tion of negotiations with Egypt.recommendations.   I recommend that the Cabinet should approve the following procedure:  (a) We should resume negotiations with the present Egyptian Government.(b) These negotiations should be upon a bi-lateral Anglo-Egyptian basis, atany rate to start with; at some later stage, depending upon the courseof the negotiations, it will probably be necessary to widen the basisof the discussions and to bring Egypt into a conference of representativesof the Powers sponsoring the setting up of the Middle East Command,namely, in addition to ourselves, the United States, France, Turkey,Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.(c) We should attempt to secure an agreement regulating our defence problems with Egypt, which would fit into the framework of the four-Powerproposals of 13th October, 1951, but we should not insist upon theEgyptian Government committing themselves to an acceptance of those proposals in advance of a resumption of the negotiations.id) We should be prepared, if necessary, to agree that British mobile land forces should be withdrawn from the Canal Zone within one year, but thisagreement should be conditional upon a settlement satisfactory to us ofthe other outstanding points, such as the future of the base, the creationof a joint air defence organisation, and Egyptian participation in the pro-posed Middle East Command carrying with it the grant of full facilities to allied forces in time of war or imminent menace of war.(e) As regards the Sudan, we should not agree to recognise King Farouk&apos;s claimto the title of &quot; King of Egypt and the Sudan,&quot; or to any change inthe status of the Sudan, before the Sudanese have been consulted; andwe should try to persuade the Egyptians themselves to discuss thisparticular question with the Sudanese, as well as other matters relatingto the future of the Sudan, at as early a date as possible. If the egyptian government were prepared to send, for instance, the Egyptian PrimeMinister to the Sudan for such discussions, I should tell the Egyptiansthat I myself should be willing to go to the Sudan for this purpose also at the same time.Background3. Egypt has consistently maintained her demands that British troops shallbe evacuated from the Canal Zone and that we shall recognise the unity of the NileValley under the Egyptian Crown, by which, of course, she means the unity ofEgypt and the Sudan. Our own attitude has been, and still is, that we do not recognise the unilateral abrogation by the late Egyptian Government of the 1936Treaty and the Condominium Agreements relating to the Sudan, and that we intend to maintain our position in the Canal Zone under that Treaty until suchPrinted for the Cabinet.

time as we are able to revise the treaty by agreement with Egypt or to reach afreely negotiated agreement with Egypt which will replace it. If we do not reacif^agreement with Egypt, we can, and shall, maintain :om forces in the Canal Zontr-^and ensure that the Sudan continues to make orderlv progress towards self-govern-ment and eventually self-determination.4.: ,At the same time we have to take into account the rising tide of nationalismin the Middle East, the events of the past few months, and the fact that in 1956 our treaty with Egypt can be revised at the request of either of the parties and that it is unlikely that the neutral authority to whom we should have recourse in the everitof disagreement between ourselves and Egypt would decide in favour of a continu-ance of the Treaty on anything like its present terms. The replacement of the WafdGovernment by the present Government, consequent upon the riots in Cairo on26th January, and the improvement which has already taken place in the situationin the Canal Zone, give us an opportunity to resume negotiations which the formerGovernment had broken off. The present Government is not in every respectsatisfactory from our point of view, and it remains to be seen whether it will beable to command sufficient support in the country to maintain its position. But therisk that it might be unable to give effect to an agreement with us is one which wehave to take, since, if we cannot reach agreement now, the best to which we can look forward is a recrudescence of anti-British activities in Egypt, the virtual liquidation of our commercial interests there, and renewed attacks on our position in the canal Zone on such a scale that our base there would once again be renderedinoperative as a war-time base.5. Our main strategic interest in Egypt is the maintenance of the base which supplies all our forces in the Middle East in peace-time and which would serve theAllied armies defending the Middle East in time of war. Without this base, thedefence of the Middle East might become impossible, and we are advised that Egyptis the only suitable location for such a base owing to such considerations asgeography, the existence of adequate communications, airfields and other installa-tions, and the presence of industrial potential and a labour force. &apos;6. In peace-time, the presence of British forces and the British base in the canal Zone is a stabilising factor in Middle East politics and contributes more than anything else to British influence and prestige throughout the Middle East, theEastern Mediterranean and North Africa. It is also a guarantee of the freedomof shipping under the flags of all nations to pass through the Suez Canal, in accord-ance with the terms of the Suez Canal Convention of 1888.7. The four-Power proposals, which were made to the Egyptian Governmenton 13th October, 1951, jointly by ourselves, the United States, tranee and Turkey,were designed to take account so far as possible of these interests as well as of thenew situation in the Middle East, but they purposely left many important matters affecting Anglo-Egyptian relations open for negotiation with the Egyptian Govern-ment. Since we are fully committed to these proposals, any arrangements whichwe ourselves make with Egypt must be in accordance with the principle underlyingthem, namely, the substitution of an Allied Middle East Command (in which thefour Powers should participate together with Australia, South Africa and NewZealand and Egypt and with which other Middle Eastern States should be associated -ated) for a purely British base and headquarters in the Canal Zone. The four-Power proposals did not, however, provide for the stationing of any specific Alliedland forces upon Egyptian soil in peace-time. They do provide that &quot; such british forces as are not allocated to the Allied Middle East Command by agreementbetween the Egyptian Government and the Governments of the other countriesalso participating as founder members in the Allied Middle East Command organ-isation &quot; shall be withdrawn from Egypt, on the understanding that the presentBritish base in Egypt would &quot; become an Allied base within the Allied Middle east command with full Egyptian participation in the running of this base in peace and war &quot; and that &quot; the strength of the Allied forces of the participating nations to be stationed in Egypt in peace-time would be determined between the participatingnations, including Egypt.&quot; They also provide for the setting up of an air defence organisation, including both Egyptian and Allied forces, with joint responsibility tothe Egyptian Government and to the Allied Middle East Command. These pro-posals were rejected out of hand by the then Egyptian Government, and there is nodoubt that it would still be difficult, if not impossible, to secure their acceptance byany Egyptian Government in advance of detailed negotiations.   Moreover, it is
^-,now plain that any agreement with Egypt is in fact bound to include a provision fori fit withdrawal of British land forces as a condition of acceptance of the principleof participation by Egypt in the proposed Middle East Command.; 8. I have therefore worked out a line of approach to the Egyptians (see annex I to this memorandum) which is intended to provide for a resumption of discussions with the Egyptian Government upon the basis of a &quot; neutral&quot; agenda.Within the framework of this Agenda we should be able to develop our thesisregarding the need for a Middle East Command and for Egyptian participation init; dependent upon Egyptian acceptance in principle of this thesis, we should thenwork out what arrangements are necessary as between ourselves and the Egyptiansfor an Allied base and air defence organisation in Egypt, as well as for other matters which need to be covered. The Chiefs of Staff have agreed that the withdrawal ofBritish mobile land forces should be possible within one year, provided that arrange-ments can be made for their alternative accommodation in other areas and thatfunds can be provided to give them at least a minimum scale of accommodation and amenities. While all our arrangements must be brought within the corners ofthe four-Power proposals, I consider negotiations should first be opened upon an anglo-Egyptian basis, and only broadened subsequently when questions affectingthe organisation of the proposed new Middle East Command come up. At thisstage we would hope, on the assumption that our own negotiations with Egypt are on the way to being successful, that the latter might be willing to participate in aconference of all the Powers sponsoring the establishment of the Middle east command.9. A complicating factor in our negotiations with Egypt is the future of theSudan. At the same time as it purported to abrogate the 1936 Treaty last October,the then Egyptian Government introduced legislation altering the title of king farouk to &quot; King of Egypt and the Sudan &quot; and laying down the outlines of a constitution for the Sudan. This was done without any consultation with the sudanese, and aroused intense resentment in the Sudan. It would, however, bevery difficult, if not impossible, for any Egyptian Government to revoke this legis-lation, and the question of King Farouk&apos;s title is a matter which concerns his personal prestige. As a consequence it raises difficulties for us, since the King isthe principal stabilising element in the country and the person upon whom we mustrely to influence his Government towards a favourable defence settlement.10. We have been repeatedly advised, in the most categorical terms, by her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo that we cannot hope for an agreement on defencewithout a solution of the problem of the King&apos;s title and that there is indeed little hope of our even being able to start defence talks without giving some assurance to the Egyptian Prime Minister that we are actively seeking such a solution. Thisis also the firm opinion of the United States and French Ambassadors in Cairo.This view has been consistently held by our Embassy in Cairo and repeated to us at intervals throughout the whole period of our efforts to reach agreement with the egyptians. On the other hand it is the considered and reiterated opinion of theGovernor-General of the Sudan that recognition by us of King Farouk&apos;s claimwould provoke widespread disturbances in the Sudan which the Government mightnot be able to control. It is in any event out of the question that we should go back upon our pledges to the Sudanese that there shall be no change in their statuswithout prior consultation and that they shall eventually be free to determine theirown future.11. Our first difficulty is to arrange for a proper consultation with the sudanese, in the absence of any fully representative institutions in the Sudan, andthis consultation must take place in the near future if it is to help us towards asolution of the defence problem. Moreover, it must be such that the Egyptians willnot be able to dismiss it as a mere put-up job. I have therefore come to the con-clusion that it might be worth trying to transfer to the Egyptians themselves someof the onus of consulting the Sudanese and attempting to persuade them to agreeto some form of recognition of King Farouk&apos;s claim to the title of &quot; King of theSudan.&quot; At Annex II is the proposal which I should like to put to the EgyptianPrime Minister. This might possibly suffice to enable us to renew negotiations on defence, and if its reception by the Egyptian Government were favourable, itmight be suggested to them that they should send the Prime Minister himself tothe Sudan to discuss matters with the Sudanese. In certain circumstances I myselfmight be prepared to go there at the same time.   Indeed, if the Egyptian Prime41844 b 2
Minister were inclined to take a realistic view of the matter, it might also desirable to suggest to him that consultations with the Sudanese should btl.broadened to include the whole question of the future relations between Egypt andthe Sudan. These ideas are admittedly somewhat tentative at present, but I shouldbe grateful if my colleagues would approve them in principle, subject to any comments which I may receive from Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Cairo or theGovernor-Genera! of the Sudan.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,\\th February, 1952..    .    , . ANNEX I.Negotiations on DefenceBelow is an outline, in stages, of our approach to the Egyptian GovernmentObviously the stages may not be rigidly adhered to in the event, but it has seemedconvenient to set them out in this way for the sake of clarity. (Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Cairo has already been instructed to discuss Stages I, II, and IIIwith the Egyptian Prime Minister.) The draft &quot; Statement of Intent&quot; is not a document which we would show to the Egyptians at any stage, but it is meantmerely as a guide for ourselves, in order to indicate the kind of result which weshould hope might emerge from the negotiations.These negotiations might therefore follow a course somewhat on the following lines:  Stage IAgreement with the Egyptian Government to resume discussions on defence.Stage IIThe formulation of an agreed Agenda for these discussions along the following lines:  1. The conception of and need for an Allied Middle East Command: Egypfsparticipation in such a Command.2. The need for an Allied military base to support such a Command, andits possible organisation, e.g., control of base, technical and adminis-trative personnel needed for maintenance of national equipment,arrangements for maintenance of base installations, airfields, &amp;c.3.   Defence of the Allied Base, including allocation of responsibilities (a) Land defence.(b) Air defence.(c) Local protection.4. Future of British land and air forces in Egypt.5. Training and equipment of Egyptian armed forces to undertake newresponsibilities.6. Facilities for allied personnel and military equipment remaining in Egypt,including personal and fiscal privileges. ,7. Facilities for the use of airfields by allied military aircraft in transit.8. Facilities for movement and stationing of forces and war material in egypt in the event of war.9. Supersession of the 1936 Treaty.(Note. This Agenda has been drafted so far as possible on &quot; neutral&quot; lines in order to try to avoid pre-judging any of the issues which we have tosettle with the Egyptians.)
) I a stage iv the actual resumption of negotiations, which should so far as possible be kept secret, on the basis of the agreed Agenda. We should endeavour as a result ofthese discussions to draw up an Agreed Minute containing a common Statementof Intent on the following lines:  1. Her Majesty&apos;s Government agree to the v/withdrawal from Egypt withintwelve months of all mobile fighting units of the British land forces inEgypt.(Note, We should probably not offer withdrawal within thisperiod at the outset of negotiations, but we should almost certainly haveto accept such a period if we are to reach agreement.)2. Her Majesty&apos;s Government will turn over to the Egyptian Government thepresent military base installations on the Suez Canal. The egyptian government agree that these shall forthwith be made available free of cost to the Allied Middle East Command;3. The Egyptian armed forces shall assume the task of providing for thesecurity from land and air attack, and for the local safeguarding, of theAllied military base and the Suez Canal. The Egyptian Government fortheir part agree (a) that the overall direction of the air defences should be vested inthe Allied Middle East Command, operating through an allied air Defence Organisation.(b) to permit the stationing in Egypt of such Allied air forces and air defence personnel as may be considered by the Supreme allied commander Middle East in agreement with the Egyptian militaryauthorities to be necessary to supplement the Egyptian air forces available.4. There will thus remain in Egypt of the British land forces only such tech-nical and administrative personnel as are required to maintain at astate of operational readiness British military equipment held in theAllied military base. These personnel will so far as possible be replaced by British civilian technicians and wherever practicable by Egyptianpersonnel trained in the handling of British stores and equipment. Ofthe British air and air-defence forces only such will remain as areallocated by the Supreme Allied Commander Middle East to the allied air Defence Organisation mentioned above. These too will be replaced by Egyptian units and personnel progressively as sufficient of the lattercan be trained and equipped to the requisite standard.5. Her Majesty&apos;s Government undertake, in common with such other par-participating members of the Middle East Command as are in a positionto do so, to facilitate the training and equipment of the Egyptian armed forces to assume the responsibilities referred to above.6. As soon as satisfactory arrangements have been concluded between theAllied Command and Egyptian military authorities regarding theorganisation of the base and its defences, Her Majesty&apos;s GovernmentStage IIIt.J&apos;      Issue of a joint Communique recording the decision to resume discussions.This might be on the following lines:  Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Government have agreedto resume discussions with a view to reaching a defence settlement. her majesty&apos;s Government have agreed, on the assurance of the Egyptian Govern-ment that they will take such steps as are appropriate and open to them toensure the return of normal conditions in the Canal Zone area, to start a withdrawal of forces from that area as soon as conditions make this practicable.It is the sincere desire of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to reach an agreement withthe Egyptian Government for arrangements for the adequate defence of the canal Zone. Both Governments recognise and agree that the successfuldefence of the Middle East depends on the collaboration of all the states concerned, in time of peace as in time of war. At the same time, they recognisethat such collaboration can only be successful if it is freely given in a spiritof partnership, and is compatible with the national dignity of all parties.
will agree to regard the 1936 Treaty as superseded and will be glad to*&quot;&quot;^enter into a new Treaty of Alliance with Egypt in keeping with th6..Ispirit which has animated the nations of the free world to join together in voluntary defensive co-operation.-.. 7. In consideration of the above and in recognition of the over-riding need:    to consolidate the defences of the Middle East, the Egyptian Govern-ment agree to participate in the Allied Middle East Command on a footing of equafity with the founder members.8. The Egyptian Government agree that in the event of war or imminentmenace of war Egypt will grant the forces of the Allied Middle east command all the necessary facilities and assistance.   Meanwhile sheagrees to grant the customary personal and fiscal facilities to such allied military personnel and war material as require to be located in egypt in time of&quot; peace.[9. The Egyptian Government agree to the location of the Allied supreme commander&apos;s Headquarters on Egyptian territory.]10, The two Governments agree to pursue as a matter of urgency and in con-sultation with the other Powers concerned further discussions on militaryand political levels to give effect to the foregoing.Stage VPublication of the Agreed Minute and simultaneous announcement of Egyptianadherence to the Allied Middle East Command.Stage VIFurther discussions between Egypt and the other Powers sponsoring the settingup of the Middle East Command on the structure of this Command and all thearrangements incidental to its establishment. These discussions might also includethe negotiation by the Supreme Allied Commander, Middle East, of the necessary arrangements with the Egyptian Government in connexion with the maintenanceof the Allied base in Egypt, detailed questions of organisation and immunities for allied forces in Egypt, and other relevant matters.ANNEX IIThe SudanWe might tell the Egyptian Prime Minister that, in view of our pledges to the sudanese, which we should enumerate, we cannot ourselves agree to recognise king farouk&apos;s claim without prior consultation with the Sudanese. At present there isno purely Sudanese institution or body sufficiently representative of Sudaneseopinion to enable such consultation to take place. We therefore consider (a) that it must be for the newly-elected all-Sudanese Parliament, which we hope will meet after elections to be held this summer, to decide in thefirst instance upon the question of King Farouk&apos;s nominal sovereignty;(b) that in order to leave no doubt of the fairness of the elections for this parliament, and to encourage all political parties to participate in them,an international Commission upon which Egypt, the United Kingdom,and the Sudanese shall be represented shall be set up in the Sudan to observe the conduct of the elections;(a) that meanwhile the Egyptian Government should send a representative of high standing, in whom they have- full confidence, to the Sudan in orderto discuss these proposals with leading Sudanese and possibly the wholequestion of the future relations between Egypt and the Sudan.2. It seems to me that a proposal on these lines ought to meet the properinterests of the Egyptians, without prejudicing the rights of the Sudanese, or con-conflicting with our own pledges in respect of the Sudan. It is therefore the course which I advocate.3. Nevertheless, if the advice which I have received from Cairo is correct,it seems improbable that it will satisfy the Egyptian Government, and we may therefore find them unwilling to reach any settlement with us on the defence issues.T have therefore thought it worth while to put up for consideration by my colleagues
an alternative proposal, which goes a little further towards satisfying the egyptian government but which might give to the Sudanese the impression that we ourselves&quot;were trying to influence them towards acceptance of the Egyptian thesis.4. Under this alternative scheme we would suggest to the Egyptian Govern-ment that their representative should consult responsible Sudanese, both inside and outside the Legislative Assembly, in order to see whether agreement could bereached on the following points :  (a) Whether the Sudan could agree that, pending Sudanese self-determination,there should be general recognition of the symbolic link between egypt and the Sudan provided by the Egyptian Crown.(b) There should be no interference by either Egypt or the United kingdom with the steps which are being or are about to be taken, with theauthorisation of the Governor-General, towards Sudanese self-govern-ment.(c) That after the achievement of full self-government, which both the UnitedKingdom and Egypt hope will be by the end of 1952, the Sudanese shallbe free to choose their own future by whatever means they thinkdesirable, and that this choice shall include full independence.(d) With a view to the orderly attainment of self-government and thereafterof self-determination for the Sudan, an international Commission, onwhich both Egypt and the United Kingdom will be represented, shallbe established as soon as possible to advise the Governor-General uponthe various constitutional steps to be taken.It would be made clear to the Sudanese that all these points, (a) to (d) above, areinterdependent, and that if the Sudanese were prepared to accept these proposals,they would be embodied in an agreement subscribed by Egypt and the UnitedKingdom and registered with the United Nations.5. The advantage of this alternative scheme from the Egyptian point of view is that it does at least enable them in theory to secure an expression of Sudaneseopinion on King Farouk&apos;s claim without waiting for the establishment of an all-Sudanese Parliament, which will undoubtedly take several months at least. Never-theless, there is no certainty that it would satisfy Egyptian aspirations, and it might provoke disturbances in the Sudan. I therefore favour postponing any decision by the Sudanese until after the election of the new Parliament, as suggested in theformer proposal.
