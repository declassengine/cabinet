(52) 1019th January, 1952CABINETTHE&apos; BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SITUATION   &apos;Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer c j r  :-.The gold and dollar reserves continue to fall at an alarming rate, and 1 mustinform my colleagues that, unless we tackle this situation with great resolution,there is a real likelihood that by the middle of the year we shall not be able to hold the pound at $2-80.2. In the last quarter of 1951 the dollar deficit was $940 million ( 337 million),.Since the beginning.of this month we have lost $225 million. The latest.forecast for the loss in this quarter is $700 million, and this will probably prove too low.Even on this estimate, however, the gold reserves will be down to $1,400 million( 500 million) by the end of June, and this is much the same: as the level at whichthey stood on the day of devaluation in September 1949. &apos; mi -   /:3. Unless we can stem this tide, it will swallow us up, and we shall reach apoint at which we can no longer buy the basic food and raw materials on whichthis island depends, or keep together the sterling Commonwealth as a coherentfinancial system. \ ... &apos; ..4. We still have time to organise ourselves to deal with this emergency, and allthe work which we are doing is laying the foundations for recovery.- But there isnot much time, and we must use it to full advantage..,.    .;,...... ..;   .      \    - -The Reasons for the Deterioration5. The latest estimates for the year 1952, which have been.agreed betweenthe Treasury and the Departments concerned, and which incorporate all thedecisions which are asked of the Cabinet on internal policy, and the effect of theUnited States steel, are set out in Tables I and II. They show the United kingdom balance of payments With the non-sterling area as follows: -United Kingdom Balance of Payments with Non-Sterling Area in 1952....... ,(  million)Estimate off first Half Second half     Total   October 1951Imports        ...      ... 1,022 1,061 2,083 2,281 &quot; \ HExports and re-exports 685 740 1,425 . 1,510 ^Invisibles (net)       ... i-    28 -    28 ...   . .4-.   26.Defence Aid...... -h   113 4-    12 4-&quot;  125 -h&apos; &apos;25   &apos; .\Deficit with non-sterling r    -area      ......      -  196      - 337      - 533      - 72041746 b
6. It is a distressing fact that although we took action to reduce imports andother external expenditure by  350 million, although we are taking substantialsteps to free more resources for exports, and although we are now allowing for 100 million of United States defence aid in the first half year and the one million tons of United States steel, our latest estimates show a reduction in the prospectivedeficit with the non-sterling world (which is the nub from the point of view of the reserves) by  200 million.7. Two factors have been responsible. On the import side, prices have risenagainst us (e.g., cotton, non-ferrous metals), and there have been increases in volumetoo (e.g., steel, coarse grains). On the export side, the general conditions (forexample in textiles) are at present unfavourable, and much more serious our competitive position in certain industries appears to be deteriorating. Except inthe markets of the sterling Commonwealth, where there are inflationary conditions and our exports are in a privileged position, we are tending to lose ground in manylines of business..8. Normally, the other sterling area countries have a surplus with the non-sterling area (and a deficit with us). That surplus offsets our deficit with thenon-sterling area. But on the data which they have submitted to the Common-wealth Finance Ministers Conference, they will be in deficit with the non-sterling area in 1952 to the tune of  120 million an estimate which is hardly surprising,for they were in deficit.of  15.6.million in the second half of 195.1 alone.9. Thus, with a United Kingdom deficit of  530 million with the non-sterling area, and with the other sterling area countries in deficit there of  120 million,the sterling area as a whole is in deficit of  650 million in 1952. And as our reserves at end-December were only  835 million, the implications are clear.Commonwealth Action10. I proposed to the Commonwealth Finance Ministers that the only possiblehope of success could come if the sterling area as a whole could get into balancewith the rest of the world in the second half of this year. That is the only wayto stop the drain.11. I accordingly proposed-a series of targets for each country (set out inTable III) the net effect of which was that the United Kingdom would reduce itsdeficit with the non-sterling world to  100 million in the second half (i.e.,  200million a year) if they would turn their deficit into a surplus of  200 million a year.The targets set the individual countries formidable problems, but I am hopeful that, they will accept them, and take immediate action accordingly.United States Aid12. We can, in my view, frame our policy on the assumption that we shall receive some economic support from the United States in the second half of 1952.It is obvious that the United States could not take major action to help us, even ifthe Administration and we ourselves wished it, before the Presidential election. Butwe are certainly entitled to a share of such funds as may be voted for economicsuppbrt in the Mutual Security legislation which will shortly be presented to congress for the United States fiscal year 1952-53. It has always been understoodthat our defence programme is subject to &quot;burden-sharing, and the report of theTemporary Council Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation made it quite clear that it would be impossible for our defence programme to be effectivelycarried out if our dollar deficit is not covered. From the 1951-52 Mutual SecurityAct appropriations we expect to receive $300 million ( 107 million), and the esti-mates for the first half of this year incorporate this. It is entirely uncertain how much money Congress will vote in the next few months, and how large will be our share; we shall not know until it is too late for us to alter our own policies for the second half-year. A figure of  80 million for the second half-year, including,e.g., United States purchases of military equipment in the United Kingdom, seemsa reasonable figure to take as a basis-it would mean that we were getting 50 percent, more aid in 1952-53 than in 1951-52. This is, of course, all highly uncertain,but we may not get as much during the second half-year, and we certainly cannotrely on getting more. -
I^lourse of Action^   13.   In a situation like this, pur own action is what counts. We must pay our way, and we must be seen to be paying our way.14. This must be the first and central objective. For if we fail in this, allother objectives defence, the strength of the Commonwealth, full employment,social welfare, better food will collapse like a house of cards..15. The dynamic force which can put us right is our earning power. We haveno hope of getting straight unless we can make our exports plentiful and competitiveacross the whole range of products, by price and by quality and by delivery date.16. This is of course the reason for the series of measures dealing with theinternal economy which I am proposing in another paper. Every measure whichwe can take to lighten the load on the internal economy directly or indirectly helpsto make the economy more flexible and to support our exporters.17. But it will take time for these measures to become effective, and the reserves are running out. We therefore should take further emergency actionagainst imports.Direct Action on Imports18. The United Kingdom^ part in the proposals for concerted Common-wealth action is to reduce our deficit with the non-sterling world in the second halfof this year to  100 million (i.e.,  200 million a year). This is to be offset by aroughly equal surplus with the other sterling area countries, so that the UnitedKingdom would be in overall balance, or better, in the second half of 1952. explained in Cabinet last week that this would mean difficult decisions.19. The estimates before us indicate that our deficit with the non-sterlingworld in the second half of 1952 may be of the order of  337 million. These deficitsare margins in a very large turnover, but there is no reason to suppose that thisis ah over-estimate. A 5 per cent, rise in import prices would add  100 million toour non-sterling import bill; the world market for many of our most importantexports is in an unsatisfactory condition, which offers little scope for a rapid increasein earnings.20. Taking the figure of  337 million in the half-year as the starting-point,we need to improve the position by  237 million in order to reduce the deficit tothe prescribed maximum of  100 million. Many of my Commonwealth colleagues were sceptical about their ability to improve their position to the required extent,and some may fail. One would indeed like to have a margin on the right side, butI fear this is impossible. Against the  237 million, we can put  80 million (as inparagraph 12) for United States aid, and although the original estimates alreadyallow for all the internal measures which we are taking to stimulate exports, sothat we cannot properly allow more on that score, we may find that deflationaryaction in the other sterling area countries will have some effect in diverting our exports to non-sterling distinations. But we cannot allow very much for this,and it is clear that a substantial reduction in our imports would be required.21. After weighing the various factors involved as best I can, I have cometo the conclusion that it is my duty to put forward a programme of import cuts,designed to yield a saving of  150 million, from non-sterling sources, in the year1952, of which about  100 million would fall in the second half-year.22. The 1952 import programme, revised by the Departments to take intoaccount the latest prices and availabilities and making allowance for all previouscuts and for the effects of anti-inflationary measures, is set out in Table IV.Substantial reductions have already been imposed; and the issue which is now presented is how further reductions should be distributed between the stocks whichhave been accumulated as a measure of defence preparedness, the current levels offood consumption, and the raw material supply for industrial production and trans-port. In my view, the very last resort would be to cut the raw material intake for industry, for they would get us into a spiral from which there is no escape-bycreating unemployment and destroying productivity, it would deprive us of any prospect of working our way out of our difficulties. The  150 million programme which I am presenting therefore includes no proposal which would seriously damage our basic industrial potential, for I think we must regard this as paramount.
23.   The review of possibilities follows:     millionTobacco. Reduction in purchases from North American 1952crop to 100 million lb. Last year the purchase was250 million lb. and this means consuming stocks heavilyin 1952-53 with risks that prices will go against us in 1953.This will not involve reduced consumption  ...      ......      16Petrol. The only direct way to save petrol is by rationing, whichis administratively cumbersome and expensive. In any case there is some doubt whether it would in fact save muchforeign exchange.  So I advise against it  ......      ......Films.-There is an agreement in force with the United States film industry which we cannot set aside. So we cannot do any-thing in this   ...     ....      ............Softwood. Our present plans to build 230,000 houses in 1952 andand 260,000 in 1953 will need additional imports in 1952 of90,000 standards ( 6f million) over and above the import programme. There is a strategic stockpile of 215,000standards, in addition to the commercial stocks (estimated at400,000 standards at end-1952). By using the stockpile, atsome cost to the Exchequer, we could get the 90,000standards of additional softwood and reduce imports by -125,000 standards. I am reluctant to do this, both on com-mercial and on strategic grounds, but it would save       ...       8 , &apos;Cotton.   The programme provides a seven-month&apos;s stock; the raw Cotton Commission needs a big stock for efficient &apos;running, but our prospective 1952 cotton bill has gone up by 47 million since October, and I propose we make a saving in1952, again predominantly by working with lower stocks, of     20Non-ferrous metals. -No building of stocks ...      ...      ...      ...       8; Other materials.&apos;1&apos;- Use of supplies in strategic stockpile to replacecurrent imports, and no new stockpiling purchases of non-sterlings materials, together with various  miscellaneoussavings might save     ...      ................     20We. should not, however, dispose of our stockpile of strategic metals and ferro-alloys.;. . Machinery.- I have considered stopping imports.of new machineryfrom the United States, but do not recommend it; the       *licensing is already, very tight, and we could not gain muchthis year without real dislocation. I would expect that our action against investment would reduce these importseventually -      .... -   ......  .:. ..i   .....&apos; -&quot;&quot; ,.       &quot;&apos;: - 72   &quot; ;* Including Board of Trade and Ministry of Supply stockpile items. , :24. It is at first sight tempting to do a further round of deliberalisation againstimports from Europe, many of which are of relatively low essentiality. But I am convinced that this would be mistaken at this stage. , Events have shown that wejudged the deliberalisation measures last November well; our action was endorsed by O.E.E.C., and we have avoided retaliation. But my judgment is that if we wentfurther now, there would assuredly be retaliation, and we should in fact precipitatea complete disintegration of intra-European trade. We should not gain much net.in the balance of payments, and we should be starting a downward spiral. when we are paying 100 per cent, gold to E.P.U., we shall probably have to go ahead, butI think it would be mistaken to embark upon this now, before the need for. this action is clear to our European partners beyond any shadow of doubt.25. The same difficulties would arise if we abstained from a second generalround of deliberalisation, but sought to put quota restrictions on a few specificgoods, such as wines and spirits, or silks. The balance of payments argumentcan be effectively deployed if the action taken covers a wide range of commodities,selected without discrimination (as ours was last November) and with reasonableregard to the commercial interests of the supplying countries. But if a few items are selected for drastic treatment, which are of special importance to the economy of the supplying countries, our O.E.E.C. position is indefensible.  Retaliation then
) becomes inevitable. In the particular case of wines and spirits, restriction wouldbe regarded as being a direct and unjustifiable blow against France. It is anomalousto allow wine to be imported when essentials have to be restricted, but I am surewe should lose more from cutting it than we should gain.26. We could, however, make some saving in the second half of 1952, without incurring those difficulties, by reducing the quotas on products which have alreadybeen defiberalised;  millionLower quotas on already deliberalised imports    .........    5-1027. The arguments against further deliberalisation at this juncture apply,though with somewhat less force, against tourism. But tourism is such a largeitem about  40 million a year, or substantially larger than our whole textileimports from Europe that it is very difficult to exclude it from a list of expenditureaits. If we made a cut (particularly if we put the ration below  35), we should haveto justify it in O.E.E.C. I think we should make a cut, but we should not make itimpossible for people to have holidays on the Continent; and we have to bear theFrench problem in mind as well as our own. A substantial cut would involve slomemodification of the arrangement under Uniscan for virtually unrestricted travel.-                                                                                            MillionTourism. Reduction in ration to  25, with  5 export of notes* .    instead of  10     ...      ......      ...      ,......10-1528. The proposals above add up to  92 million. To secure  150 million, itis necessary to cut  58 million from the only remaining important section of theimport programme, which is food.29. The scope for action in food is limited, because of the extent of forwardcommitments, but the following possibilities add up to  75 million, against the 58 million above:  , . millionWheat and flour.-Reduce total stocks to 10^ weeks&apos; consumption       sugar.

If this were done, but consumptionmaintained, stocks of sugar would be down to 9 weeks&apos; con-sumption by end-1952, and stocks of oils and fats (of .particular strategic importance) to 16 weeks&apos; 10 weeks&apos;cover for processing the raw material and 6 weeks&apos; supply for consumption. This living on stocks would of courseweaken the position in 1953.]Meat.-Reduction in purchases from Argentina in next protocolagreement, and in purchases from other sources saving of90,000 tons (about Id. on the ration, now estimated toaverage Is.

30. To select  58 million from this h\t of  75 million is a most painfuloperation. Indeed, this whole programme of  150 million which is less than15 per cent, of our total imports, and only about 1\ per cent, of our non-sterlingimports-shows how narrow are the margins on which we are living. If the pound is allowed to fall, this import programme will be automatically cut, for weshall not be able to pay our suppliers. The question really is how to make the cut in the way which gives us the best prospects for recovery, and I would ask mycolleagues, when considering their attitude to individual cuts in this list, to consider at the same time what are the alternatives.Longer-Term Considerations31. If we can convince the world that we are putting our internal economy in order, and that we are resolutely acting in combination with the rest of the sterling Commonwealth, to balance the sterling area&apos;s accounts and to stop the drain on the gold reserves in June, we can overcome the immediate crisis andrestore confidence in sterling.32. But we shall still have a very long way to go. We are trying at one and the same time to run a country which depends upon overseas supplies forhalf its food and nearly all its raw materials and petroleum, to carry out defence and international political commitments which involve direct expenditure of foreign exchange of well over  400 million a year, and to act as the centre of a world-widefinancial system, based on sterling. We are doing this with a gold reserve whichin the course of the next few months is likely to fall to a critical level, and which even now is only about one-fifth of our short-term external debts.33. I draw three conclusions from this. First, we cannot bear this great loadwithout a massive expansion of our earning power producing enough of the things which the world wants, at the world&apos;s prices. Second, we cannot run the system and maintain sterling without gold reserves far above any level which they haveattained since the end of the war, and we shall have to apply our energies as hard to building them in 1953 as we are fighting to stop the drain in 1952. Third, itwill take a long and sustained effort to get these foundations of our economy right.Conclusions34.   To sum up, I recommend:  (i) that it be accepted that the central objective in 1952, upon which all our other objectives depend, is to stop the drain on our gold reserves andthus to safeguard the food and raw material supply, and the purchasingpower of sterling (paragraphs 13-15).,(ii) that we must reduce our deficit with the non-sterling world in the second half of 1952 to an amount not exceeding  100 million (and if possibleless) and thus with a surplus of at least  100 million with the other sterling area countries be in overall balance in the second half of1952 (paragraph 18).   &apos;(iii) that in addition to the internal measures before the Cabinet designed toincrease our earning power, we should make a cut of  150 million inour import and other expenditure in the non-sterling world in 1952(paragraph 21).  .(iv) that reductions in purchases of tobacco and raw materials of  72 millionbe made (paragraph 23).(v) that we do not yet embark upon a further round of deliberalisation ofimports from Europe (paragraphs 24-25), but seek to make savings of  5-10 million in the second half by reducing quotas on items alreadydeliberalised, and reduce the tourist ration to  25 (paragraphs 26 and 27).(vi) that the food and feeding-stuffs programme be cut by  58 million, andthat items be selected accordingly from the list in paragraph 29.R.

Consequently our exports there willprobably be substantially less, and the surplus less, and our overall deficit correspondingly greater,except to the extent to which these exports go to other destinations, thus reducing our deficit withthe non-sterling world.TABLE IIICOMMONWEALTH FINANCE MINISTERS TARGETSThe following are the targets proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer:  Surplus or Deficit with Non-Sterling World(  million)United Kingdom    .......Colonies      .........South Africa (not a member of area pool) .......Non-commonwealth members of area (Irish Republic, &amp;c.)australia new Zealand .......India ..........Pakistan       .........      .Ceylon ..........Southern Rhodesia ...Individual Countries&apos; Estimates		Target proposedsubmitted for the Conference		for Second HalfFull Year 1952	Half-year	of 1952- 410*	-205	- 1004 25	4 12	4 27!    - 4 14	4   7	4 25&apos;:    - 73	- 36	(- 10)-71	- 35	4 154   5	4   3	4 10- 78	- 39	- 104 30	4 15	4 254 23	4  11	4 13;.;    4,. 5	4   2	4   5- 530*	-265	Total ......* The United Kingdom deficit for 1952 with the non-sterling world is now estimated at 533,instead of 410, and the total deficit of the sterling area correspondingly higher.
