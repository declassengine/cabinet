ANNEX ADRAFT TELEGRAM TO H.M. AMBASSADOR, CAIROMy telegram No. 362 /of 14th February:  Resumption of negotiations/.You may now discuss with the Egyptian Prime Minister the issueof a communique on the lines set out in paragraph 3 of this telegram.The communique should of course be issued by both Governments, but only when a definite agreement has been reached to resume negotiations on an agreed basis.    Further instructions indicating our objectives in the defence negotiations and the limits to which I am at present prepared to go inrespect of the Sudan follow by despatch.2. I realise of course that a statement on the lines of the suggestedcommunique will not give the Egyptian Prime Minister what he wants,namely, acceptance by us of the principle of complete evacuation of the canal Zone and recognition of King Farouk&apos;s title to the Sudan.    I am not however prepared to concede the principle of evacuation in advance of asatisfactory agreement upon the other points of vital importance to us, suchas the future of the base, the creation of a joint air defence organisation,and Egyptian participation in the proposed Middle East Command, carryingwith it the grant of full facilities to Allied forces in time of war or imminentmenace of war in accordance with the Four-Power proposals.    Nor can Iconcede recognition of King Farouk&apos;s title;  least of all before there has beena proper opportunity for the Sudanese to be consulted.    At the same time Iwell understand the importance of making as generous a contribution aspossible, both to enable the negotiations to be resumed in the right atmosphereand to strengthen the Egyptian Prime Minister&apos;s position in his own country.The text in the next paragraph of this telegram represents the limits to whichI can go, and you should not depart from it without reference to me.
3.Following is text of suggested communique.BeginsHer Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Government haveagreed to resume discussions with a view to reaching a defence settlementagreed, on the assurance of the Egyptian Government that the latter willtake such steps as are appropriate and open to it to ensure a return to normal conditions in the Canal Zone area, to start reducing Her Majesty&apos;forces in that area as soon as conditions make this practicable.    It is thesincere desire of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to reach an agreement with theEgyptian Government for arrangements for the adequate defence of the canal zone which will provide for a gradual assumption of responsibilities by theEgyptian armed forces.    Both Governments recognise and agree that thesuccessful defence of the Middle East is an international responsibility anddepends on the collaboration of all the states concerned, in time of peace asin time of war.    At the same time, they recognise that such collaborationcan only be successful if it is freely given in a spirit of partnership and iscompatible with the national dignity of all parties.Her Majesty&apos;s Government haveEnds
mANNEX draft DESPATCH TO H.M. AMBASSADOR, CAIROFebruary,1952.Sir,After the frustration of repeated efforts to reach bilateral agree-ment with the Egyptian Government on the problems of defence and the futureof the Sudan, H.M, Government decided in the course of 1951 that an attempt should be made to find a solution of the defence question through the medium of international co-operative defence arrangements in the Middle East.The Egyptian Government, however, rejected without discussion the far-reaching proposals for the reorganisation of Middle East defence which were put forward on 13th October, 1951, by the United Kingdom, United States,French and Turkish Governments.    The Egyptian Government then pro-ceeded to abrogate the 1936 Treaty and the 1899 Condominium agreements in respect of the Sudan, and made every effort to drive our forces out of the suez Canal Zone by a combination of terrorism, intimidation, and administra-tive obstruction.   In the face of H.M. Governments determination to standon their rights under the 1936 Treaty and to take whatever measures were necessary to this end, the Egyptian Government failed in their purpose.Faced by similar intransigence on the part of the Egyptian Government in theCase of the Sudan, H,M0 Government proceeded with their plans to encourage the evolution of the country towards self-government.2. The events of the last four months have in no way altered H.M.Governments determination to fulfil their defensive responsibilities in theMiddle East at whatever cost.    Their attitude remains that they do not recognise the purported abrogation by the late Egyptian Government of the1936 Treaty and the Condominium Agreements, and that they intend tomaintain their position in the Canal Zone under that Treaty till such time as it has been possible to reach a fresh and freely negotiated agreement with egypt to replace it.    Failing such agreement with Egypt they must maintain
British forces in the Canal Zone, and ensure that the Sudan continues to makeorderly progress towards self-government and eventually self-determination0At the same time H.M. Government are fully conscious of the difficulties ofmaintaining not only British commercial and cultural interests in Egypt butalso an operative base in the Canal Zone in the face of a hostile egyptian government and people.    They do not underestimate the strategic as well as political importance of Egyptian co-operation to the successful organisationof Middle East defence.    They have also to take into account the rising tideof nationalism in the Middle East and the fact that in 1956 the Anglo-egyptian treaty may be revised at the request of either of the partieSj and that it is unlikely that the neutral authority to whom we should have recourse in theevent of disagreement between ourselves and Egypt would decide in favour ofthe continuance of the Treaty on anything like its present terms.3. The replacement of the Wafd Government by the present Governmentconsequent upon the riots in Cairo on the 26th January, the indications whichhave been received that the latter are anxious to reach a settlement, and theimprovement which has already taken place in the situation in the canal zone give us an opportunity to resume the negotiations which the WafdGovernment had broken off.    The present Egyptian Government are not inevery respect satisfactory from H.M. Governments point of view and it remains to be seen whether they will be able to command sufficient support in the country to maintain their position.    But the risk that they might be unable to give effect to a new agreement with H.M. Government is one whichmust be taken, since, if we cannot reach agreement now, we must look forward to a recrudescence of anti-British activities in Egypt, the virtualliquidation of British commercial interests there and renewed attacks on ourposition in the Canal Zone on such a scale that our base would once again be rendered inoperative as a war-time base.4. I have therefore worked out a line of approach to the egyptian government which is intended to provide for a resumption of discussions onthe basis of a &quot;neutral&quot; agenda so designed as not to prejudge the main issues-4-
and to encourage objective discussion of our points of difference.    Withinthe framework of this agenda we should be able to develop our thesisregarding the need for a Middle East Command and for Egyptian participa-tion in it.    Dependent on Egyptian acceptance in principle of this thesis, weshould then hope that the way would be open to work out the necessary arrangements for an Allied base and air defence organisation in Egypt aswell as for other matters which need to be covered.    It is clear that all such arrangements must be brought within the four corners of the Four-Power proposals, which H.M. Government still regard as the most satis-factory foundation for the organisation of Middle East defence and thesolution of Anglo-Egyptian differences.5. I consider, however, that negotiations might first be opened on an anglo-Egyptian basisB    Our object in these first contacts should be toprepare the way for a conference of all the Powers sponsoring the estab-lishment of the Middle East Command.    The stage at which this broadeningout of the negotiations should take place cannot at this stage be foreseen,and can only be decided when the course and prospects of our preliminary discussions with the Egyptians can be assessed,66 Your Excellency was accordingly instructed in my telegrams nos. 332 and 333 of the 8th February and No0 362 of the 14th February toattempt to seek agreement with the Egyptian Government on the resumptionof discussions on defence.    You were also instructed to attempt the formulation with the Egyptian Government of the agreed Agenda to which I have referred above, which should be along the following lines(1)    The conception of and need for an Allied Middle East Command:Egypt&apos;s participation in such a Command.(2)    The need for an Allied military base to support such a Command,and its possible organisation, e. gc s control of the base, technical and administrative personnel needed for maintenance of nationalequipment, arrangements for maintenance of base installations,airfieldss etc.
(3)    Defence of the AlliedJ^a^e^ja^^^^responsibilities -. (a)  Land defence.(b) Air defence.(c) Local protection.(4)    Future of British land and air forces in Egypt.(5)    Training and equipment of Egyptian armed forces toundertake new responsibilities,(6)    Facilities for allied personnel and military equipmentremaining in Egypt, including personal and fiscalprivileges,(7)    Facilities for the use of airfields by allied military aircraft in transit,(8)    Facilities for movement and stationing of forces and warmaterial in Egypt in the event of war,(9)    Supersession of the 1936 Treaty,7, If you are successful in securing Egyptian agreement to the resump&apos;tion of discussions on defence and to an agenda along the lines proposed, itmay be desirable to suggest the issue of a joint communique in the terms ofthe draft contained in my telegram No, of the February /see annex A/.8, If a communique on these lines can be agreed, it should be possibleto set negotiations in train without delay.    In my view it is essential to their ultimate success that discussions should be conducted so far as possible in secret, so that the difficulties caused by indiscretions to the Press andbombastic public pronouncements by Egyptian statesmen should not hamperour efforts to the same extent as in the past,    I consider that discussions would best be started in Cairo and as I have already indicated, J should be willing to come to Egypt personally at the appropriate stage if in your judg-ment this would contribute to their success.    While it is clearly impossible
to foresee how negotiations will develop or what adjustments or concessionsmay meet the political requirements of both Governments, the furthest thatH0M. Government would be prepared at present to go, whether in direct negotiations wi&apos;;h the Egyptians or in a wrier conference, would be anagreement in principle along the following lines:-(1)    Subject to agreement on the points enumerated below, H,M, Govern-ment agree to the progressive withdrawal from Egypt of mobilefighting units of the British land forces in Egypt within a limited period to be determined and subject to conditions to be agreed,,Only such British land forces would remain in Egypt as may beconsidered by the Supreme Allied Commander, Middle East, inagreement with the Egyptian military authorities to be necessaryto supplement the Egyptian land forces available,(2)    H0Mo Government will turn over to the Egyptian Government thepresent military base installations on the Suez Canal,,    TheEgyptian Government agree that these shall forthwith be madeavailable free of cost to the Allied Middxe East Command,,(3)    The Egyptian armed forces shall assume the task of providing forthe security from land and air attack, and for the local safe-guarding, of the Allied military base and the Suez Canal,    TheEgyptian Government for their part agree -(a) that the overall direction of the air defences should be vested in the Allied Middle East Command, operating through an allied Air Defence Organisation;(b) to permit the stationing in Egypt of such Allied air forces andair defence personnel as may be considered by the supreme allied Commander,, Middle East, in agreement with theEgyptian military authorities to be necessary to supplement the Egyptian air forces available.
(4)    There will thus remain in Egypt of the British land forces, apartfrom such limited forces as may be agreed under (i) above,only such technical and administrative personnel as are requiredto maintain at a state of operational readiness British military equipment: held in the Allied military base.    These personnelwill so far as possible be replaced by British civiliantechnicians and wherever practicable by Egyptian personneltrained in the handling of British stores and equipment,,    Of theBritish air and air defence forces only such will remain as areallocated by the Supreme Allied Commander, Middle East, to theAllied Air Defence Organisation mentioned above    These toowill be replaced by Egyptian units and personnel progressivelyas sufficient of the latter can be trained and equipped to the requisite standard,,(5)    H0Me Government undertake, in common with such other partici-pating members of the Middle East Command as are in a positionto do so9 to facilitate the training and equipment of the Egyptianarmed forces to assume the responsibilities referred to above.(6)    As soon as satisfactory arrangements have been concluded betweenthe Allied Command and Egyptian military authorities regardingthe organisation of the base and its defences, H0M. Governmentwill agree to regard the .1936 Treaty as superseded and will beglad to enter into a new Treaty of Alliance with Egypt in keeping with the spirit which has animated the nations of the fre e world to join together in voluntary defensive co-operation,,(7) In consideration of the foregoing and in recognition of the over-riding need to consolidate the defences of the Middle East, theEgyptian Government agree to participate in the Allied middle east Command on a footing of equality with the founder members.
(8)    The Egyptian Government agree that in the event of war orimminent menace of war Egypt will grant the forces of the AlliedMiddle East Command ail the necessary facilities and assistanceMeanwhile she agrees to grant the customary personal and fiscalfacilities to such Allied military personnel and war material asrequire to be located in Egypt in time of peace,,(9)    The Egyptian Government agree to the location of the AlliedSupreme Commander&apos;s Headquarters on Egyptian territory,,(10)    The two Governments agree to pursue as a matter of urgency andin consultation with the other Powers concerned further dis-cussions on military and political levels to give effect to theforegoingo9. Your Excellency will note that in their main essentials theprinciples set out in paragraph 8 are in harmony with the Four-Powerproposals.    But you will note that they provide for a positive undertaking by H.M. Government to maintain no mobile fighting units of the British land forces in Egypt, except with the agreement of the Egyptian GovernmentsThey also contemplate that the base shall be manned in the main bycivilians.    These provisions should of course be treated as concessions which H.M. Government would be willing to make to secure agreement.You are aware of the difficulties and disadvantages involved in the withdrawalof British mobile land forces from EgyptB    Much the same considerations apply to the replacement of military personnel by British civil technicians.It is true that this was already accepted in principle in H.M0 governments proposals of the 11th April lasts but it is a measure which would present thegreatest practical difficulties in execution, and you should endeavour at the outset to obtain consent to the retention of some military administrativepersonnel.10. As regards the Sudan, H.M. Government understand that whateverelse they may be willing to surrender of their ambitions in the Sudan, theEgyptian Gxyvm^m^&amp;r^/^ei^gT^&amp;Aye^i^ by the accieptasnce by H.M. Government-9&quot;
of King Farouk,s claim to the kingship of the Sudan as well as EgyptoWhatever the legal and historical arguments in support of such a claim, itsunilateral recognition by H0M0 Government would,, however, not only beregarded by the Sudanese as a breach of H0M0 Governments pledges but would be unacceptable to public opinion in this country, whatever the qualifying safeguards,,    You should therefore make clear from the outset that the first step must be consultation with the Sudanese,,    It may thereforebe necessary to remind the Egyptian Government of the exact nature ofH5M. Governments pledges to the Sudanese,,    These may be summarisedbriefly as follows:  that there shall be no change in the status of the Sudanwithout prior consultation with the Sudanese; that the Sudanese shall have theunrestricted right freely to determine their final status and their ultimaterelationship with the Co-domini;  that H0M, Government will make everyeffort to promote the establishment of self-government in the Sudan with anall-Sudanese Parliament and Council of Ministers within the course of thepresent year.    Nevertheless, K0M. Government acknowledge that Egypt haswide and legitimate interests in the Sudan and they recognise that nosettlement is likely to be reached with Egypt, which does not take their interests into account,,11, At present there is no purely Sudanese institution or body sufficientlyrepresentative of Sudanese opinion to enable consultation to take place onthe reconciliation of Egyptian and Sudanese interests and more particularly on the question of King FaroukJs title.    Nor is it possible to see how such consultation can properly take place until there is a fully representativeParliament in the Sudan,,    You should therefore put the following proposals to the Egyptian Government -(a)    that it must be for the all-Sudanese Parliament, which H,M,Government hope will meet after elections to be held this summer, to decide in the first instance upon the question of king Faroukss sovereignty;
(b)    that meanwhile the Egyptian Government should send a represen-tative of high standing, in whom they have full confidence^ to theSudan in order to discuss this question with leading Sudanese andpossibly the whole question of the future relations between egypt and the Sudan0This procedure will make plain to the Egyptians that only the Sudanese candecide whether the recognition of Egyptian sovereignty is in their own interests.    While it is for the Egyptian Government to decide how they willconvince the Sudanese that a link with Egypt is in their interests, it may beas well to make clear that in H,M. Governments view there is not the slightest chance of the Sudanese accepting King Farouk as their Kingunless the proposal is qualified by the firmest guarantee on the Egyptianpart to respect the rights of the Sudanese to free self-determina,tlon and, ifsuch be their wish, to ultimate secession from Egypt.    It is also clear thatthis plan cannot be fulfilled unless pro-Egyptian elements in the Sudanco-operate in the all-Sudanese Parliament which is to be set up0    If thecourse of discussions with the Egyptian Government make this desirable,you have authority at the appropriate time to suggest that a commission,upon which the United Kingdom, Egypt, and the Sudan would be represented,should be set up in the Sudan to observe the conduct of the elections to the sudanese Parliament.12. You may also add that H.M. Government would still be glad toco-operate in the establishment of an international authority to supervise thedevelopment of the Nile Waters in the joint interests of Egypt and the Sudanand to work for an international guarantee of the Nile Waters agreement which formed part of H0M. Governments proposals of the 13th October,,H.M, Government would also be willing to consider any other suggestions which the Egyptian Government may put forward to safeguard their interests in the fair exploitation of the waters of the Nile,
13. In conclusion it must be quite clear that sincerely as H.MeGovernment wish for agreement with Egypt on the future of the Sudan8 theyneither can nor will make a bargain with Egypt over the heads of the sudanese, in return for strategic concessions in the Canal Zone,H.M. Government are not predisposed against any settlement of the relationship between Egypt and the Sudan provided that it represents thewishes of the majority of the Sudanese, but in their view it is for the egyptians to secure the necessary support for their policies among the sudanese people,,
