Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1952Copy No. 0.3CABINETSTEEL ECONOMYNote by the Minister of Housing and Local government at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 12th February I was asked to report what progress had been made in securing greater economy in the use of steel in building(C.C. (52) 16th Conclusions, Minute 7). This is being handled by the Sub-Committee on Steel Economy, which is a Sub-Committee of the BuildingCommittee, of which I am Chairman. I attach herewith a report on their work.The Sub-Committee, which is under the Chairmanship of Mr. Seal, deputy secretary, Ministry of Works, has two permanent members nominated respectivelyby the Ministry of Supply and the Iron and Steel Federation. They are receiving the assistance of Dr. Lea, Head of the Building Research Station of the Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial Research, who has recently been assisting themain Building Committee, and they co-opt such other experts as.are necessary forthe particular subject under study.They say that, provided adequate supplies of reinforcing rod and high tensilesteel wire are available, there is great scope for economy in steel by the encourage-ment of reinforced and pre-stressed concrete. Steps are already being taken bythe Ministry of Supply to increase the supplies of these materials. The shortageof designers and builders capable of the high standard of work, called for limits the use of these methods.The allowable safety factors in structural steel were reduced during the war,and the saving thus permitted has been continued since. It is technically possibleto secure further economies; but complicated methods of design are involved, and again we are limited by shortage of trained staff. It is also probable that manyfloors are built to carry greater weights than could possibly come upon them.What is needed is a steady pressure on those who design buildings to economisein steel, and the extended use of methods of computing stresses which take accountof modern knowledge, and which the average designer can understand and safelyapply. Some of these modern methods may involve a relaxation in the buildingby-laws: where this is shown to be desirable we shall not hesitate torecommend it.All these matters are under consideration by the Committee, and they hope to make a further report soon.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,14//? February, 1952.SUB-COMMITTEE ON STEEL ECONOMYReport by the chairman, Membership and Terms of ReferenceMr. Stanes of the Ministry of Supply and Mr. Kavanagh of the Iron and steel federation have been appointed as members. We have no other permanent mem-bers, the policy being to co-opt others as necessary for the purpose in hand. TheTerms of Reference we take to be &quot; To review all possible measures of economy inthe use of iron and steel of types employed in the building and allied industries.&quot;41865CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 45mh February, 1952
2. Method of Work - (We have held two meetings and reviewed the problem generally. In very general terms we intend to proceed by id) examining existing specifications, Codes of Practice, &amp;c, to ensure that.&apos; full advantage is taken of the properties of modern steel,ib) considering whether by suitable publicity or otherwise, design may not be influenced to secure greater economies,(c) considering what action should be taken to divert steel supplies to products and forms ie.g., cold-rolled sections) which use steel most economically,id) publicity to secure the greater use of those products and methods known tobe economical.For the purpose of examining the work being put in hand by the nationalised industries, the Fighting Services and the Ministry of Education, we think it best tojoin forces with the main Sub-Committee on Economy in Building Materials. as you will see from the report put forward by that Committee, approaches are beingmade to the Service Ministries and the Ministries of Fuel and Power and Education.I am therefore associating the Steel Economy Sub-Committee with those approaches.3. At our last meeting we considered the use Of steel and cast iron for housingboth for structural purposes and for fitments such as cookers, stoves, &amp;c. Theamount of structural steel in a house in England and Wales is very small, not more on the average than a hundredweight to a hundredweight and a half, and theMinistry of Housing have taken effective steps to restrict the use of steel in flats,where it nevertheless remains essential for floors. Usage in Scotland appeared tobe considerably higher; this is being looked into. There is also probably some scope for saving of ferrous metal by a greater substitution of steel for cast iron in fitmentsand components.  We are pursuing this matter.I shall report further as the work progresses.Lambeth Bridge House, S.E. 1,6th February, 1952.
