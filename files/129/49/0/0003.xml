irIS- DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS -BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)E C R E T3. (52) 3;opy no. (g V5TH JANUARY, 19523 A bine TCOMMONWEALTH FINANCE MINISTERS MEETINGMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues may like to have a brief note on the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in London.    The conference,which will be preceded by a meeting of officials, opens on Tuesday, 15thanuary,    The United Kingdom Delegation v/ill consist of myself, theSecretary of State for the Colonies, the President of the Board of Trade,the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Minister of State for economic Affairs, and the Parliamentary Secretary, commonwealth relations Office,    We shall be accompanied by the Minister of -finance for Northern Ireland,    With the probable exception of Sir C. Deshmukh(India) all the Finance Ministers of the Commonwealth will be attending,including Mr, Holland, Prime Minister of New Zealand, who is also his country&apos;s Minister of Finance,    In addition, a number of representativesof Colonial Governments are coming to London to act as advisers to theColonial Secretary,2. The task of the Conference will be to stop the drain on the centralgold reserves of the sterling area and to establish a concerted policy to restore the position of sterling and make the sterling area viable.    Ifthe reserves run out the sterling area will dissolve into chaos.    They havenever been really adequate since the war and have dwindled at a mostalarming rate in the last six months,    &quot;We estimate that the sterling area is at present in deficit with the rest of the world at an annual rate ofabout  1,600 millions, a deficit which has led to the loss of nearly 4-0% ofthe gold reserves since June and a change in our European payments union (E.P.U,) position from an accumulated credit.of over  100 millionsat the end of June, 1951, to a debt of nearly  200 millions at the end ofDecember,3, Against this background we intend to go into the discussions withthe following objectives:-(a) To convince the other members that the sterling area is a great advantage to them and that the United Kingdom is able and determined to play its full part as the centre of the area,(b) To secure from each of the other members ah undertaking thatthey will play their part by taking internal and external measuresto right their economies, and so prevent them from being a drainupon the gold reserves and upon United Kingdom resources.(c) To set on foot plans for closer co-operation to strengthen sterling,and to secure more effective relations between the United Kingdomand the sterling Commonwealth on the one hand, and Canada on theother.
(d)    To get a communique which will strengthen confidence in sterling and express hope for and confidence in the future,4. None of these objectives will be easy to attain.    If, forinstance, the United Kingdom is going to make good the objective pro-posed in (a), we must convert a deficit of  570 millions on our overallbalance of payments in 1951 into a surplus in 195Z (taking United state said into account).   I need not enlarge on the unpleasant decisions whichwe are having to take in order to do so but if we fail the reserves will disappear and with them the sterling area and our ability to buy the food and raw materials on which we depend,5. It is our intention, having pointed out the dangers which face the sterling area, to suggest that the conference tackles its task under three main headings:-(i)     The prevention of internal inflationThe strength of sterling depends in the last resort uponthe internal policies of each individual country in the sterling area.    The internal policies of the United Kingdom are the mostimportant,    I intend to explain to my Commonwealth colleaguesvery fully and frankly the measures which we are taking.    Butthe sterling area cannot afford inflation anywhere within it.We must do our best to secure from each Finance Minister afrank exposition of the steps which his own Government aretaking to combat inflation so that we may have the opportunityto assess the extent to which the sum total of these measures will achieve our objective.    This will not be easy because,hitherto, the independent countries of the Commonwealth havebeen acutely suspicious of anything that savoured of intervention in their domestic policies.    But the time is past when we canallow any Commonwealth country to destroy the sterling area by its domestic policies.    It is partly in order to set a good examplethat I and the Secretary of State for the Colonies intend to givea full description of the action we are taking at home and in theColonial Empire,(ii)     Action to right the balance of paymentsThis is not merely a dollar crisis because the sterling area is so heavily in deficit with the rest of the world that,broadly speaking, a deficit with any foreign country costs us gold or dollars.    We intend, therefore, to lay before the conference the proposition that all countries within the sterling area mustwipe out the deficits of their overall balance of payments and thatthis should be done as far as possible by reducing their expendi-ture outside the sterling area.    Thus the area as a whole will achieve at   least a balance, and if possible a surplus, with thenon-sterling world,(iii)     Longer term constructive policy the whole future of the sterling area depends on stopping the drain on the central reserves as quickly as possible.    Butthis in itself will not enable us to face the future with any realconfidence, unless we can agree on a longer term policy designedto secure the viability of the sterling area and enable us toremove the discriminatory practices which are the subject of
such criticism from the United States and Canada.Mr. Abbott, the Canadian Finance Minister, is certain to make this point at the conference.It is unlikely that we will be able to go very deeply intolonger term policy in the time available to us, but we intend tosuggest some heads for discussion, such as the expansion ofthe sterling areaJs earning power, particularly in North America,and measures to stimulate a substantial flow of desirable north american investment within the area.    We can hope to follow upthese questions after the conference.Finally, it is most essential that at the conclusion of the conference weshould be able to issue an effective and hopeful communique which willmake a real contribution to the restoration of confidence in sterling.6. The achievement of these objectives will involve a substantial measure of hardship all round and it can only be done if each Governmentin the sterling Commonwealth is prepared to accept the overridingnecessity of achieving the viability of the sterling area, howeverunpleasant may be the internal political consequences.     Fortunately the sterling area system is of the greatest possible benefit to all its largermembers and we can legitimately assume that all of them will be preparedto accept a substantial measure of sacrifice to ensure its survival.    Itv/ill not be difficult to prove to them that the reserves are now too smallto allow us to survive another crisis as severe as the present one or itspredecessors in 1947 and 1949;  and it will be our task to ensure that themeasures taken are adequate to prevent such a recurrence.7. The United Kingdom Delegation are not despondent about our chances of securing a substantial measure of success in the forthcoming conference, and I hope that at its conclusion we will be able to produce asatisfactory report to our colleagues,R.A.J3 ,Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,5TH JANUARY, 1952.
