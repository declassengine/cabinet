annex report BY THE COMMITTEE ON MALAYAWe were invited by the Cabinet on .28th December, 1951 (C.C. (51)20th Conclusions, Minute 1), to consider in detail the report on Malaya (C. (51) 59)by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. We endorse the recommendations inthis report and draw the attention of the Cabinet to the particular points set out below. Action on many matters of detail within the competence of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies is, we understand, already proceeding.Responsibilities of the High Commissioner2. The Chiefs of Staff and the Commanders-in-Chief, Far East, have agreedthat the High Commissioner must have complete operational control of all theforces in the Federation, and be empowered to issue operational orders to theG.O.C., Malaya, without reference to the Commanders-in-Chief. These must,however, continue to be responsible for the morale, discipline, training and administration of their respective forces. In order to ensure the closest consulta-tion between the High Commissioner and the Commanders-in-Chief (who are, ofcourse, responsible for the whole Far Eastern theatre) it has been agreed that sir G. Templer should be invited to attend all meetings of the British defence -ordination Committee (Far East) at which the internal or external defence of malaya are to be discussed or when he himself expresses a wish to attend.3. We agree with the strong recommendation of the Secretary of State forthe Colonies (paragraphs 44 to 47 of C. (51) 59) that the High Commissioner^responsibility should be confined to the Federation. Although our policy must beto bring Singapore and the Federation into closer union as rapidly as circumstances permit, there would be the most severe reactions both from the Malays in theFederation and the Chinese in Singapore to any attempt to force the pace. Ifthere were weighty practical advantages in putting these two territories under onehead, then the risk of upsetting local opinion might have had to be accepted. Ourview is, on the contrary, that the practical advantages are in favour of a HighCommissioner for the Federation alone. This limitation of the High Commis-sioner&apos;s responsibilities has, on the whole, been received with understanding bythe Press.Federal War Council and cabinet. Although it would be desirable to simplify the complicated pattern ofGovernment in the Federation by amalgamating the Federal War Council withthe Executive Council, it is not possible to press this measure without some regardto local political factors. The new High Commissioner is seized of the importance attached by Ministers to this simplification of the administrative machine. the acting High Commissioner has been informed that General Templer will wish toconsider the possibility of an early merger very soon after his arrival. Theestablishment of an inner &quot;War Cabinet&apos;&apos; (paragraph 49 of C. (51) 59) will ensure that the urgent tasks of the campaign are pressed ahead with resolution and the minimum of delay.Commissioner-General South-East Asia5. The Commissioner-General has a dual responsibility. He answers to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs for the &quot; better co-ordination of measures forthe maintenance and protection of His Majesty&apos;s interest&quot; in the foreign countriesin South-East Asia, and is responsible for advising His Majesty&apos;s Government on general problems of,foreign affairs within his area.. He is specifically charged withconstant watch over the food situation in the area and regional intelligence and information.6. The Commissioner-General is also His Majesty&apos;s principal representative in the Colonial and Protected Territories of South-East Asia (Federation of Malaya,Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei). His published instructions directhim to promote the co-ordination of policy and administration between the Govern-ments in his area of authority. He has no administrative functions in any territoryhowever, though he.can issue directions on &quot;defence matters&quot; to the High Com-missioners arid Governors. His defence advisers are the Commanders-in-Chief,Far East, and he forms with them the British Defence Co-ordination Committee,
JPar East, of which he is Chairman. His present instructions tell him that\Defence &quot; includes all measures necessary for dealing with the Emergency inVlalaya; but the Colonial Secretary is arranging for this arrangement to be ended,since the High Commissioner alone must have full responsibility within the Federartion. It is, however, desirable that the power of direction should be retained forgeneral defence purposes to ensure that all the Colonial Governments in.the areamarch in step in their preparations against aggression,7. We have considered whether there is any real justification for retaining the appointment of Commissioner General. The Foreign Office would wish toretain a &quot; listening post&quot; in Singapore, but do not regard the retention of a high-powered Commissioner-General as essential, and they are concerned at the high cost of the present organisation. It would, however, create an unfortunate impres-sion both in the Far East and elsewhere if at this time we were to take a step whichmight beheld to indicate a lessening of our determination to maintain our positionin the area. We have also taken into account the very great personal prestige andpopularity which Mr. Malcolm MacDonald enjoys in South-East Asia, and the considerable local feeling against his giving up the appointment, together with thegreat assistance that he would be able to give the new High Commissioner andthe new Governor of Singapore. Our conclusion is that there would be advantage in his remaining as Commissioner-General, South-East Asia, for three or four months after the normal expiry of his appointment in May, and that the continua-tion of the post of Commissioner-General, South-East Asia, when Mr. Malcolm Macdonald finally leaves it, should be decided in the light of events nearer thattime. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has undertaken to look into thepresent cost of the Commissioner-General&apos;s organisation, which appears undulyhigh.Police and C.I.D.8. While we do not advocate the immediate amalgamation of the police forcesof the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, since the separate administrations musthave a large measure of control over their own forces, we consider that there mightbe an advantage: since there are many intelligence problems in common in estab-lishing a unified C.I.D. under the Commissioner of Police in the Federation. Thisis essentially a problem to be studied by the authorities in the Federation &apos;and singapore in the first place, but we would urge that, if the practical advantages of amalgamation are seen to be considerable, political considerations should not beallowed to weigh too heavily against the implementation of such a scheme. It is inany case desirable that the closest liaison should be, maintained between the separate C.I.D.S.British Officers for the Malay Regiment (Appendix X of C. (51) 59)9. The present standard of British officers in the Malay Regiment is not satis-factory. Although they receive additional pay the number of volunteers has notbeen sufficient and it has been necessary to post on a compulsory basis. A shortwhile ago special much higher rates of additional pay were approved for volunteers and it is not yet possible to say whether these new rates will prove sufficient induce-ment. We have, however, asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theSecretary of State for War to re-examine the question as a matter of urgency.10. Whether, however, the majority of officers are found on a voluntary or compulsory basis, there must remain the difficulty of providing the number ofofficers needed of the quality which has been asked for. British Regiments andBattalions are already considerably below the strength in regular officers needed forefficiency and can stand no further depletion. A scheme is being examined forattracting ex-Indian Army officers to accept Short Service engagements for the malay Regiment.Tax Evasion11. We have noted the danger that the whole system of taxation for Malayamay be brought into contempt by the widespread evasion of income tax, and wereinforce the request (Appendix XIII of C. (51) 59) that a staff, of qualified expertsshould be sent for a period to Malaya to carry out an investigation of some of themore complex cases, and collect material for exemplary prosecutions, ;
Recommendations Jig12.   We recommend that the Cabinet should give general approval to tllfproposals contained in the report on Malaya by the Secretary of State for theColonies, and in particular should (a) endorse the decision to appoint a High Commissioner with full responsibility.       for both the civil administration and military operations within theFederation;(b) agree that the term of office of the present Commissioner-General, South-East Asia, should be extended for three or four months after he is dueto be relieved in May, but that consideration as to whether he is eventual-ally to be relieved or the post abolished should be deferred for the timebeing;(c) agree that the High Commissioner and the Governor of Singapore should consider the most efficient way of integrating the two police forces andin particular the C.LD.S;(d) take note that the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary ofState for War are considering the proposals for improving the number and standard of British officers in the Malay Regiment, and invite themto submit the result of their consultation to the Minister of Defence;(e) take note that the Secretary of State for the Colonies will be asking theChancellor of the Exchequer to assist the Malayan Governments incombating income tax evasion by the temporary loan of an expertinvestigation staff.
