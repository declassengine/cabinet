1 ITHIS DOCUMENT IS - THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1952SECRET Copy No.   7 311?/? January, 1952CABINETSERVICES ESTIMATES 1952-53Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i. Departmental ProposalsDuring November and December 1951 proposals for defence expenditure inthe three years 1952-55 were worked out by the Service Departments, the Ministryof Defence and the Ministry of Supply on the basis of completing by March 1954that part of the  4,700 million defence programe which it was still possible to carryout within that period together with certain additional requirements for that programme and some of the further measures necessary to enable us to meet our full share of the requirements Of the Medium-Term Defence Plan of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation.2. The resulting financial proposals for the Service Departments for thefinancial year 1952-53 were as follows:    millionAdmiralty.................        402  .War Office     .........    . ...      ...        611Air A^inistry   * - -      -. -      - - -      ;..      ...        5341,547In addition provision of  120 million was proposed for the defence expenditureof the Ministry of Supply and for the Ministry of Defence.3.   The United Kingdom man-power requirements of the forces were:   -1st April, 1952 1st April, 1953Navy       ..........      ...      147,700 146,400Army............     449,100 474,500R.A.F...........&apos;..      270,000 306,000866,800 926,900II.-The Prime Minister^ Note4. The Prime Minister in his Note of 15th December, 1951, stated that thenational economy could not bear so great a burden and asked the Departmentsconcerned to produce modified proposals based on the following reduced pattern of expenditure:  Research and    All other works       Production  Development  Expenditure       Total m.    v         m.  m.  m.  m.Admiralty       ...      ...      14 161 15 140 330War Office      ...      ...     30 200 ... 270 500Air Ministry    ...      ...      85 190 .... 190 465129 551 15 600 1,29541714
25. The Prime Ministers Note also stipulated that expenditure on new works services in the United Kingdom for the purposes of the Investment programme should be limited to a total of  53 million at September 1951 prices (Admiralty 7 million, War Office  11 million and Air Ministry  35 million) and that the totalburden of production programmes on the metal-using industries should not exceed 440 million.6. Proposals in conformity with the Prime Ministers Note were preparedby the Service Departments and discussed at a meeting with the Prime Ministerand the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 20th December. The memoranda sub-mitted by the Service Ministers and the discussion at the Prime Ministers meetingmade it clear that a curtailment of Service Estimates to the extent described inparagraphs 4 and 5 would have produced a drastic set-back to the programme ofrearmament with cancellation of contracts on a considerable scale. The PrimeMinister agreed, therefore, at the conclusion of the meeting, that revised proposals should be worked out in consultation with the Treasury to mitigate the worst effects of the cut and in conformity with the general principles:  (i) that, although it was necessary for economic reasons to delay its com-pletion, it was not intended to cut the rearmament programme;(ii) that we should concentrate on attaining the greatest possible readinessin 1952;(iii) that special regard should be paid to limiting the load on the particularly .difficult sections of the national economy.III. The Revised proposals. In the light of these principles further discussions have taken place between the Departments concerned, as a result of which the following revised proposals have been drawn up: -Research and				Develop-		All other			Production		Works	ment		Expenditure		TotalAdmiralty	175-	75	18 05	15-	25	148	75	357-80War Office	216	00	35 00			271	-50	522-50Air Ministry	191	00	76 00			203	00	470-00	582	-75	129 05	15	-25	623	-25	1,350-308. The provision for works services included above allows for the followingexpenditure on new works in the United Kingdom for the purposes of the Invest-ment Programme in 1952:   m.Admiralty        ...............       6-5War Office       ................      12-air Ministry     ...............      47 0- 65-59. Man-power. The current estimate of the strength of the forces on1st April, 1953, is as follows:  Navy..................      146,400Army..................     457,500R.A.F................     297,500Total...............     901,40010. In order to achieve these figures it is proposed, subject to the PrimeMinister^ approval, to reduce the age of call-up for national service from 18 years months to 18 years. This was the age provided in the National Service Act of1948, although it was subsequently raised as there was at the time a surplus of men available for call-up.11.   No change is contemplated in the age at which men are posted overseas.
12. Production. The reductions in the Service Estimates plus the delays towhich the programme is already subject will make it necessary to regard the dateof completion of the programme as put back on average by at least one year.IV. Recommendation13. The modified proposals described in paragraphs 7-11 above together withcertain other adjustments to the figures result in the following defence budget proposals for 1952-53:    MillionAdmiralty      ...............      357 - 8War Office     ...      ............      522-5Air Ministry   ............      ...      470-0Total    ......      .........    1,350-3SWINTON.XIth January, 1952.
