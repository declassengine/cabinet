(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL.C9(52) 20 COPY NO, (pC-15th  FEBRUARY, 1952 1CABINETPAID HOLIDAYS FOR GOVERNMENT INDUSTRIAL workers memorandum by the Lord President of the council I have been asked by the Home Affairs Committee (H,A, (52) 4thMeeting, Minute 6) to bring before the Cabinet the question of the length ofthe paid holidays of industrial workers in Government establishments,2, The number of these workers (e, g0 in dock yards, Royal OrdnanceFactories, etc,) is some 400,000, of whom a substantial proportion are members of the buildings, engineering, ship-building and electrical trades.For some time now their conditions of employment have included one week of paid holiday a year, in addition to paid leave on the. six bank holidays and on three traditional &quot;privilege&quot; holidays normally allowed at Christmas,Easter and on the King&apos;s Birthday,   (These three extra holidays are reducedto 2-jr in the case of those who work only a five day week).   For some timethe trade unions have been pressing strongly for an additional week of paidholiday.   The Labour Government, though sympathetic to this claim and though they indicated that in principle they accepted it, resisted its immediateapplication because of its adverse effects on production and because a Government concession in this matter might be expected to spreadrapidly.   They also justified their attitude on the ground that the government must follow private practice and that until the autumn of last year only slightly more than 40% of workers outside Government service had two weeks of paid holiday,3. The situation has now changed.   The engineering industry concededthe second week&apos;s holiday in the autumn of 1951 and the miners, though they have not been given the second week in 1952, have been given cashcompensation for its deferment.   The present situation is that outsideGovernment employment some 60% of workers enjoy two weeks of paidholiday and if the miners are included some 65%,   Furthermore, the second week has now spread to all the trades in which the Labour Government wishedto avoid encouraging it.   The claim for Government workers is arbitrable,and though the unions have hitherto been unwilling to test the matter inarbitration, they are in the changed circumstances likely to do so if nooffer is made to them and to gain some concession by it,49 The alternatives open to the Government are the following:-(i)     to refuse to make any offer;(ii)     to concede the claim in full for application in 1952;(iii)     to concede if, for 1953 with or without an offer of cashcompensation for the withholding of it in 1952;
to make a compromise offer of three extra days of paid holiday,on the ground that in private enterprise those workers who already have two weeks of paid holiday normally have only six paidbank holidays in addition, whereas the Government workerswith their &quot;privilege&quot; holidays have 8j or 9 days of paid holidayin addition to the present week.Arguments in favour of some concession are:-That the unions are likely to be able to obtain a concession by arbitration.That industrial relations will be seriously damaged if theGovernment tries to withhold &quot;fair&quot; conditions which obtainfor the majority of workers outside Government employments,That essential recruitment, e, g. of engineering workers for thedefence programme, will be hampered if those same workers can obtain better conditions in non-Government employment,,   Thesettlement reached in the engineering industry last autumnincluded both pay improvements and the second week&apos;s holiday. TheGovernment have adopted the pay improvements for their workersbut have not so far accepted the other half of the settlement.That the long-term effects of conceding a full fortnight of paidholiday are likely to be good rather than bad;  and that evenin the short-term the effects of a concession on production arenot likely to be serious, since many of the workers concernedalready take a second week of holiday without pay.The arguments against any concession are as follows:-In present economic circumstances it is wrong for the Governmentto be handing out improvements in conditions of employment which could have a prejudicial effect on production;  if they doso, the tendency for some members of the public to regard thepresent crisis as unreal will be increased.A move by the Government in this matter is likely to precipitaterapid extension of the second week of paid holidaythroughout industry.   The 35% of workers still entitled only toone week anclude some important trades and particularly the dock workers.   If the dock workers obtain a second weekfsholiday the present overloading of port facilities in the handling of both imports and exports will be seriously aggravated.While production in Government establishments may only be directly reduced so far as the workers at present limit themselvesto one week of actual holiday, the financial cost will amountto an extra week&apos;s wages for everyone.   This will total between two and three million pounds a year.There are in the Post Office 130,000 non-industrial workersentitled to one day of leave per year less than the entitlementwhich the industrial workers will enjoy if they obtain the fullconcession.   These postal workers would have a case for atleast one day more.   To concede this would mean adding 400staff - an addition which would cut seriously into the reductions which the Postmaster-General is expecting to make0
\\J7. The Home Affairs Committee have examined the problem carefully.Most of us felt that the Government should not simply maintain a firmrefusal of the whole claim.   To do so would merely provoke arbitrationproceedings in which the Government would probably lose, andthe resulting damage to industrial relations would adversely affect theattitude of the workers towards other measures (e.g., the dilution of labour)required to increase production.   We also felt that it would be undesirable to offer cash compensation in lieu of the extra holiday in 19 52; this might provoke demands in other quarters for compensation for failure to x*estorevarious pre-war privileges.   We were not so clear as to the other possibilities.   There was some support for an offer of an additional three days of paid holiday.   The Financial Secretary to the Treasury, in particular,urged that this course would be less damaging to the Governments campaign to induce workers to produce more.   Even if the offer were not accepted,it would place the Government in a stronger position in arbitration since,with the three extra days, Government employees would be as well offas the majority of other industrial workers and the &quot;Fair Wages&quot;principle could not be invoked against the Government.   But there was some opinion that such an offer would be unlikely to solve the problem forlong;  that it would be regarded as mean and inadequate, particularly asthe point had never been taken up on behalf ox the Government in any of theprevious protracted negotiations;  and that it wotild be damaging to theGovernment if it were rejected and if a subsequent arbitration resultedin better terms being given,8. In the upshot, though there was some support for the view thatthe full concession should be made forthwith, the balance of opinion in theHome Affairs Committee appeared to favour the view that the Governmentshould offer the full concession for application in 1953; but that theyshould resist its application in 1952, leaving the trade unions to testthe matter in arbitration if they thought fit.   We were advised that thereis some prospect, though by no means a certainty, that the trade unionsmight accept such an offer and refrain from seeking to obtain the concession in arbitration.9. The Home Affairs Committee wished to submit the matter tothe Cabinet accordingly,W.Privy Council Office, S, W.1, ,5TH FEBRUARY, 1952.
