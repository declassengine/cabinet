THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HtS  BRITANNIC  M.V   fY*S  GOVERNMENTUNITED. KINGDOM POLICY ON TRADE WITH EASTERN europe and IMPLICATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES BATTLE ACT(MUTUAL DEFENCE ASSISTANCE CONTROL ACT)1. Trade with Eastern Europe is of great importance to the economic life andtherefore to the defensive strength of the United Kingdom in particular, and also ofother Western European countries. We must export to Eastern Europe in orderto secure essential supplies which, even if they were obtainable at all from other sources, could only be secured by payment of dollars which we cannot afford.There is, however, the danger that our exports to Soviet countries may assist themin building up their war potential. For this reason we have,&apos; in recent years, in common with other N.A.T.O. Powers and Western Germany, operated a systemof security export controls designed to prohibit the export to the Soviet Bloc allitems with significant strategic value and to put a limit on exports of (ess strategicitems. A more detailed note at Appendix A gives the.reasons why we mustmaintain the maximum amount of trade consistent with security and explains how the Security Export Controls operate. Appendix B shows the internationallyagreed criteria for selecting the goods to be included on the prohibited or restrictedlists.China is subject to the same general rules but is treated more severely.Ministers have already approved the policy in regard to China (E.A. (51) 9).    &apos;2. The United States, who have little or no need to rely on imports fromSoviet countries, operate a wider range of restrictions on exports than any of theother NATO, countries except, possibly, Canada, and there has been continuedUnited States pressure on ourselves and Western Europe to extend the scope ofthe international security controls. Hitherto they have done this by negotiatiqn,through the medium of the International Co-ordinating Group on Security ExportControls in Paris, but Congress have now passed new legislation the Battle Act which provides for more stringent export controls as a condition of United states military or economic aid. We and the French lodged a formal protest againstthe Battle Act even before it was.passed because it was inconsistent with the prin-ciple of co-operation on which the common defence effort has been built up.3. The Battle Act classifies, in three categories, the goods which the UnitedStates authorities consider to have strategic importance. In the case of the firstcategory. (goods listed as arms, ammunition and implements of war, includingatomic energy items) the prohibition of exports is absolute; there is no discretion to permit exceptions. Exports of goods in the second category (items useful in theproduction of arms) may be permitted without incurring forfeiture of aid wherethe President approves. The United States Government have promised to consult the Co-ordinating Committee of the Paris Group about such exceptions, but theywill not necessarily accept its advice. In the third category are items (of whichthe most important to us are rubber and tin) for which United States approval of export quotas is required.4. The Security Export Controls&apos; Working Party have compared the listsdrawn up under the Battle Act with the lists of items at present &quot;embargoed orrestricted under the system of controls agreed internationally by the Paris Group.Over a wide field the two sets of lists are in line but there are some significantdifferences; the Battle Act Lists contain a number of.items which were differentlyclassified by the Paris Group. These are set out in Appendix C. The UnitedKingdom is required to state by 24th January, 1952, what steps it is taking to prohibit exports of those goods for which the Battle Act prescribes embargo.5. It is important to note that the lists of goods to be embargoed or restrictedare not included in the Battle Act itself. They have been drawn up by the american administration as representing their interpretation of the definitions of strategic goods covered by the Act. Further, complete lists have not yet been published in the United States, although abridged lists, giving genera! headings, have beenmade public. If, therefore, the United States Administration could be induced tomodify their lists and/or their proposed procedures, to comply with the secret
internationally agreed formula (Appendix B), it would be possible to comply.withthe terms of the Act without any significant extension of our own controls.    ...6. There are strong reasons why an. effort should be made to secure modifi-cations of the United States lists or procedures. The present international formula(Appendix B) was accepted by the United States in common with the other western countries, as correctly describing the appropriate scope of security controls. Theadditional items under the Battle Act do not comply with these criteria; they are&apos;all dual purpose goods, admittedly haying a greater or lesser strategic value butessential to the normal peacetime life and industrial activity of a modern State; thecomplete embargo of them would be tantamount to a limited form of economic warfare. It would interfere further with our trade with Eastern Europe and might,through reduction of essential imports, result on balance in damage to our own economic and defensive strength. Moreover,&apos; such a departure from the principlesagreed, by the Paris Group would tend to undermine that organisation and to destroy the.principle of international co-operation on security controls. There isthe further objection that the United States Government may add to the lists orreclassify items on them and, having once yielded on principle, we should hardly be able to resist any pieces...:&apos;&apos; encroachments which might be dictated by changes of United States policy .jr political pressure. &quot;.7. Apart from tbxi difficulties caused by the United States extension of thescope of the controls a serious problem is likely to arise under the Battle Actin fixing the permittee quantities of those exports which are restricted but notprohibited. Under the i-aris Group machinery export limits for each item are agreed in negotiation, but the final decision in a particular case rests with the exporting country. Under the proposed United States procedure, if strictly applied,the final decision as to the limits of exports of each commodity would rest withWashington and any excess exports would involve cessation of aid. This would be particularly serious to the United Kingdom when applied to materials such asrubber and tin, the exports of which are vitally important to our economic well-being. We already limit exports of rubber to the Soviet Bloc but it is essential thatwe, and not the United States, should have final responsibility for deciding towhat extent we can afford to limit such crucial exports without damage to our economic strength. .Conclusions.8. In these circumstances we suggest that the United Kingdom attitude to theUnited States proposals under the Battle Act should be as follows: -(1) We should adhere to the principles agreed by the Paris Group and encourage the other member countries to do likewise;(2) Whilst continuing to point out that this Act is inconsistent with theN.A.T.O. partnership concept, we should endeavour to secure theagreement of the United States Government to administering the Actin a manner consistent with the Paris Group&apos;s principles and procedures.If the above line succeeds no further report to Ministers will be required. If it failswe shall be faced with a dilemma: either we shall have to sacrifice our principles and an important part of our trade or we shall have to face the prospect of losingour United States aid.9. It is considered that as a first step we should consult the other nations which are members of the Paris Group; as a second step we should have a fullmeeting of the Group, including the Americans, in time to reach agreed views before the 24th January, i.e., the operative date of the Battle Act. The French,Norwegians and Dutch have already consulted us and arc in general agreementwith this suggestion.Recommendations10.  It is recommended that Ministers be invited (1) to endorse the existing general policy on trade with Eastern Europe setout in Appendix A of this paper;.(2) to authorise the action set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 above.27th December, 1951
TRADE WITH EASTERN EUROPE AND CHINAGeneral1. After the war the Western Allies hoped that the normal pattern of western europe&apos;s trade with Eastern Europe could gradually be restored, but from. 1947onwards Soviet policy forced on the West measures of control of strategic goods inorder, to limit the growth of their war potential. Controls had later to be appliedto trade with China as a result of events in Korea. In framing the controls, were recognised that even a complete stoppage of trade would not destroy the powerof the Communists to wage war. It would, however, mean economic warfare andwould aggravate international tension. Moreover, it would do serious damage tothe economies of Western Europe. In considering what controls to apply there is a natural divergence of approach between the United States and other western countries. The United States does not need to trade with Communist countries,but Western Europe must if it is to become viable. -United Kingdom trade . Most of our imports (roughly two-thirds) from the Soviet countries inEurope consist of essential raw materials. In 1950 we got from them about one-fifth of our imports of softwood, one-third of our imports of coarse grain andone-tenth of. our total bacon ration. The only other possible source is north america; but this is doubtful, and in any case we have not got the dollars.3. Security controls and the increased demands of rearmament have caused a sharp decline in our exports and a sharper decline in the amount of new orders from Soviet countries. This is inevitable for security reasons, but as a matter of economics we should do all we can to maintain our exports, both to pay for essential imports and to keep a foothold in this potentially huge market. Any further restrictions on United Kingdom exports would imperil our essential supplies.4. In the present situation we have to rely to an increasing extent on exportsof raw materials from the Sterling Area to pay for our imports., but even so the sterling Area is now heavily in deficit with Eastern Europe. The principal items are rubber from Malaya and wool from Australia and New Zealand. Exports of rubber to Russia are worth about  25-30 million a year as against  40 million forour imports of grain and timber. We are limiting Russia&apos;s imports of Malayanrubber to the 1950 level of 80,000 tons a year, which we consider about representsher present consumption. Actual shipments in 1951 will be some 70.000 tons,from Malaya and probably about 10,000 tons from other sources. This compares with 100,000 tons in 1948 and 105,000 tons in 1949, out of which she is believed(consumption then having been lower) to have set aside enough for a substantialstockpile. Limits have also been applied to the satellites in Europe. No rubberis now exported to China from the United Kingdom or Colonies. The Russiansinsisted on having a clause in the recent timber and grain contracts with the UnitedKingdom entitling them, to cease or decrease deliveries if they were not able to spend the sterling proceeds on rubber. Any serious cut in our rubber exports would almost certainly be followed by Russian counter-measures and might in the longterm also have serious consequences for Malayan producers.5. Apart from these commercial considerations, any drastic change in the pattern of trade might well mean forfeiting the substantial debt repayments whichthe United Kingdom are getting from some Communist countries.Commonwealth Trade6. The other independent Commonwealth countries do not rely on Com-munist countries for vital imports. The Soviet bloc is, however, an important buyerof wool from Australia and New Zealand and of cotton and jute from Pakistan.7. Ariy proposal to stop this trade would create difficulties for these countries and it is doubtful whether they would co-operate. In addition India and Pakistanare opposed, on the ground of their non-alignment policy, to the restriction of tradewith Communist countries, while Ceylon has so far declined to prohibit the exportof rubber to China though&apos;so far only one shipment has gone. Ceylon does not xporfpubber to Russia.&apos;&quot;
8. Apart from rubber mentioned above, the only substantial trade betweenthe Colonies and the Soviet countries is that between Hong Kong and China. Thegreater part of the free world&apos;s trade with China passes through the Colony and hong Kong depends in a large measure.for its commercial existence on this tradeand, for its subsistence, on certain food supplies from that country. Malaya hasa minor trade with China.Security Controls . /9. The export of arms, ammunition and atomic energy materials to Com-&quot;munist countries in Eastern Europe is prohibited by the Western Allies; also nearly300 other items of primary strategic importance.10. Since she came under Communist domination similar controls were applied against Communist China; these have been intensified since the Chineseintervention in Korea. There is an embargo on a very wide range of exports fromthe United Kingdom and Colonies, including Hong Kong, and export control over-all United Kingdom exports to China.11. The controls are co-ordinated through an informal organisation knownas the Paris Group [i.e., N.A.T.O. Powers plus Western Germany). The Coloniesoperate virtually the same controls as the United Kingdom. The independent commonwealth countries are kept informed and in general follow the same policy,except the three Asian members, though in practice they do not normally exportstrategic goods to Communist countries. Sweden and Switzerland co-operate butdo not wish to be identified with the Group.Current Problems12. There has been continual United States Congressional pressure to increaserestrictions and extend strategic controls into what we regard as the domain ofeconomic warfare. Under the so-called Battle Act, recently signed, the UnitedStates Administration have power to cut off all military and economic assistance to countries whose strategic export control policies do not conform to their require-ments. Although the Act allows the President a measure of discretion and is to be administered by Mr. A. Harriman, who is well aware of the importance to western europe of trade with the Soviet bloc, it does provide the United States with a powerful instrument of coercion and there is likely to be strong Congressionalpressure on the Administration to use it as such.13. Because of the difference between our respective controls, the United Statestend to investigate our trade with the Soviet bloc in particular goods beforesupplying similar items to us, even when these are for our defence programme.Moreover, the United States reduce our dollar earnings by restricting their ownimports of goods, e.g., furs from the Soviet bloc and China via the United kingdom or Colonies. Because of Hong Kong&apos;s close ties with China, the United Statesaction in this field has been particularly severe against the Colony.14. Another question likely to arise shortly is possible United Nations actionto impose additional sanctions against China if full-scale fighting is resumed in korea. The United States has already asked us to consider imposing more severemeasures in those circumstances. Recommendations will shortly be made to theEconomic Policy Committee.Talking Points15. The United. Kingdom can take credit for much of the initiative in evolvingthe present system of controls, and in forming the co-ordinating organisation inParis. We have gone further than most of the European members of the Groupby introducing control over the transhipment of the more important strategic goodsin United Kingdom ports. The list of goods we embargo covers 95 per cent, ofthose on the United States list of articles of &quot;primary strategic importance.&quot;Economically no nation has more at stake than the United Kingdom, both in europe and the Far East, but our performance has exceeded that of our European fellowmembers.Conclusion16.: Within the limits imposed by security controls it is in our interest tocontinue to trade with the Communists.  We are already restricting exports of
strategic goods as far as we can. To go further would damage our own economicand defensive strength through loss of essential supplies and incur the risks involvedin full economic warfare.Appendix extract FROM LONDON TRIPARTITE TALKS (1950)Criteria for the Three Categories of control in selecting additional items for inclusion in the three categories, experts shouldbe guided by the following criteria:  (i) Items for Embargo [List I) -(a) Items which are designed or used principally for the production and/ordevelopment of arms, ammunition and implements of war.(b) Items which would contribute significantly to the war potential ofthe Soviet Bloc where the items incorporate advanced technologyor unique technological know-how. This applies only to goodssufficiently important to the war potential of the Soviet Bloc thatthe absence of an embargo would permit a significant advance in soviet Bloc technology over its present level of development.(c) Items which would contribute significantly to the war potential of theSoviet Bloc in that the items, if embargoed, would maintain orcreate a critical deficiency in the war potential of the Soviet Bloc.(ii) Items for Quantitative Control (List II)Items which are highly important from the point of view of their contri-bution to the war potential of the Soviet Bloc and of which thehigh strategic character is directly related to the quantitative extentto which they may be exported to the Soviet Bloc.(iii) Items for Exchange of InformationItems of potential strategic significance for which information presentlyavailable on the Soviet Bloc needs is insufficient to establish clearly the necessity for control on types indicated.The words &quot; war potential&quot; used in the above criteria should be interpreted as meaning the following. War potential is to be viewed from both the short term and the long term aspects. It includes (a) items of direct military application. Itmay also include, amongst others, sejected items which represent (b) sectors ofindustry in which strategic and industrial interests are very closely mingled and where the items concerned can easily and quickly be turned over from peacefuluses to the manufacture of war equipment or other direct military application; and(c) other industrial fields which serve to support the basic economy of a countryand which therefore support either a peace-time or a war-time economy.As a general guide it will probably be found that (a) and (b) in the previous paragraph apply to items for embargo, that (b) and (c) apply to items for quantitativecontrol, and that (c) applies to items for exchange of information.* * * *Appendix CRESTRICTED ITEMS UNDER THE BATTLE ACT1. Title I, Category A of the Battle Act (Mutual Defence Assistance ControlAct) consists entirely of munitions and atomic energy items. From a preliminary examination we are reasonably satisfied that we are not, in fact, exporting any goodson this list to the Soviet Bloc or China; but some of the headings are so wide andso loosely phrased that it is not possible to guarantee complete coverage. this problem should, however, be capable of being settled in discussion with the UnitedStates authorities.2. Title I, Category B of the Act (the Primary or Embargo List) contains eightitems which are neither on International List I. nor controlled by the United King-dom as munitions or atomic energy items.
.   (a) The following items have been rejected for embargo by the Paris Group:  Aluminium (primary and some secondary forms).General service locomotives.Heavy rails.Block signalling systems.Chlorofluoromethanes. ,Rare earth metals and their compounds, mixtures and products (withcertain exclusions).All these except the last are on International List II; the first 4 were on theUnited States List 1a. The reason now advanced by the Americans for controlling the last two items is that they have important atomic energy uses.(b) The following items are not controlled but the practicability of controllingthem on atomic energy grounds is currently under discussion:  Electrolytic cells for the production of fluorine.Fluorimeters of certain kinds.(c) In the following cases the definitions of the items given in Title I, CategoryB are wider than the corresponding definitions hitherto adopted for purposes ofUnited Kingdom controls.Centrifuges of certain types.Turbo-blowers of certain types.Refractory materials of certain types.Photo-multiplier tubes and specialised parts therefor and any electronmultiplier unit activated by positive ions.Radiation detection instruments of certain types and components thereof.id) The definitions of some munitions items in Title I, Category B are wider than the corresponding definitions adopted for the purpose of United Kingdomcontrols.3. The secondary or quantitative control list (Title II) contains five items and part of a sixth which are on International List III and two items which the paris group has refused to accept at all.These are:  Road and airport machinery. \Railway freight cars.Components for freight cars.   I -y^ jjjTin.Natural rubber.Small types of excavators.      /Coal cutters.Combination coal cutting and loading devices.   Not listed.All these items except natural rubber are taken from the United States List 1a.
