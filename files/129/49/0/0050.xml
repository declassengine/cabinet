THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. February 1952SECRET Copy No.C. (52) 5020th February, 1952CABINETSUPPLY OF ARMS TO INDIA AND PAKISTANNote by the Prime Minister and Minister of defence i circulate for consideration by the Cabinet a minute of mine about the supplyof arms to India and Pakistan and the memorandum prepared in reply to it.W. S. c.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,20th February, 1952.Prime Minister to Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Defence, and ChiefStaff Officer of the Minister of Defence : Minute of 26th December, 1951It must be remembered that these two countries may go to War with one another and that is the only object for which they seek arms. Unfair favour was shown to India in the arrangements made at the time of partition and the balancemight be slightly redressed in favour of Pakistan. On the other hand we placeourselves in a very questionable position by arming both sides with no other objectthan long-term advantages of keeping up the United Kingdom manufacturingpotentials. For instance, forty-two bombers for Pakistan raises the query &quot;whoare they going to bomb?&quot; Obviously the cities of India. This involves us in seriousresponsibility. We are like an arms merchant supplying both sides in a possiblyimpending struggle. There is of course this difference, that we do not get paidanything. All that happens is that the amounts are marked off the so-called&quot; sterling balances.&quot; It would seem that these issues should be brought beforethe Cabinet after we are again united on our return from the United States.(Intld.)        W. S. C.26th December, 1951.41879a
SUPPLY OF EQUIPMENT TO INDIA AND PAKISTAN1. India and Pakistan still look to the United Kingdom for their requirementsof defence equipment, but in recent years we have had very little to offer andrepresentations for increased supplies have frequently been made at high level.On 25th August,&quot;195.1, the late Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan wrote to Mr. Attlee for helpin meeting Pakistani.most, urgent requirements. No reply has yet been sent to his letter. The whole problem of supplies to both India and Pakistan has been examined and the results of this examination are set out below.Policy hitherto followed2. The demands of India and Pakistan for defence equipment have been given a lower priority than those of the old Commonwealth countries, N.A.T.O. countries and other foreign countries with which we have firm defence agreements (e.g., Jor-dan and Iraq). They have, however, usually been given preference.over the demandsof other foreign countries. Special attention has been paid to maintaining broadparity of treatment between India and Pakistan, bearing in mind that India has agreater capacity to produce for herself and that she inherited all the ordnance fac-tpries existing at the time of transfer of power.3. This policy is based on the fact that we have no defence agreement with either India or Pakistan: the effect of the policy has been that neither country isnow receiving any appreciable quantities of United Kingdom military equipment,and that any which can be released is surplus and mostly obsolescent.Issues already made or promised4.  The more important issues in recent years have been:  Pakistan :--3 destroyers (2 in 1949 and 1 in 19.51).14 Attacker jet aircraft.24 Sea Fury aircraft.10 serviceable   &quot;1 obsolescent Tempest aircraft being issued by Far6 unserviceable j       East Air Force.India: 3 destroyers (in 1949).39 Vampire aircraft.20 Vampire airframes and engines for assembly in India.12 unserviceable Tempest aircraft.The following have been promised:  Pakistan: 22 Attacker jet aircraft (in process of delivery).18 Sea Fury aircraft (deliveries set back to meet Admiralty require-ments). *13 serviceable obsolescent Tempest aircraft.India: 3 frigates (recently offered on loan).In addition 10 Seafire aircraft (the naval version of the Spitfire) havebeen offered to India. This should not, however, be considered&quot; as a firm promise, as the Admiralty regard them as reserve air-craft. They should only be issued to India when they are nolonger required by the Admiralty.Further requirements and prospects of supply5. The unsatisfied requirements of both countries are very considerable.They include certain items mentioned above as promised but not yet delivered.&apos; ,6. The prospects of meeting the additional requirements are very poor. Wemay be able- to let Pakistan have  If million worth of Army equipment by March1953, and India about  j million worth, but supplies will be confined to a few itemsand will be unbalanced. The only important demands we could meet are Lincolnbombers for Pakistan (in 1954-55, by which time they will be surplus to United41879* -
Kingdom requirements) and Spitfire photographic reconnaissance aircraft for India.It is proposed that five Spitfires should be supplied to India and that a limited num-ber of Lincolns should be promised to Pakistan. It is considered that Pakistandoes not really need as many as 42 Lincolns and that the precise number should beleft over for discussion nearer the time of issue.Future Policy7.  Under the policy followed hitherto there is little prospect of our being .able to supply either India or Pakistan with much specialised military equipmentduring the next two years.  After that we may be able to provide rather, more,mainly of obsolescent types becoming surplus as new types are produced.8. There are of course objections to a policy of limiting supplies in this way,on the grounds that it may well result in driving both countries to other sources.It is known that both India and Pakistan are already negotiating with the UnitedStates, European countries and Canada. This may mean the loss of a valuablelong-term export market which also, helps to maintain United Kingdom war poteh- jtial. On the other hand, it would be difficult to justify any relaxation, as supplies from the United Kingdom at present could not be increased except at the expenseof our own requirements or those of old Commonwealth or N.A.T.O. countries.The Arms Working Party could, however, Continue to examine demands on their merits and recommend to Ministers the acceptance of commitments which do not. interfere significantly with the requirements of the United Kingdom or of otherpriority countries, provided that such interference can be regarded as more than offset by the advantages to be gained.9. It is of the utmost importance from, both the political and strategicalpoints of view that we should retain the goodwill of both countries. The loss oftheir goodwill might lead to interference with existing air transit rights in both countries and the prevention of Gurkha recruitment by India.11. It is our long-term objective to build up India and Pakistan as bulwarksagainst Communism and to obtain their assistance in the defence of South-east asia and the Persian Gulf. Pakistan have already given some indication of havingthe intention to co-operate with us in war, though possibly not at the outset. Ifwe lose their goodwill we shall certainly not achieve any of these long-termobjectives.12. There is admittedly a risk that any arms we supply may be used by Indiaand Pakistan in fighting each other, but the quantities we are likely to be able tosupply in the immediate future are unlikely to be large enough to affect the issuematerially. A complete stoppage of supplies would tend to operate to the advantageof India as against Pakistan to an even greater extent than the present policy. both countries have legitimate reasons for requiring equipment for their own internal and frontier defence commitments as well as to protect themselves against aggres-sion from outside the Indian Continent. Their armed forces were equipped with british types of equipment at the time of partition and they naturally look to usto continue to supply them at least with what they need for maintenance, replace-ment and training.&apos; A refusal to continue supplies would not prevent them fromobtaining at any rate some of their requirements from elsewhere. This would almost certainly be from outside the sterling area and would thus impose a furtherstrain on the foreign currency reserves of the sterling area as a whole.Recommendations13. In view of the considerations set out above it is recommended that theCabinet should (a) endorse the policy which has been followed hitherto and is set out inparagraph 2, subject to reconsideration if and when either India orPakistan is prepared to enter into a defence agreement with the United .Kingdom;(b) approve the issue of a limited number of Lincoln bombers to Pakistan (in1954-55), subject to the precise number being settled nearer the time of issue, and 5 Spitfire Photographic Reconnaissance aircraft to India(paragraph 6);(c) agree that a reply should be sent to the Pakistan Prime Minister informing him of the items which can be supplied and explaining why we cannotsupply any more at present.  -
