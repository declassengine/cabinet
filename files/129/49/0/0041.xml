CONFIDENTIALCe(52) 41 . COPY NO. JD15TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETGERMAN CONTRIBUTION TO WESTERN defence memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe German contribution to Western defence is the counterpartof the new Contractual Agreement between Germany and the threeOccupying Powers, to which I drew my colleagues attention in my memorandum C. (52) 31 of 8th February.Paris Conference on the Establishment of a European Defence Community2, Owing to French opposition to any direct national German con-tribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.), it wasagreed at the North Atlantic Council meeting in Brussels in December,1950, that a German contribution should be made through a european army on the understanding that certain conditions would be fulfilled.The chief of these were that the European Army must:(a) strengthen the integrated defence of the North atlantic area;(b) be integrated into the N.A.T.O, framework; and(c) promote the closer association of the countries of western europe and tie Western Germany more firmly to the West.3, The North Atlantic Council at Lisbon will have to decide whether the plan for the European Defence Community produced by the paris Conference fulfils these conditions and provides an effectiveGerman defence contribution.    The military effectiveness of the Parisproposals has been examined in Washington by the Standing Group andthe Military Representatives Committee on the basis of a report fromSHAPE.   Their conclusion is that, provided flexibility is maintained incarrying it out, the plan is militarily acceptable and provides the best and most rapid means of achieving a German defence contribution.4. The long-term aim of the European Defence Community is topave the way for a European federation.    Our policy is to welcome this and similar plans of a supranational European character, provided theEuropean Community thus constituted forms part of a wider atlantic community.Relations between the European Defence Community and N.A.T.O.5. The proposals for regulating the relations between the european defence Community and N.A.T.O. are as follows:-(a)    The European Defence Forces will be placed under the command of SACEUR and will thus in practice be controlled by theNorth Atlantic Council.    ... ...
(b) The casus foederis for both organisations will be made thesame by a protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty and byarticles in the European Defence Community Treaty whichwill provide that an attack upon one will be regarded as anattack upon the other.    This involves no new commitment for the United Kingdom.    We are already bound by theNorth Atlantic Treaty to five of the European defence community members.    To the sixth, Germany, we gave inSeptember, 1950, in conjunction with the United States andFrench Governments, a unilateral guarantee.    The effectof the present proposal is to spread the load of that guarantee to the other N.A.T.00 Governments and to obtain from germany reciprocal undertaking.(c) The two organisations will be linked by -(i)  reciprocal consultation between the North atlantic council and the European Defence Community Counciland joint meetings of the two Councils;(ii)  close co-ordination at the technical level between members of the staffs of the civilian agencies ofN.A.T.O. and the European Defence Community;(iii) as soon as the European Defence Forces have beenplaced under the command of the Supreme allied commander, Europe, the presence of officers of theEuropean Defence Forces as members of his own andsubordinate Headquarters,The position of Germany6, The relationship between N.A.T.O, and the European defence community is complicated by the position of Germany which though an equal member of the European Defence Community has not yet been admitted to N.A.T.O.   The presence of German representatives at jointmeetings between the North Atlantic Council and the European defence community Council and the close liaison which is to be established between the civilian and military agencies of both organisations will, ineffect, be the first step towards German membership of N.A.T.O,German admission to N.A.T.O. is the logical consequence of a german contribution to European defence, and is therefore inevitable, in the longrun, and indeed desirable, because a rearmed Germany will be easier tocontrol in a body where the United States and United Kingdom are represented.    Sooner or later the Germans themselves will press for it,and, once they are making an effective defence contribution, their claim should be admitted.On the other hand, there are -various reasons for not pressingGerman membership at this moment:-(a)    There would be strong opposition in France.    French publicopinion will only accept German rearmament with thegreatest misgivings, and if we are to lead it forward to german membership of N.A.T.O. we must do so gently stepby step.-Z-
(b) German opinion may also need time, after the Federal Republic&apos;sentry into the European Defence Community, to prepare itself forthe further step of membership of N.A.T..O.   Suchmembership will appear to many Germans to pose evenmore acutely the apparent choice between integrationwith the West and the reunification of Germany.(c) The Russians likewise would probably regard the FederalRepublics membership of N.A.T.O. as a more decisivestep than her entry into the European Defence Communitytowards the breakdown of the quadripartite system inGermany (including Berlin, where our vulnerable positionwould become increasingly more exposed) and towards the mobilisation of West German resources in the service of american aggressive aims.    There would be advantage inour allowing the Russians, too, time to accustom themselvesto the first step before discussing the second.(d) Once Germany joined N.A.T.O., our troops would have to be inthe Federal Republic on normal N.A.T.O. terms.    We should stand far less chance than at present of securing the special facilities and the very-important financial support( 150 millions in 1952-53) which we hope to obtain underthe present arrangements.A .E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,15TH FEBRUARY, 1952.
