I regret that I should have to ask you to discuss these important matters at such short notice.    The reason for the urgency is explained in the summary.3.

ANNEX ABATTLE ACT AND RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTSTO THE SOVIET BLOCMinute by Mr. Berthoud to the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs as leader of the United Kingdom Delegation set up for the talks with our associates in the Paris Group (including the Americans) I submitour Report written in Paris yesterday.    The reason for haste is that the paris Group has been reconvened on 21st January to hear the views of governments on the three reserved points.    This meeting cannot be delayed because the Battle Act comes into force on 24th January,    the americans are responsible for this unfortunate last minute rush as theypostponed discussion in Paris.    The general picture which emerged inParis is as follows:-2. The Cabinet instructions were broadly:-(1)    To get the United Kingdom views over to the Americans with thesupport of our European associates, without damage to Anglo/American relations.    In this we were successful,(2)    On a rigid interpretation of the instructions, to get the americans to give assurances that Battle Act sanctions (withdrawal of aid)would not be applied against any country which adhered to theexisting Paris Group &quot;principles and policies&quot;,,    This wouldbe equivalent to a rubber stamping by the Administrator of theAct of the actions of the Paris Group members who have con-side rable latitude to make their own exceptions to the rules.We were not successful in this, mainly because the Americansclaim in the words of their delegate that &quot;the Act does not permit the Administrator to substitute the Paris Group judg-ment for his own judgment&quot;.3. We did, however, get the Americans to say that the Administratorwould consult the Paris Group before imposing sanctions or adding to hislists which at present do not differ much from ours.    This is the intentionof the changes in present procedures proposed by the Americans.    We,therefore, preserved the principle that all these matters would be discussed with the Americans in the Paris Group and not bilaterally by the Americanswith individual members.    This saves face.    Furthermore there was clear recognition by the Americans that final decisions on what should or should not be exported remained reserved to national governments.4, The present American Administration appear genuinely anxious tobe reasonable about all this.    They point out that they did not want the battle Act and that it was as a result of their efforts that the previous much worse Kem Amendment was replaced.    They fear that if we ignore the Act,which is our alternative, Congress will impose worse legislation^5. The strong point against agreeing to any changes at all is that ifwe make them under the threat of the Act, we are to some extent condoningit, and other more difficult concessions may be demanded later, particularly if there is a change in the United States Administration.    As this raises so important a point of principle and policy, the attached Report w ich wasagreed by the Ministry of Defence and Board of Trade representatives onthe Delegation, does not make a firm recommendation.    The position ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government and of all other European partners in this fieldhas been fully reserved on all the changes proposed by the United States.
6. The points on which decisions are required by Ministers are inparagraphs 9-13 and 21 of the Report.    They are:-(i)    Paragraph 9Should we agree to some tightening up of the exceptionsprocedure, involving a greater obligation to discuss with the paris Group (except where this is impracticable) exports ofgoods which we have agreed should be denied, but which are needed to secure essential imports from the Soviet Bloc?This does not raise a new point of principle.(ii)     Paragraph 12Should we hold up exports to the Bloc of strategic -goods which we are committed to supply under existing con-tracts to give the Administration more time to consider themand get authority for the necessary exceptions under the Act?(iii)     Paragraph 13Do we agree to consult the Paris Group beforeexporting some six items which are on the American embargolist but not on ours?    This would be a new obligation,7. Questions (i) and (iii) are linked.    Question (ii) gives rise to administrative difficulties.    Finally paragraph 21 of the Reports needsconsideration.(Signed)  E.A. BERTHOUD17th January, 1952.
SX BBATTLE ACT AND EAST-WEST TRADEReport fry Leader of United Kingdom Delegation to theFereign Secretary^Reference Minutes of the Cabinet Meeting held onJanuary 3rdT 1952*1.     As reported to the Cabinet in C(52)l the United StatesBattle Act provides for stringent restrictions on trade with soviet countries as a condition of U.S* military and economic aid.It appeared that these restrictions were likely to he more stringent than those at present applied by international agreement.2,     The decision of the Cabinet subsequently endorsed by thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, was that at the discussionscontemplated in the Paris G-roup the United Kingdom should, inasspciation with other European member countries, endeavour to persuade the United States Government to administer the BattleAct in a manner consistent with the principles and proceduresalready agreed by the Paris Grotip*3* A U.K, Delegation was formed to carry out these instructions^It consisted of a Foreign Office leader and representatives of theMinistry of Defence and Board of Trade.k-t     The tenor of the Cabinet decision was communicated throughthe diplomatic channel to the Governments of member countries including the United States, in advance of  ho Parismeeting.   Valuable preliminary talks took place with the U.S*and French Delegates.Proceedings in Paris.5,     The Co-ordinating Group met in Paris on January 15th and l6th.The U.K. Delegate made the opening statement.    The text is at annex A.    This received general European support.    The FrenchDelegate strongly objected to any......efforts to apply Americanlegislation to European countries. He and a number of other european delegates emphasised the importance of East-West tradeto their countries.   All European delegates were strongly opposedto/
to any change in the principles and procedures of the Paris55.-s^Group.6*     The U.S. Delegate agreed on the importance of maintaining the Paris Group, out made three suggestions involving modifications of its present principles and procedures which would assistthe Administrator to discharge his legal obligations under theAct, using the machinery of the Group,   For text see Annex B,7e     At the close of the session an agreed summary was prepared.For text see Annex C,    It will he seen that all the european members of the Group reserve their position on the threeU.S* suggestionsoAppreciation.8,     The discussion revealed a remarkable degree of unanimitybetween the European countries      It however quickly became evident that the U.S. delegate was not in a position to undertakethat the Administrator would administer the Act on the basis otdecisions taken by the Paris Group, since he was legally boundto keep the final decisions in his own hands.,     He was howeverprepared to give maximum weight to Paris recommendations and to change existing procedures and policies as little as possible.This led to the three O.S. suggestions mentioned in para, above-which are set out in greater detail in para, h of Annex0.     Our comments on them are:-(a)    Exceptions. Procedure. &apos;9*     Under present Paris Group arrangements, whilst there is ageneral obligation to inform the Group as far as possible beforeexporting items subject to embargo, it is open to each Governmentto make its own decisions first and justify them afterwards.The Americans now propose that it should be mandatory to consult the Group in advance and in detail in all but the most exceptional circumstances.     It is, however, admitted by the Americans that
each country would still be free to take its own decisionafter the consultations,10,   Apart from desiring to limit the number of exceptions, thepurpose of the American suggestion is to enable the U.S,member of the Group to report to the Battle Act Administrator,who can then assess the position and if he does not agree thatan exception is justified can so inform the exporting countrythrough the Paris Group,,     The exporting country when takingits decision would have to have regard to the possible effecton U.S, aid,11,    The American proposal does not involve a basic departure from present Paris Group policies., and preserves the integrity of the Group0     It will, of course, make it more difficult forexporting countries to take decisions on individual cases which might involve cessation of all aid,(b) Suspension of Sblpments ,pf Items on the BattleAct /Embargo. ListSa12,    Lists are being tabled in the Paris Group by all countries of present outstanding obligations to supply goods to theSoviet Bloc which appear on the American Embargo Lists,     Underthe ai.ct, the Administrator must grant a specific exception eachtime such an item is shipped.     The Americans proposed thatthere should be a suspension of such shipments to give timefor consideration in Washington^      The U,S, delegate said thatwhile the decision in the last resort must rest with the /.Administrator, full weight would be given to the nature andexistence of these obligations, and that exceptions wouldprobably be easier than in the case of new commitments.&apos;(c) Control jDf Expjorjjs of Items on the AmericanEmbargo Xi&apos;sT, &quot;*buT&apos;&apos;riot on ours.13,    There are a relatively small number of items which are set out at Annex C of Paper 6(52)1 which are subject only toquantitative control on our lists, but to embargo under the/, a * , ,
Battle Act,     As the Administrator cannot give these itemsspecial treatment on that account, the U.S. delegate proposedthat there should be prior consultation as if they were infact on the Paris Embargo Lists.1h*    It should be pointed out in respect of points (a) and(c) above that the number of cases in which the U.K. are likelyto press for the use of the Exceptions Procedure is small.The items covered at (c) do, however, include transportequipment, locomotives etc., to which we attach importance^15*    The following general points should also be mentioned:(1)    Harmonising of Paris and Battle Act Lists,, etc.There is no American pressure to have identical paris group and American Lists.     We were assured that the administrator, whilst reserving his final decision,would consult the Paris Group before adding or subtractingfrom his present lists.     As mentioned in para. 2 of annex C to this report, efforts will be made to resolvedifferences of definition between the two sets of listsi(2)    Title II Items.The Battle Act provides for the fixation of quantitative limitations on the export of items to belisted under Title II.     Some of these are not already on International List II.      It is proposed that theyshould be the subject of bilateral discussion.      It wasagreed in Paris to await proposals   from the U.S.     TheU.S,,Title II List includes such items as tin and rubber,which are vital for the U.K.(3)   PublicityThe Americans seem anxious to publicise actionstaken under the Battle Act.     We strongly deprecated this idea and were supported by other European countries.   N./.....
Conclusion16.    It was not possible to persuade the U.S. representatives to accept our main contention, namely that they should operate in conformity with the present policies of the Paris Group.It is probably legally impossible for them to do this.     Wehave therefore failed to prevent aid being used to enforceAmerican policy.     The position still is that we risk the total loss of aid if we do anything contrary to the Battle Act,even if we are supported by all the other European members ofthe Paris Group.17.    The U.S. are however prepared to consult the Group eitherabout adding items to embargo lists or about exports requiringexceptions under the Act and to give weight to their views.Their proposed changes to existing Paris Group proceduresare designed to ensure that any matter requiring action bythe administrator under the Act is first discussed by the paris Group.18.   The three U,S. proposals referred to in parajf 9        to 73above preserve intact the multilateral approach and the sovereign right of each country to take its own decisionswhatever the consequences.     They would however restrictfreedom of action by making it much more difficult for usto make our own exceptions, as we must first consult the paris group in all but the most exceptional circumstances.     Itis fair to add that there have not been many occasions in thepast when we have needed to invoke the exceptions procedure.Re cqmme ndati qns19.   Acceptance of the U.S. proposals would probably in the short term incline the U,S. Administration to operate the battle Act in a reasonable way.    If they could be -relied upon to heed the views of the Paris Group, it would thereforeprobably pay us to accept the proposals as there is no/* * * *
Paris,16th January, 1952.prospect of changing the terms of the ^ct itself.     Indeedwe were repeatedly warned by the U,S, delegate that therewas a serious risk of worse legislation,20,   On the other hand, to make any concession now is dangerous because it implies giving way to legislation towhich we object in principle.     We must remember that the americans are likely to suggest limitations in our exportsof tin and rubber.21.   We therefore recommend that if Ministers decide toaccept the U.S. proposals, we should, when notifying the paris Group (which reconvenes on Monday, January 21st.)make clear thatj-(a) we regard the result as unsatisfactory;(b) we keep a free hand on the outstanding question,of restricting exports of Title II commodities,including rubber and tin.The U.K. decision will s3^girfrix influence the other Eurqp&amp;aacountries.
SECRET ANNEX   ASTATEMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM delegate to THE CONSULTATIVE GROUPJanuary 15, 1952We are here to discuss the relationship between thepresent principles and proeedures of the Group and the MutualDefence Assistance . Control Act of 1951, an Act which attachescertain conditions to the continuance   of any aid given bythe United States to friendly countries.     We have all, Ithink, received an Aide Memoire from the United StatesGovernment on this subject, to which we have been asked to reply not later than truth January,     His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfor their part thought it desirable to discuss the problems involved with their partners in the Group, including ofcourse the United States;    and we welcome the presence ofMr. Linder here to-day,2.     Section 101 of the Act declares it to be the policy ofthe United States to embargo certain types of goods to soviet bloc countries, namely arms, ammunition, and implements of war, atomic energy materials, petroleum, transportationmaterials of strategic value, and items of primary strategicsignificance used in the production of arms, ammunition and implements of war.     You will see that there is not one ofthese categories which is not covered by the internationalLists operated by members of this Group, or by the CommonReference List of War Materials, or by controls on atomic energy items.     There is thus a basic similarity between the objectives at which the Act purports to aim and those of this group,     There are, however, some differences between the lists already drawn up by the Administrator and those towhich we collectively subscribe.     Furthermore the Administra-tor of this Act is empowered to make unilateral additions tothe lists.    But perhaps the most serious difficulty is thatrecourse to the exceptions procedures agreed by this Groupafter lengthy consideration and discussion would involve therisk of withdrawal of all U,S, military and economic aid,3.     My Government believe that all members of the Paris group would wish to avoid any action prejudicial to the discharge ofits present important functions.     Its work is an outstandingexample of international cooperation in a field in whichindependent national action cannot be fully effective.   It is essentially a multilateral system and we believe that inmatters concerning the common defence effort, and the securityof the free world, it is essential to preserve the multilateralapproach.     Two conditions are in our view fundamental to the correct discharge by the Group of its present agreed functions:(a) Maintenance of the strategic criteria governing the selection of items for embargo or restriction, unlessrelationships between i^ast and Y/est undergo a change,(b) Preservation of the principles and proceduresgoverning exceptions,Li,     There is, to the best of our knowledge and belief, nothing in the Battle Act which would preclude its being administeredin a manner fully consistent with the principles and procedures of the Group, and^this would   in our view be in the best interests of all of us,5,     I will now refer to the more specific points which arise:( i)   Differences, between lists/Setting
Setting aside atomic energy and munitions items, which are recovered separately, the International Embargo List falls verylittle short of the list of &quot;items of primary strategic importance&quot; under Title I of the Act,   Agreement has alreadybeen reached here to limit the exports of the residual items.We still do not consider that these items come within theexisting criteria for embargo; with one or two exceptions theyhave been exhaustively discussed in this forum and their inclusion in the Battle Act list is not, we think, in itself a reason for changing their classification on the internationallists,(ii)     Exceptions Procedure.The Group has always recognised that rigid enforcement of security export controls is liable in particular cases to defeattheir object, which is to increase the strength of the Westrelative to that of the East, and my Government set great store&quot;by the flexibility which the agreed -procedure for exceptionsprovides.    Each member has the right to export an embargoeditem to the Soviet bloc if, having regard to its strategic importance, it considers this justifiable in order to obtainessential supplies,   Any such relaxation of controls has to he reported to the Group with a statement of the circumstances held to justify it.    The Group is free to comment and to influencefuture action, but the decision in each case rests with the exporting country.    This, in the view of H.M.G., is a point of fundamental importance and we would strongly urge our UnitedStates colleagues to recognise it and. use the exceptionsprocedure provided under the Battle Act in such a way as topermit of its retention.(iii)   Prior 0ommiteorafio ftWhat I have said above about the need to retain scope forexceptions applies, we think a fortiori to the case of PriorCommitments.6. There is another general factor: in any appreciation of theposition of this Group vis-vis the Battle Act, account should,we think, be taken not only of the close coincidence of theInternational Embargo List with the corresponding Battle ActList, and of the existence of the Group1s machinery for makingexceptions in cases of necessity, but also of the wider considerations referredjfco in the Act itself, namely &quot;thespecial contribution&quot; /&quot;of recipients of aid/ &quot;to the mutualsecurity of the free world, the importance of such assistanceto the security of the United States&quot;, and &quot;the strategic importance of imports received from countries of the Soviet bloc&quot;*7. We appreciate that in many ways the Battle Act marks a closer appreciation of the position of the Paris Group than its predecessor, the Kem Amendment, and in particular that there isprovision (as regards Category B of Title I) for consultationwith the Group before the terms of the Act are applied in their full rigour.   We very much hope that this provision, coupled with/
with the President&apos;s power to make exceptions, opens the doorto some arrangement under which the Act can &quot;be administered in a manner fully consistent with the principles and procedures ofthe Group and so as not to infringe the sovereignty of themembers of the Group.8.     It is not for us to suggest how this should be done; weare not the experts on the Battle Act,   We took the initiative in seeking this discussion and in the presence of the UnitedStates Delegation, in order to convince them of the validity of our case for maintaining the principles and procedures of theGroup and to enable them to make proposals for a modus pperandj ;within the limitations I have described,, we shall be ready and willing to examine such proposals,   -
AOSECRET Annex 3*STATEMEN^QF^THE^UNITED STATES delegate to THE CONSULTATIVE GROUPJanuary 157 1952&quot;1.   I deeply appreciate this opportunity to discuss with yousome of the problems of mutual interest which have developed since our meeting here last July.   You will recall, I am sure, my discussion,of the Kern Amendment which had been adopted by the U.S. Congress ashort time before and my emphasis on the political realities which that legislation reflected.    (CG Paper IV, Annex A - July 19, 1951).2.   I mentioned then that the President in. signing the KernAmendment called for more flexible and practicable legislation. Aftermost careful and detailed Congressional consideration the Battle Actwas enacted by Congress.    (The Act is officially entitled the mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951. Public Law 213).3*   This Act reflects the serious concern of the Congress and theAmerican people with the flow of strategic goods to the Soviet $locFurthermore, it provides, we believe, a realistic basis for U.S. parti-cipation in constructive security-control measures in the mutual secu-rity interests of the free nations.   Your governments are alreadyfamiliar with the provisions of the Act.   They were described in some detail in the aide-memoire which was given to your Governments at thetime the initial determinations under the Battle Act were transmitted,y/e are aware that your Governments may have been concerned that the battle Act, by its terms, or in its administration, might jeopardizethe existing multilateral arrangements for dealing with securityexport control problems.   Such a concern is understandable, particul-arly in view of the fact that the time limits set in the legislationnecessitated certain decisions by the Administrator without oppor-tunity for as full consultation with the Co-ordinating Committeecountries as we would have wished.   However, it was not the intentof the legislation, nor is it the intention of the Administrator,to impair multilateral efforts to obtain adequate security controls.On the contrary, one of the major purposes of the legislation is tostrengthen the security control effort through further international
SECRET -   2    -operation.U.   Even though I may &quot;be repeating myself, let me state againthat it is the intent of the United States Government to seek tostrengthen international cooperation in the field of mutual security.United States policy, as expressed in part in the Battle Act, lookstov/ard increased cooperative action in the security control field,not only among the Western European nations receiving United states assistance but among all the freo nations.5.   The United States regards tie Consultative Group structureas the appropriate forum in which to discuss problems relating tothe control of strategic exports from our countries to the soviet bloc and we shall take into full account   existing or future Co-ordinating Committee arrangements.   In making the initial deter-determinations as to the list of commodities of primary strategic sig-nificance which should.be subject to embargo, the Administratorhas, with only a few changes, adopted International List 1, the arms categories generally covered by a Coordinating Committee agree-ment, and the atomic energy categories already agreed by your indi-vidual Governments for embargo to the Soviet Bloc.    This was a clear recognition of the careful and effective work done by theCoordinating Committee in developing its lists of strategiccommodities.6.   Before considering how best to relate the administrationof the Battle Act and the activities of the COCOM, it is necessaryto have a full understanding of the statutory requirements placedon the Administrator and on the President.   The Administrator isrequired to recommend to the President termination of aid to any country which knowingly permits the export of Title I commodities to the Soviet Bloc.   With respect to Category A, the munitions andatomic energy list, it is mandatory that aid be terminated.   Noexception is permitted in any circumstances.   With respect tothe items in Category   B   of   Title   I
SECRET - 3 -itiich is, as you know, substantially the same as International List I,the President may in his discretion direct the continuance of aid toa country which has exported such an item to the Soviet Bloc &quot;whenunusual circumstances indicate the cessation of aid would clearly hedetrimental to the security of the United States.&quot;     But you will note that in making such a determination, the President will take intoaccount:   &quot;the contribution of such country to the mutual securityof the free worlds the importance of such assistance to the security ofthe United States, the strategic importance of imports received from countries of the Soviet Bloc, and the adequ&amp;oy of such country*s controls over the export to the Soviet Bloc of items of strategic importance.&quot;It is clear from the history of the legislation that the exceptionprovisions must he reserved for the truly unusual circumstances.7.     Title II of the Act provides that the United States shallnegotiate a program for1 controlling exports of strategic items not subject to emhargo under Title I.     It also provides that aid shall heterminated if the President determines that other countries are noteffectively cooperating in this activity, or are furnishing insufficientinformation so that a judgment can he made.     Title III of the Battle Actrelates to discussions with countries which are not receiving aid andalso authorizes the this. to furnish technical advice and assistance *nexport control procedures t^ any nation desiring such cooperation.8.     I think it will he apparent from what I have said ahout theprovisions of the Battle Act that there are a numfrer of specific issues which our Governments must face if we are to achieve a maximum degree ofharmoay &quot;between the operations of the Coordinating Committee and theconduct of our Administration in carrying out its responsibilitiesunder this Act.     First, there are a number of questions relating to the procedures to be followed in making changes in the Battle Act lists.Second, there is the question of how Title II is to &quot;be implemented.Third, and perhaps the most difficult, there are the questions relatingto the handling of exceptions under the Act.     Oft eaoh one of these matterwe have oertain points we should like to make and suggestions which
* SECRET ^^ wish to put before you for consideration.     Before turning tothese questions, however, I should like to say a word about our views on how the public understanding necessary for a reasonableadministration of the Battle Act, consistent of course with the needfor security, can best be achieved,9*     The United States Government has, in the past, been handicappedin bringing about an adequate public understanding of the realaccomplishments of multilateral cooperation and the steps taken through the Coordinating Committee to strengthen trade securitycontrols.     We have recognised the problems which publicity would raise for other Coordinating Committee countries and have, therefore,refrained from release of much factual information which, if itcould have been made public, might have resulted in better under-standing in the United States of action taken under this program,A continued lack of information may lead to more restrictive legis-lation which would greatly handicap the multilateral approach.    Forthis reason the Administrator desires to follow a policy of publiclyreleasing actions taken by him under the Battle Act legislation inso far as the release of the information is consistent with thebest interests of all cooperating countries and we hope othergovernments will agree that a more liberal policy on release ofinformation is in our mutual interest,10,     The Battle Act requires frequent reports to a number of com-mittees of Congress concerning actions taken under the Act.     Inaddition to this formal requirement, the Administrator intends to cooperate closely with the Congress and to consult with these commi-committees regarding major problems with which he will be confronted.It will, therefore, be necessary to inform the Congressional commi-committees on various aspects of discussions with other governments con-corning the Battle Act and their activities related to it.     Informa-tion given to the Congress concerning the Coordinating Committee willbe classified in accordance with our agreement in the Committee(COCOM Docs, 267 and 1+23),     Public disclosure of the work of theCoordinating Committee will be subject to preconsultation as hasalready been agreed.
SECRET - 5 m1,^   Until now, only the Title I, Category A, list and the 3-pagesummary description of Title I, Category B, together with a general statement of action taken under the Act. has been made public.   TheUnited States has not made public disclosure of the 7-yage generalizedlisting of Title I, Category B.     However, at the time our aide-memoire was presented we requested your views on the publication ofthat generalized version.   We would like to be in the position to release this version promptly if a further disclosure of the contents of the Category B list appears necessary^     It is not how intended to publish the complete and detailed Title I, Category B, list. If publicationlater      appears necessary we will, of course, consult with theCommittee.12.   With respect to changes in the Battle Act lists, it is the intentof the United States not to modify the Title I or Title II lists until there has been an opportunity for discussion of a proposed change inthe Coordinating Committee.     In making any alteration, the Administratorwill give full consideration to the discussion in the CoordinatingCommittee and to the views of the individual countries, although, under our law, the Administrator has responsibility for making the finaldecision on the items which he will include in any of the lists.13*    Insofar ae action under Title II of the Act is concerned the administrator has, as you know, listed 28 items which, in the viewof the United States, require the application of stringent export con-trol measure b.     Some of these items have already been agreed in the-Coordinating Committee for addition to International List I,     In thepast the United States has urged that a limited number of the other items which now appear on Title II also be placed under embargo con-trol.     A majoir consideration in placing these items on the initialTitle II list,   rather than on Title I, was our recognition of thefact that they were still under discussion in the CoordinatingCommittee or had not been agreed for embargo by all members of theGroup.      Rubber and tin are, included on Title II since they are considered to be of such Importance as to require particular attentionunder the terms of the Act,     In the case of those items on Title II/...*.
SECRET - 6 -which.&apos;have not been agreed for International List I, I am not yetn a position to indicate what degree of control the Administratorwill feel he should seek in order to meet the purposes of the Act*I can say, however, that if additional measures appear necessary itis our intention to raise them for discussion in the CoordinatingCommittee.Finally,, there is the problem of exceptions.     We recognise that,under present circumstances, the urgency of Western requirements fora few commodities from the Soviet Bloc has enabled the Bloc in somecases to obtain items which are subject to the embargo provisions of title I of the Battle Act.     We believe we must find a way to mini-mize such shipments in the future and that together we can do so.This calls for more effective marshalling of our combined efforts.15.    Consistent with the criteria set forth in the earlier part ofmy statement (Paragraph li) exceptions can be made under the BattleAct when there is no practicable alternative to the shipment of aTitle I, Category Bj item.     Exceptions under this Act, however, mustbe of a different character than those under the&amp;$m Amendment.   TheKern Amendment was sweeping in character and it was apparent from the start that few countries could comply with its terms without injury to the strength of the free world.     The Battle Act, on the otherhand, reflects both an appreciation of the large measure of inter-national agreement on these questions and the necessity for limiting the list of embargoed items to those of primary strategic importance.     In the light of the history of the present legislation,the Administrator considers that exceptions under this Act mustbe of a specific and limited nature and that any general exception ofthe character initially made under the Kern Amendment must be avoided.16,    The use of the exception provisions of the Act will, of course,require full and complete information on the circumstances involved.Although the Act requires that the final decision must rest with the/.....
SECRET - .7 -(Resident, we wish to have the Coordinating Committee participate as fully as possible and are confident that full weight will be given toits information and views on the proposed export of a Title I, CategoryB, item.    Accordingly, the United States suggests that the CoordinatingCommittee exception procedures be amended to provide for discussion on all proposed exports of items on the International List I, beforethe shipment is made or the commitments undertaken.    In addition, it isdesirable that there be prior consultation on proposed exports of the arms, the atomic energy, and the four additional items which are on the category B list but which do not now appear on International List I.This procedure should assure the adequate discussion of all aspects ofa prospective shipment;    would provide interested countries and the administrator with the views of participating governments regarding thecase;    and, it is hoped, would suggest a means of avoiding theproposed shipment,17.     Insofar as existing commitments are concerned, we are unableto express definitive views on the immediate decisions which will berequired since details regarding the commitments and the problems theymay present have not thus far been available.   However, it is only fair to state that it is our belief that there may be some commitments to export Category B items which in line with the Coordinating Committeeunderstanding the countries concerned may not need to fulfill.    Inany case, an adequate appraisal of the problems posed by existing commitments and an acceptable means of dealing with them depends onthe availability of full information.    We hope that in the course ofthese meetings you will be able to present enough details so thattogether we can discuss means of handling the problem.    If, on thebasis of available information on existing commitments and scheduledshipments, it appears that the Administrator would not have time inwhich to reach a judgment, I shall suggest that shipments   .&apos;\- / ,/against these commitments be suspended as of January 25.    Thissuspension would be only for the minimum time required for an adequateappraisal of the factors involved and would, of course, be withoutprejudice to the eventual fulfilment of the commitments if it is/determined ...
SECRET - 8 -)-determined that circumstances justified exceptional treatment.    Inthe light of recent experiences on exceptions in the COCOM I do notbelieve that these problems will be numerous or ones to which wecannot find a solution.    I want to assure you that my Government,for its part, intends to make every effort to avoid any unreasonabledelay,18.      In closing, I should like again to express my appreciation forthis opportunity to discuss these questions together and to emphasise that we wish to be as realistic and constructive as possible in seeking with you the proper answer to the problem of exportcontrols in our mutual security interests.

SECRETReference paragraph h(a) of Annex CSTATEMENT BY U.S. DELEGATECONCERNINGPRE-CONSULTATION ON EXCEPTIONS1.     During the discussion yesterday,  it was suggested thatwe present a proposal concerning the manner of handlingexceptions.     We are very happy to comply with this suggestion and are now presenting certain specific ideas for theconsideration of the Group.     They have been developed inrelation to several basic considerations which I touched onyesterday--that is:That so far as the Battle Act is concerned, the Administratormust be    informed in advance as to proposed shipments of any itemon the Category B List regardless of how that item is carried onthe International Lists;That, in the interest of effective multilateral cooperation,we believe it desirable that the advance consultation might,at least so far as future commitments are concerned, take placein the COCOM before the commitment is made;That the consultation in the COGOM should be directed atobtaining the fullest possible presentation and discussion ofthe circumstances, which will provide the Administrator with thebenefit of the information and considered.views of all theindividual governments;And that, while the Act does not permit the Administratorto substitute the Committee^ judgment for his judgment,nevertheless he is prepared to give full weight to the views and information developed by adequate discussion in theCommittee.Another basic consideration we had in mind is that, sofar as the Act is concerned, there is no distinction betweenshipments under commitments made before January 2k and those under commitments made after January 2k*     However, as I mentionedyesterday, the circumstances and considerations relating toprior commitment cases may be expected to weigh heavily in the administrator&apos;s decision.2. .   Having said this, I would suggest that if the membersof this Group wish to create the maximum harmony between theoperations of the Coordinating Committee and the administrationof the Battle Act, it would be desirable to proceed on the basisof the following understanding so far as the Committee&apos;sexception procedure is concerned:a) We believe that consultation in the CoordinatingCommittee, as provided in paragraph 2 of COCOM Document U;71,should take place before commitments are made to export items which would constitute exceptions to the agreed controls, unlessthe exigencies of the negotiating situation make such advanceconsultation impossible,,      In that event, consultation shouldtake place as soon as possible thereafter, -b) In advance of the actual export of an embargo item, webelieve that any Participating Country should be able, and we hope will have the interest, to bring up the proposed exportfor discussion in the Committee if it considers that there hasbeen a material change in the circumstances surrounding the transaction between the time that the commitment was made andthe time that the shipment is to take place./ (o)
SECRET- 2 -c) Consultation in the Committee is intended, as weunderstand it, to assist the exporting country to assess the strategic importance of the export involved in relation to theessentiality of the counterpart supplies to be received, andto make it possible for the exporting country to judge whether there is a practicable alternative to the shipment of strategic goods which need to be made to avoid the loss of essential supplies.     We also understand that exporting countries will give full weight to the views of other countries expressed in theCommittee.d) In the case of items whose strategic importance has notbeen agreed upon unanimously in the Committee, and which are,therefore, controlled according to the &quot;quid pro quo&quot;provisions of paragraph 3(d) of COCOM Document k70, we believethat participating Countries should feel free to consult theCommittee at any time in order to clarify the strategicsignificance of the items or of the quantity involved inrelation to the adequacy of the &quot;quid pro quo&quot; in anytransacti on.e) we take it for granted that the Committee at any time may agree that in the case of certain 3(d) items, as with an embargo item, Participating Countries should consult with theCommittee in advance of making an export commitment.-3.     Hence, we suggest that, in addition to an indication of concurrence in paragraph 2 above, the members of this Groupmight alter the exceptions provisions in COCOM Document U71in the following way:a) Change paragraph 2 of the document to read as follows:&quot;Governments will inform the Coordinating Committee, inadvance and in detail, regarding any trade negotiations orproposed transactions which may result in such exceptions andwill invite the views of other members of the Committee,(it is recognized that there may be a few exceptional caseswhere the exigencies of the trade negotiations made itimpossible to inform the Committee before entering intocommitments involving exceptions.     If such cases occur, theCommittee will be informed as soon as possible thereafter.)&quot;b) Add the following at the end of paragraph 3 of the document:&quot;With respect to information filed with the CoordinatingCommittee concerning prior commitments, any Governmentmay request further amplifying details.&quot;
