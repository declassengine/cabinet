(THIS DOCUMENT IS -THE-PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAXEST-Y-1S--GOVER-NMENT)C ) confidential. (52) 29COPY NO,11TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETJOHN DEERE PROJECT AT EAST KILBRIDEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland the Economic Policy Committee have decided after the fullestconsideration (E.A. (52) 8, 10 and 18 and the minutes of the second and fourthmeetings) to postpone indefinitely - apart possibly from the work of sitepreparation - the erection of a factory at East Kilbride, near Glasgow, forthe John Deere Plow Company, Moline, Illinois.   I concurred with great reluctance in this decision which is based on the shortage of steel and therestriction of investment.   It will, however, be strongly challenged inScotland and the resulting situation cannot fail to be most damaging to theGovernment.   Since it was likely that the Prime Minister would be personallyapproached, I thought it advisable to let him know the position.   It is at his suggestion that I am circulating this paper.20 The John Deere Plow Company are a large mid-western Americanconcern.   They were induced to establish a factory in this country in the face of most attractive offers made to them by France, Holland, Italy and other european countries and an undertaking was given that the Government wouldbuild for them a factory of 425,000 square feet in the new town of EastKilbride.3. In the spring of last year the case for proceeding with the factory in face of defence obligations was questioned.   The late government decided to confirm the undertaking to build it, subject only to the overridingpriority of the defence programme.   On the faith of this undertaking the firmhave incurred considerable expense and entered into large commitments.4. There will be a powerful reaction in Scotland to the announcementof a decision to postpone the construction of the factory indefinitely.   TheScottish Council, which is a responsible and representative body with a highreputation as the mouthpiece of all shades of moderate opinion, will undoubtedly criticise the decision in the strongest terms.   Its chairman,Lord Bilsland, has indicated his intention of resigning his chairmanship of the Scottish Industrial Estates Company, who would have built the factory, onthe ground that he cannot be a party to a breach of faith.   The Opposition will,of course, claim that they rescued the project from a similar fate last year and.would not, had they remained in power, have allowed the present decision to betaken.   The nationalists will argue that the John Deere case illustrates thedanger to Scotland of London control.   It will be pointed out - I believe withjustice - that comparatively little factory building for defence purposes is going on in Scotland, that our unemployment, at 3. 2 per -cent, is higher than in anyOther region and that the postponement of a dollar-earning American projectrequiring over a period of two years some 2,000 tons of steel is not justified by the present steel shortage, eased as it has been by the promise of american help.
5, I understand that the firm have been informed of the decisionto postpone the building of the factory and that they are likely to abandon the project altogether unless they can be assured of a definite startingdate.   My hope is that the situation might be retrieved if they were to begiven a firm starting date in 1953.J.S.Scottish Office, S. W. 1. ,11TH FEBRUARY, 1952.
