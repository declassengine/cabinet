confidential. (52) 21 COPY NO, Pip6TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETPAID HOLIDAYS FOR GOVERNMENT INDUSTRIAL workers memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Lord Presidents memorandum (C,(52) 20) records thatthe balance of opinion in the Home Affairs Committee appeared tobe in favour of conceding the full demand for a further week&apos;s holidayin 1953.   I wish to urge on my colleagues that this policy is open toa number of objections.2. The paramount need to-day is to get the country to workharder and longer.     To give a further week off to Government staffeven in 1953 will, I fear, have a bad psychological effect.   It will be misinterpreted (in some cases deliberately) as a sign that theGovernment is not in earnest and as an open invitation to thosetrades which still get one week only to press for the same concession,3, In this situation I believe that we should do better to offer no more than three extra days, this concession starting this year.If we do this we cannot be accused of flcatLng the Fair Wagesprinciple.   Government industrials already receive 9 (or in somecases 8-1) odd paid days of holiday as compared with 6 in outsideindustry and psychologically the offer of three days will, I think,be less serious than that of a full week.   Even if this offer results in the Trade Unions taking the case to arbitration and winning, atleast we shall not have volunteered the extra week.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1. ,6TH FEBRUARY, 1952,
