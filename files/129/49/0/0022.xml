FORM OF ACCESSION PROCLAMATIONNote by the Secretary of the CabinetThe traditional form of the Accession Proclamation is shown inthe attached draft &apos;A&apos;,     This is not wholly in accord with modernconstitutional conditions in the Commonwealth.    Thus -(i)     the phrase &quot;Imperial Crown&quot; is likely to be associatedwith the &quot;Indian Empire&quot;;(ii)     &quot;Ireland&quot; is a survival from the days when the Southowed allegiance to the Crown and was a member of theCommonwealth;(iii)     Cacnda objects to the. pftrase &quot;British dominions beyondthe Seas&quot;;(iv)    the various references to &quot;allegiance&quot; date from beforethe time when India, though ceasing to owe allegiance to the Crown, decided to remain a member of theCommonwealth and to acknowledge the King as &quot;Headof the Commonwealth&quot; and the symbol of the freeassociation of its peoples.It is known that, if the Proclamation followed the traditional form, therepresentative of India would not feel able to sign it.2. An alternative form of Proclamation, devised to avoid theforegoing difficulties, is attached - draft &apos;B&apos;.3, The points of difference between the two drafts are indicated by underlining.COPY NO.(Signed)  NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.1,6TH FEBRUARY, 1952CONFIDENTIALC.(52) 226TH FEBRUARY, 1952CABINET
