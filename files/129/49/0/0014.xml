annex draft ANNOUNCEMENTThe shortage of manpower is such that the needs of essential industries, particularly those producing for the defence programme orfor export and certain basic industries, cannot be met unless further steps are taken, first, to secure that man-power is distributed inaccordance with the nation&apos;s needs and, secondly, to improve its efficiency and economical use.    The Minister of Labour has, in con-sultation and in agreement with the National Joint Advisory Council,devised new arrangements for this purpose.The first essential thing is to ensure that workers changingtheir jobs or seeking employment should at least have knowledge ofwhere their services can best be used in the national interest^ andshould not through lack of that knowledge, go into the less importantjobs, when they would be prepared to take more important work if they knew of it.    For this purpose the Minister of Labour is making anOrder under Defence Regulations requiring employers seeking to engageworkers to do so by notifying their vacancies to a Local Office of theMinistry of Labour, and to engage only workers submitted by a local office,    Certain employment agencies working under approved arrange-ments and in accordance with official directions may be used instead ofLocal Offices,Advertising of vacancies will be permitted provided that theadvertisement states that applications must be made to a Local Office,The Order will not apply to the engagement of persons under 18years old, or men who have reached 65, or women who have reached 60,or women with a child under 15 years old.Agriculture and coalmining and one or two other special classesof work will be excspted.
Appointments to managerial, professional, administrative orexecutive posts will not be affected by the Order,,The Order will be laid as soon as possible and will come intoforce on 25th February.It must be made perfectly clear that there is no intention of attempting to compel workers to take jobs they are unwilling to take.No directions to workers are to be used.    They will be told of theimportant vacancies and asked to take them willingly.    If they are not willing to do so they will be submitted to other work of the kind they desire, needing labour.Labour Supply Inspectors will again be used under existing powers, to examine the labour requirements of firms asking for additional labour, and to ascertain whether their needs could be met byother arrangements, such as up-grading and training.    If a firm isfound to be sufficiently manned, additional labour will not be supplied.Industries are to be invited to review their training andapprenticeship arrangements, and to consider whether their scopecould be widened, the period of training could be shortened, and age limits be removed or extended.
