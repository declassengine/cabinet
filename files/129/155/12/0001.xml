THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY BS government cp(71) 1229 January 1971RECONSTRUCTION OF NATIONAL INSURANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesCOPY NO   X) CABINETINTRODUCTION2. The Social Services Committee have Invited me to bring beforethe Cabinet my proposals for reconstructing the national insuranceschesas and for the preservation of occupational pension rights cn changeof employment.    These prosposals, which implement the undertakingswe gave in our Election Manifesto, are described in a separate memorandum (CP(?1) 13),    In this memorandum I set out briefly themain changes, their advantages and disadvantages, and the alternativepossibilities I have rejected.THE MAIN CHANGES2.        As compared with the present scheme the main changes Ipropose are, the present flat^rate contribution system for &quot;employed persons and employers, and trie stamped cardsthat go with it, will be abolished.    Instead there will be fully earnings &quot;-related contrfvb^ons, collected throughPA YE, at a higher percentage and extending to a higher level of earnings than the present graduated contribution.The higher earner will pay more than at present and thelower earner less.    Further, the employer will pay alarger proportion cf the contribution than the employee?II.       earnings^reiated contributions to the basic scheme will cease to earn any further entitlement to graduated pension over and above the basic flat ratesiii, selective improvements will be made in the flat-ratebenefits for the disabled, the chronic sick and the very old?CO
iVc        the present arrangements for partial contracting outof the present earnings-related system for those in approvedoccupational schemes will be abolished;vc       for the minority who are not covered by occupational pension schemes which satisfy certain broad conditions a new state reserve scheme, separate from the basic scheme, willbe established to provide earnings-relaied pension in returnfor earnings-related contributions over and aboire those forthe basic scheme $   Unlike the basic scheme the reserve scheme will not be financed on pay-as-you-go principlesor subsidised by the Exchequer but will be fully funded;vjL      provision will be made to ensure that occupational pension rights will not be lost as a result of changing jobs.OBJECTIVES AND ADVANTAGES3. a.       My proposals place the finances of the national insurance scheme on a sound basis which will enable itto meet the inescapable demands of the substantial rise in expenditure on pensions resulting from the growing numberof pensioners and from, our commitment to maintain atleast their   purchasing power.    They achieve this by providing a buoyant source of revenue without piling upexcessive burdens for future contributors,    I believethat we shall be given credit for not seeking, like theGrossman scheme, to buy off todayJs contributors withpromises of higher benefits tomorrow which would commitfuture generations to higher levels of contribution.Indeed, under my proposals, there is a prospect of areduction in contributions in the longer term,    (see paragraphs 18-19 of CP(71) 13.)b.        They achieve a more equitable distribution of thecost of pensions by relieving the lower^paid of the burdenof the flat-rate contribution, which represents a disproportionate crharge on their earnings.    (Annex 1,Tables 1A and IB to CP(71) 13. )c. They give everyone an opportunity of ear23&amp;gs inaddition to the basic State pension, a pension related totheir earnings.    They achieve this as far as possible by giving occupational pension schemes the stimulus tocontinue to develop their coverage and their benefits.This is a marked Improvement on the BoydwCarpenter2
scheme and is in sharp contrast to the Grossman schemedintention of providing a large earnings-related State pension.,with damaging effects on the growth of occupational schemes and the savings they generate,    (See Part B of CP(71) 13, )d. They establish a reserve State scheme of modestdimensions to provide earnings-related pensions for the minority without adequate occupational cover,    This scheme would be separately financed and properly funded under thecontrol of an independent Board,    Employees in occupational schemes which satisfy broad tests of adequacy would be exempted, and we shall be getting away from the presentcontracting-out tests based on precise equivalence with thestandard set by the State scheme,    (See Part B of CP(71) 13. )e. They ensure that our broad aims of improving earnings -related pension provision is promoted by securing the pension rights of people who change their jobs (although I recognisethat my proposals on contribution refunds in the future, whichare essential to our purpose,are bound to be unpopular withsome people),    (See  Part C of CP(71) 13. )f. They give priority on the benefit side to improvements,within my public expenditure programme as agreed for thepurpose of the present review, for the present generation ofthe very old? sick and disabled people.    This continues our policy of selective improvements for those with special needs.My proposals, although modest, represent a realistic start athelping those in need now, which can be developed as resourcesallow, and stand in congzsct  to the neglect of existingbeneficiaries in the Grossman scheme.    (See paragraphs and 14-16 of C P(71) 13.)g.        Contributions to the reserve scheme will represent a steady and sizeable source of new personal savings.    Since ovirproposals are, in additions, deliberately designed to encourage the growth of occupational pension schemes, we can expect a :further contribution to savings from any new schemes, as wellas from any extensions or improvements to the existing schemes.The proposed changes in the contribution structure of the basicscheme, by shifting more of the cost of the scheme fromemployees to employers, will cause some increase in personal consumption but this increase will diminish in time as employers3contributions gradually work their way through into prices.While therefore the short-run effects on savings of jya$proposals as a whole are expected to be neutral, the long.-run effects are expected to be favourable to savings (on certain assumptions, possibly by some  30 million a year).(See also paragraph 24 of CP(71) 13.)
DISADVANTAGES4. a. In. order to avoid too big an increase in contributions for higher-paid employees the total contribution is spiltunevenly between employer and employee,,    Employers will pay about  2.10 million a year (under 1 perccent of their totalpayroll) more than if the split was even.    This is not out of line with the practice in a number of EUROPEAN economic community (e.c.) countries in which the major part of thecost of social security benefits is borne by the employer (seeparagraph 6 below),   An additional cost of  125 million a year will fall on some employers by way of contributions to thereserve scheme.    On a rough estimate the increasedcontribution costs for employers may result in a once-for-allincrease in prices spread over a year or two of about 1 to ifper cent, with some adverse effect on the balance of payments.(Paragraphs 3-4 and 18-19 of CP(71) 13,)/   b. Despite the transfer of part of the cost to employers,the higher-paid will have to pay substantially more than theydo now (though the earnings celling of if times national average earnings (&quot;national average earnings&quot; is used, for convenience, to mean the average earnings of adult malemanual workers in manufacturing industries and certainnon-manufacturing industries and services,, as obtainedfrom the Department of Employments ha3f-yearly enquiries into earnings, ) will limit the burden), but very little morethan the contributions they will be paying after two upratings(1971 and 1973) &apos;*hen the scheme comes into effect,    some increase Is inherent in the switch from partly flat-rate,partly graduated, to a totally graduated contribution system.In the 1971 and 1973 upratings a disproportionate amount ofthe extra income necessary will be raised through graduated contributions from the higher-paid.    In fact by 1973 we may find that we should not need the full T2f per cent (jointemployer/employee) starting contribution on which the detailed scheme attached is based.    If, as is possible, weshall need a shade less - about 12 per cent - I shall of courseconsult the Chancellor about the distribution of the savings in contributions as compared with those shown in the Vifhite Paper.(Paragraphs 18-19 of CP(71) 13.)Co Despite paying higher contributions the higher-paidwill receive in return only the same flat-rate pension aseveryone else0    This is bound to be criticised by some ofour supporters on the grounds that the scheme isredistributive.    Contributions will vary with earningswithin a bracket rising to if time national average earnings,4
Anyone earning at or above the top of this bracket will payabout 14s a week more than the average earner.    The break with the tradition that higher contributions bring higherpensions must be made, however, if we are to have a buoyantrevenue without over ^burdening the poor.    (Tables 1A and IBof Annex 1 to CP(?I) 13. )d. Although the benefit return of the reserve scheme willappear small and slow to mature by comparison with the benefitformula of the Grossman schemef we have to live with the logicof onv declared policy and avoid subsidising the reserve scheme with consequent damage to the growth of occupational pensions.(Table 2 of Annex 1 to CP(71) 13.)e, For independence of Exchequer support to carryconviction, the reserve scheme must b$ financed by fundingthe contributions-    and the investment cannot be restricted to gilt-edged securities if we are to offer even a reasonable prospect that the purchasing power of the pensions will bemaintained.    En terms of current earnings, the contribution income might initially be of the order of  200 million a year,and by the end of the century the funds might have built up to something like  5, OOO million - the figures are necessarilyspeculative.    Even a fund of this sise would not by any meansdwarf other investors - the Prudential already has total assetsexceeding  2,000 million,    Our supporters may fear that, inthe wrong hands, the funds could be used for ill-judgedintervention in industry.    We can however lay a statutory dutyon the managers to pursue an investment policy designed tomaximise yields and thus the benefits payable - this would bea difficult provision for any Government to repeal and should avoid any danger that the investment power would be used forextraneous purposes,    la consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, I shall aim so to structure the investmentarrangements that safeguards against Government interferenceare built in, and that the dangers of any untoward effect on themarket are minimised.    On these aspects I shall seek to drawon the experience of those concerned with the large-scaleinvestment of occupational scheme funds, and of other experts;but in particular I have it in mind to lay down statutory limits on the proportion of voting shares which can be held in any onefirm.    (See also paragassphe 23 and 24 of CP(71) 13.)f* Those of us having responsibility for public service pension schemes, and particularly for schemes which arenotionally funded -* such as the teachers1 scheme and theNational Health Service (NHS) scheme - have been under some pressure to introduce full funding.    The setting upof a fully funded reserve scheme might increase the pressure.5
But to fund the public service schemes, including the unfundedCivil Service scheme, would require such large sums of money -possibly of the broad order of  300 million a year for&quot; 30 or 40 years -that such a project would hardly look realistic.    And, in any eventjwe could rest heavily on the fact that the benefits of the reserve scheme are to depend entirely on investment performance, whereas the public service schemes provide guaranteed pensions backed by public money.    If there are dangers on this front, I doubt whetherthey will be greatly increased by what we do about the reserve scheme.g. Initially the number of current contributors to the reserve scheme might be roughly of the order of 7 million and this may appearhigh for what is intended to be a fall-back scheme.    But this figure would have to be compared with some 13 million in recognisedoccupational schemes.    And as occupational schemes extend their scope the number paying to the reserve scheme should decline,(See also paragraphs 22 and 24 of CP(71) 13).h. A temporary Increase of staff will be needed to effect thechangeover to the new arrangements.    At its peak in 1974-75 thiswill mean an extra 2, 000 staff net In the Department of Health and social Security and an extra 1^-350 (feh^se figures do not include anythingfor the extra staff if earningc-related contributions are to be collected from  he self&quot;employed,    This possibility is still underconsideration) in Inland Revenuec There will be a rapiddecline In the number of extra staff over the following two or threeyears, howeverr and by 1980 the effect of my proposal will be toproduce, savings of about 1,250 staff in the Department of Health and social Security (ie, a reduction of about 3,250 compared with the peak figure) and about 400 staff on agency work In the Department ofEmployment.    In the Inland Revenue there will be a continuing needfor an extra 650 staff in the long term,    (These figures do not includeanything for the extra staff if earnings-related contributions are to be collected from the self-employed.    This possibility is still underconsideration).    In addition, before the peak of 1975 is reached therewill be a reduction in Post Office charges equivalent to some 900directly employed Post Office staff.    The eventual savings in staffresult In the main from the new contribution system, and they can onlybe secured at the price of an Increase while the changeover from thepresent system is taking place,ALTERNATIVE POSSIBILITIES5.        In view of the difficulties listed above, I have considered very carefullywhether we might adopt some other approach,, albeit at the price of an overtdeparture from our Election Manifesto,    Among these other approaches were -
a. To abandon the present link between contributions and benefit entitlement completely and to have a tax-based pension.This idea has some attractions of simplicity and savings in staff.There are powerful arguments against its however, on grounds ofpublic expenditure and the serious implications for taxation policy.To pay a universal pension at the current standard rate of  5 a week would cost an extra  425 million a year now, rising to nearly 500 million in 20 yearsr time.    Savings on supplementary pensions would reduce this by no more than about  70 million a year.    Andthe removal of contribution conditions from entitlement to short-term benefits would add about  80 million to the cost of these benefits.While we might phase In the full cost over a period a substantial part would have to be incurred Immediately.b. To provide a modest earnings-related addition to the flat-ratepension through the basic scheme.    This would be stigmatised asa feeble imitation of the Grossman scheme but could not even,without undue complications, accommodate provision for contracting out.    It would suffer from most of the disadvantages of my proposals,with few of the advantages.c. To leave the present scheme much as it Is,    This would beseen as a confession of failure; and in any event is not possible asa long-term policy because we shall need to rely increasingly on earnings-related contributions to finance the flat-rate basic pension and the present contracting-out system Is too inflexible to enable usto do this for long without damage to occupational pension provision.Additionally there is a pressing need to put the State scheme on a stable footing and continued uncertainty about its future will of itself be damaging to the development of occupational provision.d. To dispense with a State scheme of earnings-related benefitsby compelling all employers to put their employees in&apos; occupational pension schemes.    This Idea, although seductive, Is, I am afraid,impracticable.    We can - and must - foster the development of occupational schemes to the fullest extents, including centralisedschemes serving whole industries (such as building); but with amillion or so employers and the ephemeral nature of many employmentcontracts it would not be realistic to require universal occupationalcoverage.    The Life Offices suggested to me, in confidence, thatfor employees not In pension schemes there might be compulsorycontributions to provident funds in which savings would be built upfor the purchase of annuities.    But, since a high proportion of themillion employers would be involved, there would be no prospect ofpolicing effectively any obligation on them to make direct payments^weekly or monthly, to the various savings agencies (building societies,life offices and so on); and, in any event, I do not see how we couldjustify departing from our Election commitment in order to substitute a ramshackle arrangement of this sort.    We promised &quot;a reserveearnings-related State scheme &quot;for those not In occupational schemes and this we must provide,7
COMMON MARKET IMPLICATIONS6.        The Social Services Committee asked for an assessment of thepossible Implications for my proposals of our entry into the e.c.,    TheTreaty of Rome expresses the view that the wcrking of the Common Marketwill favour harmonisation of social systems, but there is nothing in theTreaty which requires any Member State to harmonise its social securitywith the social security of other Member States, and there has been little evidence of any move in this direction among the Six themselves0Nevertheless, it might be an advantage to increase the employer^contribution in this country.    The French have complained that we pat too much of the cost of social security on general taxation and too little onemployers and thus give our manufacturers an unfair advantage.    Thepoint was mentioned in our previous negotiations in Brussels, but it wasnot pursued.    It is unlikely to become an issue in our present negotiations, but it might be raised again after we join the Communityunder Article 101 of the Treaty of Rome, which deals with unfair competition.    The employerTs contribution, expressed as a percentage ofthe workerfs earnings? ranges from 15 per cent in Germany to 35 per centin Italy,    In the Common Market countries privately-run occupational schemes are &quot;of limited significance - and under the national lav/ of germany in particular, the equity investment of such schemes is narrowly restricted -but that should not discourage us from going forward with our own policy ofrelying mainly on occupational schemes to provide earnings-related pensioncover In this country,LIKELY REACTIONS OF PENSIONS INTERESTS7, The Life Offices can be expected to seek a scheme which would bestill more advantageous from the standpoint of their own business, but once we are seen to be firm they will, I am sure, go all out to expand occupational pension provision - which is what we want.    So far as we can tell at thisstage, the National Association of Pension Funds and the pension brokerswill be reasonably friendly towards our proposals, though doubtless theywill have reservations on specific points - as will the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) - on, for example, the share of the contribution to bepaid by employers l$x the basic and reserve schemes,conclusion. I invite my colleage*test  agreement to my proposals as set out in cp(71) 13 ar. the basis of -a.        Early confidential discussions with representatives of themain organisations concerned with occupational pension schemes.These would be technical and would concentrate on the terms of exemption from the reserve scheme.    I would also wish to consultin the strictest confidence the leading officials in those organisations and in the CBI about the proposals as a whole.    In the light of their actions I would consider the form and timing of further consultations with a wider circle, including the Trades Union congress in particular.COiMFIDEMTIAjL
b. Preparation of a. White Paper0c. Preparation of legislation, with the aim of introducing it atthe start of the 1971-72 Session.My aim is that the new arrangements, which can only start at the beginningof a tax year, should come into operation in April 1974.    The timetable forthis is very tight, since employers and Departments will need at least two years to prepare after legislation has been enacted.    A decision on theproposals is therefore urgent.K department of Health and Social Security SE128 January 19719
