THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT2 February 1971CABINETBROADCASTING finance memorandum by the Minister of posts and TelecommunicationsIn the manifesto, we saidg-west will ensure that the British Broadcasting Corporationcontinues to make its effective and essential public service contribution in both television and sound broadcasting.Equally, we will ensure that the independent televisioncompanies are not prevented from providing a responsibleservice by too high a Government levy on their income, &quot;THE bbc,     The BBC forecast that in the five year period ending March, 1975,their deficit will accumulate to &amp;19, 25 million.    The forecast allows forthe increase in the television licence from  6 to  6, 10s, (monochrome)?and from  11 to  11. 10s (colour).    Prescribed by regulations made by my predecessor in the last Parliament, this increase is due to take effect on1 April next.3.     I am satisfied that the BBCs forecast of income is realistic and reasonable.4.     As to expenditure, in April last when the regulations prescribing the 6,10s. and  11. 10s. fees were made, the BBC were already forecastinga deficit of  13 million by March 1974.    But, following the findings of aCourt of Inquiry appointed by the Labour Government, a settlementreached by the BBC with Its Unions in July last will, the Corporationestimate, cost an extra  17 million in the 5 years up to March 1975.This, together with rising costs, essentially accounts for the markedworsening of the BBC&apos;s financial position.5.     Savings of the order required to meet the deficit could only besecured by making severe cuts in the BBC!s television services.    Forexample, abolishing bbc altogether would save  64 million * more thanenough - over the period,    A major reduction of BBC television hoursCP(71) 16COPY NO1
(by almost a half) would save  36 million? and the abolition of regionaltelevision  30 million,    Cuts of this order would be politically unacceptableNor could the BBC prodxice the same amount of television as at presentsbut more cheaply, except by lowering the quality of their service?eg by increasing the amount of time given to old cinema films or cheapAmerican series.    This, too, would be unacceptable,6,     There are no savings of anything like the amount required to befound from the BBC!s present radio operation,    &quot;We are considering whether there should be some reduction of it, in connection with our plan to authorise commercial radio,    But the most we would contemplate is theabolition of Radio 1 and of BBC local radio.    Even on this basis the BBCwould still be some  29. 25 million in deficit at March 1975.    To producethis amount an increase of between 8s. and 9s. (on top of the  6. 10s. dueto take effect on 1 April) would be required.    For practical reasons, theincrease would have to be lOsj and it would not take effect before 1 July.This would produce an additional  35, 4 million.    In the result, if we decide that both BBC local radio and Radio 1 should be abolished, theCorporation would be left with a modest surplus of  6 million or so at theend of the 5 year period.    But if, to take the other extreme, we decide that both should continue, the BBC would stand to be some  5 million in deficit, well within their temporary borrowing powers of  10 million.7.     With the agreement of Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting,I recommend j-a. that the increase in the licence fees from  6 to  6, 10s. nonochrome) and  11 to  11. 10s, (colour) due to take effect on I April be revokedg and b, that, instead., the fees be increased from  6 to  7,(monochrome) and from  11 to  12 (colour) with effect from 1 July.ITV8.     In October last, the ITA represented tome that the levy, which is charged on a progressive scale on the advertising revenues of theprogramme companies, should be reduced from its current level of some 20 million in a full levy year by  18, 5 million ie virtual abolition.However, after protracted discussion, the authority reduced its bid to aminimum reduction of  12 million.    The Authority have also represented to me that some basis other than a charge on revenue should be sought.The case for a reduction is that, without it, the continuing decline in thecompanies&apos; advertising receipts, together with rising costs will so farweaken the financial position of independent television as to make itimpossible for it to provide a service of a high general standard.    TheLord President, the Chancellor and I are agreed that a reduction of 10 million in a full levy year would be fully adequate to enable theAuthority to ensure that the companies discharge their obligation.    this reduction should suffice until the end of July 1972 (ie the end of the nextfull levy year),    During that time, we will review the basis on which the levy is charged,2
PROPOSED ANNOUNCEMENT9.     If ray colleagues agree, I would propose to make a statementannouncing both the decision to increase the licence fee and to reduce the levy.    A draft statement is contained in the annex.    It would be necessaryto make the statement within the next few days.    Upon it depends theITArs ability to give the necessary notice of the increases it needs tomake, with effect from the end of July, in the rentals it charges  thecompanies.    (in fact, 6 months&apos; notice is the contractual requirement;but the Authority has secured a fortnights waiver from the companies).For the BBC, an announcement is needed very shortly so that the PostOffice can cancel the arrangements made for the April increase.C J c ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, SE12 February 19713
DRAFT statement with permission,   I  should  like   to make a statement about broadcastingf finance.First,   the  finances  of   the BBC:  honourable Members will  recall   that,under regulations made  in  the  last Parliament,   the   licence  fee  isdue  to be   increased on  1 April next  by 10s:   that  is,   from  6  to   6  10sfor monochrome   television;  and  from  11   to   11   10s  for colourtelevisi on.The BBC have  represented  to   the Government   that,   in consequence ofthe wage  settlement and revised conditions of  service reached with  itsUnions  last year,   and of  rising costs generally,   the   increase of  10swill not suffice:   and  that,   if   the BBC are   to maintain  their presentservices of   television and radio without  accumulating a seriousdeficit,   a further  increase will be necessary.After a close  review of   the BBC&apos;s  forecasts of  expenditure   theGovernment have concluded  that  the  licence  fee should be  increasedby  1   to  7  for monochrome and to  12  for  colour  television.    this increase   is  designed  to meet  the  foreseeable needs of   the  Corporationuntil March  1975;   the  BBC accept  that  this  should be  sufficient  forthis purpose.    The new fees will   take  effect  from 1  July next.The  increase  of  10s due  on 1 April next will not now  take  effect.The necessary regulations will  be  laid as  soon as possible.Second,   the   levy on  the   independent   television companies:   theIndependent Television Authority have  represented  to me  that  the continuing decline  in  advertising  revenue over  the  last year,   togetherwith rising costs,   are seriously  threatening  the companies&apos;   ability to provide a  television  service of high quality. .The Government  have  therefore decided  that  the  rate of  the  levyshould be  changed  so as   to  reduce   the yield  in a full   levy year  byan estimated  10 million.    The order  to give  effect   to  the new scalewill be brought be fore Par 1iament  as  soon as possible.
(confidential am satisfied  that   this  reduction will  provide  independent television with  the  resources   that  it needs-     It   is designed  toenable   the  companies   to  improve  the quality of   their programmes  andthose of  Independent Television News.    The Authority have assured methat  it   is   their  intention   to use  this  opportunity   to  secure  such animprovement.    The Government regard  the present reduction as  a holding measure designed  to  stabilise,   at  least until  31  July  1972  -that   is,  until   the end of   the next  full   levy year  -  the financialposition of   the  public  service of   television provided by  the authority in  the meantime,   the Government will  review  the basis  on which  the levy   is  charged.
