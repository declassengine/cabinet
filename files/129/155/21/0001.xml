DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 2112 February 1971CABINETAGRICULTURAL INTERIM IMPORT LEVIES: NEGOTIATIONSWITH THE UNITED STATESMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilBACKGROUNDL At its meeting on 29 September 1970 (CM(70) 24th Conclusions,Minute 2), the Cabinet agreed that we should introduce interim importlevy schemes for cereals, beef, lamb and dairy products other than butter and cheese.    To do this it was necessary to negotiate with a number ofimportant overseas suppliers including the United States, Canada, Australia,New Zealand and Argentina, because the proposed schemes would affectrights which these countries enjoy in our market as a result of various international obligations into which we have entered bilaterally andmultilaterally.    Negotiations began in November,    We have recentlyreached a basis of understanding with New Zealand and we have also made considerable progress with a number of our other suppliers, includingAustralia.    There are good prospects, except perhaps in the case ofArgentina, that we will be able to introduce our proposed schemes forbeef, lamb and the minor milk products by agreement with our overseas suppliers to whom we have obligations with which the schemes conflict.Where we have trade agreements, we may have to concede our suppliers1rights to reduce our access to their markets so as to restore the balanceof the trade agreement.    But in the case of cereals we have run intoconsiderable difficulties with the United States.NEGOTIATIONS ON CEREALS2.        We already operate minimum import prices (m p) for cereals **supported by country levies - under a five-party agreement with theUnited States, Canada, Australia and Argentina,    Under this agreement,which expires on 30 June, our suppliers agreed, in effect, to the suspension of our cereals tariff bindings under the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    In November, we opened negotiationswith them for an immediate  7 per ton increase in our m p and theintroduction of general variable levies instead of country levies from1 July.COPY NO
30 We have always recognised thatj in bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion with the other four parties to the cereals agreement,the American attitude would be crucial,    Our proposals raise considerable difficulties for the United States Administration, partly because of their concern about the possible implications for the USA&apos;s substantial cerealsexports and partly for internal political reasons, notably in connectionwith their efforts to contain domestic protectionist pressures,,    before christmas, in face of strong American opposition, we modified our original proposals to them, and suggested instead an increase of only 5 per ton on our m p in 1971 with a further increase of not more than 2 per ton for 1972.    We maintained our proposal to introduce generalvariable levies from 1 July.    During the Prime Ministers visit to washington on 17 December, he agreed with President Nixon that our proposals should be further discussed with them in the New Year,    the americans were however unable in the event to give us their reaction toour modified proposals until 8 -9 February, when there was a meeting withthem at senior official level in Loud on 04,        At this meeting the Americans made counter-proposals which,after considerable pressure and probing from cur side, they reducedto the following elements:i0       ^h^her we should provide a rigorous and enforceableassurance about the level of our future imports of their cereals,with provision for growth: or we should raise our mips in 1971-72by not more than  2 and in 1972-73 by not more than a further  10ii.      We should give a general assurance that we would set thelevel of our guaranteed prices so as to maintain the balance between home production and imports,,Hi.     Our GATT bindings should be suspended for the duration of the proposed under standing, which would be subject to reviewor termination at 60 days1 notice, with the level of our mipsreviewed at the end of 1972.    Provided we met these conditionsthey would agree to our introducing general variable levies on1 July.OUR RESPONSE TO THE AMERICANS5. The Ministerial Committee on Agricultural Policy (AG)considered the position on 11 February. There is a considerablegap between the Americans&apos; counter-proposals and what we could accept as consistent with our policy objectives. In particular we agreed that there could be no question of giving the Americans assurances about the future level of our cereals imports; or of making any concessionthat might adversely affect our negotiations to enter the european economic Community.
6,        However, in deciding how to react to the Americans1 counter-proposals, there is a serious timing problem to take into account,,    Thecurrent five-party agreement on cereals expires on 30 June,    Unless by then we have negotiated a new agreement with our major suppliers, or alternatively have completed the procedures required to withdraw ourGATT tariff bindings, we shall be unable even to continue the presentmip scheme for cereals, let alone introduce new levy arrangements,whether for cereals or, probably, even for the other products (seeparagraph 8)e    To withdraw GATT bindings could be expected to takeat least four months.    Thus if we do not begin by the end of this month the necessary procedures to free ourselves from our cereals bindingsand are unable to reach acceptable agreements with our suppliers, werisk losing all our m p protection at the end of June (unless our suppliersagree to a temporary extension of our present arrangements)a    Further -more, while world cereal prices are at present gaeusrally above the levelto which even a  7 increase would raise our mips, some easing could being in September when the new crop begins to come on to the market.In that event, if we had not in the meanwhile raised the level of our m p,United Kingdom market prices would be likely to fall and the deficiency round bill rise.    When the level of market prices in the UnitedKingdom is below that of the guaranteed prices, every  1 by whichmarket prices fall costs the Exchequer, on a crop of 13 million tons, 13 million in deficiency payments.    Moreover, in addition to the GATTbindings, we have agreements with minor cereals suppliers which would need to be renegotiated to allow us to operate general levies and thewsare only terminable at four months&apos; notice,7,        In this situation the majority of AG felt that we should forthwithset in hand the necessary procedures for withdrawing our GATT tariffbindings, and giving notice to our minor suppliers, before having further negotiations with the Americans or any of our other suppliers.    In doing so we should make clear both to the GATT and to all our suppliers that what we have done is necessary in order to put ourselves in a positionto introduce our new arrangements on 1 July when the present five-partyagreement on cereals expires; but that our action should be regarded asprovisional and that we remain ready to continue negotiating with the americans and our other principal suppliers for a mutually acceptableagreement.    If agreement could be reached, we would not complete the procedures for withdrawing our bindings,.    In view of the Prime Minister&apos;stalk with President Nixon before Christmas, we thought he shouldsimultaneously send the President a personal message to this effect,8. Failing such action, the majority of AG were of the view thatwe had no prospect of securing agreement with the Americans in timeand would risk serious delay in bringing our new cereals levy arrangementsinto effect.    This could mean a similar delay in introducing all the other schemes because any agreement we might reach on schemes for, say, beef and lamb would probably depend on the sort of understanding we havereached with New Zealand, namely that these schemes should not be implemented until negotiations for the cereals scheme are complete,
9o The Minister for Trade however points out that we have to secureGATT agreement before we can begin to negotiate our bindings.    If weembark on this course in the GATT now, the Americans would resent this attempt to bring pressure on them and would be even more likely to try to delay or block the procedures for withdrawing our bindings, so that theycould not be completed before the end of June.    They might be supportedin this by some of the other major suppliers,,    Moreover, even if this riskwere avoided, under che GATT rules we would either have to offerequivalent compensation for the bindings we wished to withdraw orface the withdrawal by our trading partners of equivalent concessionsgiven to us.    Since there is little scope for us to offer equivalentcompensation, the Americans would be likely to withdraw tariff concessions for such British exports to them as whisky, high-qualitywoollen textiles and shoes0    The other major suppliers would also be free to take similar action,    Furthermore our action in seeking towithdraw our cereal tariff bindings would seriously embarrass theUnited States Administration in their efforts to contain domesticprotectionist pressures.    The total effect on our commercial interestwould therefore be considerable.    In the Minister for Tradels view,before beginning the procedures to withdraw our bindings, we shouldmake a further high-level approach to the Americans to get agreementwith them; and should be prepared to restrict the increase in our mipsto  4 per ton.    While not giving any assurance about the Americans&apos;access to our market, we might also offer them a very general undertakingabout our future domestic support policies, if this would be presentationallyhelpful for them.    We should be committing ourselves in effect for18 months at the outside and the practical effect would be negligible.On this basis he believed an agreement might be secured with the americans, which our other suppliers could be expected to follow.10.       AG were conscious that the choice between the two coursesset out in paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 raised issues of considerable importance for our international political and trade relations, particularly with theUnited States of America0    They accordingly invite the Cabinet to decide between these two courses.W W     :Privy Council Office SW112 February 1971
