IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HEP, BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(71) 1 COPY NO   i)b1 January 1971CABINETARMS FOR SOUTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of Skate for Foreign and commonwealth affairs. At the meeting on 1 December (CM(70) 42nd Conclusions,, Minute 2)the Cabinet invited me to ascertain the terms in which the Soxith african government would be willing to give a public undertaking not to use arms supplies for purposes other than maritime defence,2. After discussions with our Ambassador in Pretoria the South african government have agreed that we may use publicly the following sentence -&quot;The South African Government have given us an assurance thatthey have no aggressive intentions and that any arms we mightsupply for maritime defence x-elafced to the security of the searoutes will not be diverted to purposes other than those  or which we agreed to supply them&quot;.3, .      I think that an assurance in these terms meets our purposes.    TheSouth African Government at first sought to link the assurance to ourrecognition of earlier public statements made by them to the effect thatthey had no aggressive intentions towards their neighbours.    But I did not regard it as wise that we should accept an assurance tied so closely toendorsement of South African policy statements, some aspects of which -e,g, references to &quot;hot pursuit&quot; by Mr Vorster - are very controversial,4, The present formula gets over this difficulty.    For internalconsumption, the South African Government will no doubt wish to show thatthe assurance they have now given us is not new and flows logically fromtheir earlier statements.    But from our own point of view the assurancestands on its own.    I therefore propose that the sentence as now draftedshould be included in the statement to be made in due course to Parliament.A D-.foreign and Commonwealth Office SW11 January 1971
