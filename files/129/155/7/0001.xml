The Welsh people have the right to the kind of local government whichmeets the needs of Wales in the second half of the twentieth century and inwhich they can participate effectively and to the full. Existing local authorities 181 county, borough and district councils and over 600 parish councils-have done their work well. Most of these authorities, however, serve smallpopulations and have scanty resources. This means that they must inevitablylook to the Welsh Office and other government departments to establishpriorities and take decisions in matters which local democratic bodies should properly settle for themselves.2. The Government are determined that local government should bepowerful enough to take its own decisions, establish its priorities and allocate the resources available to it. They want reformed local government to be free from detailed control by central government. The purpose of this document isto set out the Governments proposals to this end.3. A great deal of consideration has been given in recent years to there organisation of local government in Wales. The course of events is sum-marised in Appendix I. The main issues and the main areas of controversyhave been clearly established. The debate must now be brought to the pointof decision.4. The Government have reviewed the proposals of the last administration.These treated Glamorgan and Monmouthshire separately from the rest of wales, an approach which received very little support and which the Govern-ment think wrong. For the rest of Wales a sound foundation was laid in the1967 White Paper.* The Government, however, put the irpresent proposalsforward in their own right, as a scheme which they think is well suited to theneeds of Wales.The principles of reform5. Many important services are most effectively organised on a large scale.This permits the recruitment of specialised staff and makes for economy inoperation. Further, people expect a general uniformity in the standard ofservice provided by local authorities, wherever they may live. These considera-tions point to having strong authorities, serving sizeable populations and covering substantial areas of the country. It is necessary to take into accountalso geographical considerations, historical associations and the strength of community feeling. Some services, however, can be dealt with quite ade-adequately on a more local scale; and the Government consider that there is every justification for district councils with clear cut executive responsibilities to run these services. They are firmly opposed to monolithic authorities, whichmoreover would deny opportunities of local public service to all save a few.6. The Government therefore propose that there should be throughoutWales a uniform system of local government with responsibility for servicesdivided between a small number of county councils and a larger number of district councils. (These titles are used primarily as a matter of convenience atthis stage. Suggestions for alternative titles would be welcome). The district* Local Government in Wales. Cmnd. 3340. HMSO, 1967.
councils would be autonomous within their own areas of responsibility.Additionally, community councils should be created, with limited but realresponsibilities, at the level of rural parishes, and if the local residents desireit, in urban areas. At present over much of industrial Wales there are no suchlocal democratic bodies. The arrangements recently introduced* for the allo-cation of capital programmes within administrative counties, which do not involve the subordination of the district councils to the county councils, willcontinue.7. The Government consider that the existing county boroughs should bebrought within the uniform system proposed. The division between county boroughs and administrative counties is one of the main defects of the presentsystem. This division must be ended. Only thus will it be possible for large towns and the areas which surround them to be properly planned and properlyserved. The Government wish to ensure the healthy development of the fourcounty boroughs; in their view this can best be done by integrating them fully into the wider communities of which they are part.II. BASIC STRUCTURE: THE ALLOCATION OF FUNCTIONSAllocation of the More Important Functions8. Given that the main executive functions of local government should be divided between two sets of local authorities, the new structure will dependprimarily on how these functions are allocated.&apos; The principle of theseproposals is that the new county councils and the new district councils musteach have a range of important responsibilities which they can performeconomically and efficiently, which will provide satisfying work for elected members, and which will together form a balanced and coherent set of func-tions for each council as a whole and for their officers working as a team. InAppendix II there is a detailed list of the main functions, showing the alloca-tion how proposed. Essentially, the new county councils will be made res-ponsible for those functions for which large areas or large populations, or both, are required: examples are the strategic aspects of town and country planning, the planning,. construction and maintenance of roads, traffic management, the education service, the personal social services, the fire service. The new district councils will be responsible for those functions whichcan be satisfactorily administered on a more local scale: examples are housing,the more detailed aspects of town and country planning, refuse collection andpublic cleansing.The personal health services9. The Government have announced their intention to unify the administra-tion of the National Health Service, which will be administered by health authorities outside local government. Responsibility for the personal health services at present provided by county councils and county borough councilswill be transferred to the new health authorities.* Circular 116/70 (Welsh Office), 12 November 1970. HMSO.2
Police authorities10. Four joint police authorities have been established in Wales, coveringrespectively the five North Wales counties, the six counties in Mid and west wales, the geographical county of Glamorgan and the geographical county ofMonmouthshire. It is intended that these police authorities should continue and the necessary administrative adjustments for this purpose should bebrought about.Functions of the New County Councils11. Following the publication of the White Paper of July 1967 there werediscussions with the local authority associations during which opposingarguments were deployed on the extent to which district councils should be involved in the discharge of a number of functions for which the primary responsibility rests at present with county councils and county borough councils: the functions discussed were education, the personal health services,welfare services, children&apos;s services, town and country planning, highwaysand traffic management, libraries, weights and measures, trade descriptions,the composition and description of food and drugs, smallholdings and animaldiseases. For all of these functions except smallholdings and children&apos;services, there is provision under the existing law for some non-county boroughand district councils, either as of right or by decision of the appropriate minister, to exercise responsibilities which are otherwise discharged by countycouncils. The detailed provisions vary with each service. In general the Govern-ment accept the criticisms of these provisions implied in the Report of theRoyal Commission on Local Government in England,* which mentionedtheir complexity and their effect in producing a pock-marked pattern ofcounty administration. In all these services the Government are clear that themain responsibility must reman with the county councils.Education and the personal social services12. In education and the personal social services the compulsory delegation of responsibilities to district councils and the provisions requiring the settingup of divisional executives should be ended. In education, the Borough ofRhondda is at present an excepted district, and four county councils operatedivisional administration over parts of their areas. These forms of administra-tion can seriously impair the effectiveness of the education service and in-crease the risks of friction between county and district councils withoutsubstantial compensating advantages. The existing schemes of divisionaladministration will not therefore be replaced when they lapse on the dis-appearance of the existing authorities, and there will be no statutory provisionfor making new ones. Similarly, excepted districts will have no place in the newlocal government structure. As for the social services, the Borough Council ofRhondda exercise claimed delegated health and welfare (but not children)functions under the Local Government Act 1958. Action is being taken undersection 10 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 to revoke Rhondda&apos;sdelegation scheme in so far as it relates to social services functions, and none ofthe new district councils will have any delegated social services functions.* Royal Commission on Local Government in England, 1966-69. Report. Cmnd. 4040,paragraph 72, HMSO, 1969.
13. The general principle of the new proposals for town and country planning is that the new county councils should have the undivided respon-sibility for preparing development plans, including both the structure plans and the local plans which are the main elements in the new procedures laiddown in the Town and Country Planning Act 1968. (This is subject to thespecial arrangements mentioned in paragraph 48 below). But the district councils&apos; would have the right to be consulted during the preparation of plans, and would have major responsibilities for securing their implementationthrough their development control powers and their powers for the acquisition,development and redevelopment of land (see paragraph 17).Development control14. The new district councils will be given direct responsibility, in their own right and not by delegation from the county councils, for deciding mostplanning applications in their areas. All planning applications will be made tothe district councils. To ensure that planning control is exercised in harmony with plan making, the advice of the planning officers of the county councilsmust be readily available to the district councils when they are taking decisions on planning applications. The planning officers must of course be familiar with local considerations. The county councils will be involved in decidingplanning applications only where these involve major matters of policy or where they are in limited categories for example, mineral working specifically -cally reserved for their decisions. This will mean that by far the larger propor-tion of planning applications will be determined by the district councils.Highways and traffic management15. All the direct responsibilities for highways and traffic managementwill be allocated to the new county councils. This will mean changes in theexisting law under which all borough and urban district councils are respon-sible for unclassified roads in their areas, and borough and urban district councils with populations of 20,000 or more may claim to undertake theimprovement and maintenance of county roads in their areas, approved ex-penditure being met by the county councils. These existing provisions areconfusing and inefficient, particularly in that the claiming arrangementsinvolve work on plans and estimates being duplicated in the county and district councifs highway departments. Members of district councils will ofcourse be concerned about the upkeep of roads, road improvements, newhighway schemes and traffic management schemes, not only because of theirdirect implications, but also because of their links with matters for whichdistrict councils would be responsible, such as town centre redevelopment,development control, and new housing schemes. Ways will have to be found by which the interests of district councils can be adequately expressed.However, a basic condition of any arrangement must be that professional high-ways and traffic management staff should be employed as one body by thecounty council.Libraries, weights and measures, trade descriptions and food and drugs16. In these services, the Government think it right to allow for the possi-bility that where a district council has a sufficiently large population to
provide them economically and efficiently and their provision by the districtcouncil would not substantially damage the service in the remainder of thecounty, the district council should be allowed to provide the service. It is not thought that there will be more than a few places in Wales where these condi-tions will be met. It is proposed that the responsible Minister should havepower to provide before the appointed day that a particular district council or district councils should be entitled to assume full responsibility for the library services, the weights and measures and trade description services, andthe enforcement of the law on the composition and labelling of food and drugs.Decisions on this issue would have to be taken well before the appointed dayso that arrangements with regard to staff, property, finance, and the localorganisation of the services could be made in good time. The details will bediscussed with the local authority associations.Functions of the New District Councils17. These will consist essentially of the functions most closely and directlyconnected with the physical fabric of individual towns and villages and the countryside; namely housing, including slum clearance, house and area im-provement, housebuilding and housing management; building regulations;development control; acquisition and disposal of land for planning purposes;development and redevelopment; provision of land and other assistance to industry and clearance of derelict land; along with clean air, the controlof nuisances, food hygiene, refuse collection and disposal, coast protection,the provision of parks, playing fields, museums, art galleries, public baths,public washhouses, public conveniences, markets and slaughterhouses andburials and cremations.Sewerage and water supply18. The Central Advisory Water Committee are currently considering thefuture organisation of the sewerage services which are at present provided in wales by the borough and district councils or by joint boards, and of watersupply, which is at present the responsibility in Wales of some local authoritiesand joint boards and two water companies. Until the Committee have re-ported and the Government have been able to consider their recommenda-tions it is not possible to say what will be done about the new district councils&apos;responsibilities in these fields.National parks19. No substantial changes are proposed in the present law on planning functions in national parks. The new county councils and other interested bodies will in due course be consulted about the possibility of establishingplanning boards for parks which will extend into more than one new county.Registration of local land charges20. The local authority associations were consulted in 1969 on the practica-bility of ending the dual system of registration of local land charges and makingthe new district councils responsible for the registration of all charges, inaccordance with the recommendation of the Stainton Committee.&quot;1 Since then* Report of the Committee on Local Land Charges. Cmnd. 8440. HMSO, 1952.5
the Law Commission have resumed work on the subject and it is hoped thatit will be possible to take account of the Commission^ views in reaching adecision on the issue of local authority responsibility.Powers of Community Councils21. The powers of community councils in the new structure need to beconsidered in relation to the powers of district councils, since most of the mare bound to be exercised concurrently. As far as executive functions are con-cerned, the Government are clear that community councils ought to have,substantially, the powers of the existing parish councils.III. THE NEW ADMINISTRATIVE MAP OF WALES22. The proposals of the previous administration for the areas of the new authorities have been carefully considered, in the light of the known viewsof the existing authorities. In carrying out this review one crucial factor hasbeen the minimum sizes of population necessary to support economicallythe responsibilities to be assigned to the new county and district councils.These figures are not capable of mathematical proof. They must be mattersof informed judgement. The Governments view is that for authorities responsible for education and the personal social services one should aim at a population of at least 250,000. It must be emphasised that this figure is put forward as the desirable minimum. It does not imply that much largerfigures are not entirely acceptable where there are good reasons for them:for example, reasons based on the social and geographic characteristics ofan area or on the need to avoid as far as possible the division of existingstrong administrative units. On the other hand, it may be necessary for othergeographic reasons to accept population figures below the desirable minimumin some instances. The figure of 250,000 has the support of the conclusions ofthe R.oyal Commission on Local Government in England,* which were to alarge extent confirmed, in relation to very different kinds of areas, by theconclusions of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland.f23. For county councils and district councils alike it is necessary to considernot only the needs of the individual services for which they will be responsiblebut also the desirability of devising areas which will be large enough, populousenough, and varied enough to provide a sufficient flow of interesting andrewarding work for elected members and a strong team of officers. All the newdistrict councils must have sufficient work and resources to provide a satisfyingcareer to those who work for them. The ability of the new district councils tomeet these requirements will not depend only on the range of functions whichare assigned to them; equally important are the size of the area and its popu-lation, which will together determine the volume of work and the range of problems on which the officers will have to advise. The present proposals are based on the proposition that a population of 40,000 is a desirable minimumto be aimed at in working out a pattern of districts.* Cmnd. 4040, paragraphs 256-265.t Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland. Cmnd. 4150,paragraph 566. HMSO, 1969.
24. However, these suggested minimum populations for the new counties and the new districts have to be considered along with two other important factors the sparsity of population over much of Wales, and the need tohave regard as far as practicable to the loyalties within existing administrativeareas. It follows that there must continue to be wide variations in the popula-tion sizes of the new Welsh counties and districts.Wales Outside Glamorgan and Monmouthshire25. The revised proposals are described in detail in Appendix III and shown on the map. In general, the Government accept the proposals made bythe previous administration for counties and districts outside Glamorgan and monmouthshire. It is intended to continue with the proposals to create twocounties in North Wales rather than one, and to leave the boundary betweenthe counties of Glamorgan and Dyfed as the present boundary in the AmmanValley. It is proposed, however, to alter the proposals of the previous adminis-tration in three areas; the Conway Valley, the southern edge of Breconshire,and the present county of Pembrokeshire.The Conway Valley26. The present boundary between Caernarvonshire and Denbighshirefollows the River Conway for the greater part of its course. But there are twosubstantial areas the Creuddyn peninsula (which includes Llandudno) andthe parish of Maenan lying to the east of the river which are in Caernarvon-shire and not Denbighshire. The line has, with some slight modifications,formed the boundary since 1284. The Local Government Commission for wales considered* that the boundary was unsatisfactory in that it dividedcommunities having common interest, that the whole of the Conway Valleyshould be in one county, and that this should be a north-western rather thana north-eastern county. Several local authorities in the area have also sug-gested that the boundary is unsatisfactory.27. It is considered that this is an area where the advantages of unifyingthe administration of the valley outweigh the objections to dividing an existingcounty and existing districts, and that a boundary adjustment similar to that suggested in the Local Government Commission^ draft proposals would be appropriate. The line suggested by the Commission was one unrelated to existing administrative boundaries, and there would be considerable practicaldifficulties in legislating for it. However, it should be possible to devise aline related to existing district and parish boundaries which would remove the worst of the defects of the present boundary. It is suggested, therefore,that the Urban District of Llanrwst and the parishes of Llansantffraid GlanConway (Aled Rural District), Eglwysbach, Llanddoget, Llanrwst Rural andTir Ifan (Hiraethog Rural District) should form part of Gwynedd.The southern edge of Breconshire28. The small towns and villages of Breconshire, south of the watershedof the Brecon Beacons, are closely linked economically and socially with the* Local Government Commission for Wales: Report and Proposals for Wales. HMSO,1963.
neighbouring areas in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. The Local Govern-ment Commission* recommended that this southern part of Breconshireshould be united for administrative purposes with Glamorgan and Monmouth-shire. The majority of the local authorities directly concerned support such achange on the grounds that it would strengthen the administration of thearea, and be much more convenient from the point of view of access to the likely centres of district and county administration.29. The population and resources of Powys would be small even if its constituent counties remained intact, and a decision to reduce them furtherneeds particularly careful consideration. Nevertheless the likely advantages tothe areas concerned would justify the transfer to Monmouthshire of the urban District of Brynmawr and the parish of Llanelly, (from CrickhowellRural District) and the transfer to Glamorgan of the parishes of Penderynand Vaynor (from Vaynor and Penderyn Rural District), The case for trans-ferring Ystradgynlais Rural District is less strong, and for this reason andalso because the Rural District Council do not favour such a transfer, it isproposed that the Rural District should form part of the county of Powys.Pembrokeshire30. Under the original proposals of the previous administration the presentcounty of Pembrokeshire would have been divided between three districtswithin the new county of Dyfed. As part of the revised proposals which were announced in November 1968, the county was instead to be divided into twodistricts.31. The Pembrokeshire County Council and most of the borough and district councils in the county agree that the county should remain a unit oflocal government. There are, however, sharp differences of opinion on how this should be achieved. The County Council have proposed that the presentcounty, perhaps with boundary adjustments, should form a unitary authority,responsible for all the major local government services. This suggestion is opposed by most of the borough and district councils, who want the countyto be divided into at least two districts, though there is strong feeling amongmost of them in favour of maintaining Pembrokeshire as an administrativecounty.32. As has already been made clear, the Government are not prepared toaccept that any part of Wales should form a unitary authority. They aresatisfied also that the proposal for a new county of Dyfed must stand andthat the population of Pembrokeshire is not large enough to allow it to remain as a separate administrative county. The choice then is between having twodistricts in Pembrokeshire on the lines proposed by the previous administra-tion or making the whole of the present county one new district.33. The main arguments in favour of having two districts are that these will be sufficiently large in population to be effective units, that Milford Havenand the Cleddau estuary together make up a considerable physical barrierwithin the county, and that the existence of two district councils instead of* Local Government Commission for Wales: Draft Proposals. Published by the Commis-sion, 1961.
one will provide substantially greater opportunities for holding elected publicoffice. On the other hand, it is argued that to make Pembrokeshire one districtwill accord with the wishes of the inhabitants, who would much prefer thecounty to remain an administrative unit of some kind. Further, it is suggestedthat industrial development on either side of Milford Haven and the construc-tion of a bridge across the estuary will bring the different parts of the countytogether and indeed make it undesirable to separate them for the purpose of district council functions, including in particular development control and functions relating to industrial development. The Government accept thearguments for maintaining the unity of Pembrokeshire and have concluded that the right answer is to make the present county one district.Glamorgan and Monmouthshire34. The previous administration proposed that Glamorgan and Monmouth-shire should be treated differently from the rest of Wales.* They proposedthat there should be three unitary areas incorporating the present administra-tive counties and four county boroughs. There would be no executive secondtier. These proposals aroused widespread opposition. In the governments view they are not the right answer, and they must be put aside.35. This area contains half the population of Wales. It is one of the greatestconcentrations of industry in the United Kingdom, and it has a proud tradition of democratic local government. The Governments objective has been to devise proposals which will safeguard this tradition and enable South EastWales to develop to the full its potential for economic growth. At the sametime the pattern of administration in South East Wales should be of a kindwith that in the rest of the Principality so that Wales as a whole has a uniformsystem of local government well suited to the nation&apos;s needs.36. The Government propose that South East Wales should be organisedas three strong counties and seventeen districts, with community councils in the rural areas and in urban areas as well where public opinion calls forthem.37. There is good evidence that socially, economically and geographicallySouth East Wales falls into three well defined areas. In the west there is the region which looks naturally to Swansea and to the industrially importantareas of Neath and Port Talbot. East of a line running roughly north-South from Hirwaun to Porthcawl, the mining valleys and the Vale focus on Cardiff.Newport, in spite of its relative proximity to Cardiff, is the natural focus of theMonmouthshire valleys.38. The Governments proposals mean that Swansea, Cardiff and Newportwould be integrated with the areas for which they are the service and com-mercial centres, and from which industrial areas in their own right they drawworkers.39. The three counties now proposed would be the three most powerfullocal government units in Wales. East Glamorgan, including the presentcounty boroughs of Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil would have a larger population* Local Government Reorganisation in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. Cmnd. 4310.HMSO, 1970.
(by some 24 %) than the present administrative county. Its services would beintegrated with those at present provided by Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil:there is general agreement that such integration is desirable.40. The Government accept that the administration of the Rhymney Valleyshould be unified within an authority looking to Cardiff rather than toNewport, and that the boundary should run along the watershed to the east ofthe Rhymney river as far as possible. They consider, moreover, that theparishes of Michaelstone-y-Fedw, Marshfield and Peterstone Wentlooge aswell as the parish of St. Mellons should be included in East Glamorgan.41. The new county including most of Monmouthshire and the countyborough of Newport would be the second largest of the new Welsh countiesin terms of population, and West Glamorgan, including the present countyborough of Swansea, would be the third in terms of population.42. The Government have given anxious thought to the only alternativeswhich in their view are worth considering. The first would leave undividedthe present administrative county of Glamorgan, while including within itthe three county boroughs of Caridff, Swansea and Merthyr Tydfil. (Most ofthe administrative county of Monmouthshire together with Newport would constitute a new county as in the proposals already described.) This would notdivide the administration of the present county of Glamorgan, which operateslarge scale services in keeping with the size of its population, on which thenew county&apos;s services could build. There are, however, serious disadvantages.The new county would have nearly twice the population of the presentadministrative county and nearly half the population of Wales. The countywould be pulled apart by the competing interests of two major cities fortymiles from each other. The opportunities for public service as members ofthe county council would be greatly reduced as compared with the presentcouncils of the administrative county and the three county boroughs. Thearguments clearly point in favour of recognising the effective line of division between East and West Glamorgan and creating two powerful administrativebodies which will rank with any in the United Kingdom.43. The second alternative would be to divide the present administrativecounty of Glamorgan and the three oounty boroughs into three or more counties.There are again strong objections to this. First, it would further divide theexisting county administration. Secondly, to divide the proposed county of east Glamorgan would inevitably mean the separation of areas which oughtto be administered together for the purposes of town and country planning and transportation. Thirdly to separate Cardiff and its neighbouring areas from either Mid-Glamorgan, or the north-eastern Glamorgan valleys, or from both, would mean the creation of at least one authority which was com-paratively weak in terms of rateable resources, and was handicapped by lackof resources and lack of suitable land in seeking solutions to its problems.The Detailed Proposals for the New Counties44. Details of the counties now proposed follow. It is proposed to adoptthe names Clwyd, Dyfed, Gwent, Gwynedd and Powys, which have founda fair amount of acceptance. The names of East Glamorgan and West Glam-organ are adopted provisionally.
(a) Clwyd:(Population: 354,000; Acreage: 599,000; Rateable Value:  13-9 million.)This would be an amalgamation of Denbighshire (except for the area to beincluded in Gwynedd), Flintshire and Edeyrnion Rural District.(b) Dyfed:(Population: 319,000; Acreage: 1,425,000; Rateable Value:  10-5 million.)This would be an amalgamation of Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire andPembrokeshire.(c) East Glamorgan:(Population: 928,000; Acreage: 359,000; Rateable Value:  32-1 million.)This would be an amalgamation of Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil county boroughs, that part of the County of Glamorgan not included in WestGlamorgan, the parishes of Penderyn and Vaynor, (Vaynor and [PenderynRural District), the Urban Districts of Bedwas and Machen and Rhymney,the wards of Aberbargoed, Cwmsyfiog, New Tredegar and Phillipstown inBedwellty Urban District and the parishes of Marshfield, Michaelstone-y-Fedw, Peterstone Wentlooge and St. Mellons (Magor and St. Mellons rural district).(d) West Glamorgan:(Population: 371,000; Acreage: 201,000; Rateable Value:  17 million.)This would be an amalgamation of Swansea County Borough and the Boroughsof Neath and Port Talbot, the Urban Districts of Glyncorrwg and Llwchwrand the Rural Districts of Gower, Pontardawe and Neath (except the parishof Rhigos) in Glamorgan.(e) Gwent:(Population: 442,000; Acreage: 335,000; Rateable Value:  16-4 million.)This would be an amalgamation of Newport County Borough, the County ofMonmouthshire except those parts to be included in the East GlamorganCounty, the Urgan District of Brynmawr and the parish of Llanelly (Crick-howell Rural District),(f) Gwyned:(Population: 221,000; Acreage: 956,000; Rateable Value:  6-7 million.)This would be an amalgamation of Anglesey, Caernarvonshire and Merioneth,except for Edeyrnion Rural District, together with Llanrwst Urban district and the parishes of Llansantffraid Glan Conway (in Aled Rural District),Eglwysbach, Llanddoget, Llanrwst Rural and Tir Ifan (in Hiraethog rural district) which are at present in Denbighshire.(g) Powys:(Population: 100,000; Acreage: 1,255,000; Rateable Value:  2-6 million.)This would be an amalgamation of Breconshire (except for Brynmawr urban district and the parishes of Llanelly (Crickhowell Rural District), Penderynand Vaynor (Vaynor and Penderyn Rural District)), Montgomeryshire andRadnorshire.The New Districts in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire45. A further study has been made of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire inthe light of the decision to incorporate all the county boroughs into thedistrict structure. The proposed distribution of new districts (as well as of the
new counties) is shown in detail in Appendix III and on the map. Considera-tions affecting the proposals for the three new South Wales counties are also mentioned briefly below:West Glamorgan:(a) In view of the economic and social links between Gower and Swansea,Swansea is linked with Gower Rural District, except for the parish of Llanrhi-dian Higher, which is linked with Llwchwr Urban District and PontardawRural District.East Glamorgan:(b) The City of Cardiff forms one new district, with the addition of PenarthUrban District and the bordering parishes of Lisvane, Llanedeyrn, Marsh-field, Michaelstone-y-Fedw, Peterstone Wentlooge, Radyr, St. Fagans, St.Mellons and Tongwynlais, all of which have strong ties with the City.(c) The district structure in the Pontypridd/Llantrisant area has beenrecast to take account of the emergence of Llantrisant as a major growthcentre and the former Pontypridd district has been expanded to include thewhole of Llantrisant and Llantwit Fardre Rural District together with someof the adjoining parishes of Cardiff and Cowbridge Rural Districts. It shouldbe noted that this proposal does not assume any particular decision with regardto the proposed new town at Llantrisant. It is based on the evidence of continued growth in the area, quite apart from the new town proposal.(d) The Cynon Valley district now includes the parish of Rhigos fromNeath Rural District and the Parish of Penderyn from Vaynor and PenderynRural District.(e) The Merthyr Tydfil district includes the parish of Vaynor.(f) The Rhymney Valley district will now be in East Glamorgan.Gwent:(g) Newport forms one new district, with the addition of Caerleon urban district and the whole of Magor and St. Mellons Rural District except forthe four parishes to be included in East Glamorgan and the parish of Henllyswhich would be included with the Eastern Valley district. The administrationof the coastal area needs to be unified, and this can best be done by the districtnow proposed.Further Modifications of Boundaries46. Where circumstances particularly require there are departures from thegeneral policy of amalgamating whole districts. For each such departure,however, an existing administrative boundary, whether of a parish or of award, is used. There are many boundary anomalies which it is desirable to remedy. However, it will not be possible to deal with them in the reorganisa-tion bill itself, and it will be necessary to devise a procedure for correctinganomalies after the appointed day. Under the previous administration therewere discussions with the local authority associations about a simplifiedprocedure for this purpose, based on the present system, where the initiativelies with interested local authorities themselves. This is one possible solution.A variant would be for a standing commission, including people with directexperience of local government, to be appointed to review boundaries with
the aim of rectifying anomalies. The same commission might also haveresponsibilities for carrying out reviews of communities after the appointed day (see paragraph 51 below) and for keeping local authority electoral areasup-to-date. Comments are invited on this possibility, which is being examined by the Government along with the proposals of the previous administration.The Capital of Wales47. The proposals for counties and districts will not affect Cardiff&apos;s positionas the capital of Wales. The distinguishing marks of a capital city will remain.The people of Wales will continue to regard Cardiff as their capital. the welsh Office is in Cardiff, and with the transfer to the Secretary of State for wales of responsibility for primary and secondary education and for thechildren&apos;s services in Wales, more of the important decisions affecting wales will be taken in Cardiff. The city status of Cardiff, as of Swansea, will bemaintained, and enhanced by extensions of boundaries.48. Cardiff is not only the capital of Wales but it will be the only newdistrict with a population exceeding a quarter of a million and will therefore have a far greater concentration of population than any other new district.For this reason it will have planning problems which will be unique in wales and which will require massive and continuous efforts by the City Council asredevelopment authority if they are to be solved. It is therefore proposed thatthere should be special arrangements whereby the new Cardiff City council will have power to prepare the local plan or plans for their area under section of the Town and Country Planning Act 1968. The plans would have to conform with the structure plans prepared by the County Council for East Glamorganbut they would set out in detail how the structure plans were to be implemented in the City.IV. THE COMMUNITIES49. It is proposed (paragraph 21 above) that the new community councils should have essentially the same executive powers as the present parish councils. The community councils would be able to express local wishes and needs, and they would be set up wherever there was an evident local desireto have such bodies.50. The present rural parishes would not be a satisfactory basis for asystem of community councils, partly because many of the parishes are too small to support effective councils and partly because many urban areas,where there might well be a demand for community councils in the new structure, are not within the pattern of rural parishes. It is intended therefore to proceed with the suggestion made in the White Paper of 1967* that thereshould be a review as soon as possible after the appointed day to produce anew pattern of communities and community councils, the latter to be set upin urban areas as well as in what are now rural districts wherever there was an evident demand for them.51. Under the previous administration it was proposed that these reviewsshould be carried out by the new county councils. In view of the urgency and* Cmrid. 3340, paragraphs 23 and 24.
importance of the task, and the likelihood that the new county councils willbe heavily engaged with other matters in the period immediately after theappointed day, consideration is being given to the possibility that the reviewsmight be undertaken by a commission, which would also be responsible for reviewing the detailed boundaries of the main authorities (see paragraph 46above).52. It would not be feasible to set up a new system of communities in Walessimultaneously with a new system of counties and districts (there are over890 rural parishes in Wales, quite apart from those urban areas in which the setting up of community councils might be justified). Transitional arrangements will therefore be necessary to cover the period between the appointed day andthe completion of the special review mentioned in the preceding paragraph.It is proposed that rural parishes which have parish councils immediately before the appointed day should have community councils during the tran-transitional period. Consideration will be given to setting up similar transitionalbodies for existing urban districts and boroughs, where there is evidence ofa local desire expressed, for example, by the existing local authorities tohave such bodies. These arrangements would apply to those rural parishesand urban districts which will be joined with existing county boroughs toform new districts.V. BOROUGHS53. The titles of borough and city, and the honorific attributes at presentattaching to boroughs, will be continued in the forms best suited to local circumstances. The history of the borough in Wales is inseparable from thehistory of the borough in England. For this reason, it is considered that the detailed arrangements for the place of the borough in the new local govern-ment structure in Wales must be compatible with the arrangements for theEnglish boroughs. Detailed discussions will proceed on this basis.VI. ALL-WALES MACHINERY54. The Commission on the Constitution have not yet completed their work.Until they do so it would be wrong to take decisions on the future of an all-Wales machinery. Meanwhile the Welsh Council, whose members are appointedby the Secretary of State, will continue its valuable and important work.VII. FINANCE55. The Government will publish later this year a Green Paper setting outthe possibilities in the field of local government finance. This will cover suchsubjects as the financial relationships between central and local governmentand within local government. It will deal with sources of revenue includingrevised arrangements for Government grants and proposals for the improve-ment of the rating system. The Government have already carried their exam-ination far enough to be satisfied that the structural reforms outlined in this document can go forward without prejudicing alternative financial arrange-ments, but it is their view that rates must continue to be the main local tax.
Electoral Matters56. The Royal Commission on Local Government in England recommendedthat the areas of main authorities should be divided into single-memberelectoral areas ;* that all the members of all main authorities should be elected on the same day;f that there should be an enquiry into whether three years(as at present) or four would be a better term of office for members of mainauthorities ;J and also an enquiry into whether spring or autumn is the bettertime for holding local government elections ;g and that the maximum numberof elected members of main authorities should be seventy-five, f These recom-mendations are relevant to Wales as well as to England, and the Governmentwill consider the views of the interested parties on them before reachingconclusions.Aldermen57. Another recommendation of the Royal Commission on Local Govern-ment in England which is relevant to Wales is that the office of aldermanshould be abolished.** In making this recommendation the Royal Commissionfollowed the Committee on the Management of Local Government.jj Atpresent aldermen constitute one quarter of the council in all counties andboroughs in Wales.Payment of members58. There is a strong case for improving the allowances at present paid to members and the Government will consult further about this with the localauthority associations. The payment of salaries, however, raises important issues of principle which the Government have under consideration.Disqualification from membership59. Under the present law an employee of a local authority may not stand for election to his employing council. The Government are clear that this rule should be retained, in the wider public interest. Their proposals to reorganiselocal government on the basis of two sets of executive authorities everywherewill mean that local government employees, though still debarred from servingon their employing authority, will all now have a chance to stand for election to the other authority in whose area they live.* Cmnd. 4040, paragraph 463.t Cmnd. 4040, paragraph 470.% Cmnd. 4040, paragraph 473.S Cmnd. 4040, paragraph 477.H Cmnd. 4040, paragraph 456.** Cmnd. 4040, paragraph 460.ft Report of the Committees on the Management of Local Government. HMSO, 1967.
IX. TRANSITIONAL MATTERSTiming of legislation61. The Government propose to introduce legislation to reorganise localgovernment in Wales in the 1971/72 session of Parliament. This would define the areas of the new counties and districts, lay down the constitutions and functions of the new authorities and make the necessary provision for the transition from the existing system to the new one. If Parliament enactedlegislation in the 1971/72 session it would provide for the new authoritiesto come into full operation on 1 April, 1974 that is the appointed day.The appointed day for the reorganisation of the National Health service would be the same.First elections62. During the period between the enactment of legislation and theappointed day, a period of perhaps twenty months, the first major task willbe to determine the electoral areas and the number of councillors for each ofthe new counties and districts as a preliminary to the holding of elections for&quot;shadow councils&quot;, in 1973. Arrangements for holding the first elections willbe discussed with the local authority associations.Management63. The &quot;shadow authorities&quot; will, between their election and the date onwhich they take over their full responsibilities, need to appoint their chief officers and settle the broad principles of their organisation. The local authority associations are already considering in co-operation with the Governmenthow the lessons of the best modern experience can be made available to thenew councils when they are set up.Staff64. The 1967 White Paper&quot; proposed that a Welsh Staff Commission shouldbe established to consider and keep under review arrangements for the recruitment and transfer of all local government employees, to consider suchstaffing problems arising from reorganisation as might be referred to themby the Secretary of State, and to advise him of steps needed to safeguard theinterests of staff affected by reorganisation. Further details of this proposal were presented in a paper sent for comments to the bodies concerned inMay 1970. In addition, the English Royal Commission recommendedf thatthere should be a review of compensation arrangements and this suggestion* Cmnd. 3340, paragraph 45.t Cmnd. 4040, paragraph 564.60. The Government consider that it would be wrong to introduce new machinery for investigating complaints alleging maladministration on thepart of local authorities at the time when the new authorities are being set up.They will, however, keep this question under review when the new authoritieshave been established.
will be relevant to Wales as well as to England. The proposal to appoint aWelsh Staff Commission has been widely welcomed and the Governmentfully accept the need for such a body to work out fair and effective arrangementsfor the transfer of staff. They will therefore continue the discussions initiated by the previous administration and also consult the interested bodies aboutcompensation arrangements and related matters.Other transitional matters65. During this transitional period, too, much detailed provision will haveto be made by orders to supplement the provisions of the reorganisation bill.Transitional arrangements for a large number of services, detailed provisionfor the allocation of the property and staff of the existing authorities and the adaptation of much local legislation will be necessary. It is unlikely to bepossible for a complete review of Welsh local Acts to be carried out before 1April 1974, of the sort that was carried out in Greater London before the hand-over to the new authorities there. Some local legislation will have to be adaptedin detail before 1 April 1974 to ensure a smooth transition to the new structure of local government and orders amending or repealing these as necessary willbe made in consultation with the local authorities affected. For other local legislation it is envisaged that the new local authorities should take over the responsibilities and powers from the existing authorities and exercise them foran interim period within the area or over the property to which they appliedbefore the appointed day; and that as soon as possible after the appointed day, either by new legislation promoted by the new local authorities or byorders made by the Secretary of State at the request of the new local authorities,the large body of existing Welsh local legislation would be adapted to the needsof the new local authorities. Discussions will take place in due course with localauthorities with powers under local legislation about which provisions arelikely to require adaptation in detail before the appointed day.X. CONCLUSION66. Briefly, the Government propose that the whole of Wales should be reorganised as a two tier structure of main authorities, with seven countycouncils and thirty six district councils. Most of the county councils wouldhave populations in the range 200,000-430,000, though there would be on every thinly populated one Powys with just 100,000 population in about1.3 million acres and one heavily populated one East Glamorgan, with over900,000. Most of the district councils would have populations in the range40,000-100,000, though there would be a few below 40,000 and one verylarge one based on the existing City of Cardiff with a population of 316,000.The main functions of the new county councils would be highways and traffic management, education, and the personal social services. The main functionsof the new district councils would be housing, refuse collection and publiccleansing, clean air, and the prevention of nuisances. Responsibility for townand country planning would be shared between county and district councils.
HISTORICAL background. The basic structure of local government in Wales derives from the majorlocal government reforms of the late nineteenth century. The Local Govern-ment Act 1888 established the thirteen existing administrative counties of wales and Monmouthshire and the county boroughs of Cardiff and Swansea.The Local Government Act 1894 consolidated a system of non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural districts within the administrative counties,but in the county boroughs a single authority remained responsible for theadministration of all local government services. Newport became a countyborough in 1891 and Merthyr Tydfil in 1908. During the present centurythere have been radical changes in the range and nature of the functionsperformed by local authorities. There have also been modifications of boundar-ies and a modest reduction in the number of district councils, particularlyunder the Local Government Act 1929, but to a large extent local authoritiesstill operate within the territorial and constitutional frameworks set up eightyyears ago.2. The Local Government Commission for Wales considered the thirteencounties and four county boroughs. They put forward draft proposals* for creating, substantially by amalgamations, five administrative counties in placeof the present thirteen. This reduction was to be achieved by associating areasof comparatively high population density in the north and south with the moresparsely populated areas of Mid-Wales. They also proposed extensions tothe county boroughs of Cardiff and Newport, a minor adjustment of the boundary of Swansea and the conversion of Merthyr Tydfil into a non-countyborough. The draft proposals were strongly contested, and after conferenceswith local authorities and other interested bodies, the Commission, in theirReportf of 1962, Iwhile (maintaining the substance of the draft proposals forthe county boroughs, put forward revised proposals for seven new administra-tive counties, which involved divisions of several existing counties. Theseproposals also were strongly contested by local authorities. In the event theCommission^ recommendations for the counties were not accepted and theGovernment undertook in February 1964 to prepare proposals themselves.3. In 1965, Mr. James Griffiths, then Secretary of State, set up an Inter-Departmental Working Party to examine the functions and boundaries of all categories of local authorities in Wales. This Working Party were allowed toproceed with their task even though Royal Commissions were set up in 1966to carry out wide-ranging reviews of local government in England and Scot-land. The Working Party consisted of senior officers of the Governmentdepartments most closely concerned, together with Professor Ivor Gowan ofthe Department of Political Science at the University College of Wales,Aberystwyth. They consulted on a confidential basis a number of local author-ity advisers during the course of their work.* Local Government Commission for Wales: Draft Proposals. Published by the Commis-sion, 1961.t Local Government Commission for Wales: Report and Proposals for Wales. HMSO,1963.
4. In July 1967, while the Royal Commissions on England and scottish local Government were still at work, a White Paper* was published, proposingan evolutionary approach to local government reorganisation in Wales. Itsuggested five new administrative counties to replace the present thirteen, asfollows:Dyfed:       Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire and PembrokeshireGlamorgan: the existing county minus the Rhymney ValleyGwent:       the existing county of Monmouthshire plus the RhymneyValleyGwynedd:   Anglesey,  Caernarvonshire,  Denbighshire,   Flintshire  andMerionethPowys:       Breconshire, Montgomeryshire and RadnorshireIt proposed to follow the Local Government Commission for Wales in provid-ing for Cardiff, Newport and Swansea to remain county boroughs (withboundary adjustments to Swansea) and for Merthyr Tydfil to become a non-county borough. (By this time the boundaries of Cardiff and Newport hadbeen substantially extended by order of the Secretary of State). The white paper also proposed that thirty-six new districts should be created in the placeof the existing 164 county districts and the county borough of Merthyr Tydfil.The present parishes should be reorganised by the new county councils afterthe main reorganisation, and similar councils should be set up in urban areas where the inhabitants so wished.5. After consultation with the local authority associations and with individual -dual local authorities, Mr. George Thomas, then Secretary of State, announced in November 1968 that he considered that the evolutionary approach followed in the 1967 White Paper was likely to be the most satisfactory for Wales atthat time and that the pattern of areas proposed in the White Paper was, ingeneral, the most likely to meet the criteria of effective and convenient localgovernment. He proposed four modifications of the earlier proposals, themost important of which was that there should be two counties in north wales instead of one. Thus Gwynedd should consist of Anglesey, Caernarvon-shire and Merioneth (except for Edeyrnion Rural District), while a new countyto be called Clwyd should comprise Denbighshire, Flintshire and EdeyrnionRural District. It was also announced that the district proposals for Dyfedwould be modified so as to make the whole of Cardiganshire a single district,thus reducing the total number of proposed districts by one to thirty-five.6. The report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Englandfwas published in June 1969, and local authorities and their associations weregiven an opportunity to say whether, having considered the Royal Commis-sion&apos;s recommendations, they wished to modify the views they had already expressed on the White Paper of July 1967.7. In October 1969 it was announced that in the light of the commentsreceived, and having regard also to the view of the Royal Commissions on local Government in England! and Scotland j that the division between town* Local Government in Wales.

and country for local government purposes ought to be ended, the Govern-ment were undertaking a further review with the object of seeing if a satisfac-tory pattern of local government could be worked out for the geographicalcounties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire which would avoid the division between county boroughs and administrative counties.8. The outcome of this review was a White Paper* published in March 1970in which the previous Administration stated their opinion that a system ofunitary authorities of the sort proposed by the Royal Commission for Englandwould be more satisfactory than a tier system in Glamorgan and Monmouth-shire. The White Paper proposed three unitary authorities, two broadlycomprising the area of the present geographical county of Glamorgan and onecovering Monmouthshire. These three authorities would include respectivelySwansea, Cardiff and Newport. It suggested a new boundary between Mon-mouthshire and East Glamorgan which would follow as far as practicable theeastern watershed of the Rhymney Valley, thus including in the East Glamor-gan unitary authority the urban districts of Bedwas and Machen and Rhymney,and the wards of Aberbargoed, Cwmsyfiog, New Tredegar and Phillipstownin Bedwellty Urban District. It was also proposed to include in East Glamor-gan the village of St. Mellons, now part of Magor and St. Mellons rural district, and the parish of Rhigos in Neath Rural District. The proposedboundary between the two Glamorgan unitary authorities would have been drawn so that Port Talbot and Glyncorrwg were included in West Glamorganand Bridgend and Porthcawl in East Glamorgan.* Local Government Reorganisation in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.
