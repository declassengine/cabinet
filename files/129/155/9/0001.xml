STATEMENT ON THE DEFENCE ESTIMATES 1971Amendments prepared in the light of the DOPC discussionChapter I paragraph 2Third sentence from the end to read:&quot;In the Gulf, the Government is continuing its discussions with the local Rulers on measures designed to demonstrate itscontinuing concern for the peace and stability of the area.&quot;Paragraph 12Line h, delete &quot;balance&quot; and insert &quot;mixture&quot;.Paragraphs 19-21Amend as follows:Alternative (1)&quot;The Gulf19.     The Government has now considered Sir William Luce&apos;srecommendations on British policy in the Gulf.      It believes that a Union of Arab Emirates, capable of carrying out thenormal responsibilities of a state, would best meet the needso  of the area;    and it has accordingly decided that it is right that the special treaty relations between Britain and Bahrain,Qatar and the seven Trucial States should cease by the end of1971.     Britain will then no longer have defence commitments to these countries.     Her defence commitment to Kuwait willalso cease in May this year.21.     However, the Government has no intention of severing itsconnexions with the area and is anxious to&apos; continue to make a contribution to its stability.     It is,  therefore, prepared tooffer a treaty of friendship to a Union of Arab Emirates.The Government recognises, too,  the importance of developing the/confidence
confidence of such a Union and the need for it to build upeffective and self-sufficient defence forces.     To that end,further discussions have started with the Rulers on specific measures to assist the Union in the defence field.&quot;Alternative (2)&quot;A new round of discussions with the Rulers has begun,following the Governments consideration of Sir William Luce&apos;srecommendations on British policy in the Gulf.     The discussionscover     a range of issues relating to future politicalarrangements in the area and the role that Britain is preparedto play.     An announcement on the progress that has been achieved will be made shortly.&quot;/JNote:   All references to the withdrawal dates for British forces from the Gulf will also be deleted from Chapters II onwards/7Paragraph 2hLines 15-16 delete &quot;provided by each of the three nations inInsert new paragraphs immediately after sections on &quot;South East Asia&quot;and &quot;The Gulf&quot;, as follows:&quot; Indian OceanThe Government&apos;s policies for South East Asia and theGulf emphasise the continuing value of existing defence facilities in the Indian Ocean.    These include the importantair staging facilities at Gan and Masirah;    and the navalcommunications station in Mauritius.    As already announced,the United States plans to build a naval communicationsfacility on Diego Garcia, an island in the British Indian OceanTerritory;    the Royal Navy will assist with the manning of this small facility when it becomes operational.turn.&quot;/   The Govei^nment5
The Government has made clear its view that the growingRussian naval presence in this area of strategic importanceshould be regarded as a matter of concern for all neighbouring countries, as well as for those countries, like Britain, whodepend for their livelihood upon the trade routes which pass-through the Indian Ocean, or who have other responsibilitiesor interests there.    The decision to continue to deployBritish naval forces and long range maritime reconnaissance aircraft in the area is an important contribution to Britain&apos;disability to maintain vigilance in the Indian Ocean.    in discussion at Singapore last month, Commonwealth Heads ofGovernment affirmed that the security of maritime trade routesin the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans was an issue of vitalimportance for a large number of Commonwealth countries.    they decided to set up a study group,  consisting of representativesof Australia, Britain, Canada,  India, Jamaica, Kenya, malaysia and Nigeria, with instructions to consider the matter andreport to Heads of Government through the commonwealth secretary General as soon as possible,.    The Government has agreed to participate in this study, while making it clear thatit retains the right to take such action as it considers necessary to give effect.to Britain&apos;s global defence policy.Arrangements for the study will be made in consultation withthe other Governments concerned.&quot;Rewrite as follows:&quot;The Defence Budget estimates for 1971-72 total  2,5h5m.,and will be of the order of 5i per cent of the Gross national product. At constant prices, these estimates are  1m. below the target published in Cmng. 1+521  (for details see Annex B, Table h).Paragraph 5527 January 1971
