/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJE5T Y*S government cp(71) 1429 January 1971SOCIAL SECURITY bill memorandum by the Lord President of tbe council. At their meeting on Tuesday 26 January the Legislation committee considered the draft Social Security Bill which gives effect to the decisions taken by the Cabinet at their meeting on 20 November 1970(CM(70) 40th Conclusions, Minute 4) about payment of supplementary benefit to strikers and to Increase the deduction from benefit in cases ofindustrial misconduct, and also to decisions taken in the course of the review of public expenditure to discontinue benefits for the first three days of absence from work and to limit the amount payable by way of injurybenefit plus earnings-related supplement to 85 per cent of average earnings.2. There are two points which I would bring to the notice of mycolleagues.    The first concerns the timing of the BilPs Introduction.    ThereIs no doubt that legislation to restrict abuses of the social security system is urgently needed but we shall not achieve our object if we alienate public sympathy by giving the impression that we are out to &quot;bash&quot; strikers or to undermine the social security system.    It would in my judgment be a mistake to introduce the Bill at the present time, with feeling running highin the House over the Industrial Relations Bill and with the postal strike inthe forefront of&quot;peoplefs minds.    We would do better to await a moreopportune time, perhaps two or three weeks hence, and I invite mycolleagues to give me discretion in this matter.3, The other point concerns the content of the Bill.    The proposition put to the Cabinet in CP(70) 103 and approved by them was that supplementary benefit should no longer be payable as a matter of course after the end of astrike and that any exceptional payments made in cases of hardship should berecoverable through the employer.    In practice everyone eligible for supplementary benefit may be said to be suffering hardship and to distinguisha special category of hardship cases would be impossible.    The draft Billtherefore merely provides that payments made during ths first 15 days after taking up work shall be recoverable through the employer,W WCOPY NO    y tCABINETPrivy Council Office SW129 January 1971
