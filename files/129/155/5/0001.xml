DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST yS government cp(71)5 COPY NO   0218 January 1971CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE WHITE paper memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. At the Cabinet meeting on 14 December 1970 my colleagues invited me to draft the Public Expenditure White Paper on the basis of the costingsin the Public Expenditure Survey Committee Report 1970,2. I now circulate a draft of the Public Expenditure White Paper whichwill be the second in the annual series following Cmnd 4234 published bythe previous Administration in December 1969.    Its main features include -a. An explanation in Part 1 of the main features of the forwardestimates of the expenditure programmes^ both in total and asregards the changed priorities which flow from our new policies.This indicates that we have the future course of public expenditure under firm control.    It carries no Implication about the rate of growth of national output, y/hich we hope to increase^ but it hasbeen brought into line with the increase in productive potential inrecent years,b. Fuller estimates in Part 2 for all the functional programmes for each year up to 1974-75.    This fills in the outline programmetotals for 1971-72 and the totals for broader groups of programmes for 1974-75 which we set out in Cmnd 4515 &quot;New Policies for public spending&quot;,c. A reference (paragraph 4) to the continuing reviews of departmental and other public sector activities in pursuit of our objectives of further reshaping the public sector and eliminatinginessential activities.d. Detailed analyses of expenditure in Part 3, by spendingauthority, economic and resource categories.e. A comparison programme by programme in Appendix A withthe corresponding figures of Cmnd 4234, the &quot;previous programmes&quot;given In Cmnd. 4515 (ie. the position at the time of the Election) andwith the figures resulting from our review of public expenditure in cmnd 4515,
f. The allocation of the relative price effect where appropriate to the Individual programmes (Part 1, Table 1.2).    These flgtiresgive a truer measure than those at ordinary constant prices of theclaims which the various programmes will make on the nationlsresources, and they bring out9 in particular, the fact that the conventional constant price estimates markedly understate theresource cost of the programmes v/hich use public service manpoweron a large scale.3. In several respects the information we propose to publish goesfurther than that given in Cmnd 4234.    We shall publish much fuller figuresfor the last two years of the period, for which our predecessors gave onlyprogramme totals, all qualified as provisional.    The draft makes it clearthat greater flexibility must apply to the projections for later years in most cases.    Second, the inclusion of the tables in Appendix A givingcomparisons with previously published figures, and the analyses by economiccategory in Part 3, should meet the views on these points expressed by theSelect Committee on Procedure.4.        However, after careful thought I have concluded that it would be unwise this year to repeat the table showing public sector receipts as wellas public sector expenditure, and the resulting balances,, which were givenin Table 1.2 in Cmnd 4234 and have attracted a good deal of interest,    Aspublished last year the main balance In this table showed a very substantial improvement between 1968-69 and 1969&quot;70 which was broadly maintained in the two following years.    This improvement was described ascontributing to the switch of resources to the balance of payments.    Butthe situation has now changed?a. The revenue estimates in this table necessarily depend onassumptions about tax rates.    Previously the continuance ofexisting rates was a &quot;neutral&quot; and acceptable assumption,    But itis a cardinal feature of our policy that we do not accept the tax system as it stands and that we propose to make important changesin rates as well as structure.b. Calculation of forward revenue estimates is particularlyuncertain and hazardous given the excessive inflation which we haveinherited and are striving to moderate.c. Nevertheless on any reasonable assumptions about incomes and price movements etc, the table would show a substantial move into deficit in the public sector accounts over the next few years,indicating prima facie that the public sector was having an expansionaryeffect on the economy.    Without much further explanation, whichwould be Inappropriate to a White Paper on expenditure policies,this would be liable to serious misrepresentation.
5.        With reluctance therefore I have concluded that we should omit this table this year, stating the reason briefly In paragraph 19 of the White Paper.In its place I propose to substitute a table Illustrating a different point.When policies on expenditure are changed there are sometimes automaticeffects on the revenue side, and this together with the changes in expenditure should be shown to bring out the net effects on public sector finance.    Thenew policies which we announced in October had consequences of this kind,eg, the replacement of Investment grants by capital allowances, and Ipropose to include a table which shows them (A, 7 in the Appendix),    Thiswill meet one of the objects for which the original table of receipts and payments was devised.6,        Although we may expect criticism from dropping the table showingpublic sector receipts and balances I think that the White Paper as a whole will demonstrate !n the clearest way that we have secured a firm grip on public sector policies and spending, that we have adjusted our priorities and are continuing with a strict scrutiny of all public spending.    This should put us in a good position to face the examination and probings of the newlyestablished Select Committee on Public Expenditure, now replacing theEstimates Committee.    In this way v/e may hope to enlist publicunderstanding and support for our new approach to the public sector.7.        Parliament has already been told that we propose to publish theWhite Paper early in the new year*    Subject to further discussion with theLord President I would suggest publication on Thursday 28 January.    Weshall also need to consider possible arrangements for a debate on theWhite Paper in Parliament In due course.A treasury Chambers SW118 January 1971*

PART public Expenditure-General ReviewIntroductionWhen the Government took office last June they carried out animmediate review of public expenditure up to 1974-75 in order to concentrate the activities of public bodies on the tasks which they alone can perform,to reduce substantially previous plans for public spending, and to permittaxation including personal taxation, to be reduced. The individual canthen expect to keep more of what he earns and has greater incentive toproductive effort. A similar prospect, and a greater freedom of decision,is opened for industry and commerce. This is the way to faster growth of the nation&apos;s resources; while more resources are devoted to meeting theessential needs of the public sector.2. The Government outlined the effects of their policies for public spending, as reshaped by this review, in the White Paper &quot; New Policies for public Spending&quot; (Cmnd. 4515) on 27 October, 1970. This gave figuresfor each individual programme for 1971-72 and for broader groups of programmes for 1974-75. The present White Paper gives a fuller presentation of all the programmes for each year from 1969-70 to 1974-75.3. These programmes differ substantially from those set out in theprevious Administration^ White Paper &quot; Public Expenditure 1968-69 to1973-74 &quot; (Cmnd. 4234) a year ago. The changes are shown in Appendix Abelow, distinguishing those made before and since the Election.4. Changes will continue to be made in the programmes as the reviewof Government functions and other public sector activity progresses. TheGovernments approach was described in the White Paper &quot; there organisation of Central Government&quot; (Cmnd. 4506). The investmentneeds of the nationalised industries represent a significant demand on resources and a review of their activities has therefore been put in hand to complement the review of the Governments own functions. Forwardexpenditure plans will reflect the outcome of these further reviews, the resultsof which will be made known as decisions are taken.5. At this stage some of the new policies have not yet been worked outin complete detail. Where this is so it is reflected in the figures andcommentaries in Part 2. Some major expenditures of the Governmentdepend in part on their decisions (for example, the rate of sickness benefit)and in part on what happens beyond the reach of Government (the incidence of illness). There are special reasons (see paragraphs 23 and 25 below)for some imprecision in the estimates of local authorities&apos; expenditure,particularly beyond 1972-73. On the other hand, one effect of the changes which the Government are making in public sector policies will be to discontinue some types of expenditure which are particularly difficult to forecast. For example, the period covered by this White Paper will seethe running down of investment grants, the flow of which has dependedto a substantial extent on factors such as companies&apos; investment decisions and the timing of their claims. There will also, under the new arrangements which are planned, be a reduction of expenditure on agricultural price
guarantees the cost of which depends heavily on the level of farm output and on movements in world prices.6. The figures in the White Paper do. not take account of potentialfuture United Kingdom contributions to or receipts from the european economic Community.7. Subject to the points in the previous three paragraphs and to the margin provided by the contingency reserve, the totals given in this white paper for the various programmes are those which the Government havedecided upon for the purposes of managing public expenditure up to 1974-75.In general there is scope for greater flexibility the further one looks towardsthe end of this period.The pattern of the public expenditure programmes8. On this basis public expenditure, which in total amounted to 21,316 million in 1969-70 at today&apos;s prices(&apos;) will rise to  23,675 million by 1974-75 at those prices. The total for 1974-75 is, as foreshadowed in cmnd. 4515, over  1,500 million lower than the previous programmes asthey stood when the Government took office.9. The following table shows in broad groups of programmes how the totals are distributed:Public expenditure by groups of programmes: 1969-70 to 1974-75TABLE 1.1   million							1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1970 Survey prices						Defence   and   external						relations      .......	2,821	2,771	2,720	2,665	2,704	2,740Commerce and industry	1,648	1,698	1,669	1,365	1,130	974Nationalised   industries						capital expenditure ...	1,446	1,501	1,496	1,546	1,627	1,760Transport and miscel-						laneous services	3,413	3,663	3,768	3,940	4,057	4,166Social services......	7.925	8,393	8,731	8,947	9,168	9,357Other services......	922	1,006	1,027	1,061	1,090	1,118Debt interest*......	2,186	2.103	1,980	1,950	1,890	1,810Contingency reserve   ...		&apos;  to	125	250	375	500Shortfall.........	 	-200	-100	-100	-100	-100Adjustment to 1970-71						outturn   prices   and						relative price effect ...	955	853	840	1,035	1,200	1,350At 1970-71 outturn prices												Total......	21,316	21,788	22,256	22,659	23,141	23,675Annual percentage in-						crease in total public						expendituref ...	-	2-6	2-0	3-2	2-8	2-6Average annual percent-						age increase 1969-70						tol974-75f......	-.-77&quot;					2-6* The estimates of debt interest rest on certain conventional assumptions (see Appendix B,paragraph 8).t These annual percentage changes are calculated with expenditure on investment grantsexcluded.___-;; -  &apos; . ,   .- &apos;____-   &apos;    - -        - -    - - -.(&apos;) 1970-71 estimated outturn prices.6
: 10. It will be seen that, in total, public expenditure would grow, onthe assumptions explained above, at an average annual rate of 2-6 per cent over the period 1969-70 to 1974-75. This is mm? closely in line with theincrease in productive potential which has been taking place in recent years,and compares with the average annual rates of increase of 3-0 per cent between 1968-69 and 1971-72, and 3-5 per cent for 1972-73 and 1973-74,planned in Cmnd. 4234.11. There are two particular points to note. First, Table 1.1 is expressed at constant prices except that the social security programme withinthe social services group is simply a projection of the cash outlay assuming the present levels of benefits. Adjustments are included under &quot; adjustments to 1970-71 outturn prices and relative price effect&quot; to take account Of theeffect of price movements on the purchasing power of benefits and the effectof upratings (see Appendix B, paragraph 5), in so far as they restore thatpurchasing power. If it were decided to go beyond this at any upratingand thus to increase the benefits in real terms, the additional outlay forthis purpose would be a charge on the contingency reserve. This procedure is the same as in Cmnd. 4234.12. Second, the &quot; relative price effect&quot; represents the allowance whichneeds to be made for the fact that over a forward period of time a seriesof figures on a conventional constant price basis will always understate theamount of national resources which public expenditure will in the eventabsorb (see Appendix B, paragraphs 9-15). Estimates adjusted in this waygive a more accurate forecast of public expenditure claims on the nation&apos;resources; and in some programmes, particularly those which are large users of public sector manpower, the changes are sizeable. A new departure istherefore made in Table 1.2 by presenting broad figures which include this allowance, together with the adjustment to estimated 1970-71 outturn prices,attributed within the limitation of existing data to each of the individual programmes. The agriculture and housing programmes have not been adjusted in this way because, for the reasons explained in Part 2, the effects of the changes in policies announced by the Government on 27 Octoberon the composition of these programmes cannot yet be costed in detail; an allowance for the adjustments to these programmes and to the social securityprogramme (see paragraph 11 above) is included in line 25 of the table.The figures for all the programmes on the conventional constant price basisat 1970 Survey prices, with the adjustments to 1970-71 outturn prices andthe relative price effect applied to total expenditure only, are set out inTable \3,711338 e*

13. The chart opposite illustrates, on its horizontal axis,, the relative sizesof the broad groups of programmes set out in this White Paper for thecurrent year. The shaded areas for each block show the average annualchanges in the provision made under this White Paper for each group overthe period 1970-71 to 1974-75. Thus, the chart demonstrates that thebulk of the increase in public expenditure planned over the next four years will be devoted to the social services (nearly 60 per cent) with transport and miscellaneous local services (mainly those connected with the environment)accounting for most of the remainder.The estimates for the individual programmes14. The Governments plans for the distribution of expenditure betweenthe functional programmes reflect the effect of the new policies and measures announced on 27 October. Expenditure on the group of programmes which includes defence and external relations will decline over the period as a percentage of total public expenditure. The social services and the miscellaneous local services concerned with the environment will increase their share of the total from 58 per cent in 1970-71 to 62 per cent in1974-75. The share devoted to Government assistance to commerce andindustry, on the other hand, will fall from 8 per cent to 4 per cent in thesame period.15. The Governments policies involve substantial increases in the programmes for education, health and welfare, roads, miscellaneous local services concerned with the environment, and law and order (see Tables 1.2and 1.3 above). Subject to the results of the review mentioned inparagraph 4, the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries is alsoplanned to increase, after having been relatively flat since 1968-69 when itdeclined from a peak in the previous year. There will be a continuingrise in telecommunications investment and resumed growth in investment in electricity after 1971-72.16. Expenditure on trade, industry and employment falls at an average annual rate of 17-2 per cent after allowing for the gross savings on investment grants.* But as Table 1.2 shows, even excluding investment grants throughout, expenditure on trade and industry falls by 7 -1 per cent a year between 1970-71 and 1974-75. Expenditure on assistance to agriculture will fall as the new system of agricultural levies takes effect.The proposed reform of housing finance will avoid the rapid increase ofexpenditure on subsidies for housing which would otherwise have takenplace.The public sector: demand on resources17. About two-thirds of all public expenditure represents direct claims by Departments and other public sector bodies on the nation&apos;s resources.This includes wages and salaries of staff employed (27 per cent of total public expenditure in 1970-71) and other current expenditure on goods and services (15 per cent), gross domestic fixed capital formation (24 percent), and certain other items with a similar economic impact (seeAppendix B, paragraph 24). Secondly, about one-third of public expenditure* See also Table A.7 on page 67.10

is accounted for by transfer payments. It is the recipients and not. thepublic spending authority who decide how this money shall be used.Thirdly, a small part of total public expenditure less than 2 per cent is spent on purchases of land and other existing assets, where the main effect is on liquidity rather than on demand, at least in the short term.18. Table 1.4 shows how the expenditure of the public sector in these three categories is expected to move up to the end of 1972-73; the absenceof complete detail for some of the programmes (see paragraph 5 above)make it impossible to carry this or more detailed analyses beyond thatyear. The figures allow for the relative price effect as it arises ineach category. Category A net expenditure on resources is planned to grow at an average annual rate of 3 - 3 per cent; and Category B transfers to increase at an average annual rate of 0-3 per cent. This largely reflects the Governments policy of maintaining and strengthening the basic fabricof the social and other essential public services, which are large users of manpower and require substantial continuing capital expenditure, whilstreducing the direct financial support to industry.Public expenditure : summary analysis by resource categories^,19?$-7$ to 1972-stable 1.4					  million					Average annual percentage increase 1970-71 to 1972-73	1970-71	1971-72		1972-73	At 1970-71 outturn prices A.

The Government have decided not to publish projections of public sector receipts, and of the balances between receipts and expenditure as was done in Cmnd. 4234, because such projections are based on what areinevitably arbitrary and highly uncertain assumptions.20. On the other hand, the Government recognise that a presentation of changes brought about by new policies may be misleading unless theirconsequences on receipts as well as on expenditure are shown.   For this
reason, the information which was given for 1971-72 and 1974-75 in termsof expenditure only in the White Paper &quot; New Policies for Public Spending &quot;(Cmnd. 4515) is supplemented by Table A.7 (page 67 below). This showsboth the amounts by which expenditure in each category has been reducedby policy decisions, compared with the programmes as they stood when theGovernment took office; and the amounts by which the receipts are increasedor reduced by those same decisions.21. Table 1.5 analyses the expenditure in the groups of programmes bythe three main categories of resource use. The social services (mainly health and education) together with transport and miscellaneous local services show the largest increases in the direct use of resources.Public expenditure: analysis by groups of programmes andresource category* 19^837$ to 1972-73TABLE 1.5				  million	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	Average annual percentage increase				1970-71 to 1972-73At 1970-71 outturn prices Defence and external relations: a.

An analysis by spending authority is given for each year 1969-70 to1972-73 in Tables 3.1 to 3.4 on pages 48-51. These tables distinguish theexpenditure of the Government (showing separately that financed from Votes),the expenditure of local authorities, and the capital expenditure of public corporations, including the nationalised industries. Table 3.5 analyses public expenditure as a whole by economic category and this is extended in Table3.6 on pages 53-56 to give a similar analysis programme by programme. Aseparate summary of capital expenditure is added in Table 3.7 on pages 57-59,classified by programme and by spending authority. The summary Table 1.6opposite shows the division between the capital and current expenditure ofthe spending authorities.23. The Government expect that savings will be secured in theindividual programmes, including those of the local authorities, by increased efficiency. For local authorities&apos; current expenditure, the contribution sought from increased efficiency, on the basis of which the. rate support grant determination for England and Wales was made, is  10 million in 1971-72 and  25 million in 1972-73; and corresponding savings areexpected in the expenditures of the Scottish local authorities.24. Current expenditure by the Government will be rising only slightly in the years to 1972-73. Expenditure on investment grants will fall rapidly,but other Government capital expenditure will rise by 4-7 per cent a year,including substantial increases for hospitals, prisons, other government building and roads. Total Government current and capital expenditure(excluding investment grants) rises by 1-3 per cent a year. &apos;

Local authorities&apos; expenditure is estimated to increase at an annual rate of 3 - 5 per cent between 1970-71 and 1972-73. Their current expenditurein 1971-72 is forecast at 3 -1 per cent above 1970-71 (the outturn for whichyear is likely to be close to that implied in the 1968 rate support grantsettlement); a further increase of 4-0 per cent is expected in 1972-73. Thesefigures are consistent with those for &quot; relevant&quot; local expenditure adoptedin the recent determination of rate support grants for those years, thoughthe statistical coverage and price basis are different. For later years, underthe existing arrangements it will not be until 1972 that estimates of current expenditure will be made definitive in discussions between the Governmentand the local authorities&apos; associations for the next rate support grantdetermination.11338D*

This heading covers military technical assistance which provides forcourses in the United Kingdom for the service personnel of other countries,the provision of British service training teams on loan or secondment to developing (mainly Commonwealth) countries and a small amount of policetraining, particularly in South-East Asia. It also covers the cost of capital equipment to a few countries although this type of expenditure is being rundown.b. Allied services . Under this heading the main items are accommodation for Ministryof Defence headquarters staff, superannuation for civilian staff and HMSOand COI services (stationery and recruitment publicity).c.

(i); they constitute the public expenditure cost as defined in the national accounts. The United States Creditsfrom which they are financed are treated as receipts in the national accounts.(ii) Repayments of the Credits are charged to the Defence Budget when theyoccur; but since to include both these and the progress payments in the totalof public expenditure would involve double counting, the former are offset byequal but negative entries in line c. (ii). Similarly payments of interest on the credits which are charged to the Defence Budget and are also included withinthe overall total of debt interest, are offset by a negative entry in line c. (ii).
1. The table above shows overseas aid expenditure in outturn priceterms and the figures are gross, i.e., without deduction of amortisation.This is because the aid programme continues to be determined gross andin cash terms. Most of the commitments to overseas countries and international organisations are made in this form and receipts from pastaid loans are contractually due irrespective of current decisions on new expenditure.2. For consistency and comparison with other public sector programmes,however, the overseas aid totals are presented in Part 1 on the same basis as other programmes, i.e., net of amortisation and at 1970 constant prices. The constant price figures are derived from the cash programmesby applying a deflating factor determined in the light of historical trends.The actual allocations for overseas aid will however be the gross cashfigures stated above.3. The Government have announced, in the United Nations and inParliament, on 23 and 27 October, 1970, that they plan to increase theofficial aid programme for the next few years, and that they will do their best to reach the UNCTAD 1 per cent target by 1975. They expect that private flows will be able to make a substantial contribution.4. As indicated in Cmnd. 4515, the aid programme for the years upto 1973-74 is as stated in Cmnd. 4234, and in 1974-75 there will be afurther increase of 13 per cent in cash terms to  340 million. Until 1970-71certain aid items were separately authorised outside the programme, but from 1971-72 all items of economic aid are consolidated into a singleeconomic aid programme.5. The figures attributed to overseas aid still include the defencecomponent of the special aid to Malaysia and Singapore which is not partof the aid programme. The public expenditure totals also differ from the aid programme totals in the treatment of the Commonwealth development corporation (CDC). Whereas the aid programme includes the amount of advances from the Exchequer to the CDC, the public expenditure figuresincorporate the net flow of funds from the CDC to overseas countries.There is therefore an adjustment, which may be positive or negative (seeline f. in Table 2.3) to take account of the balance of the Corporation^ netinvestment overseas.OTHER OVERSEAS services table 2.4   million	1969-70 provisional outturn	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate at 1970 Survey prices a.

1. The expenditure on other overseas services shows no significant change from 1970-71, although it includes allowance for some reductions in the size of the Diplomatic Service. The expenditure is directed to the promotion of British interests overseas. Part of it is governed directly by international commitments.a. Overseas representation2. This expenditure comprises the cost of the Foreign and Common-wealth Office (including the Overseas Development Administration) and ofthe Diplomatic Service and its accommodation and associated expenses inrepresenting British interests internationally.b. Overseas information.  This covers three main elements:(a) British Council expenditure to promote wider knowledge of theUnited Kingdom and the English language abroad and to fostercultural relations with other countries (another part of the Council&apos;expenditure is included in Table 2.3, Overseas Aid).(b) The cost of the BBCs External Services and associated expenditure involved in British broadcasting directed to other countries.(c) The cost of information staff at home and abroad and of supporting services of the Central Office of Information and the Stationery Office.c. Other external relations4. This expenditure mainly comprises international commitments andsubscriptions, including the United Kingdom&apos;s assessed contributions toregular budgets of United Nations organisations and of the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Council of Europe andthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (secretariat costs).AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRYTABLE 2.5   million	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1970 Survey prices						a.

This expenditure covers both that part of agricultural support which takes the form&apos; of deficiency payments under price guarantees and alsoproduction grants and other subsidies to farmers, together with the associated administrative costs.   Because   of the special difficulties of
forecasting this expenditure, the convention has been adopted in previouspublic expenditure White Papers of projecting the cost of agricultural support atthe approximate level forecast following the previous Annual Review ofAgriculture, without attempting to allow for future variations in market conditions or for the results of future Annual Reviews. It has always been recognised that in practice expenditure might turn out either higher or,as in the case of the current year, lower than the projected figures.2. The same basic approach has been followed on this occasion, andin general only limited adjustments have been made to the projected figures as they stood following the last Annual Review. However, furtheradjustments to the figures are appropriate this year in the light of theGovernments announced intention of introducing import levies designedto remove or drastically reduce the need for deficiency payments and toproduce savings of the order of  150 million by 1974-75. It is intendedto make a start in introducing new arrangements in 1971-72, but it isimpossible to forecast v/hat effect they will have on expenditure year by year, because the timing and method of implementing the change mustnecessarily be related to the progress of international negotiations, includingthe negotiations for joining the e.c.. The adjusted projection of the costof agricultural support therefore assumes, on a quite arbitrary basis, savings of  25 million in 1971-72 from the introduction of the new arrangements,rising to  50 million in 1972-73,  100 million in 1973-74 and  150 million in .1974-75.b. Other assistance to agriculture3. Most of the other expenditure by Government departments on agricultural and horticultural services is included here. As with agricultural support, some expenditure has been projected forward on a conventionalbasis with no detailed forecast of future variations-e.g. animal diseasecompensation, and payments made under the Anglo-Irish Free trade agreement. One of these conventional items, provision for stabilisationpayments to the bacon curing industry, has been increased in the light of up-to-date information. The other main increases are due to the developmentof policies under the Agriculture Acts 1967 and 1970, and to the modernisation of wholesale horticultural markets.c. Fisheries4. The main expenditure under this heading relates to subsidies forthe fishing industry and grants and loans for new vessels and equipment.Future expenditure on these depends on operating results and on the plans for capital investment which may be made by the industry. Neither can beforecast with accuracy. The decrease over the forecast period takes accountof reductions in rates of grant following the withdrawal of investment grants.d. Forestry5. This item includes both state forestry and grants to the private sector. The figures make no provision for a change in policy. They include an estimate of the increasing value of State-owned forests, taken as equal tothe Commission^ net cost of forestry operations; this is included as a measureof the change in the value of stocks. The cash requirement shows little changeover the five years, at about  15 million a year.

The Council for scientific Policy (CSP) advises the Secretary of State on the allocation ofmoney for this block of work (often referred to as the &quot; Science Budget&quot;)except in the case of the Social Science Research Council; but it is intended that the SSRC should in future be more closely associated with the CSP.2. Line b. of the table shows expenditure for which the Secretary ofState for Scotland is responsible. Within the field of agricultural research,a number of institutes in Scotland are financed separately on Scottish Votes,although their programmes of research are co-ordinated with the agricultural research Council.3. The Research Councils encourage and support research in thefollowing main fields: increasing the yield of crops, improving theproduction of food from animals, fighting disease and improving health,extending knowledge of mineral resources and how to use them, the conservation of nature, extending knowledge of hydrology and freshwaterbiology, increasing knowledge of conditions in Antarctica and how they affectconditions elsewhere on the earth, exploring and learning how to exploit thesea-bed, the ocean and the air, mapping the extra-terrestrial universe,exploring the laws governing physical matter, improving methods of engineering, extending man&apos;s understanding of society and himself, conductingother research in natural sciences and producing highly qualified scientificmanpower.4. The table below shows the allocation of the &quot; Science Budget&quot; up to1971-72 in greater detail. The Governments decision to close theDocumentation Processing Centre of the Department of Education and science is reflected in the allocation. As announced in Cmnd. 4515 theprogramme of expenditure on the Research Councils is being reviewed.

a.  Department of Trade and IndustryGeneral services. This section covers expenditure on Government research establishments and those of the Atomic Energy Authority, other government research and development, support for industrial technology (e.g. throughresearch associations) and the cost of the Departments administration. Thefigures allow for decreases in projected expenditure on these items reflectingthe decisions set out in Cmnd. 4515.Promotion of local employment2. Expenditure on the promotion of local employment comprises loans and grants to firms providing additional employment in the development and intermediate areas, the development of industrial estates and theprovision of factories. The figures allow for the extended measures ofassistance under the Local Employment Acts detailed in (a) to (c) ofparagraph 14 of the White Paper on &quot;Investment Incentives &quot; (Cmnd. 4516).Investment grants3. The figures reflect the decision to discontinue investment grants.Residual grant expenditure arising from contracts entered into before27 October, 1970, will continue for some years but the amount cannot beforecast with precision at this stage; it has been assumed that in 1974-75it will be  65 million.Assistance to the coal industry. Provision is made for continued assistance to mitigate problems arising from the contraction of the coal industry up to March 1974, thoughthe continuation of the redundancy scheme after March 1972 is subject to review next year.Industrial Reorganisation Corporation5. Following the decision to wind up the Industrial reorganisation corporation expenditure previously assumed to run at up to  40 million ayear is eliminated. For 1971-72 the saving is  10 million higher than was assumed in Cmnd. 4515. The negative figures in later years indicaterepayments.Other services. This covers promotion of tourism, exports, etc., and other expenditureincluding assistance to the shipbuilding industry, existing industrial investment schemes and miscellaneous nuclear expenditure. By 1974-75the main expenditures will be on loans to British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. andthe Radio Chemical Centre Ltd. (two new companies to be set up with public sector participation to take on certain trading activities from the atomic Energy Authority) and on services to promote tourism and exports.These last include expenditure by the British Tourist Authority and theEnglish Tourist Board, and expenditure administered by the Tourist Boardon the hotel loans and grants scheme (which is not to be renewed whenits existing time limits run out) and on the new limited scheme of assistanceto tourism in development areas. It also covers expenditure on trade fairs,on grants to the British National Export Council and on assistance to theNational Exhibition Centre, and to certain other bodies, principally theCouncil of Industrial Design and the National Film Finance Corporation.
7. This heading covers expenditure on the development, proving and production of civil aircraft and aero-engines, including the United Kingdom&apos;s share of the Concorde project; other assistance to the aircraft industry; andBritish and international space programmes. It also covers a proportionof the costs of the headquarters and research and development establishments of the Ministry of Aviation Supply, and of aerospace research in industry,the remainder being included in the Defence Budget. No provision is madefor civil aircraft or aero-engine projects not already approved; any whichmay later be approved would be a charge on the Contingency Reserve.c. Department of Employment and other expenditureEmployment services. Employment services comprise expenditure by the Department ofEmployment and expenditure by local authorities on services (including the youth employment service) for which the Department makes grants. Thelarger items of expenditure are departmental administration (including theemployment exchanges, Government Training Centres and the factory inspectorate), training and rehabilitation schemes, and services for theseriously disabled.9. The increase over the period to 1974-75 is due mainly to further development of the placing, advisory and industrial training services, includingthe continued expansion of Government Training Centres to about 14,400places by the end of 1974-75, and the implementation of the industrial relations Bill.Redundancy Fund payments10. Payments out of the Redundancy Fund, which is financed by employers&apos; contributions collected through the National Insurance stamp, are administered by the Department of Employment. These payments show areduction for the years following 1971-72 because increased industrial activity is expected to reduce the incidence of redundancies.SET additional payments and regional employment premium11. Additional payments under the Selective Employment Tax (SET)arrangements and regional employment premiums are paid to qualifyingemployers in the great majority of cases by the Department of Employment.A relatively small amount is paid by other Departments to nationalised industries in respect of those parts of their undertakings which qualify.12. SET additional payments were abolished with effect from 1 April,1970, but because payment is made in arrears some provision is necessaryin 1970-71 and, for belated claims, in the two subsequent years. The regional employment premium, which is paid only in respect of manufacturingestablishments in development areas will be discontinued from September 1974.Miscellaneous services13. This heading includes expenditure by the Highlands and IslandsDevelopment Board, the Scottish and Wales Tourist Boards, the export credits Guarantee Department and the Development Fund. It also includesgrants to the British Productivity Council which, as previously announced by the Government, will be phased out from 1971-72.

The capital expenditure of nationalised industries is expected tocontinue at much the same level up to 1971-72 but to show an upward trend thereafter. The programmes of the industries, which are designedto meet demand for the industries&apos; products and services in the most efficient way, have been reviewed and as a result nationalised industries&apos;
investment in aggregate is now forecast to be below the correspondingestimates in Cmnd. 4234 (after taking account of changes in coverage andrevaluation). The individual programmes shown in Table 2.8, which are described in more detail below, assume the continuation of the presentdegree of involvement of the State in nationalised industries.Fuel2. Fixed investment by the fuel industries is expected to decline until1973-74.3. Fixed investment by the National Coal Board on main streamactivity is forecast to run at a steady level throughout the period. Table 2.8includes other investment by the Board which covers ancillary, anddiversified activity, e.g. North Sea gas investment. These aspects of theBoard&apos;s operations are to be the subject of a detailed review.4. Investment by the electricity supply industry in Great Britaindepends largely on the rate of growth of demand. The forecasts in Table 2.8assume the continuation of the generating boards&apos; planning margin (17 percent), and the forecasts allow for ordering two power stations in 1970 and up to three stations in 1971. The timing and number of orders in 1971and later years depend upon demand forecasts, the appropriate planningmargin, and, to a lesser extent, fuelling and reactor system considerations.5. The gas programme reflects the continued growth of the natural gassystem, to take full advantage of the availability of North Sea gas. the peak of expenditure on the distribution system is expected in 1970-71, whilespending on the conversion of appliances should reach a peak in 1971-72.Steel6. The British Steel Corporation will need relatively heavy capitalexpenditure over the next few years on replacement and modernisation of plant and expansion of capacity for home and export markets. Theestimates in Table 2.8 show a steep rise up to 1971-72, as the Corporation^programme gets under way.Post office. The telecommunications programme accounts for the bulk of PostOffice capital expenditure. It caters for the increasing demand fortelecommunications services, both inland and overseas, and provides formodernisation and for improvement of the quality of service, as well as for growth of traffic and provision of services to new customers. it provides for the extension of subscriber trunk dialling to all customers.Investment in posts includes expenditure on the mechanisation of the postal services and the programme of replacement of uneconomic buildings. Aslow rate of growth is assumed for mails business.Airways and airports8. The programmes of the British Overseas Airways Corporation andBritish European Airways are based mainly on purchases of aircraft forthe replacement and expansion of their fleets. That of the British airports authority will need to be revised when the site of the Third London Airportand the date of its opening are decided.
Surface transport9. The British Railways Board (BRB) are now completing their firstCorporate Plan; the present forecast of their expenditure for 1972-73 and forthe years following is therefore provisional. Responsibility for london transport was transferred to the Greater London Council on 1 January, 1970,and expenditure on the Board after that date is shown under &quot; Otherpassenger transport&quot; in Table 2.10. The programme of the British transport docks Board is determined by the forecast level of demand for new portsfacilities mainly at the Humber, South Wales and Southampton. That forthe British Waterways Board provides for the replacement of craft and forwarehousing facilities. Investment by the Transport Holding Company is nearly all in Thomas Cook and Sons Limited. The expenditure of theNational Freight Corporation is mainly on vehicles for their road haulagesubsidiaries and for National Carriers Limited (formerly BRB&apos;s freightsundries division). Provision has also been made for freight liners Ltd.Investment in the replacement of buses accounts for most of the programmes of the National Bus Company and of the Scottish Transport Group, withthe latter also investing in modernisation of their shipping fleet and piers.Shortfall10. For the nationalised industries as a whole experience shows,particularly in recent years, that capital expenditure tends to fall short ofthe approved figure. For the purpose of forecasting total investment,therefore, deductions (shown as &quot; shortfall&quot;) have been made from theaggregate expenditure on fixed assets by the individual industries givenin Table 2.8.ROADS AND PUBLIC LIGHTINGTABLE 2.9   million	1969-70 provisional outturn	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate		1974-75 estimate at 1970 Survey prices New construction and improvements: Major roads        ......

1. Table 2.9 covers expenditure by the Government and by localauthorities. The Government wholly finance the construction, improvement,maintenance and lighting of trunk roads (motorways and all-purpose roads)and make specific grants&apos; (normally 75 per cent) towards the cost of constructing and improving principal roads including lighting. All other expenditure (including maintenance of principal and non-principal roads, aswell as improvement of non-principal roads) is a local responsibility.2.,,..The figures allow for a steadily increasing rate of expenditure on theimprovement of the country&apos;s main road system, including motorways andtrunk roads, as well as the principal road system mainly in urban areas.Within these figures the reductions in the rate of increase which were announced in Cmnd. 4515 amounted to  5 million in 1971-72 rising to 25 million in 1974-75. No part of the reduction in 1971-72 will fall on major roads capital expenditure, but progressive reductions (mainly onprincipal roads) are being made in subsequent years, rising to  20 million in 1974-75. The rest of the reductions will fall on other local authoritycapital expenditure. On maintenance expenditure some allowance has beenmade for an increase to reflect the recommendations of the Committee onHighway Maintenance (the Marshall Committee).3. Arising from proposals in Cmnd. 4516, an additional provision forroads, rising to  3-5 million a year in 1974-75, has been made under theLocal Employment Acts.4. Local authority expenditure continues to increase and the figuresreflect the levels of expenditure in 1971-72 and 1972-73 on which the rate support Grant settlement was based.transport table 2.10  million	1969-70 provisional outturn	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate		1974-75 estimate at 1970 Survey prices Department of the Environ-ment, Scottish Development Department and Welsh Office: a.

1. This block of expenditure includes support to nationalised industries and to other branches of surface transport chiefly by grant for specificservices.a. Support to nationalised transport industries2. Under the Transport Act 1968 grants are made to the British railways board (BRB) for passenger services which are judged to be socially and economically necessary but which the Board would otherwise close. In1970-71 they are estimated to be  62-5 million. The recent decision towithdraw grant to the London network has led to a saving of  10 million in 1971-72 and of  15 million a year thereafter. Under the same Act theBRB are paid grants to enable them to eliminate surplus track and signallingcapacity which is at present a burden on their operating account. These willbe worth  12 million in 1970-71 and will be progressively reduced up to1973-74, after which they will cease.3. Under the Transport Act 1968 grants are also paid to the NationalFreight Corporation (NFC) in respect of the deficit on their subsidiary,National Carriers Ltd. (NCL), which they took over from the BRB. In1970-71 the grants will be  12-4 million but to give the NFC an incentive toimprove NCL&apos;s performance they will taper off and will cease after 1973-74.4. Responsibility for London Transport was transferred to the greater london Council on 1 January, 1970. There is a small payment in 1970-71in respect of the London Transport Board&apos;s revenue deficit for 1969.5. The provision also includes expenditure for essential maintenance ofwaterways and for subsidies to the Scottish Transport Group, mainly inrespect of losses on Western Highlands and Islands shipping services.b. Other surface transportPorts6. The estimates cover investment by public trust and local authorityports.Bus fuel grants7. The estimates reflect the cost of refunding to operators of bus stageservices increases of fuel duty since 1964.Rural bus and ferry services. Local authorities may contribute towards the cost of rural bus andferry services throughout Great Britain under Section 34 of the transport act 1968. These contributions normally qualify for a 50 per cent grant from the Government. Expenditure has been small in 1969-70 and 1970-71but is expected now to increase.Infrastructure expenditure. The provision for infrastructure covers gross expenditure (includingcentral Government grant) by local authorities and nationalised industries on measures designed to assist public transport in commuter areas. there could be some variation in the timing of expenditure, depending very much on the starting date of major rail schemes.   Savings of  8-5 million in
1971-72 rising to  20 million in 1974-75 will result from the decisionannounced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 27 October to apply more stringent criteria to new transport infrastructure schemes in cities.Other passenger transport10. The investment programme of London Transport is primarily amatter for the GLC. Expenditure qualifying for infrastructure grant is excluded. Provision is included for the cost of an underground link withHeathrow Airport. The remaining provision includes estimated expenditureon the purchase of new buses by local authorities and Passenger TransportExecutives.  Most of this expenditure qualifies for a 25 per cent grant.Miscellaneous transport services11. The main items are road safety and research. Road safety measures as envisaged in the White Paper &quot; Road Safety A Fresh Approach&quot;(Cmnd. 3339) are being encouraged following a circular to local authoritiesin April 1969. Provision is also made for an expanded research programme.This category also includes provision for Departments&apos; contributions to establishing a proposed new Transport and Environment Centre, as well asassistance to the British Railways Board for a research and development programme being undertaken at the Railway Technical Centre, Derby.c. Civil aviation services12. This covers expenditure at aerodromes operated by the Departmentof Trade and Industry and on air navigation and miscellaneous services provided by the Department. It also includes capital expenditure by localauthorities at municipal aerodromes.d. Shipping services13. This covers Department of Trade and Industry expenditure on shipping services, and net loans to the shipping industry. Repayment of loans produces the negative figures in the table.housing table 2.11   million	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1970 Survey prices						Housing        .........	1,071-8	1,122-2	1,144-4	1,167-5	1,129	1,1051. Housing finance is undergoing a major reform and while the mainlines of the Governments policy on local authority rents, slum clearance,the refashioning of the subsidy system and rent rebates have been publishedthe details of the reforms have yet to be fully discussed with local authority associations and other interested parties. In compiling the figures in the tableabove some allowance has been made for the effects of the changes proposed
by the Government, but until the full details of these are worked out thefigures must be regarded as provisional. It is particularly difficult to forecastwhat the cost of rebates will be. Moreover, whilst the allowance for thepolicy changes has, for convenience, been entered solely in this block ofexpenditure some of the effects may arise in the Social Security programme.2. The proposed changes in housing finance have implications mainly for expenditure on subsidies and the figures in the table reflect this. Subsidieswill be concentrated on those who need them, particularly by way of rent rebates and rent allowances. Subsidies will also be channelled towardsthose local authorities with problems of slum clearance and high buildingcosts so that these problems may be tackled more effectively than in the past.3. The main element in the figures, however, is capital expenditure on public sector housing by local authorities, new town authorities and theScottish Special Housing Association. There is still an urgent need for new construction to replace slums, to relieve overcrowding and to overcome local shortages.4. The Government has stated its intention to continue the major drivefor rehabilitation involving the payment of improvement grants to both thepublic and private sectors.5. Local authority lending is important in the promotion of homeownership and house improvements and the Government will keep thequestion of further provision under continuous review. The housing corporation and local authority assisted housing associations are also being encouraged to increase their activity.MISCELLANEOUS LOCAL services table 2.12   million	1969-70 provisional outturn	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate		1974-75 estimate at 1970 Survey prices Capital Expenditure: Public health and avoid-ance of pollution Improvement of the environ-ment and local facilities New towns&apos; industrial and commercial development, etc.       .........	227-2 117-7 25-0	250-8 120-8 30-2	268-8 115-5 29-1	285-3 123-1 32-8	-	- 465	495Current expenditure: AH services.........	427-2	446-0	435-6	453-3		484	501Total        ......	797-1	847-8	849-0	894-5	949		9961. The heading &quot; Miscellaneous local services &quot; covers a wide variety of services, mostly the responsibility of local authorities, which fall into thethree groups shown under &quot; Capital expenditure &quot; in the table above.31
2. The first group of services is concerned with public health and thereduction or removal of pollution. It includes water supply, sewerage andrefuse disposal, miscellaneous public health and clean air policy. Theincrease in expenditure is considerable and is a corollary to industrial growth,to the increase in population, and to the improvement of living standards. Asthe demand for water, sewerage, and refuse disposal increases, the technical problems also increase and provision becomes more costly.3. The second group comprises a wide variety of services for improvingamenities and the environment, such as the redevelopment of central urban areas, the reclamation of derelict land, the provision of swimming pools,playing fields, the facilities in country parks, as well as town and country planning and general administrative services. The figures incorporate partof the  10 million reduction mentioned in paragraph 16 of Cmnd. 4515, muchof which it is hoped can be achieved by encouraging private rather thanpublic investment for industrial and commercial development. Provision ismade, mainly in the later years, for the Thames flood barrier and associatedworks, the construction of which is expected to extend beyond 1974-75.4. The third group comprises direct expenditure by New town development corporations, mainly on industrial and commercial development,which is also to be increasingly financed by the private sector. Other public expenditure on new towns is shown elsewhere. That on water and sewerageis in the first group of services in the table above, and for roads and housing the expenditure is included in the appropriate main programme.5. The figures in respect of capital expenditure by local authorities inEngland and Wales, which are included in the first two groups in the tableabove, are prepared as though the existing system of loan sanction controls over individual projects were to continue. Under the arrangements set outin circular 2/70 of the Department of the Environment (116/70 Welsh Office)control in detail over many local authorities&apos; capital projects will cease from1 April, 1971, and individual authorities will have freedom to determinelocally their own order of priorities within a total capital expenditureallocation. This may ultimately result in a different pattern of expenditureupon the services covered by these arrangements, including services in thisblock.6. The current expenditure figures for 1971-72 and 1972-73 are basedon the forecasts arrived at with the local authority associations in the courseof the rate support grant settlements. In general they reflect priorities similarto those applying to capital expenditure. For the two later years the figures show the effect of continuing, broadly, the rates of growth implied in localauthority expenditure over the past few years. The actual expenditure inthose years will depend on the expenditure decisions of individual authoritiesin the light of the rate support grant as it is settled in 1972.

The law and order programme covers expenditure by the Governmentand local authorities. It includes the cost of the Home Departments, theLegal Departments, the Houses of Parliament and the Privy Council. Mostof the expenditure is incurred by local authorities on services to which theGovernment contribute through specific grants or rate support grant.Police2. Continuing increases in police and civilian strengths (including trafficwardens) are forecast.
3. At the beginning of 1970-71 the prison population was about 43,500.The population is expected to increase at a faster rate over the survey period than was previously assumed. The forecasts allow for an increasingprovision for the prison building programme.Probation and after-care (England and Wales)4. The forecasts provide for the increased expansion of this service inorder to relieve some of the pressure on the prison service.Child care (England and Wales)5. The forecasts provide for the implementation of the Children and young Persons Act 1969 and the new system of community homes for children needing care in residential establishments, and the necessary growth of the child care service.Social work (Scotland) &apos;6. The forecasts take account of the additions announced in Cmnd. 4515for the further development of social work services, particularly for the elderlyand mentally handicapped. Some increase in expenditure is also attributable to the further implementation of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.7. In future White Papers child care (England and Wales) and social work (Scotland) will be included in a programme called Health and personal social Services.Fire services. The forecasts provide for expansion resulting from the recommendationsof the departmental Committee on the Fire Service and from additional workon fire prevention.Law courts and legal aid9. The forecasts assume that the work of the courts and the number ofboth civil and criminal cases in which legal aid is granted will continue torise.Other services10. The main services on which a continuing increase in expenditure is forecast are the urban programme of aid for areas of special social need,and the criminal injuries compensation scheme.

Table 2.15 above shows details of expenditure on education andlocal library services throughout Great Britain. As a proportion of total public expenditure it increases over the period from 12-3 per cent to 13-8 percent. The figures take account of the decisions on educational expenditureannounced in Cmnd. 4515.2. The growth in expenditure is determined largely by the growth in numbers of pupils, students and teachers. The total of primary pupils isexpected to increase by just over 3 per cent between 1969-70 and 1974-75, andfrom 5-56 million to 5-74 million after reaching 5-81 million in 1972-73.By contrast, the total of secondary pupils is expected to increase by about27 per cent from 3-35 million to 4-27 million as a result of larger age groups and the raising of the school leaving age in 1972-73. The combined increasein primary and secondary numbers is forecast at about 12 per cent, comparedwith teacher numbers which are expected to rise by about 24 per cent from391,000 to 484,000, thus bringing the number of pupils per teacher down from about 23 in 1969-70 to 21 in 1974-75.3. In higher education, the forecasts assume growth of university studentnumbers at broadly the same rate as in recent years, but further educationstudent numbers (full-time equivalents) will rise by 10 per cent by 1972-73and then ease off for two years when the 15-year-olds stay on at school, afterthe leaving age is raised, instead of moving to further education. The numberof students training to be teachers is assumed to increase by over 11 per cent.
4. Building programmes beyond 1972-73 have not yet been finally determined. In the schools, as well as making the normal provision for the growing numbers, the programmes up to 1972-73 will include provision forthe additional secondary pupils staying on at school when the leaving ageis raised. It is also the Governments intention to proceed as rapidly aspossible with the replacement and improvement of old primary school buildings. A start will be made in 1972-73 with the increased programmeof starts for improvements totalling  44 million, as announced in Cmnd. 4515.5. Higher education building programmes, as well as providing for the assumed increase in student numbers, will also include margins for the replacement of obsolete buildings and for additional residential and socialaccommodation in further education and teacher training establishments and universities. From 1 April, 1971, the capital programmes for the youth service and for local libraries in England and Wales will be within the discretion of local authorities, subject to overall expenditure limits, and the forecasts of expenditure are subject to variation accordingly.6. The rise in current expenditure, as well as keeping pace with increasing numbers of pupils and students, will allow for better staffing standards in schools as larger numbers of teachers are employed and for a significantimprovement in the level of non-teaching expenditure in schools and further education establishments.HEALTH AND WELFARE1&quot;TABLE 2.16   million	1969-70 provisional outturn	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate at 1970 Survey prices Capital expenditure: Hospitals   .........

1. In 1971-72 and subsequent years the net cost of the health and welfare programme, in public expenditure terms, has been reduced by theincreased charges and the abolition of cheap welfare milk announced in cmnd. 4515. The provision for gross expenditure is however little affectedby the charges, and is expected to be  2,222 million in 1971-72, rising to 2,471 million in 1974-75, excluding the relative price effect. This allows for an addition in 1971-72 of  20 million and in 1972-73 and subsequent years of  30 million from the planned provision of an extra  110 million overthe next four years, also announced in Cmnd. 4515. This addition enablestotal provision for the hospital services and the community health and welfare services to increase at constant prices in 1971-72 by 5-2 per cent and 9-7 percent respectively.2. In 1971-72, 62-1 per cent of the expenditure is on hospitals,20-6 per cent on the family practitioner services, 14-6 per cent on community health and welfare services and 2-7 per cent on welfare foods and other services. It is envisaged that these proportions will gradually change infavour, of the community health and welfare services as the policy developsof providing care; in the community where this is more appropriate thanhospital care. Detailed allocations of expenditure to particular services havenot yet been made for 1973-74 ,of 1974-75.Hospital services . The objectives for the hospital service are to continue the modernisation and replacement of hospitals and the normal developments of the services improved treatment and diagnostic facilities, the relief ofstaff shortages and improved education and training of staff. particular regard will be paid to the mentally handicapped, the mentally ill and the elderly. Care will be taken that hospital building and other plans are consistent with and complementary to those of local authorities. allocations of funds to hospital authorities will be designed progressively to reduce thedisparities between the resources available to different regions. There willbe close attention to a more rapid introduction of productivity pay schemes,more effective management and control of building and engineeringmaintenance, improvements in nurse staffing, postgraduate medical education and other staff training.Family practitioner services4. This heading covers general practitioner, pharmaceutical, dental and ophthalmic services provided under the National Health Service. net expenditure shows a reduction because of the increased charges. But the gross cost is expected to continue to increase because of a small rise in thenumbers of doctors and dentists and the development of more expensivedrugs.Community health and welfare services. It is envisaged that these local authority services will continue todevelop, in part to provide care in the community instead of in hospitalwhere this is appropriate. It is proposed to give particular emphasis to meeting, the needs of the mentally handicapped, the mentally ill and the elderly. Other services which are expected to develop are family planning,nursing and other domiciliary services, day care of young children and services for the physically handicapped.

The schemes of social security cash benefits make up the largest ofthe public expenditure programmes. National insurance and industrial injuries benefits account for over two-thirds of total expenditure on thesocial security programme, retirement pensions being the main item. Thebalance is made up by the non-contributory schemes and administration.2. Table 2.17 above shows on the basis of existing benefit levels theestimated distribution of expenditure between the various benefits up to and including 1974-75.Demographic factors3. At present there are 7-4 million retirement pensioners; by the endof 1973, because of increasing numbers of old people and because of a continuing trend towards earlier retirement as well as lighter mortality, thereare expected to be 8 million. The tendency for the numbers of sickness benefit claims to increase means that the cost of this benefit is rising. the combined effect of these and other demographic factors is to produce asubstantial increase in the future cost of social security benefits, even apartfrom changes in the levels of benefit.Increases and improvements4. The Government has already introduced two new benefits, the costof which is included in Table 2.17. The first, which came into force inNovember 1970, is the pension for persons who were too old to join thenational insurance scheme in 1948 (which the Government proposes toextend later this year to all persons over 80). The second, which is due to start in August 1971, is the family income supplement for families wherethe breadwinner is in full time work but on low wages. The Governmenthas also carried through proposals for scaled down pensions for widows under50 and the attendance allowance for the very severely disabled; these benefits
are now due to start in April 1971 and December 1971 respectively. Inaccordance with Government policy, these benefits will extend special help to classes of people who most need it.5. Following the established convention, the figures for social securitydo not reflect changes which may take place in the schemes in the futurebut which have not yet been announced. Improvements in the level of social security benefits, unlike changes in other programmes, can be brought intoeffect within a few months of a decision. The figures project only the costof benefits at their present level. They show how the cost of social securitywill rise even without any further changes in the schemes or in the rates ofbenefit.6. Increased expenditure on social security benefits has to be paid forby contributions and taxation, and the pace of advance must depend on theprogress of the country&apos;s economy. Nevertheless, the Government intends to review retirement pensions and related benefits every two years, startingthis year, to ensure that they maintain at least their purchasing power, andthat pensioners&apos; living standards are properly protected.FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATIONTABLE 2.18   million	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1970 Survey prices						a.

The estimates for the Royal Mint cover the cost of normal requirements of coin. That for 1970-71 also includes provision for thecompletion of the major part of the new coinage requirement fordecimalisation, and that for 1972-73 includes an estimate of the cost of the plant necessary to complete the move of the Royal Mint from Tower Hill toLlantrisant.

Accommodation (Home)1. This covers expenditure by the Department of the Environment on civil accommodation for Government Departments at home and on buildingresearch and development work. The accommodation is mainly offices, butalso includes Government Training Centres, scientific and research buildings,museums and galleries and miscellaneous buildings such as those for theRoyal Mint and the Stationery Office.2. About three-quarters of the total is current expenditure needed toretain and operate the existing accommodation, and covering rent, rates,maintenance, running costs and staff costs. The capital expenditure, togetherwith an element of staff costs, relates mainly to the provision and furnishing ofnew buildings. The largest programmes are for computer buildings and otheroffices needed for a variety of reasons, including replacement of leasedaccommodation or of sub-standard premises and for dispersal of staff from london. There are also programmes for increasing the number of placesavailable at training centres and for museums and galleries building. as announced in Parliament on 4 November, 1970, there will be increased expenditure on buildings for Government Training Centres of about 3 million in the years 1972-73 to 1974-75.
b. Stationery Office (Home)3. The figures show expenditure by the Stationery Office to meet therequirements of Government Departments, together with the stationery office&apos;s administrative and other costs. The capital expenditure arisesmainly on computers and other office machinery for GovernmentDepartments.c. Home publicity services4.

The figures cover the capital requirements of the home broadcasting services of the BBC in the United Kingdom, incorporating expenditure onthe colour television service, and an increase in the number of local radio
stations from 8 to 20 by 1971. The Corporation^ expenditure (capital and current) is financed by Government grant which since April 1961 hasconsisted of the whole of net income from licence revenue. The combinedsound and television licence fees will be increased from 1 April, 1971.b (ii).  Independent Television Authority4. Expenditure covers the capital requirements of the Authority in providing transmitters and relay stations to broadcast the programmes of independent television companies. The Authority is financed by means ofthe rentals which it charges to programme contractors.c. Meteorological services. The estimates cover the cost of services provided for both militaryand civil purposes the whole of which is charged to the Defence Budget;an adjustment has been made in Table 2.2 (Other military defence) to enablethis item to be shown here.

The estimates have been prepared by the Northern Irelanddepartments. They refer to those services for which the Northern ireland government is responsible and as such are not subject to detailed controlfrom Westminster, i The overall level of expenditure on these services is,
however, customarily subject to agreement between the two governments and is determined with regard to the parity of services in Northern Irelandand Great Britain, taking into account the special needs of the Province, aswell as the overall constraints on public expenditure in the United Kingdom.The forecasts have been revised in the light of the statement on public expenditure made in Stormont on 8 December, 1970.2. Because the figures in the Table represent public expenditure forwhich the Northern Ireland Government is responsible, they do not include expenditure on such items as defence and most agricultural support, whichis contained in the relevant United Kingdom programmes.SCOTLANDExpenditure within the Secretary of State&apos;s responsibilityTABLE 2.22   million	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1970 Survey prices						Agriculture, fisheries and						forestry	55-4	65-4	62-1	57-6	51	45Research Councils, etc.	2-9	31	3-4	3-5	4	4Trade, industry and						employment	3-5	4-2	4-7	4-3	4	4Roads and public lighting  ...	71-9	76-5	82-1	84-3	87	90Transport     .........	2-5	3-9	4-7	4-9	6	housing       .........	225-2	228-0	210-0	230-0	230	230Miscellaneous local services ...	93-6	100-8	102-8	109-4	113	117Law and order						(excluding social work)	43-0	46-1	48-9	51-7	53	55Social work   .........	19-4	20-5	23-1	24-7	26	27Arts    .........	0-9	1-0	10	1-1	1	1Education     .........	233-9	236-7	246-7	255-5	263	271Health and welfare   ......	198-6	203-9	209-2	214-8	221	229Financial administration	3-2	3-2	3-2	3-3	3	miscellaneous services	2-5	2-9	4-1	3-3	3	3Total        ......	956-5	996-2	1,006-0	1,048-4	1,065	1,0851. Table 2.22 provides separate expenditure figures relating to services in Scotland for which the Secretary of State&apos;s Departments are responsible,directly or indirectly (e.g. expenditure by local authorities), with the exceptionof expenditure by the nationalised industries in Scotland.2. The Scottish figures show differences in the pattern of expenditure by comparison with Great Britain as a whole, corresponding to differences in circumstances and needs. One of the main differences is that in scotland the public sector has a larger share of housing investment.3. The responsibilities of the Secretary of State&apos;s Departments inrelation to roads and public lighting, housing and miscellaneous local services are virtually the same as those of the Department of the
Environment. The main differences m the coverage of other expenditureblocks are as follows:Agriculture, fisheries and forestry: This includes the Scottish share ofthe costs of agricultural support (including arbitrary reductionsreflecting changes in the system of support see page2&amp; paragraph 2^and other agricultural and fishing services met separately by theDepartment of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland. other expenditure on agricultural support, and on animal health services,which is met by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is excluded, as well as expenditure by the Forestry Commission.Research Councils, etc.: The figures cover only agricultural research inScotland financed from Scottish Votes; they do not include expenditurein Scotland by the Science, Social Science, Medical, Agricultural, and natural Environment Research Councils.Trade, industry and employment: The figures relate mainly to expenditure by the Highlands and Islands Development Board andthe Scottish Tourist Board. They exclude Redundancy Fundpayments, SET additional payments, payments of regional employ-ment premiums, investment grants and certain other grants.Transport: The Scottish figures cover rural bus and ferry grants,infrastructure expenditure, support for sea transport services in the highlands and Islands and departmental administration. They donot include fuel grants, new bus grants, support to the british railways Board, the National Freight Corporation, the BritishWaterways Board, the port authorities and civil aviation.Law and order and social work: Except in table 2.22, expenditure inScotland on social work, including the expenditure of the localauthority social work departments, set up under the Social Work(Scotland) Act 1968, is classified under &quot;Law and order&quot;, whilecorresponding expenditure in England and Wales is divided between&quot; Law and order &quot; and &quot; Health and welfare&quot;. In Table 2.22 thesocial work expenditure is shown separately from the main law andorder services. In future White Papers the social work expenditure will be classified under Health and personal social services.Arts: The figures relate mainly to the Royal Scottish Museum, theNational Galleries of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland andthe National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland. They excludecentral Government grants made through the Arts Council. As inEngland, expenditure by local authorities is included under the heading &quot; Miscellaneous local services &quot;.Education: The figures include all expenditure by the Scottish education department and local authorities, including expenditure on schools,further education, teacher training, youth service, etc. expenditure by the University Grants Committee in Scotland is excluded.

Table 2.23 provides separate expenditure figures relating to services for which the Welsh Office is responsible directly or indirectly (e.g.expenditure by local authorities in Wales).2. The table does not include investment in Wales by the nationalised industries.3. The responsibilities of the Welsh Office in relation to Roads andpublic lighting, Housing, Miscellaneous local services and Health and welfare cover almost the same fields as those of the Department of the environment and the Department of Health and Social Security.4.   Other figures cover only part of the relevant fields as follows:Trade, industry and employment: Expenditure by the Wales TouristBoard. The figures exclude Redundancy Fund payments, SETadditional payments, payments of regional employment premium,investment grants.Transport: Road safety and assistance to public transport (infrastructuregrants, grants towards bus services in the rural areas). The figuresexclude support to nationalised transport industries and expenditure by the port authorities and on civil aviation.Arts: Expenditure by the National Museum and National Library of wales. The figures exclude central government grants made throughthe Arts Council.Education: Primary and secondary education for which responsibility in wales was transferred to the Secretary of State on 5 November, 1970.The figures exclude expenditure on further education, teacher trainingyouth services, for which responsibility in Wales remains with theSecretary of State for Education and Science; and expenditure by theUniversity Grants Committee.
5. The figures show differences in the pattern of expenditure in comparison with Great Britain as a whole, reflecting differences in circumstances and needs. For example the figures for Roads and publiclighting and for Miscellaneous local services (which include water supply,sewerage and clearance of derelict land) are substantially larger in relation tothe figures for other main programmes than they are for Great Britain asa whole.

These notes list the principal changes affecting the current year, 1970-71, which have been recorded subsequent to June 1970, and the principal changes affecting 1971-72 and later years which have been recorded subsequent to the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement of27 October, 1970 (Cmnd. 4515).(a) Agriculture: excluding price guarantees: provision is made in each year for increasedpayments to curers under the Bacon Industry Stabilisation Scheme, because of substantial recent increases in pig meatinot matched by corresponding increases in bacon prices. f*vu*,(p) Trade and industry: excluding investment grants: the net saving in 1970-71 has arisenlargely on expenditure by the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation.(c) Trade and industry: investment grants: the reduced estimate for 1970-71 is the resultof a dip in eligible investment in 1969, as a reaction from some bunching of investment which took place in 1967 and 1968 in order to qualify for the higher rate of grantavailable in those years. Provision is now made for some savings in 1971-72 from thetermination of investment grants: no quantified provision for this saving was madein Cmnd. 4515, where it was stated that such savings would start to accrue in 1971-72but would not become substantial until 1972-73. Provision is now made for someresidual payments of investment grants in 1974-75, on contracts entered into before27 October, 1970; no quantified provision for these payments was made in Cmnd. 4515,:which noted, however, that such payments would arise.id) Nationalised industries: the provision in 1970-71 (and to a lesser extent in later years)is reduced as a result of a change in accounting conventions, whereby in future pay-ments to the British Railways Board&apos;s pension fund will be reckoned as current, notcapital, expenditure.(e) Roads etc: increased provision is needed in the current year because the fine weatherenabled more work to be completed.(/) Housing: the estimates have been revised in the light of later information abouthousing starts by local authorities in Scotland.(g) Miscellaneous local services: the provision for 1971-72 and 1972-73 is reduced in thelight of the information arising from the recent Rate Support Grant negotiations with local authorities in England and Wales. Provision is made, starting on a small scale in 1971-72 and reaching over  20 million in 1974-75 for the Thames FloodBarrier; there is also some increased provision for spending on infrastructure in development areas.(h) Education: The minor changes take account, among other things, of the rate support grant settlements for 1971-73.(/) Social security: the estimates for payments of supplementary benefits have been revised in the light of the latest information. Provision has also been made for thecost of the recently announced additional payments for fuel to people receivingsupplementary benefits, and for the extension of the new pension arrangementsfor people over 80.(/) Miscellaneous services: the saving in 1970-71 stems largely from the abolition of theLand Commission.(k) Northern Ireland: provision is now made for certain savings as a consequence pf thediscussions (which were foreshadowed in Cmnd. 4515, paragraph 33) with the NorthernIreland Government about those aspects of the new policies announced by theChancellor of the Exchequer on 27 October which are the responsibility of thatGovernment.(/) Debt interest: revised forecasts have been made of payments of debt interest at outturn prices, and of the appropriate conversion to a constant price basisX1)(m) The nature of the relative price effect and the method by which it is calculated are described in Appendix B, paragraphs 9-15 pages 70-71. The change betweenCmnd. 4515 and this White Paper is due to a revised assessment of the movements ofprices, involving a narrowing of the differential from 0-8 per cent to 0-6 per cent ayear (in Cmnd. 4234 it was 0-7 per cent), partly offset by a rise in estimated 1970-71outturn prices.O See section 2 and Appendix B, Methodology, paragraph 8.
Changes in public sector expenditure and receipts resulting from new policies as announced in Cmnd. 4515 and Cmnd. 4516 comparedwith previous programmes5&quot;: 1971-72 to 1974-75This table shows the effects of the policy decisions announced by theGovernment on 27 October in Cmnd. 4515 and 4516, some directly alteringpublic expenditure, others forming part of the same policy decisions but having their effects on the receipts side of the account. Changes in estimates which are not due to these particular changes of policy are excluded.TABLE A.7 Increase (-f), Reduction (-)   million	1971	-72.	1972-73		1973	-74	1974-75		Expendi-ture	Receipts	Expend i-ture	Receipts	Expendi-ture	Receipts	Expendi-ture	ReceiotsAt 1970 Survey prices								Defence    .........	-28	-	-35	&apos; -	-69		-132	-Other   overseas   services;								passport, etc., fees	 	5		6	iihi: i irt;	6	:.   i	6Agriculture,  fisheries and								forestry:								(i) agriculture price								guarantees	-25f	 	-50t	 	-lOOf	 	-150f	 (ii) other expenditure	-2	 	-7	 	-8	 	-6	 (iii) levies on agricultural								imports     ......	-	t  t	 	*	 	t  *		 tResearch Councils, etc.   ...	-2	 	-3	 	-4	 	-5	-Technology and industry:								(i) investment grants	-245	 	-365	 	-529	 	-6001!

* The previous programmes are denned in the General Note (i) on page 5 of cmnd. 4515.t Cmnd. 4515, paragraph 34, explained that it was then too soon to be preciseabout the amount of savings for 1971-72, but that in the longer run substantial savings were expected of the order of  150 million. The figures shown in this table for this item are those assumed on an arbitrary basis as explained in Part 2 of this white Paper, page 20, paragraph 2.J New receipts are expected from the introduction of import levies on agricultural products but no estimate can be made at present of the amount from this source,which will depend on a number of variables, including the levels of minimum import prices and of world prices.8 As was explained in Note (1) to Table 1 in Cmnd. 4515, no account was thentaken of savings on investment grants starting to accrue towards the end of 1971-72.It has now been possible to estimate the amount of this saving.II Note (2) to Table 2 of Cmnd. 4515 explained that no allowance was made forresidual payments of investment grants in 1974-75 on capital expenditure incurredunder contracts made before. 27 October, 1970. This expenditure has now been estimated at  65 million, and the net saving on investment grants is therefore reducedto  600 million as shown in this table.% Paragraph 34 of Cmnd. 4515 explained that the refashioning of the system of housing subsidies, rents and rebates is expected to lead to a saving in public expenditure of  100- 200 million a year by the middle of the decade.
APPENDIX BNOTES ON METHODOLOGY1. These notes explain the conventions and classifications used in this white Paper. ,Definitions and coverage2. The figures in this White Paper have been compiled on the sameconventions as were used in Cmnd. 4234 and described in Appendix iii of that White Paper.Shortfall3. The estimates for all years include an allowance for shortfall to correct a tendency for actual expenditure in any year to be less than theestimate made at the beginning of that year. The shortfall allowance of 200 million for 1970-71 is based on information about actual public expenditure in the first half of the year. For 1971-72 and later years a shortfall  of  100 million has been assumed. A separate allowance for nationalised industries shortfall is made in that programme (see Table 2.8).Price basis4. The constant price basis of the individual programmes in all the tables, apart from Table 1.2, is that of 1970 Survey prices. This price basiscorresponds with that of the 1970-71 Supply Estimates for current expenditure on goods and services and some transfer payments, except thatthe April 1970 pay awards for the Armed Forces agreed in February 1970have been included. The estimates for gross domestic fixed capital formationare mostly at March 1970 prices. In some cases, however, such as roads and education, they relate to the price basis currently in use for planning pur-poses. The programme estimates have been converted from 1970 Survey prices to estimated outturn prices for 1970-71 by means of an overall adjustment.5. Social security benefits are expressed in terms of existing levels ofbenefit since it is not practicable to forecast the exact date and amount of future benefit increases. But in order that the total of public expenditure will provide a measure of the estimated demand on resources, the line&quot;Adjustment to 1970-71 outturn prices and relative price effect&quot; contains a net entry for social security comprising two elements a downwardadjustment relating to the forecast movement in prices and a notional upwardadjustment on account ofxsuch price movements.6. Certain other current grants, subsidies and capital transactions are estimated in money terms, that is, at the amount expected to be disbursedin each year, irrespective of price changes which may by then have occurred.In order to measure the demand on real resources implied by theseexpenditures, the cash estimates have been deflated in all the summary tables&apos;to constant 1970-71 outturn prices. For overseas aid this adjustment hasbeen applied to the estimates for that programme, using a price deflatorappropriate to the expenditure involved. For other programmes an overalladjustment related to the estimated movement in the price level of the output
of the economy as a whole, as measured by the gross domestic product(GDP) factor cost price index, is included in the line &quot; Adjustment to1970-71 outturn prices and relative price effect&quot;.7. For certain types of subsidies which are intended to reimburse deficitsthe estimates are entirely notional and are taken as representing 1970-71outturn prices.   Agricultural subsidies are the most important example.8. The forward figures of debt interest involve the neutral assumptionthat interest rates continue at their present level. Allowance is made forsome change in the total amount of debt and for the refundingof current debt. These projections of debt interest are made at the outturn prices of each year and deflated to constant 1970-71 outturn prices by theGDP factor cost price index.Relative price effect9. The relative price effect arises because the output of the public sector is measured by its various inputs and the prices of goods and servicespurchased by public sector outlays (either directly in the case of expenditureon goods and services or indirectly in the case of transfers to other sectors of the economy) tend to move differentially from prices in the economy generally. This means that for any future year public expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product measured at conventional constant prices will not reflect precisely public expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product when measured at the actual prices of that future year.Nor will the use of real resources by the public sector be correctly stated.10. The major component of the relative price effect arises on public sector wages and salaries. Over time, the productivity of labour in the economy will be rising. So the cost of employing a given amount of labour in the public sector, in terms of the potential output from the private sectorwhich has to be forgone, will rise in step with productivity in the private sector. Rising productivity in the private sector will be accompanied byrising real earnings in that sector and real earnings in the public sector willhave to keep pace if the necessary distribution of the labour force is to beachieved. Expressing public sector programmes at constant pay and pricestherefore progressively understates their cost because it does not allow forthe increase in opportunity cost arising from productivity changes in theprivate sector. (In fact a rise in productivity in the public service isoccurring continuously through advances in technology, in organisation andin training methods. But the national income conventions for expressingpublic expenditure at constant prices preclude any measurement of the extentto which a better service is provided for a given utilisation of resources.)11. Hitherto account of the relative price effect has been taken inpractice only in regard to the wages and salaries content of public expenditure. But, as was explained in the Green Paper &quot;public expenditure: a New Presentation &quot;,(*) the adjustment for the relative price effect is required in principle for all types of transaction. The estimates inthis White Paper include an allowance for the differential price movementof all components of public expenditure.(!) Cmnd. 4017, page 23, paragraph 14.
12. For 1971-72 and later years the relative price effect applicable towages and salaries and to all other categories of expenditure has been estimated from an analysis of the past relationship between the pricemovements in the various components of expenditure (measured at factorcost) and the movement in the GDP factor cost price index.13. No further adjustment for the relative price effect is required for those programmes, or parts of programmes, which are estimated in money terms and deflated to 1970-71 outturn prices by the GDP factor cost price index. Such expenditure will form the same proportion of GDP whethermeasured at the outturn prices of each year or at constant 1970-71 outturn prices. Overseas aid and social security (excluding administrative costs)are deflated by special index numbers and so some further relative priceadjustment is necessary for these programmes. This adjustment is thedifference between the special deflator applied to each of these programmes and the GDP factor cost price index.14. For 1970-71 there is no relative price effect or deflation of cashprogrammes since the price basis of the programmes, after adjustment for1970 Survey to 1970-71 outturn prices, is on an identical outturn price basisto that of GDP.15. For 1969-70 figures of provisional outturn are prepared at both1969-70 outturn prices and at 1970 Survey prices. The figures for individual programmes in all the tables, apart from Table 1.2 are at 1970Survey prices. The total of public expenditure for 1969-70 shown in alltables is the sum of the individual programmes at 1969-70 outturn pricesrevalued to 1970-71 outturn prices by the movement in the GDP factorcost price index between 1969-70 and 1970-71. The difference between this figure and the sum of the individual programmes is entered for 1969-70in the line &quot; Adjustment to 1970-71 outturn prices and relative price effect&quot;.Presentation of adjustments16. The adjustment from 1970 Survey to 1970-71 outturn prices, the adjustment of cash programmes to 1970-71 outturn prices and the relative price effect are grouped together and shown in the line &quot; Adjustment to1970-71 outturn prices and relative price effect&quot; in all tables other thanTable 1.2.  These adjustments are as follows:  million		1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75		provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate		outturn					1.

17. The corresponding figures from Cmnd. 4234, revalued to the pricebasis of this White Paper, are as follows:  million	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate. Adjustment to 1970-71  outturn prices    ............ 2. Adjustment of cash programmes to 1970-71 outturn prices 3.

The totals of these adjustments of the revalued Cmnd. 4234figures are larger than the adjustments which were shown in that white paper(2).   The Cmnd. 4234 total included allowances for:(a) the movement from 1969 Survey to 1969-70 outturn prices;(b) the adjustment of cash programmes to 1969-70 outturn prices;and(c) the relative price effect.The total for (a) in the adjustments of the revalued Cmnd. 4234 figureshas been obtained by applying to the programmes as revalued to 1970Survey prices the percentage rates of increase used in converting the latest estimates of expenditure from 1970 Survey to 1970-71 outturn prices.Since these rates are much larger than diose between 1969 Survey prices and 1969-70 outturn prices, this adjustment is larger than the correspondingelement in the original adjustments of Cmnd. 4234. The total for (b)represents the difference between the cash programmes as deflated by the adjustment in Cmnd. 4234 to 1969-70 outturn prices and converted to1970-71 outturn prices by the latest view of price movements in the economy generally between 1969-70 and 1970-71, and the estimates of thoseprogrammes revalued at 1970 Survey prices. This adjustment is larger thanthe corresponding element in Cmnd. 4234 because of the rise in prices between1969-70 and 1970-71. (c) is the residual. The difference which appearsbetween this and the corresponding total in Cmnd. 4234 arises partly becausethe allowance made a year ago for the relative price effect has not provedquite correct. For example, if the allowance for the relative price effect in Cmnd. 4234 for 1970-71 had been exactly right the correspondingallowance now, a year later, for 1970-71 would be nil.(2) Cmnd. 4234, page 78, paragraph 15.72
19. The adjustments shown in this White Paper for the latest estimates ofexpenditure are for 1970-71 onwards lower than those in Cmnd. 4234 revaluedto 1970-71 prices:(i) The small reduction in the adjustments to 1970-71 outturn pricesreflects the lower estimates of expenditure on goods and servicescompared at constant prices with those in Cmnd. 4234.(ii) The much larger reductions in the adjustments to cash programmes are explained largely by the fact that the upward movement in pricesgenerally between 1969-70 and 1970-71 has been much steeper than was envisaged at the time of Cmnd. 4234.(iii) The lower estimates of the relative price effect result mainly fromthe wider coverage of the relative price effect as now calculated (seeparagraph 11 above) which tends on balance to reduce the total;another but smaller factor is that the programmes in this white paper are lower than those of Cmnd. 4234 as revalued.Allocation of adjustments to individual programmes20. The relative price effect and other adjustments have been allocated to individual programmes in Table 1.2. This allocation has been done inthe following way:(a) The overall adjustment to 1970-71 outturn prices is analysed by economic categories and the resulting factors are applied to individualeconomic categories within each programme. Account is taken ofinformation about the actual incidence of pay awards in 1970-71 on individual programmes.(b) For those programmes (or parts of programmes) which are estimated in money terms the estimates are deflated by the GDP factor cost price index.(c) Relative price adjustments are calculated for each economic categoryoverall and applied to the individual components of each programme at 1970-71 outturn prices estimated as in (a).21. For 1969-70 in converting the provisional outturn to 1970-71 prices the GDP factor cost price index is applied to the individual programmetotals and the relative price effect (including other adjustments) is obtainedas the residual after subtracting the programme totals as revalued to 1970Survey prices.22. The allocation to individual programmes of the relative price effect and other adjustments is less accurate in relation to those programmes than are the overall adjustments in relation to total public expenditure. Therates of growth for some programmes, with the relative price effect andother adjustments attributed, may be higher or lower than the rates of growth for the unadjusted programmes, depending on the composition ofthe individual programme concerned.23. For social security, housing, overseas aid (relative price effect) and agriculture, fisheries and forestry the adjustments are grouped together inTable 1.2 in the line &quot; Other adjustments &quot; (see paragraph 12, page 7).
311338Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office24. The classification of expenditure by resource category is as described in paragraph 18 of Appendix III of Cmnd. 4234.Average annual percentage changes in expenditure25. Tables 1.2 and 1.3 show in the final column the average annualpercentage changes in expenditure on each programme for the period1970-71 to 1974-75. This period has been chosen in preference to 1969-70to 1974-75 in order to avoid a possible distortion in the comparisons. Thedifference to be assumed on a trend basis for future years between therelative increase in wages and salaries in the whole economy and that of theGDP factor cost price index may be expected to be reasonably stable. But,for the corresponding comparison relating to a past year in this white paper, 1969-70 the actual movements of pay in the particular service need to be compared with the actual movement of the GDP factor cost price index; and as the incidence and timing of pay increases in the public sectoris not uniform, this comparison may be markedly different from one year toanother. For this reason 1969-70 has been excluded from the calculation ofthe average annual percentage changes.26. In all tables showing average annual percentage rates of changesin expenditure investment grants have been excluded from the calculation of the rates.
