THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government cp(71)11 COPY NO    C,&apos;..28 January 1971CABINETLOCAL. GOVERNMENT REORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. Proposals for the reorganisation of local government In Englandand Scotland are being circulated to the Cabinet in the form o  draft white Papers by the Secretary of Stats for the Environment (CP(71) 10)and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP(?1) 6),    Proposals in respect of wales are, for the reasons touched on in paragraph 6b below, being circulated by the Secretary of State for Wales in the form of a draftconsultative document (CP(71) 7).2. These proposals have been considered in detail by the ministerial sub-Committee on the Reorganisation of Local Government (PJH(G))S and the outcome of their work has been reviewed by the Ministerial Committee on regional Policy and the Environment (RE)0    The latter recommend theproposals to the Cablnst for endorsement as the basis for consultation withthe local authorities, a.nd recommend that the drafts should be published asproposed.    It will, I thinks be clear from these and from later parts of thismemorandum that, while many points can be left open for discussion, wemust commit ourselves now to the main features of the proposed structure.3. There are powerful political arguments for completing there organisation at bo b, levels In England and Wales by April 1974, in timefor the new authorities to take over full control before the likely date ofthe next election,,    The Lord President will be explaining what this impliesfor the legislative programme! its implications for the passage of theproposals through Parliament and their implementation are dealt with inparagraph 7f below.OUTLINE OF THE proposals.        A broadly similar two tier structure of authorities is proposed Ineach country.a.        The counties (&quot;regions&quot; in Scotland) will be responsible for education^ the personal social services, strategic planning, highwaysand transportation, police and fire services, some environmentalhealth services and a number of other services which are bestadministered over substantial areas or populations.   Almost ailcounties will have populations of over 200,000.1
b. The districts will be responsible for housing, planningdevelopment control^ refuse collection (and refuse disposal exceptin England), some environmental health services^ and certain other services which are best administered at a local level.    Theirpopulations fall mainly in the range of 40-1009 000 though some willbe substantially larger and those in the more sparsely populated areas of Scotland substantially smallercc0        The two tiers will be independent, with no element ofsubordination of requirement for compulsory delegation.,d. This broad pattern does, however, conceal certaindifferences between the three countries:I. In England she densely populated metropolitan areas are designated^ and within these the education and personal social service functions are assigned to the districts (whosepopulations are nearly all above 200, 000) rather than to themetropolitan counties,,ii0        In general rather more extensive functions would be allocated to district councils in Scotland and Wales than inEngland.    Refuse disposal., clean air and&quot;building regulations would be county functions in England, bu$ the responsibilityof the districts in Scotland and Wales along with otherenvironmental services.    In Scotland the districts would alsoformulate local plans but in the other two countries allplan making would be the responsibility of the counties.ill.       Moreover j in Wales it Is proposed to allow certainlarger districts to retain functions in relation to librariessweights and measures and food and drugs j exceptionallytheCardiff district would have power to make their own localplans.    No provision Is proposed in England for differentiatingbetween the powers of the larger and smaller districts.iv.       In the more sparsely populated parts of Scotland somefunctions are conferred not on the Inevitably weak district councils but on the &quot;regions&quot;, and Orkney and Shetland wouldhave their own virtually all-purpose authorities.e. Existing parish councils will be retained in England and in wales.    The drafts indicate that the Government will consider inthe course of consultations whether specific provision should bemade for &quot;grass-roots&quot; machinery elsewhere, but incline to theview that any community which wishes to establish a communitycouncil should be enabled to do so.2
DIFFICULTIES AND POINTS OF CONTROVERSY5*        Local government reform Is bound to be contentious whatever is done.But we are committed to reorganisation by our manifesto and to shelveit would be disastrous for local government and local services06.        The three sets of proposals a though close In substance3 arise fromvery different backgrounds.    Their reception is. therefore, expected todiffer.a. In England we have rejected the concept of unitary authorities,recommended in the 1969 R.eport of the Redcliffe-Maud Commissionand accepted by the previous Administration, in favour of a moretraditional two tier approach based on counties and districts.b. In Wales there have been several attempts at producing are formed structure, including previous White Papers in 1967 and1970,    (It is for this reason that It is not proposed to publish thecurrent proposals in that form),    The broad lines of the proposalsoutside Glamorgan and Monmouthshire are similar ^o the proposalsof the previous Administration, but within that area 3 proposedunitary authorities would be replaced by 3 counties and 17 districts.c0 In Scotland, the proposals are broadly in line&quot; with those ofthe Conservative Governments White Paper of 1963, and will be generally regarded as improvements on those of the WheatleyCommission which reported In 1969.    They will be subject to localcriticism, but the critics are unlikely to find substantial support forany particular alternatives.7, All the proposals contain elements which will prove controversial.,and they involve certain difficulties of which the Cabinet should be aware ja.        GENERAL STRUCTUREi. In England we may be criticised for not being sufficientlyradical and for abandoning H.edcliffe-Maud.    It will be said that,by failing to concentrate major functions in the hands of a small number of authorities, we are missing an opportunity for enablingmore power to be devolved from Whitehall.    But we are clear both that it is not possible to devise a unitary system which cansatisfactorily deal both with those services which are bestadministered over wider areas or large populations and with those for which large authorities are too remote, and that - with theexception of certain financial controls which are dealt with below -these proposals put no narrower limit than would any others on thepossibilities for devolution, which are very limited,3
ii.        By basing the English and Welsh systems on the counties weshall arouse strong anta-gonism from the larger boroughs and theAssociation of Municipal Corporations who favour a town-basedsystem - though this opposition may not be shared by the medium and smaller boroughs who will retain many of their present functions under our proposals,b. POSITION OF THE LARGE FREE-STANDING CITIESThe most vehement opposition can be expected from the existing county boroughs (other than those which will form part of metropolitan areas)and two or three Scottish cities.    These will lose to the counties many oftheir major functions notably education, the personal social services,transport and highways and strategic planning.    They willpress for therestoration of these powers,    The places affected includes inter alia,Bristol, Nottingham.-, Hull, Teesslde, Southampton, Portsmouth;, Plymouth,Cardiff, Swansea, Newport, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.    RE(G) gaveconsiderable thought to this problem, particularly in respect of education and the personal social service ss but came to the conclusion, which REendorsed, that most districts would, even after reorganisation, be too small to administer these services and that to make exceptions for the large cities would both wreck the couMy proposals as a whole and increasepressure for further additions to district functions.    This point is crucialto the proposals.    If we are to go ahead on these lines we must do soprepared to stand up to considerable opposition on this point, much of it from our own supporters.c. DISTRICT FUNCTIONSThe adverse reaction from the boroughs in England may be strengthened by the apparently rather weaker position of the district councils there thanin Scotland and Wales.    RE(G), however, examined the differencesindividually and concluded that no particular embarrassment should be caused by them.    The allocation of the minor services is, in any event,less crucial than that of the principal services and we can review thedistricts1 position on any service which appears to be particularly sensitivein the light of reactions to the White Paper.d. FINANCIAL CONTROLA major review of local government finance is in hand; the intention is to publish a Green Paper later this year.    We are satisfied that the outcome of that review will not be   incompatible with the structural proposals.The Chief Secretary, Treasury has, however, expressed concern that theCabinet should be aware of the implications for local government finance and Whitehall control of the combination of two key elements in theproposals: the independence of the two tiers and the allocation of housingto the distrlcta.
i. CONTROL OF CAPITAL expenditure from April, allocations of loan sanctions for locally determinedschemes will be made to county areas (as well as London and county boroughs) rather than to districts; in each county area the county and districts councils will jointly apportion between themselves thecapital allocations for the county area.    We should try to continuethis, but it will be difficult, when the large urban authorities have become districts, to devise an acceptable system for division.    Ifwe cannot, responsibility for distribution or at least for arbitrationwould have to revert to Whitehall,ii, DISTRIBUTION OF RATE SUPPORT grant the successor to rate support grant is likely to be distributed onlyto the county councils outside the metropolitan areas.    Since theneeds and resources of second-tier authorities will differ,equalisation between fchern is desirable.    Each county could only bemade responsible for equalisation (whether by grant or by differentialprecepting) if we accepted that in this regard the lower tier shouldbe subordinate to the upper.   Alternatively the legislation might require the districts to evolve an equalisation scheme among themselves.    But; this might not work in a situation in which some districts would be important ex-county boroughs.    Consequentlythere might have to be arrangements for arbitration by Ministers,iii. TREATMENT OF HOUSING FINANCEHousing finance raises the most difficult problem.    If housing isat the lower tier, haphazard variations in local deficits andsurpluses cannot be avoided and, unless corrected for, will resultIn wasteful differences in the standards of other services provided and va-rlatlons in the btirdens on ratepayers that may be difficultto defend.    Large housing surpluses will be involved by the endof the decade, and equalisation arrangements between districts ineach county similar to those mentioned in the preceding paragraphswill be needed - with similar problems.    If no workable solution on these lines can be found, housing surpluses (or a high proportionof them) would have to be paid over direct to the Exchequer - hardlya satisfactory outcome^ v/hen local authorities will be requiringmore funds, either in the form of the central government contributinga larger proportion of their expenditure or in the form of freshsources of local taxation,iv, RE recognised also that in Scotland, because a longer time will elapse before surpluses are likely to arise in local authority housing revenue accounts and because there is no pressure for the devolution of financial controls, two independent tiers would not havethe same disadvantages,5
re were very conscious of these difficulties.    But theallocation of housing to the districts is essential to a viabletwo-tier system^ while any proposals to subordinate the districts to the counties could only increase greatly theopposition to our proposals, and prevent them gaininggeneral acceptance.e, PROVINCIAL ARRANGEMENTSWe may be criticised for going ahead with local government reorganisationbefore the Commission on the  Constitution has reported.    However,Lord Crowther has confirmed that, so far as can be envisaged, there isnot likely to be anything in their report that would warrant any delay inproceeding with the reform of local government below the provincial level.For this reason and those set out in the drafts, RE felt that there was no case for delaying local government reform; Indeed, in the case of wales in particular it is highly desirable to press ahead in advance of theCommission^ report,f. IMPLEMENTATION&quot;We have established thatj. provided the necessary legislation is introduced at the beginning of the forthcoming 1971-1% session, reorganisation can becompleted by April 1974 in England and Wales.    (The Secretary of State forScotland is prepared to delay this to 1975 in Scotland, since the firstelections to the new authorities would be completed before the next GeneralElection),    Cabinet should, hp\yever, appreciate that the timetable for implementation will be very&amp;^jftahd will necessarily involve cuttingcorners.    Because in England it will not be possible to define in the bill the several hundred districts outside the metropolitan areas, the LocalGovernment Boundary Commission will need to start work informally on,and indeed to publish, informal proposals for the new pattern of county districts while the Bill is before Parliament, and before the new countyboundaries have received the Royal Assent,    Consultations with localauthorities on areas and other matters (Including electoral areas) will need to be kept within a vigorous timetable, and there will be complaintson this score.    There will necessarily be only limited scope fordiscussion of the district pattern in Parliament when the Local GovernmentBoundary Commission have made their recommendations, notwithstanding that their proposals may ultimately affect constituency boundaries.    Lessformal arrangements than^wlaill-y desirable will have co be made forinquiries into electoral areas, both for the counties and for the districts.Not only this, but the need for speed will compel all the first elections to beheld on the basis of a mbcture of single-and multi-member electoral areas;these will be provisional arrangements, to be reviewed in time for thesecond or third elections.    Again there will be no time for the ordersdefining the electoral areas to be subject to Parliamentary procedure andwe shall have to take a firm line with amendments on this paia.2.    Finally,it is clear that the need to concentrate an immense amount of work into thenext 3 years will inevitably involve a temporary Increase in staff in both theDepartment of the Environment and the Home Office, though probably notmore than 20 extra staff in all.6
ADVANTAGES OF THE proposals. RE were nevertheless convinced that the case for going ahead withthe proposals was overwhelming.    A major reorganisation of localgovernment is overdue.    The publication of proposals has created, in all three countries, a state of uncertainty whose continuance could Inhibit theimprovement or even maintenance of the existing level of provision and efficiency in local government services.    Oar proposals will have powerfulsupport not only In local government circles from the counties and county districts, but also from members of our own Party to whom reorganisationon the basis of the counties will have strong attractions.    Among the boroughs we shall retain, wherever we can, the dignities attaching to thepresent municipalities! many of these will consider their position to be substantially improved in this and other respects compared v/Ith theproposals of the previous Government,9. The drafts also leave open a number of electoral matters ofparticular interest to many of our supporters in local government, forexample the term of office, whether there should be single-memberelectoral areas, the timing of elections^, etc.    While RE(G) have reachedtentative conclusions on some of these matters, they are essentially oneswhich can best be decided after full consultation with all concerned.10.       The drafts also leave open the future of the aldermanlc system InEngland and Wales, a matter on which neither RE(G) nor RE were able toreach a firm conclusion.    The latter accepted that there were powerfularguments in favour of abolition, but there were some contraryconsiderations.    In view of the Importance of not provoking unnecessaryopposition at this stage, and of the possibility that a decision to maintainthe system might prove necessary to mollify our supporters in the boroughs,P-E decided that on balance the published documents should leave thematter open at this stage,CONCLUSION11.        I Invite my colleagues ja. To endorse the broad lines of the proposals set out In thethree drafts annexed to CP(71) 5, CP(71) 7 and CP(71) 10,b. To agree to the early publication of those drafts, subject toany minor amendments which may be agreed - the precisearrangements for publication to be settled between the three sponsorSecretaries of State and the Lord President.c. To agree that legislation on the reorganisation of localgovernment in England and Wales should be introduced very earlyin the 1971-72 session.7
d.        To agree that She Secretary of Stafee for the environment and I should arrange for RE(G) and RE to give further considerationto detailed proposals for legislation on local government reorganisation in all three countries in the light of public reactions to the proposals and the outcome of consultations v/Ith all concerned,,R m home Office SW128 January 19718
