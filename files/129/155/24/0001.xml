THE RB-211Note by the Secretary of State for defence i attach for consideration by the Cabinet the appraisal at Annex made bythe Ministerial Group on Rolls-Royce of the cost of continuing the RB-211project as compared with the cost of cancelling it; and our conclusions as to the course we should follow in the pending negotiations on the futureof the project.COPY NO VaCMinistry of Defence SW124 February 1971
THE RB 211 PROJECTI,     Cost of continuing with the RB 211 projectThe cost of continuing with the RB 211 has been assessed under thefollovdLng heads:A)    1971&quot;75 period (in cash terms)CookReport(519 mMASMAS(519 (646engines) engin3s) engines)MAS(with  100, 000price increaseper engine(646)Remaining launch cost	95	100	100	100Production loss	80	100	124	54C ontingencie s	25	45	45	45Total	200	245	270	200Notes(a) The Cook report is based on sales of 519 engines plus 21 flighttest engines    150 aircraft.    The MAS calculations are based on thesame figures, and alternatively 646 engines - 170 aircraft.   Thelatter figure was also adopted by Cooper Bros.(b) Cost of in-service development has been netted against profit onspare parts during the period; both figures are small.B)     Complete programme 1971 to about 1993 (discounted to 197&quot;! ) m(a)Cook reportEngines (incl,launching cost)Less profit on sparesTotalAssuming price increase after 5*19engines to cover full production costs170(50)12000Assuming price increase on ,all engines to coverfull production costs110(50)60 (Note (a))

Theprincipal differences between these figures and those of the Cookreport are:i0   higher estimate of sub-contractors new prices    5,000iia   additional programme costs suggested byCooper Bros.  30,000(c) If no production loss on any engine was assumed, the MS figures would be only about  80 million compared with the figure of 60 million given by the Cook Working Party.C)     innual net spend RB 211  (including working capital) mCook report Cooper Bros.

The first twoitems of  25 million each would fall on the Exchequers   The cost of damage payments should not be a charge to the Exchequer, but on the receiver^ though they would be a balance of payments and resource cost.There may also be further costs to HM&amp; arising out of the need to protectRoils Royce American assets (including patents).3
2.     Thus, at the old contract price for the first tranoho of engines:qLe cost of resources needed from now on to produce the SB 211 will exceed the markot value of the output produced by  120 million(Sir William Cook&apos;s estimate), or with a price increase of  100,000per engine by  150-170 million   (MAS&apos;s estimates), ie, financiallosses of that order.     Assuming the cost of these resources equalstheir market value in alternate uses, the waste of resources in producingthe RB 211 is of the same order.     An increase in the price paid byoverseas customers reduces this waste.II.    Cost of Cancelling the RB 211 Project.3o     But if the RB 211 is cancelled there will also be a waste of resources.i.   Resources will be unemployed or under-employed for a period during the transfer to alternate uses.   By the end of a year some two-thirds of the original 30,000 drop in employment may be made good.   The corresponding loss of output would be about  25 million.Measures to reflate demand to restore output to its former level would reduce these losses.     But in addition there will also be afurther loss of some  25 million of resources from the dis-economies of smaller scale production in Rolls-Royce.ii.   Resources will not necessarily be re-employed in the samepattern.   There will be a loss of exports not wholly offset by increases in other exports and import substitution, and regionaldisparities in unemployment rates (eg Northern Ireland) will beincreased.  Both effects will make it more difficult to achieve a given level of national output whilst maintaining a viable externalbalance and reasonable price stability.iii.   Other United Kingdom exports may suffer from a backlash.   this effect is unqupjitifiable but potentially significant, affecting afield of eg some  3,000 million of engineering exports&quot;; and whilethe damage to domestic output and employment could be made good bythe appropriate fiscal and monetary measures, the damage to thebalance of payments could only be repaired at a further cost inresources,4
iv0   Retaliatory action against Rolls-Royce could also severelydamage the balance of payments,   While a successful claim byLockheed and the airlines against the Receiver would result in upto  50 million payment across the exchanges, the greater damagewould be done by the possible loss of Rolls-Royce patents in theUSA resulting from a successful claim against Rolls Royce by UnitedStates creditors under New York State law,NB.     Cancellation of the project would also involve an unquantifiablewaste of investment to date in the technology of the project; andwould further take Rclls-Royce and the European engine industry outof the big engine field at least for some time to come,u.     The waste of resources is continuing the rb 211  is thus large -subject to the immediately preceding note, and on the moderately realisticassumptions in column (a) of paragraph 1(B) the complete programme 1971-1993 discounted to present day values could cost  120 million; it might cost up to twice as much if we could not negotiate an acceptable price for the engines.     The direct loss from abandoning it is believed to bemuch smaller,  50 million or perhaps up to  100 million if we includeLockheed damages of up to  50 million.     The decision however turns upona judgment about potential wider damage to the balance of payments(paragraph 3(ii), (Hi), und (iv).   If the risk of such damage is consideredreal and significant and it can be avoided by going on with the RB 211,that is the course which should be chosen.   If the risk is slight or the damage likely to be small, or if it has already been done, on a strictlyeconomic basis the RB 211 should be abandoned,5,    We are in any event committed to further-, discussions with Lockheedon 2 March,   These should make clear how far we can expect to mitigate the costs of continuing with the project; and clarify to some extent what arethe risks of wider damage arising from legal or commercial reactions tothe failure of Rolls-Royce,   We recommend that our opening position inthe discussions with Lockheed should be as follows -5
CO N Fl DENTIALi. We should ask a price for all production engines which willfully meet the estimated cost of production.     It must he recognised that the Lockheed Corporation is unlikely to meet uson this, if only because their estimate of future production costs is lower than ours, but the negotiation cannot reasonablystart lower, and pre sent ationally this is the most important point.   At the least, we must ensure that engines beyond the numberspecified in the old contract are not produced at a loss.ii. We should seek a reasonable US contribution to the remaininglaunching costs, the objective being a 50/50 split.   We can afford to take a more generous lino on this if we get the full productionprice for the engines.   In any event, we cannot reasonably expect to get away with less than the  60 million which was promised (onthe basis of  42 million from the Government and  18 million from the banks) last November.iii. Lockheed must be asked to renounce any claim they might have for delayed delivery under the original contract.iv0   We should offer to deliver engines 9 months later than proposedby the original contract, but should seek to ensure that heavypenalties would not arise if delivery slipped by a further 3 months.v. Wo should seek an appropriate warranty that Lockheed&apos;s ownfinancial situation will be such as to allow thorn to see the projectthrough.vi. Te should seek favourable terms on progress payments fromLockheed, so as to minimise the disadvantages cash flow positionof the new company in the early period.60      This is an opening bid.   We shall clearly not get our way on allthese points,,   It seems premature to consider at this stage what thesticking point should be - we first need more reformation about Lockheed&apos;sown position, and about the potentially critical legal point mentioned inparagraph 3(iv).   It should be noted that if we could secure terms for the engines beyond those specified in the original contract (ie beyond thefirst 519 engines) which did not involve an actual loss on production thedifference between the various cost estimates that have been provided wouldlargely disappear.24 February 19 71 ,
