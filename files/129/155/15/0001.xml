THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S (XTSERNMENT1. It has been clear for some time that there were more majorBills seeking places in next Session&apos;s legislative programme than we could hope to prepare and pass. The time has now come when Ishould ask my colleagues to consider their priorities. This hasparticular relevance to what is to be said in the White Papers on local Government Reorganisation.2,     The main contenders are as follows -i. europe the Ministerial Committee on the Appajoach to Europehave still to consider the report of the Official Committeeon the legislative implicabions of entering the european communities.     But it looks as if entry may involve 1 or 2Bills with a total length of perhaps 150 clauses, quite apart from any legislation which might be required as a consequence of joining.     If the date of accession is to be1 January 1973 drafting would need to commence in, ss.y,May of this year,ii. Local Government Reorganisation, England ,iii. Local Government Reorganisation, wales the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for -Wales are both anxious to legislate next- Session on localgovernment reorganisation in order that the new localauthorities may take over the reins in April 1974.     Aseparate Bill would&apos; ibe required for each country.Legislation for Scotland would follow in 1972/73.CP(71) 1529 January 1971CABINETLEGISIATTVE PRIORITIES - SESSION 1971/72Memorandum by the Lord President of the council
iv. Reorganisation of the Health service it is proposed as a means to greater efficiency totransfer to the National Health Service local health services at present administered by local authorities.     It is obviously desirable that the transfer should take effect atthe same time as the reorganisation of local government; theSecretary of State for Social Services considers   that this cannot be achieved unless the necessary legislation is passednext Session,v. National insurance the Secretary cf State for Social Services has submittedan outline of his proposals to the Social Services Committeeand will be bringing these before the Cabinet shortly.Legislation early next Session will be necessary if the new arrangements are to be brought into operation during thepresent Parliament (ie on 1 April 1974) and it is proppsedto publish a White Paper shortly after the Budget statement.The timetable proposed is extremely tight,vi. Housing FinanceThis Bill must be passed next Session if the plannedsavings are to be achieved.3,     There is a strong case for each of these candidates, but in total they represent a heavier load of major legislation than -we can hope to prepare and pass in a single Session,      We have to bear inmind that a variety of other legislation will certainly be needed and that we cannot commit all our resources whether drafting orParliamentary to major Bills.     I do not expect time on the Floorto be a limiting factor, but the number of Standing committees which we can make available will be; the only safe course is tosend every Bill likely to require a protracted Committee Stage toa separate Standing Committee.     In my judgment we will probablyfind it necessary to leave 2 of the Bills&quot;which I have listedover to a later Session.2
4.     I am not asking my colleagues to take final decisions now;that can only he done in the context of a complete set of proposalsfor the Session, which I hope to bring forward vdthin 2 r-ons&amp;s.But we must establish our priorities and ensure that we do nothing which conflicts with them.     The point arises immediately on the&quot;White Papers on the Reform of Local Government in England and invitation/ales, which both as drafted would virtually commit the Governmentto legislate next Session.     If my colleagues are clear that legislation in this field is so urgent that other Bills which Ihave listed should he postponed to make room for it, I have noobjection.     But unless we are clear on this point we should keepour options open by avoiding any commitment in the Yftdte Papers.Privy Council Office SW1 W W29 January 19713
