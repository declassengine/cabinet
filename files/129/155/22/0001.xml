HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y*S government cp(71) 22 COPY NO        G218 February 1971CABINETCABINET BUSINESSNote by the Prime Minister1. We are adding unnecessarily to our burden of work by the lengthand prolixity of the memoranda circulated to Cabinet and cabinet committees,    It is worth recalling what is said in Questions of procedure for Ministers on this subject -&quot;Memoranda . .,. should be as brief and as clear as possible.Time spent in making a memorandum short and clear will be saved many times over in reading and in discussion&quot;.2. Not enough is being done to sharpen and improve the presentation of problems and proposals for Ministerial decision.3. It should be a rule that the length of any memorandum circulatedto Cabinet or to a Cabinet Committee should not exceed two pages offoolscap at the maximum.    The memorandum itself should be confinedstrictly to essentials.    The problem and the background should be statedclearly and concisely, without unnecessary elaboration or repetition; andthe proposals for consideration or the recommendations for decision should follow, equally concisely.4. It may be desirable to support a memorandum with supplementaryfactual information or more extensive argumentation on points cf detail.If so, an annex may be appropriate; but this too should be set out in asconcise a fashion as possible.    The growing practice of adding a coveringnote to a long and detailed report by officials as a means of bringing a subject before Cabinet is not satisfactory.5, The Cabinet Office have been authorised not to accept for circulationany memorandum which does not comply with these criteria, as well as therequirements about prior interdepartmental consultation and adequate advancenotice which were set out in my Note on Cabinet Business (CP(70) 98) of29 October 1970.1
