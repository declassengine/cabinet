HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(71) 313 January 1971QUESTION TIMEMemorandum by the Lord President of the council I have been under pressure  or some time to state theGovernments intentions with regard to the report made by the SelectCommittee on Procedure last March, recommending changes in the procedures for tabling and handling Questions and in the duration of question Time.    Discussion in the Ministerial Committee on parliamentary procedure has revealed some difference of opinion and I think that mycolleagues would wish to have the opportunity to express their views.TABLING PROCEDURES2.     At present oral Questions may not be put down more than 21 days before they are due for answer; this rxile was introduced in 1965 becauseQuestions to major Departments were being tabled up to 6 weeks in advance.Generally the maximum period of notice has tended to become the minimum and the Select Committee therefore proposed that the period be reduced to10 sitting days (i. e. normally 2 weeks).3.     I think that the House would be resentful if the Government deniedit the opportunity to reach its own conclusion on this recommendation.The case for the change is now stronger than when the recommendation wasmade because under the current roster some Ministers come &quot;top of the list&quot; every three weeks? the present rule thus effectively debars a Memberwho has received an oral answer from tabling a follow-up Question to be answered next time the Minister comes first in order.    Shortening the periodof notice would, of course, have the disadvantage that it would reduce thescope for staggering the preparation and consideration of draft replies and supplementary material, and so add to the burden on Ministers and their departments, who in some cases face 40 or 50 or more oral Questions whenanswering first.    This is a consideration to which some of my colleaguesattach importance and I respect their views; but it is not one which wouldcommend itself to the House,     Most Members are likely to be in favour ofthe proposed change and I have come to the conclusion, as did the majorityof the Ministerial Committee, that the possible disadvantages are not sufficient to justify facing the obvious difficulty of resisting thisrecommendation.    I invite my colleagues to agree,copy NO    g cabinet
4.      The other changes proposed in the procedure for handlingQuestions are of minor significance! they are summarised in the Annex.I see no difficulty in accepting any of them, although the proposal that allfirst Questions should take precedence over all second Questions may mean that more Questions have to be answered at short notice.DURATION OF QUESTION TIME5.     The Select Committee recommended that the House should meet forPrayers on Mondays to Thursdays at 20 20 pm instead of 2. 30 pm.    Theyrejected proposals by Mr. John Boyd-Carpenter that Questions shouldcontinue until 3. 45 pm or 4 pm on days when the Prime Minister answered,on the ground that the interests of the House would not be served by reducing the time available for the business of the day.     They also rejected a proposal for Questions on Friday.6.     In the Ministerial Committee we were agreed in disliking thisrecommendation I we also thought that it would be unpopular with Membersgenerally.    If that view is endorsed by my colleagues, there remains thequestion of tactics.    The choice lies between declining to table thenecessary Motion, which was the course adopted with a similar recommenda-tion from the Procedure Committee in 1966-67, and tabling the Motion and leaving the House to make up its own mind; in either case I would say thatI doubted whether the change would be for the general convenience ofMembers.    I prefer the latter course.conclusion,     My view is that, despite the disadvantages attaching to some of therecommendations, the best course would be for me to table the Motionsnecessary to give effect to them and then, after explaining theGovernments point of view, to leave matters to a free vote,,    These are matters on which the House will expect to reach its own conclusions and Ido not believe that there is sufficient at stake on any of the recommendations to warrant the Government denying it the opportunity to do so.W w privy Council Office, SWl13 January 19712
ANNEXMinor Recommendations on the Handling of questions the Select Committee on Procedure recommended -a. that when a Member has put down 2 Questions fororal answer on any one day to the Minister at the head ofthe list, or to the Prime Minister,, his second question should appear on the Order Paper below all first or singleQuestions to that Minister by other Members.b, that any Question to the Minister &quot;top for Questions&quot;tabled on the last day on which notice can be given should appear on the Order Paper below any Questions already tabled,so as to assist the printer by avoiding late re-arrangement.c      that Questions tabled on the first appropriate day shouldnot go to the printer in the 4 o&apos;clock pouch but should all wait for the 6 olciock, so as to limit the effect on the chances of aQuestion of any minor query which temporarily delays itsdespatch,d.      that the Table Office should be empowered, once thedate of the opening of a new Session has been announced,formally to accept notices of Questions with a view to their inclusion amongst the notices given on the opening day.
