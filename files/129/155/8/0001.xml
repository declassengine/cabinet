1POLICYINTRODUCTIONIn the Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy 1970(Cmnd. 4521), the Government set out its defence objectives asfollows:(1)    to enable Britain to resume, within her resources, a proper share of responsibility for the preservation ofpeace and stability in the world;(2)    to improve the capabilities of the Armed Forces, to overcome their manpower difficulties, and to enhancetheir role in the community;(3)    to establish ana maintain a sound financial basis on which ,to develop and carry out defence policy and plans for theyears ahead.2.    Britain&quot;s basic security continues to depend on the strength ofthe North Atlantic Alliance and it is to NATO that by far the greaterpart of Britain&apos;s military forces is committed.   But the first ofthe objectives above recognises that British interests and responsibilities do not lie exclusively within NATO.    Britain&apos;political and trading interests are world-wide and they can flourishonly in stable conditions.    She must also,  therefore, be willing toplay her part, though on a scale approximately^ropriate to her resources, incountering threats to stability outside Europe.    For british territories overseas, and for those to whom Britain owes a specialfluty by treaty or otherwise, there is a direct responsibility toProvide protection.    In South fcast Asia, the Government is engagedin working out Five Power Commonwealth defence arrangements for the/ Malaysia.
Malaysia and Singapore area,   /&quot;in the Persian Gulf, the Governmenthas decided on measures (see paragraphs 19-21 below) which it considers willeffectively demonstrate its continuing concern for the peace and stability of the area. J   British support for CENTO and SKATO willcontinue.   Britain will also continue to support the efforts of theUnited Nations and other international authorities working to eliminate the sources of tension and conflict between nation? and to promote armscontrol and disarmament.3.     The second objective is directed towards making good as faras possible the deficiencies in manpower and equipment caused bythe policies of the previous Administration, and to ensure a fuller understanding by the commurity of the purpose and tasks ofthe Armed Forces.    Cmnd. 1+521 reported on the immediate decisions which had been taken to strengthen Britain&apos;s military capabilities;other measures are mentioned later in this statement.k*     The third objective related to the Government1s resolve that defence plans and policies should not in the future be under constantthreat of financial retrenchment.    The Government does not under-eatimate the difficulties created by ever-rising   costs in thedefence field;   but it recognises the need for a stable basis for future planning and is satisfied that its plans can be accommodated within the firm targets established for the defence programme overthe next four financial years,WESTERN security the CONTINUING THREAT5.     Western security remains under the shadow of the presentand potential threat of the vast military resources of the soviet union.    The threat is not confined to the NATO area.   Backed by itsstill growing strategic nuclear capability, its large and modern-conventional forces and its rapidly expanding navy and merchant/ marine
marine, the Soviet Union is engaged in enhancing its power and influence across the world.    Success in this policy will be at theexpense of Western political interests and couH also put increasingly:at risk important Western economic interests.    In the Indian Oceanand elsewhere, the Soviet Union will also be competing with theefforts of China to extend her political influence among the developing nations. - -Europe and the Atlantic6.     There has been a continuous rise in real terms in defence and defence-related expenditures of the Soviet Union over the last fiveyears of about 6 per cent per year on average;    and the trend ofthese expenditures in the Warsaw Pact as a whole is steadily upwardseven though the rate of increase in 1971 may be rather slower.There are massive Russian forces permanently stationed opposite thecentral region of Allied Command Europe in Czechoslovakia, east germany, Hungary and Poland. . In April 1970 there was the largestaver concentration of Soviet ships in the North Atlantic engaged ina major maritime exercise.    The Caribbean is also an area ofincreasing activity by the Soviet Navy.The Mediterranean7.     In the Mediterranean, the position of the Ooviet Union has grown, stronger through the scale of its penetration of the arab world and the increasing size of its naval forces.    Five years ago the maximum number of Russian naval vessels in the Mediterraneanfas five surface ships, five submarines and ten auxiliaries.    In1:970 on latest assessments this had risen to thirty surface ships,ten submarines and twenty-five auxiliaries./ Indian Ocean
Indian Ocean and the Gulf8.     The Soviet Union is building up its military, capabilities inthe Indian Ocean area.    This is in support of its political aim off gaining influence among the non-aligned countries at the expenseof Western interests;    the increasing Soviet naval presence alsoposes a potential threat to sea routes vital to the economy of britain and Western Europe.    Five years ago there were no Russiannaval vessels in the Indian Ocean.    In 1970, at a peak period, therewere seven surface warships, at least four submarines and nineauxiliary vessels.    Port facilities are available which could be exploited by the Soviet Navy.   Air-field development for Soviet usehas been taking place in South Yemen and Somalia.East-West Negotiations9,     In parallel with the expansion of its political and militaryinfluence, the Soviet Union has shown itself willing to negotiate&apos;on certain problems in response to Western initiatives.    The talks on strategic arms limitation between the Soviet Union and theUnited States will enter their fourth session at Vienna next month.Four Power talks on ways of improving the situation in and aroundBerlin began at ambassadorial level in March 1969 and have taken&quot;nlace since at intervals of about three weeks.    Inner-German talkswere resumed at official level at.the end of November 1970 following the meetings between Herr Brandt and the East German Prime Ministerearlier in that year.    There has also been some forward movement inthe. Federal German Republic&apos;s Ostpolitik, with the signature on 12fenst 197O of the Soviet-German Treaty and on 8 December 1970 of/ the German-
the German-Polish Treaty.   But as other events in 1970 have shown/&quot;&quot;in particular.....j a willingness to negotiate, though welcome initself, is not an indication of a change in basic Soviet objectives.There appears to be no incompatibility for the Russians in simultaneouslynegotiating and exerting the kind -of pressures which could severelyprejudice East-West relations.    Thus, it remains to be seen whetherthe Russians are interested in progress towards eletente or merely in .Western endorsement or the stains quo in &quot;Europe on Soviet terms.THE ALLIANCE1&apos;S RESPONSE10.   Western policies must, therefore, continue to be based on thetwin concepts of defence ana c.etente.    The military strength ofthe Alliance must be maintained at luveis sufficient to deteraggression, whatever form it may take, at the some time as theWestern countries are seeking to engage the Soviet Union and her allies in discussions which could lead to a real and lasting relaxation of tensions between East and West.&quot;Alliance Defence 70&quot;11.   These considerations were essential elements in the majorexamination, conducted over the last year,  of not&apos;s defencecapabilities (the &quot;Alliance Study on Defence Problems for the 1970s&quot; -short title AD70).    This review, which covered the whole spectrum of nato defence problems, included a reassessment of the threat;    an appraisal of current military capabilities, force dispositions and operational plans in relation to future requirements;   and a stock-taking of the economic resources available to the Alliance.-   - - / 12..5
12.   .AD70 has reaffirmed that NATO strategy, based on flexibility;, lit;Response and defence well forward, is soundly conceived in relation-to the threat;    and that its credibility will continue to depenu .ontht maintenance by NATO of the right balance of conventional and&apos;nuclear forces, including theatre nuclear forces.    In particular^the study Identified certain imbalances between NATO and Warsaw PactCapabilities in the conventional field.    It established the need forpriority to be given,  in the structure and organisation of NATO&apos;aConventional forces, to measures designed to enhance their deterrent effect against the full range of possible aggression,    to strengthen the will of member countries to resist foreign pressures, and to-bring-reinforcements rapidly to bar in a oeveloping crisis,;1;3.   The study recognised that the vVest has the basic resources&apos;for adequate conventional strength and drew attention to the disparity&apos;$n recent years between the upward trend of defence expenditure   in;real terms in the Warsaw Pact countries and the downward trend among he European NATO countries.    It underlined the importance of close collaboration between all the members of the Alliance to provide thelipst&apos; effective collective defence posture;    and of ensuring that; t*ue. .burden of maintaining the necessary military strength is fairlyshared. ,1.4*   fATO Defence Ministers at their meeting in Brussels in December&quot;1970 endorsed the conclusions and recommendations of AD70 and set.the course for further intensive, study and action during 1971.    TheUnited States Government gave a pledge, that, given a similar approachits&apos;;; Allies, it would maintain and improve its own forces in Europe;,shd that it would not reduce them except ,in the context of reciprocal/ East-West6
East-West action.    For- their- part, ten of the European NATO countriesannounced their adoption of a special &quot;European Defence ImprovementProgramme&quot;, designed both to increase the effectiveness of national forces committed to NATO and to accelerate certain common projects of major military significance, notably the NATO integratedcommunications system and measures to improve the protection of aircraft on the ground.    The total cost over the next five years ofthese additional measures will be in the region of  hOOm. and further substantial expenditure will arise thereafter.BRITAIN&apos;S PARTKATO15.   The main  components of the substantial forces which Britaincommits to NATO are described in Chapter II below.    They include theBritish contribution to the western strategic deterrent and theBritish forces deployed for the defence of the Atlantic and the centralregion of Allied Command Europe.   Britain also provides an important .part of NATO&apos;s mobile reinforcement capability and a maritime presence in the Mediterranean.16* I Cmnd. 1+521 described a number of measures on whicu the Governmenthad decided to strengthen British forces committed to the Alliance,,   ,These measures will constitute a major contribution to the european defence Improvement Pro gramme.    They consist of the increase in the maritime strength of the Alliance by the decision to run onH.M.S. Ark Royal;    the provision, as part of the expansion of theTerritorial and Army Volunteer Reserve, of an additional armouredoar regiment;    and the revision of the Jaguar programme to make possible a major increase of four- squadrons in Royal Air B&apos;orce offensive/ support7
support aircraft available to SACEUR.   / Mention of infrastructurecontribution if decision taken in time.J717.   Britain is also engaged in a range of other co-operative projectswith her European allies.    These include the multi-role combat aircraftproject with Germany and Italy, the Jaguar aircraft and the Exocetand martel guided-weapons with France, and a programme for a newcombat reconnaissance vehicle with Belgium.    Britain has established a regular series of bilateral staff talks with her European allies,primarily designed to promote the harmonisation of tactical concepts.The Government is ready to explore new possibilities of collaboration in the defence field where it can be shown that they will contributeusefully to the cohesion and effectiveness of the European defence effort.Indian Ocean18.   /&quot;To be drafted. J?The Persian Gulf/?9,   The Government has now considered Sir William Luce&apos;s recommendations on British policy in the Persian Gulf.    It shares the widely held viewthat a Union of Arab Emirates, capable of assuming all the responsibility-facilities of fully independent statehood, would best meet the requirementsof the area;    and it has accordingly decided that all the existing agreements and treaties made individually with Bahrain, Qatar and the seven Trucial States will be terminated by the end of 1971.    TheGovernment is prepared to offer to a Union of Arab Emirates a treatyOf friendship which would contain an undertaking to consult together in time of need.    This undertaking will not commit Britain to military intervention.20.   These decisions mean that, after the end of 1971, Britain will nolonger have defence commitments to Bahrain,  Qatar and the TrucialStates.    Her defence commitment to Kuwait will also cease in May thisyear.    There will,  therefore, be no requirement for British forces tobe permanently stationed at Bahrain and Sharjah as at present.Decisions on the timing and necessary redeployment of British forces will depend upon the date on which all Britain&apos;s existing commitments in the area are terminated.21.   But the Government has no intention of severing its connexionswith this area and is anxious to make a contribution to Its stability.It recognises the importance of developing .the confidence of the Unionof Arab Emirates and the need for the Union to build up effective and-       / self-sufficient
9/ bilateral elf-sufficient defence forces;    and is prepared to offer thefollowing measures in the defence field to assist the Union:(1)    transfer of the Trucial Oman Scouts to the Union to formthe nucleus of its army.    The Union would assume full financial responsibility;   but,  if requested, Britain will be prepared toloan British officers and other personnel to the union forces and to assist in the supply of equipment;(2)    the provision of small British liaison teams capable ofgiving expertise and training to the naval, army or air branchesof the Union Defence Forces.    Arrangements for the provision ofsuch teams-will be reviewed annually;(3)    regular visits to the Persian Gulf by ships of the royal navy;training visits to the Gulf from tine to time by Britishtroops of company or possibly battalion strength and Royal AirForce aircraft.South East Asia22.   Good progress has been made towards the establishment of FivePower defence arrangements in Malaysia and Singapore.    A meeting of senior officials took place in January under the chairmanship of thePermanent Secretary of the Singapore Ministry of Defence at which therewas a review of the planning in hand by the military authorities onthe spot and agreement was reached on the matters to be considered by ministers of the five Governments, who will be meeting in London inthe spring.    Those matters include the political framework for thedefence arrangements, which will replace the Anglo/Malaysian defence agreement;    the establishment of an Air Defence Council, which will beresponsible for the functioning of the future integrated air defence system to which all five countries will be contributing;    and proposals relating to future arrangements for regular consultation between thefive Governments.    It is hoped to bring the new arrangements into forcetowards the end of the year.23.   In the light of the replacement of the Anglo/Malaysian defence agreement by the new defence arrangements, the British Jungle Warfare .School in Johore will become a Malaysian establishment.    The british military authorities will continue to operate the School until the endof this year, when it will be transferred to the Malaysian authorities.The Malaysian Government, recognising the great importance of jungletraining within the new defence arrangements, will be undertaking
bilateral discussions with its partners about meeting their needs forthe use of the facilities of the School and the associated trainingareas and ranges, as well as for training areas elsewhere in Malaysia.2iu   The British military contribution to the defence arrangements will be deployed in the area during 1971-72.    In addition to the ;sea,land and air forces previously announced in Cmnd. 1+521, naval forcesEast of Suez will include a sixth frigate or destroyer-,    / it has alsobeen decided that the Royal Australian Navy should provide.a submarinein the Singapore area for most of the time;    and the Royal Navy willasvsist by contributing one submarine to the Australian squadron.^7from 1972 onwards other combat units will also come to the area forMaritime,  jungle, and air training;    it is planned that these units should include larger warships from time, to time, a regular flow of major and minor Army units, and the deployment for periods of several weeks at a time of Vulcan, Phantom, and Buccaneer detachments.   british forces deployed in the area will, along with the forces of Australiaand New Zealand, come under the authority and control of an integrated ;command headed by an officer of two-star rank, provided by each of thethree nations in turn.    This command structure, served by integratedstaffs drawn from the Services of the three countries, will ensure thatthe forces of Britain, Australia and New Zealand deployed in malaysia and Singapore are operated, administered, and supported in the most effective and economical way.25.   British, Australian, and New Zealand staffs are now planningtogether the establishment of support facilities which will, so far aspracticable, be provided on a joint basis. / Discussions are in progress with the Singapore authorities about the land and facilities which willbe required. J   Meanwhile the rundown of the British base in Singaporecontinues;    and the value of land, facilities and associated equipmentnotified to Parliament as likely to be transferred free of charge tothe local Governments in the current financial year amounts to aboutSl9ra.MANPOWERJhe Services;26.   Cmnd. 1+521 set out the serious deficiencies in Service manpower&quot;hich the Government found oh taking office.    On 1 April 1970 theServices were nearly five per cent below the&apos; strength required to meet/ the previous
the previous Administration&apos;s defence -programme.    Only 28,000 maleother ranks were recruited in 1968-69, a fall of almost thirty per centcompared with two years earlier.    There was a welcome improvement in,1969-70 to over 3h,000 and recruitment in 1970-71, if current trend3are sustained, may exceed 38,000;   hut the numbers being recruited arestill well short of requirements and the spread of higher education and the raising of the school-leaving age will both have the effect of reducing the number of young men available for recruitment.27.   The Government will give the highest priority to improving the;manpower situation.    It firmly believes that its announced intentionto restore the Armed Forces to their rightful place in the life of thenation and to keep defence in the front rank of its priorities will initself provide a direct encouragement to recruitment.   But this can be only a beginning.    The Government will also maintain a constant reviewof conditions of service across the whole field with a view to making and keeping them competitive with civilian conditions.    Service life and work make special demands and offer unique challenges to theindividual;    this is part of their appeal to those who join theServices.   But it is important that conditions of service should differ from those in civilian life only where there is a genuine militaryneed.    In accepting the case made by the Donaldson Committee forgiving boy entrants to the Services a chance to shorten their engagementson reaching the age of 18,  the Government is putting this principleinto practice.    Other measures to improve conditions of service are described in Chapter IV.Civilian Staff28,   The Ministry of Defence employs large numbers of civilian staffin support of the Armed Forces, embracing a wide range of professionsand skills.    Administrative and other office   work accounts for onlya proportion of the staff:    nearly one half of the non-industrialStaff and   about two-thirds of the industrial labour force areemployed on production, repair and   supply.    The non-industrial staffinclude, for example, the 1,500 officers of the Royal Fleet AuxiliaryService.    It is frequently more economical to employ civilians in place of service personnel and, where policy permits,  this is done.On 1 April 1971 the total civilian strength is expected +0 be about/; 316,200^7 including /&quot;62,900-7 locally engaged staff abroad.    This isin line with the downward trend in the number of civilians over recentyears.    There will be a further reduction of about /&quot;l6,000 7 by 31/ March
C ONEIDENTIAL -   -March 197?.    Headquarters staff of the Ministry of Defence will, beabout /&quot;15s600-7 on 1 April 1971.DEFENCE ORGANISATION29.    The White Paper on &quot;The Reorganisation of Central Government&quot;(Cmnd. 2+506) set out the principles which now apply to the organisationof the functions of government.    These principles will be taken fully into account in the gearing of the organisation of Britain&apos;s defence effort to meet the requirements of the defence policy objectives which the Government has established.    As announced in Cmnd. 2+506, theparticular problem of how best to organise the integration of all defence research and development and procurement activities, under theresponsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence, is being examined by a project team headed by Mr, Derek Rayner.Headquarters Organisation30.    The committee under the chairmanship of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence, set up in July 1969*-is continuing its examination of the shape and size of the Ministryof Defence and associated major headquarters.    After firstconcentrating on the top structure of the Ministry, the committeeturned its attention to the relationship of the Ministry of defence with Command Headquarters, and the management methods and techniquesused at headquarters.    Following a detailed study of the way inwhich work is carried out v/ithin the Ministry of Defence in the personnel and logistics fields,  the committee made recommendations,which have been accepted, for the delegation of work to Commands andthe transfer of work to the provinces which together should permit ofa reduction of some / 2,000-7 Service and civilian posts in London overthe next few years;    and the resultant streamlining and combination of work with that already carried out in Commands should produceworthwhile savings.31.   The committee has also examined the Ministry&apos;s financial methods,including accounts, audit and contract.    In the light of its recommendations in these fields, a Directorate of Internal Audit isbeing set up which should both improve management and lead to staffeconomies;    and increased powers of local purchase and otherprocedural changes will be introduced in the contracts area making for more efficient use of staff and manpower.savings./   Command
Command Strue ture32.    The process of streamlining the Command structure of all three services in the United Kingdom continues.    Major changes have alreadybeen made in the Command structures of the Royal Navy and the RoyalAir Force.    In 1972 Headquarters, Army Strategic Command andHeadquarters, Southern, Northern and Western Commands will close andbe replaced by a single -Command Headquarters at Wilton,  to be knownas Headquarters United Kingdom Land Forces.    The new Headquarterswill, with a few exceptions, command all Army units in the UnitedKingdom;    and the number of Army districts in England will bereduced by two.   These changes will both improve efficiency andachieve manpower economies in the order of 250 military and 1000civilian posts.THE DEFENCE BUDGET33* The Defence Budget estimates for 1971-72 total S,^25k5j^*At&apos;constant prices these are  1m, below the target published in cmnd. 1+521 (for details see Annex B, Table 1+). These estimateswill represent ..... per cent of the Gross National Product.

The general purpose combat forces of the Royal Air Force are all the front line formations and units except those designated AirMobility Forces,  i.e. the transport and tanker forces.     They consistof strike/attack, offensive support, tactical reconnaissance, long-range maritime reconnaissance and air defence aircraft and units,deployed within Strike Command, Air Support Command and Royal AirForce Commands overseas.Strike Command22,   The Command has four Groups:a. No 1 (Bomber) Groupb. No 11 (Fighter) Groupc. No 18 (Maritime) Groupd. No 90 (Signals) Group.It is also administratively responsible for the Military Air TrafficOrganisation.     The majority of the aircraft in the Command are committed to NATO.      No 1 Group provides Vulcan strike/attack andVictor and Canberra reconnaissance aircraft for SACEUR and in supportof SACLANT and strike/attack Buccaneers in the maritime role.     No 11Group provides Lightnings for SACEUR and phantom &quot;TC-ls for SACLANT inthe air defence role;   No 18 Group provides Shackletons and Nimrodsfor SACLANT and CINCHAN in the long-range maritime reconnaissancerole.     As a result of the decision to retain H.M.S. Ark Royal after1972, the numbers of Buccaneers and Phantom FGls in Strike command for maritime operations will be smaller than hitherto planned.Air Suuoor-t Command23.    Apart from its transport forces (see Air Mobility Forces),  theDEPLOYMENT22/Command
Command provides, in No 38 Group, offensive support aircraft for thesupport of the Army in the field.     The Group is now re-equipped withphantom figures which can undertake attack and all weather reconnaissancetasks   and which, as the offensive air element of the United KingdomMobile Force, are earmarked for assignment to SACEUR.     The Command&apos;sHarriers are assigned to SACEUR in the close support and reconnaissancerole for the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (Air).ROYAL AIR FORCE COMMANDS OVERSEAS24.   Aircraft are deployed overseas as follows:  ;a. Royal Air Force Germany     This is a tactical force assigned to SACEUR as part of 2 Allied Tactical Air Force:    it includesCanberras, Buccaneers and Phantoms in the strike, attack and reconnaissance   roles;   Harriers for close support and reconnaissance;   Lightnings for air defence;    and Wessexhelicopters for Army support.     Bloodhound surface-to-air missilesand light anti-aircraft gun squadrons of the Royal Air ForceRegiment are deployed for the defence of the Command&apos;s airfieldsagainst low level air attack.b. Far East Air Force     The Command includes units of theRoyal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force, asIwell as of the Royal Air Force.     Although the strength of theRoyal Air Force contribution has continued to run down, theRoyal Air Force still provides Lightnings in the air defencerole and Shackletons for long-range maritime reconnaissance,together with supporting transport aircraft and helicopters.After 1971 the Royal Air Force will contribute a detachment of Nimrod long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft and someWhirlwind helicopters to the Five Power defence arrangements.In addition, frequent visits will be made by Vulcans, Buccaneers,Phantoms and Victors from this country and general support for .23 /Wits
units and detachments will be provided by transport aircraft of Air Support Command.c*     Air Pore   Gulf    The Royal Air Force provides Hunters forground attack and fighter reconnaissance. Shackletons formaritime reconnaissance and supporting transport aircraft andhelicopters.     Detachments from other theatres make regulartraining visits to the area.d.     Near East Air Force     In Cyprus there are Vulcans declared to CENTO, Lightnings, Bloodhounds and light anti-aircraft guns for air defence, and transport aircraft.       In Malta thereare Canberras declared to CENTO for reconnaissance, andShackletons,     The Shackletons will be replaced by Nimrods, someof which will be earmarked for assignment to SACETJR and theremainder declared to CENTO.EQUIPMENT25.   Deployment of the Phantom, Harrier and Nimrod will be nearing completion by the end of this year.     The first Buccaneers have beendeployed to R.A.F. Germany.     Planning for the introduction of theJaguar is going ahead    in the light of the decision to provide an extra four squadrons in the front line,  so increasing significantlythe United Kingdom&apos;s contribution of offensive support aircraft to SACEUR,Some Shackleton aircraft are being converted t o provide airborne early warning over the sea.     More trials with Harrier aircraft will becarried out from an aircraft carrier to evaluate the potential ofV/STOL aircraft in the maritime environment.COST OF ROYAL AIR FORCE GENERAL PURPOSE COMBAT FORCES26.

Air mobility for the Services is provided by the transport andtanker forces.     Strategic transport squadrons are equipped withVC 10, Comet, Belfast and Britannia aircraft;   and the tactical force with Hercules, Argosy, Andover, Wessex and Whirlwind aircraft.     TheHercules is also used extensively in the strategic freighting role.During 1970 the tactical force was reduced by the rundown of oneArgosy squadron.     All elements of the transport fleet exerciseregularly in their war roles.     The tanker force of Victor aircraft in Strike Command provides facilities to maintain combat squadrons
in constant air-to-air refuelling practice, supports the day-to-day-operations of the United Kingdom air defence force   and generallypractises its role of operational support as required for all RoyalAir Force combat aircraft   world-wide,  including those which may been gaged in land-based maritime air opex-ations.EQUIPMENT28,   Most of the Argosies will be withdrawn from the transport roleby the end of the year;   the Puma support helicopter will shortlyenter service.COST OF AIR MOBILITY FORCES29,   The cost of air mobility forces in 1971-72 in terms of money and manpower is estimated to be: m.

The most important operational role of the Armed Forces duringthe last twelve months has again been in Northern Ireland.      In EastPakistan and elsewhere they have assisted in relief operations.They have taken part over the last year in an extensive exerciseprogramme ranging from large scale joint exercises in support of treaty obligations to individual unit training both at home and overseas.     This has involved the deployment of units, principally by26 /aircraftCONFIDENTIAL
aircraft of Air Support Command and amphibious ships, to train intwenty-seven countries from Norway to the Solomon Islands.NORTHERN IRELAND31*    In January 1970 there were seven major units in the infantryrole in Northern Ireland (five more than the pre-1969 garrison).After serious rioting at Easter a further unit was deployed to theprovince in April,     Another unit was sent out in June.32,    During June there were a number of disturbances in both belfast and Londonderry.     Particularly serious rioting, lasting four days,started in Belfast on 26 June in which 71 soldiers were injured.During the following weekend a major disturbance broke out in thePalls Road area of Belfast  in    reaction to a search for arms by theArmy and the Royal Ulster Constabulary;    28 soldiers were injured.As a result of these disturbances it was decided to increase and bring forward the reinforcements planned to cover the period of the orange celebrations of 12 July;   and a further six major units, togetherwith a tactical headquarters and logistic support were deployed to northern Ireland.     In addition the Ulster Defence Regiment was called up full-time during this period to support the regular forcesin patrolling border areas and guarding key points;   most of its members worked eight hours on duty in every twenty-four.     the regiment earned high praise   for the efficiency, courtesy and gooddiscipline it showed over this period.33.    In the event, the 12 July celebrations passed off quietly andfor the remainder of the year disturbances were fewer and less intense.By the end of November it was possible to reduce forces deployed inthe infantry role to eight major units.3h.   The two major infantry units making; up the pre-1969 force levelwere on two-year tours accompanied by their families.     Because ofthe shortage of accommodation the reinforcing battalions have been on emergency tours which,  in view of the nature of the task,  theuncongenial living conditions and family separation,  are limited to27 /aboutCONFIDENTIAL
about four months.     This calls for frequent replacements of units.Units of the Royal Artillery, the Royal Engineers, the Royal Marinesand the Royal Air Force Regiment have continued to be employed on internal security duties in Northern Ireland.      It has also been necessary to continue to redeploy units temporarily from B.A.O.R.for service in the Province, though these units remain available fortheir NATO role and can be returned rapidly to Germany should theneed arise.     The position has been improved by housing a thirdbattalion in accommodation which will enable the men to serve a twoyear tour accompanied by their families and a fourth unit will beso accommodated during the year.35.    H.M. Ships have carried out patrols of   the Northern Irelandcoast in support of security operations.      Air Support Command has provided the essential air mobility backing for security operations in Northern Ireland including a detachment of Wessex helicopters.The Command has also provided air transport to move troops at short notice on a number of occasions.36.    In addition to their military duties, members of the Armed forces have carried out a large number of community relations projectsaimed at assisting the local population and lessening tension betweenthe communities.     During the floods in August and September 1970 theServices rescued people cut off by floodwater, provided food andhelped clean streets and homes.37*   The Services have thus played a major part in maintaining freedomunder the law and in trying to lower tension in Northern Ireland.In the face of intense provocation,  irksome conditions and physicaldanger, they have continued to display commendable restraint, courageand humanity.THE NATO AREAOPERATIONSSurveillance and Interception38.   The Western Fleet and Royal Air Force long-range maritime0q /reconnaissance
reconnaissance aircraft monitor the movements of Soviet naval forces operating in the North Atlantic.     Air defence aircraft, supported by-tankers of Strike Command, intercept and investigate unidentifiedaircraft approaching the United Kingdom and operating on thenorthern flank of the NATO area.Fishery Protection39o    Ships of the Fishery protection Squadron patrol 3000 miles ofcoastline.     Frigates from the Western Fleet carry out distant waterfishery protection patrols off northern Norway and on the Iceland/Greenland fishing grounds.Hydrographic SurveyhO.    Survey vessels of the Royal Navy provide essential services both for defence and commerce.SalvageMinehunters have been involved in several operations to locatethe remains of crashed aircraft and, with diving teams and salvagevessels, assist in their recovery.MILITARY AID TO THE CIVIL COMMUNITYSearch and Rescue Operationsh2.   H.M. Ships, Naval and Royal Air Force helicopters and otherRoyal Air Force aircraft helped in search and rescue operations bothin and around the coast of this country and in many other parts ofthe world.Bomb Disposal43*   Among the tasks carried out by Service bomb disposal experts,the Plymouth Command Clearance Diving Team undertook the dangerous operation of disposing of the bombs in the wreck of theArnold Mask off Jersey.Engineer Taskskh.   The Royal Engineers inserted temporary piers under the Britanniabridge in the Menai Straits after it was seriously damaged by fire,/to29
to enable British Railways to make permanent repairs.     Other majortasks performed, by the Royal Engineers included building a bridgeover the River Yarty after floods in South West England and building a permanent stadium for the people of Gibraltar, which will becompleted this year.Relief Operations Mounted from United Kingdom45.     The largest relief operation mounted from Britain followed the ending of the Nigerian civil war in January 1970.     Land Rovers,trucks and medical supplies were provided by civilian organisations and the three Services and were flown out by Air Support Command andother agencies.     Air Support Command aircraft also flew relief supplies during the year to Tunisia, the Malagasy Republic, Turkey,Rumania and Peru.EXERCISESNATO46.    Naval and air forces participated in eight NATO maritime exercisesin the Atlantic, North Sea and Mediterranean.     These includedaircraft carrier support to both SACLANT and SACEUR.     Amphibiousforces took part in exercises on the northern and southern flanksand a Royal Marines Commando group carried out extensive training underarctic conditions in conjunction with other NATO forces.     R.A.P.Strike Command participated with strikes delivered by Vulcans andBuccaneers, with tactical and long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft and with air defence aircraft supported by Victor tankers.47.   Army and Royal Air Force units assigned to the Allied CommandEurope Mobile Force practised their role in exercises held in northNorway and Turkey.     They also carried out winter warfare trainingin Norway.48.   B.A.O.R. units exercised both in Germany and other countries;and Royal Air Force combat squadrons were involved in over fortyair exercises.     All the combat squadrons and associated ground/environment
environment stations underwent at least one tactical evaluationexercise to prove their ability in their assigned role.National and Commonwealth49.    Submarine, anti-submarine and weapon training exercises were held by naval and air forces in the Norwegian Sea and Gibraltar areas.Royal Naval Reserve units took part in a full programme of exercises.50.    In July, the Joint Anti-Submarine School, Londonderry wasreconstituted as the Joint Maritime Operations Training Staff in theRosyth area.     Since then a comprehensive programme of joint royal navy and Royal Air Force maritime courses has been arranged and these have included representatives from other NATO nations.     during november a major joint Royal Navy and Royal Air Force exercise washeld to practise the arrangements for shore based air support of a naval force in the Mediterranean.51.    Besides completing a full training programme in the United Kingdommost of the Army regular combat units based in this country and about one third of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve trainedoverseas during the year.     Joint exercises were conducted in several countries including Belgium, Canada, Denmark,  Italy, the Netherlands,Norway, and the United States.52.    Detachments of Phantom and Harrier aircraft exercised in norway and Cyprus during the year.     The Phantoms also trained in Sardiniaand Italy.     Vulcans of R.A.F.  Strike Command and squadrons from.A.F. Germany provided the strike element for one French and oneDanish air defence exercise.JORDAN53.    In response to an appeal by King Hussein of Jordan, the services provided emergency medical relief facilities in Amman following the severe internal fighting in September.     The operation was under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross.31 /54.
5I4..    A field hospital, field surgical team, field ambulance section and a hygiene section, all from the Royal Army Medical Corps, withother specialist and supporting personnel were flown to Jordan at theend of September by the Royal Air Force.      Some 150 servicemen were involved;    all had volunteered for the operation and had beenespecially enrolled as members of the British Red Cross Society.They joined medical personnel from nine other countries in providingurgent assistance to the injured and sick.55.    The British team remained there for five weeks during which itadmitted 9h patients, performed 2U6 operations and treated 563 out-patients.      Supplies and medical requirements for the team andpatients were flown into Amman each day by the Royal Air Force.British Army ambulances and X-ray services were used extensively byother foreign medical teams, while detachments of the Royal Signalsprovided the communications network between the International red cross headquarters and all the teams involved.56.    A party of injured who had been flown to Nicosia under arrangements made with the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus were treated at the British Military Hospital, Dhekelia.THE FAR EASTOPERATIONS AND MILITARY AID TO THE CIVIL COMMUNITYEast Pakistan Relief Operation57*    In response to a request by the Government of Pakistan, a reliefoperation was mounted by British forces following the flood disasterin East Pakistan in November.     The most urgent need was forassistance in overcoming the formidable problems of- distributingrelief.     For three weeks,  in close collaboration with the Pakistanauthorities&apos; own relief programme, a naval task force spearheaded byH.M.S. Intrepid operated off the Ganges delta south of Patuakhali.A shore base was also established at Patuakhali from where furtherdistribution of supplies was undertaken by Royal Naval helicopters32 /and confidential
and shallow-draft boats.     Royal Engineers and Royal Marines assisted in restoring essential facilities such as bridges and wells.     Aflying doctor service treated over 1000 patients for injuries and took part in the vaccination programme against typhoid and cholera.58.    An airlift by Royal Air Force Hercules aircraft carried over 700tons of relief supplies, fuel and stores for the task force in EastPakistan, including supplies financed by public subscription.     Theforce withdrew on 11 December, by which time aid was regularlyreaching all parts of the area in which the British relief effort hadbeen concentrated.     The speed and efficiency with which this operation was mounted and carried out have been acknowledged by messages of thanks and congratulations from the Pakistan authorities.Local Assistance59.   Assistance to local communities has been rendered throughoutthe theatre.     The Royal Engineers have conducted well-drillingoperations in Thailand, survey work in Indonesia, and supervisedairfield construction and other work in the Solomon Islands and theGilbert and Ellice Islands.     The Royal Air Force have flown photo-graphic sorties for survey purposes in Indonesia.     All -three services have carried out minor constructional $asks in Hong Kong and Malaysia..Malaysia and Singapore/o*0. Service assistance in Malaysia flood disaster/&apos;61.   Royal Air Force Shackletons have continued to conduct routinemaritime surveillance of the Indian Ocean and South China Sea.Hong Kong62.   H.M. Ships have carried out guardship duties in the colonythroughout the year.     The Naval presence has been augmented by visitsof larger ships of the Far East Fleet, including H.M. Ships Bulwark,Intrepid. Fife and Blake.     The garrison has continued to assist thepolice in the control of the frontier and in the maintenance   of lawand order throughout the colony.     Army battalions and Royal Marines33 /Commandos
Commandos have taken turn in watching likely trouble spots andhelping the Hong Kong Government counter subversion by patrollingin remote areas and islands.     Royal Air Force helicopters based in the colony have supported the garrison and the police in their internal security role and there have been a number of visits bycombat aircraft from Singapore and from the United Kingdom.The Beira Patrol63.   The United Nations embargo on the importation of oil to Rhodesiathrough Beira has been enforced by the Beira Patrol throughout theyear.     This operation has been carried out by H.M. Ships with afloatsupport provided by ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service and byShackleton aircraft of the Royal Air Force operating from Majunga.Regular Air Support Command flights have been maintained in supportof the Royal Air Force detachment at Majunga.EXERCISESSEATO6h.    In March last year units of the Far East Fleet and Royal AirForce aircraft took part in the annual SEATO maritime exercise inthe South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand.National and Commonwealth65.   The exercise programme for 1970 was dominated by the jointBritish, Malaysian, Singaporean, Australian and New Zealand land,sea and air exercise BERSATU PADU held in the Malaysian area between april and July.     Its purpose was to train and exercise forces in theconditions likely to have prevailed had the United Kingdom withdrawnits forces from the area by the end of 1971 and to practise setting upthe.,kind of organisation that would have been necessary to introduce,train and support forces from outside the theatre.66.   The home-based British Army units deployed by air consisted ofa brigade headquarters and two infantry battalions, together with/artillery,
artillery, engineer, logistic support and army aviation units,amounting to some 2300 men, 300 vehicles and 10 helicopters:additionally the Royal Air Force deployed some 40 aircraft and 2100men.     These forces joined naval, army and air units already in the theatre.     Royal Naval participants included a Royal Marines Commandogroup embarked in H.M.S. Bulwark, a guided-mlsslle destroyer, sixfrigates, two submarines, and nine other naval and Royal FleetAuxiliary vessels.     Another Royal Marines Commando group and a Gurkhabattalion were employed as 1 enemy&apos;.     In all some 25,000 men, of whichthe United Kingdom contributed over half, took part in the maintactical exercise.67.    The United Kingdom-based contingent was mainly deployed andrecovered by air.     Altogether Air Support Command flew 230 roundflights to the Far East with VC10, Belfast, Britannia and Herculesaircraft;    during the initial stages 93 sorties were mounted from theUnited Kingdom in a ten-day period and two battalions of troeps weredeployed in the first twenty-four hours.     Vulcans of Strike Commandprovided the strike component and Victor tankers supported the deployment of No 54 Squadron Phantoms, which set up a new non-stoprecord from London to Singapore 9t 14 hours 9 minutes.      Shackletonaircraft of the Far East Air Force contributed to the anti-submarinephase of the exercise and Canberras from Strike Command providedtactical reconnaissance.68,    Although the exercise was originally planned in the context ofthe previous Administrations policy for withdrawal of forces fromthe Malaysia and Singapore area,  its value has been enhanced by theGovernment&apos;s decision to retain a permanent presence there.     It hasdemonstrated the ability of forces of the five nations to work together effectively in a tactical situation,  as well as Britain1scapability to deploy significant forces to South East Asia quicklyshould this prove to be necessary,
69.    Other activities during the year included a naval weapontraining and tactical exercise off West Malaysia in February   and exercises carried out in conjunction with the Royal Australian navy and Royal New Zealand Navy including, for the first time, a majorexercise in the south eastern part of the Indian Ocean,     strike command flew three reinforcement exercises to Malaysia and Singapore,THE GULFOPERATIONS AND MILITARY AID TO THE CIVILIAN COMMUNITYRoyal Navy70,    Frigates and coastal minesweepers carried out patrols to preventthe smuggling of arms and to control illegal immigration.      Surveyships were engaged in charting and hydrographic work in the area.Army71.   Army forces assisted in the training and build up of local forces.British Army personnel continue to be loaned to the local forces inthe area.      In the case of the Sultan of Oman1s Armed Forces, thishas involved operations against rebels in Dhofar, the southern province of Oman.Royal Air Force72.   Royal Air Force pilots continue to be loaned to the Sultan ofOman&apos;s Air Force.     Royal Air Force personnel have also been deployedto R..A.F. Salalah to defend the airfield against rebel attacks.     Atthe request of the Sultan, a Royal Air Force surgical unit has beenmade available to provide medical care for the inhabitants of theSalalah area pending the opening of a local civilian hospital.EXERCISES73.   As part of the programme of CENTO exercises two frigates, togetherwith a submarine and long range maritime reconnaissance aircraft, took part in the annual CENTO naval exorcise in the Gulf.     Near East AirForce units took part in the annual CENTO major air defence exercisesin Iran and the annual CENTO search and rescue exercise in Turkey,
In August the United Kingdom acted as host to the CENTO rifle meetingNISHAN VII.THE CARIBBEAN AND SOOTH ATLANTICOPERATIONS AND MILITARY AID TO THE CIVILIAN community the Bahamas Patrol7h.   The Bahamas Patrol, carried out by frigates of the Western Fleet,was intensified temporarily in May 1970 as a r result of renewed Illegaluse of small islands of the Bahamas Group by parties of intruders.The Royal Navy patrols have been supplemented by reconnaissance flightsby Air Support Command aircraft since October 1970.Trinidad and Grand Cayman75.   The Caribbean frigates stood by in case there was a need to evacuate British nationals from Trinidad during the internal disordersand provided a military presence when disturbance threatened in GrandCayman in April and May.Anguilla76.   The Royal Engineer force on the Island has carried out numerousaid tasks including building construction, well-drilling and roadsurfacing.Hydrographic Survey77.   The hydrogrephic survey ships Fox and Fawn carried out a comprehensive series of tasks in the Caribbean area during the year.EXERCISES78.   During the year the Army carried out an exchange exercise withthe Jamaica Defence Force.     Royal Engineer exercises have been heldin Barbuda and the Turks and Caicos Islands.AFRICAOPERATIONSWithdrawal from Libya79.   The withdrawal of British forces from El Adem and Tobruk was completed on 28 March 1970./EXERCISES37

IIIRESERVE forces.     The significance of the Reserve Forces extends far beyond their essential military role.   They, and the Cadet Forces, are among themost important of the links between the Services and the civilcommunity.   From the Services&apos; point of view this brings advantages in terms of recruiting. But that is only part of the benefit:anything that helps to root the Armed Forces more firmly in the wider community, which they exist to serve, is of mutual value.2.     The current strengths of the Reserves are shown in Annex A,Table 6,ARMY RESERVE FORCES3.     The Army Reserves consist of two main elements?a. the Regular Army Reserves, which consist of former regular officers and men, and the ArmyGeneral Reserve, which consists of certain formernational servicemen and ex-regulars to whom theNational Service Act applies;b, the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve(To &amp; A.V.R.),4. As announced in Cmnd. 1+521, an additional T. &amp; A.V.R. armoured car regiment is being added to the British reserve forces availableto support B.A.O.R.i   and the establishment of the T.&amp; A.V.R..1* also being increased,  initially by some 10,000, to provideunits in the infantry role.      Since these decisions were announced, detailed discussions have taken place with Commands   theCouncil of Territorial, Auxiliary and Volunteer Reserve Associations,and the Associations themselves.   The armoured car regiment will consist of a headquarters squadron and three armoured car squadrons.The increase in the T,.&amp; A.V.R.  infantry will amount to 20 battalion/headquarters
headquarters and 77 sub-units of company size.     In most cases thesub-units will be formed from existing yeomanry, artillery and infantry cadres which have already been given authority to doubletheir establishment, pending formal increase to company size in due course.;     When account is taken of cadres which will form part ofthe new armoured car regiment, all but  &quot;\5J of the present 90 cadreswill have been expanded under these arrangements.     Cadres not included in the expansion will remain in being at their present size.5.     All these new- units will be formally established with effect from 1 April 1971;    for local and other reasons not all of them willstart to form at the same time but it is expected that all will have begun to enlist recruits by the end of June 1971.     They will notattend annual camp as units this summer, but special arrangements are being made for the recruit training of volunteers with noprevious military experience and for a period of continuous trainingby as many as possible of the other members of the new units.6,     The present expansion makes it desirable to re-state the role of the T. &amp; A.V.R.     This is to provide a national reserve availableboth for employment on specific tasks at home and overseas and tomeet the unexpected when required,  and in particular:a. to complete the Army Order of Battle of British forcescommitted to NATO and to provide certain units for thesupport of NATO headquarters;b. to assist in maintaining a secure United Kingdom base in support of forces deployed on the continent of Europe;c. to provide a framework for any further expansion of the reserves.ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT7.     The Regiment became effective operationally on 1 April 1970.   ^
Since then its strength has been building up steadily and on1 January 1971 was  &quot;  J7.   It has already made a valuable contributionto the security of Northern Ireland.   Its equipment and accommodationare being improved and special attention is being paid to its training.8.     The formation of the Regiment has greatly reduced the strain on the Regular Army and has also provided a form of service to thecommunity in which citizens of Northern Ireland can take part.ROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINESRESERVE FORCES9.    These consist of two main elements.a. the Regular Reserve, mainly officers and men whohave served in the Royal Navy or the Royal Marines including,in particular, the Royal Fleet Reserve of approximately3,500 ratings who have recent experience of active servicejb. the Volunteer Reserves, i.e. the Royal Naval Reserve,the Royal Marines Reserve and the Women&apos;s Royal naval reserve:   about 3,400 officers and 4,600 ratings andother ranks.10.   Members of the Regular Reserve are not required to trainregularly, but those of the Volunteer Reserves normally have an obligation for   fourteen days continuous training annually as wellas evening Instruction.   The Royal Naval Reserve Divisions maintain a sea-going role, maiming eleven minesweepers which take part in nato and national exercises and providing about half the country&apos;sminesweeping effort in home waters.   The Royal Naval Reserve also includes over 600 professional seamen from the Merchant Navy and fishing fleets.11.   In the event of war, current plans provide for the Royal naval reserve to man the minesweepers mentioned above, supply supportingmanpower for the ships of the Fleet, shore headquarters, communication/centres41C01FIDENTIAL
centres and the naval control of shipping organisation, and providea nucleus of naval expertise for ships of the Merchant Navy.12.   The Royal Marines Reserve consists of nearly 1,000 volunteersbelonging to five main units centred on London, Bristol, Merseyside,Tyne and Scotland.   These reservists are in continuous training for their primary task of reinforcing the regular Corps, and exerciseregularly with Royal Marines Commandos in the United Kingdom andPar East.ROYAL AIR FORCE RESERVE FORCES13.   The Royal Air Force Reserve consists of the Regular andVolunteer Reserves and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.   Urgentreinforcements overseas in the event of emergency would be met from regular personnel serving in commands at home and it is necessary,therefore, to maintain only a very small paid Royal Air Force Reserve.The total strength of the three components of the Royal Air force reserve forces is approximately  &quot;   J officers and airmen.CADET FORGESGeneral14.   The Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet Force, the Air TrainingCosps and the Combined Cadet Force make an important contributionto regular recruiting.   On recent estimated   some 17 to 20 per cent of recruits to all three Services are former cadets.   Currentstrengths are shown in Annex A, Table 6.Army15.   The committee set up in 1969 to conduct a review of the aims,organisation, training, administration and equipment of the ArmyCadet Force has completed its work.    It has made recommendations for improvements in the training, equipment, and clothing of cadets;for changes in the establishment and rank structure of adults in theForce;   and for increases In the grants made from Ministry of Defencefunds.   All but one of these recommendations have been accepted and/will
will be put into effect as quickly as possible.COST OP THE RESERVE FORCES16.   During 1971-72, the cost of the reserve forces and auxiliariis expected to be:  ma. Royal Naval Reserves  &quot; .b. Army Reserves  &quot; J7c. Royal Air Force Reserves  &quot; jTOTAL/k3CONFIDENTIAL
gpNgljEMTJALIVMANPOWER AND CONDITIONS OP SERVICEBACKGROUND1.    In 1967 (Cmnd. 3357) the previous Administration announced a cut in total United Kingdom Service manpower from 417,000 in 1967to 380s,000 in 1971 and foresaw a further drop to a level &quot;about75,000&quot; below current strengths by the mid-1970s;   this implied afinal figure of about 340,000.   In 1968 (Cmnd. 3701) it annoimcedthe intensification and acceleration of the cuts.   These were then to amount to &quot;rather more than 75,000&quot; below 1967 levels, and that figure was to be reached &quot;during the financial year 1973-74&quot;1there was also to be a reduction of 20,000 in the Gurkhas and locally-enlisted personnel.    In 1970 (Cmnd. 4290) it forecast a UnitedKingdom personnel strength of the order of 350,000 in 1974.   In theevent the reductions ran well ahead of schedule.   On 1 April 1970there should have been 391,300 United Kingdom personnel in theForces, according to the previous administration s plan.   In factthere were only 373?000, which was 4,500 less than the total planned for 1 April 1971 (see Annex A, Table l).2.    The cause of this decline was a serious drop in recruitment ofboth officers and men (see Annex A, Tables 3 and 4) reflectinguncertainty and loss of confidence regarding the Services&apos; future.The drop In recruitment was even more disturbing than the shortfallia overall numbers because it unbalanced the Forces as well as weakeningthem.   Shortages are most severe in the junior ranks of officers andmen.3.    The effect of recruiting shortages is cumulative:   shortfallsla earlier years tend to increase the requirement for the next year,la the financial year 1969-70 34,300 male other ranks were recruited/(see44OONKDMSiX
(see Annex A, Table 4) against a requirement of 46,100.   The resultantshortfall of about 12,000 increased the requirement for 1970-71 to1+9,100.4.    In the longer term, taking into account the effects of recentdecisions stemming from the Donaldson Report (see paragraphs 24 and25) the steady annual requirement for male other rank recruits is ofthe order of 1+3,000, disregarding any accumulated shortfalls fromprevious years.   The table below shows the cumulative twelve-monthrecruiting totals at quarterly intervals since December 1969 expressed as a percentage of this steady requirement.   The improvement is apparent,but recruiting is still well short of the long-term objective.12 months ending	Number of recruits	% of steady requirement31 Dec 1969 31 Mar 1970 if fl          5 m m                 111     f 01	32,900 34,300 36,400 36,300 C    J	77 80 85 84jiu dun i.y /v 30 Sep 1970 31 Dec 1970		5.    The main recruiting field for male other ranks is the 15-24year age bracket.   In the past more have been recruited from the younger half of the group, aged 15-19, becatise this is the time when a young man selects his career, in many cases changing jobs at leastonce in the process;   it is also the natural time to begin anapprenticeship, whether in the Services or in industry.   The size of the field from which the Services have traditionally recruitedis declining,as shown in the graph below./foraph to be insertedJThe upper trace of the graph shows that the number of young men inthe United Kingdom aged between 15-24 and fit for employment has remained relatively stable since 1966 but will decline between now and1975.     The lower trace represents the number actually available foremplyment:    the space between the lines is a measure of the numbers/engaged
engaged in full-time education.   This last group Increases rapidlyfrom 956,000 in 1971 to 1,253,000 in 1975, largely because of theexpansion of higher and further education and the raising of theschool-leaving age in 1972-73.   Thus the number available for employment, and hence for recruitment to the Services, will bedrastically reduced, and by 1975 will have fallen by 12 per cent.The effect on the Services and on other employers will be particularlysevere in 1973 after the school-leaving age is raised.6.     The last five years have shown that the number recruited tothe Services each year as other ranks from the fit and availableelements of   the 15-2U years age group has averaged 1.1 per cent.To meet the long-term average annual requirement for about U3,000male other rank recruits it will be necessary to raise that percentageto 1.5 per cent, i.e, by about one third.     Looked at in a different-way, about one in seven of each generation of young men leavingschool before the age of 18 must join as other rank recruits foran average length engagement at some time.7.     Officers for the Services are mostly recruited direct fromcivilian life, though some 25 per cent are selected from the ranks.Rising educational standards tend to increase the number of youngmen with the qualifications required for the various types of commission.   Even so, the 1,905 male officers recruited fromcivilian life in 1969-70 were less than 70 per cent of the requirement, and the  &quot;    J so far recruited in the first nine monthsof 1970-71 represent only   ..... per cent.J7 of the requirement forthe year, compared with 56 per cent in the same period of 1969-70(see Annex A, Table 3).     The decline in total officer strengths overthe next five years is unlikely to run significantly ahead of thedecline in numbers required.   Nevertheless, the imbalance is likelyto persist, particularly in the Navy and Army;    the proportion of/older
older officers may tend to increase and shortages in certain areas(for example, engineers and doctors in all three Services) are likelyto get worse.REGRPITMENT AND KB-BNGAGBMENT DURING- 1970-71ROYAL NAVYOfficers,8,     Officer entry from civilian life to the Royal Navy in the Seaman,Supply and Secretariat and Engineer specialisations has shown a smallimprovement in 1970-71 over the previous year.   While recruitment for full career commissions has remained more or less steady (provisionally151 as against 156 in 1969^-70), there has been a substantial increase in short-career commission recruitment (provisionally 18.3 as against 150 in1969-70).     Although too few Seamen and, more especially, Engineerofficers.are&apos;being obtained,  the increase in the numbers of graduatesand undergraduates joining these specialisations is a welcome trend.In addition,  120 Royal Naval Scholarships and Reserved Cadetshipswere awarded to boys still at school for entry in two years   time.9.     Short service specialist recruitment remains quite good.Instructor officer recruiting is excellent in both numbers and quality.   The main source of doctors and dentists continues to be thecadetship schemes.10.   Entry to the Royal Marines is satisfactory:   a small deficiency in full career commissions was virtually made up by an increasedintake of short service officers.Ratings and Other Ranks11.   Recruitment.   Recruitment of both Royal Navy ratings and royal marine other ranks has improved during 1970-71.   Results for thefirst nine months, April to December 1970, show a 23 per cent increase over the same period in 1969-70.   But there are still shortages to bemade good in most branches;   these are particularly serious in the/CommunicationsklCONFIDENTIAL
Communications Engineering Mechanic, Medical, and Naval Airbranches.12.   Re-engagement.   The most important of the re-engagement points for both the Koyal Navy and the Royal Marines is currently at nine years, at which re-engagement rates have consistently improved since1965-66   when the first men serving nine year engagements reachedthe end. of their initial term of service.   Only a relatively small number, almost all. of them artificer apprentices ana mechanicians,now come up for re-engagement at tne twelve year point.   For these,re-engagement is expected to settle at the encouragingly high levelof about 60 per cent.   A high rate of re-engagement from 14 to 22years1 service,which completes the pension qualification, is also being maintained.Women&apos;s Services13.   Recruitment of officers to the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service has remained satisfactory : recruitment of ratings has shown a marked improvement.    In the first nine months of 1970-71 709 ratings wererecruited, compared with 609 in the same period in 1969-70, butthere are still shortages in certain categories.   Recruitment ofQueen Alexandra&apos;s Royal Naval Nursing Service officers shows no improvement and is below requirement, but recruitment of nursesremains satisfactory.ARMYOfficers14.   Final figures for the 1970-71 entry to Sandhurst are disappointing245 cadets entered the Academy against a requirement of 450.    Thefigures for 1970-71 university entry for the combatant branches arelikely to total 54, comprising 25 University Cadetships and 29 directentry commissions.    1970-71 is likely to be a successful year for entry to Mons Officer Cadet School for short service commissions;
up to the end of 1970 171 cadets entered the School compared with.134 in the same period of 1969-70.   Of these 111 and 89, respectively,entered direct from civilian life, an increase of 25 per cent.The Combined Short Service Commission and Industrial Career scheme is increasingly popular and more industrial firms are showing interest.15.   Recruitment of medical officers Is not encouraging.   Only twodoctors entered from civilian life in the first nine months of 1970-71the same number as in the comparable period of 1969-70.    However, inthe same period twelve doctors on short service commissions were granted either regular or special regular commissions in the sameperiod compared with only one in the same period of 1969-70.Soldiers16.   There has been an improvement in recruiting, but this has only partially relieved the Army&apos;s manpower deficiency.    In the firstnine months of 1970-71  &quot; male adult and young soldiers wererecruited, an increase of /7,... per cent over the same period of1969-70.   Junior recruitment in this period surpassed by percent J/7 the high figure achieved in the first nine months of 1969-70.Annex A, Table 5 shows that in 1970-71 about       .., per cent J7of thesoldiers entitled to be transferred to the reserve after 6 years service are expected to prolong their engagements, as are alsoZ,7.... per cent^J of those with 9 years1 service and /.....per cent Jof those with 12 years&apos; service.   The indications are that formen on the 3-year engagement the prolongation rate may be about 50per cent;   of these most seem liKely to prolong their service to years.Women8 s Services17.   There were  &quot; officer entrants from civilian life to the queen Alexandra4s Royal Army Nursing Corps (Q.A.R.A.N.C.) andC    J to the Women&apos;s Royal Army Corps in the first nine months/of
of 1970-71.   This is an aggregate improvement of /7.... per cent,./over the same period in 1969-70.    On the same basis of comparison the recruitment of Servicewomen showed an increase of /.....per cent&apos;7but both Corps are still short of their requirements;    in particularthere is an acute shortage of trained state enrolled nurses for theQoA.R.A.N,C.ROYAL AIR FORCEOfficers18.    Royal Air Force Cadetships and Graduate Entry.    The autumn1970 cadetship entry was the last to contain a proportion ofCranwell cadets.   From 1971 onwards, cadetships will be tenableonly at universities and other institutions offering full-timecourses leading to a degree, and Cranwell will progressively assumeits new role of providing general service and some flying training for graduate entrants, both maturing university cadets and directentrants, to the main branches.    The first two graduate entrantcourses assembled at Cranwell in September and October 1970 and both were well subscribed.   The total of cadets in residence at universities is now 350 compared with 266 in 1969.   The number of direct entry graduates to all Royal Air Force branches from civilianlife in the first nine months of 1970-71 showed a significant increase85 compared with 51 in the first nine months of 1969-70.   Theimprovement, coupled with the increase in cadetahips, promises wellfor the graduate entry scheme, particularly for the General Duties(Flying) Branch, though difficulties still remain with other branches,particularly the Engineer Branch.    It is expected that a further 30graduates will enter commissioned service for the last quarter of1970-71 which will mean that a total of 115 graduates will have entered from civil life compared with 63 in 1969*-70.19.   Other Entrants to Commissioned Service.   There has been a
marked increase of interest, shown by the number of enquiries, incommissioned service in the Royal Air Force.   The number of aircrewofficer selections in the first nine months of 1970-71 was Jcompared with   in 1969-70, and for the Ground Branches         Jcompared with  &quot;      J7.   The number of engineers selected is signifi-cantly greater than in the first nine months of 1969-70 and contains a higher proportion of graduates and professionally qualifiedcandiaates;   however, when viewed against this year&apos;s increasedtarget, recruiting to the branch is still well below requirements.The recruitment of qualified doctors though difficult shows some sign of improvement;   medical cadetships continue to be the mainstay of recruiting to the branch.Other Ranks20. The recruiting achievement for male adults and apprentices inthe first nine months of 1970-71 was per cent J\ higher than for the same period in 1969-70.   The main shortfalls are in thetrades of wireless operator special, air defence operator, theRoyal Air Force Police and gunners for the Royal Air Force Regiment.21.   Extensions of service by airmen completing 5-year engagementsin 1970-71 are expected to settle at  &quot;i+u per cent      although the trend in favour of extending to a 9 rather than a 12-year engagementpersists.   Of airmen completing 9-year engagements   kh per cent J.are likely to extend to 12 years and     13 per cent J to 22.Re-engagements to complete 22 years reckonable service for pensionare limited by the need to balance age/ranK structures and so maintainpromotion prospects.Women&apos; s Services22,   Although there has been a slight drop in Women&apos;s Royal Air Forceofficer recruiting in the first nine months of 1970-71, the proportionQf entrants offering higher educational qualifications has increased./Recruitment
Recruitment of airwomen and nurses continues to be buoyant and in thefirst nine months of 1970-71 shows a  &quot; per cent.J7 improvement overthe same period in 1969-70.   There will be shortfalls of stateenrolled nurses, clerics accounts and musicians.REDUNDANCY23.   The plans of the previous Administration for manpower redundancyhave been reviewed in the light of the requirements of the Governmentsdefence policies;    but the need to preserve a balanced age and rankstructure and the advanced stage of the plans have made it impossiblefor them to be entirely rescinded.    In the Navy   the first of the twoplanned phases (involving some 20 officers and 800 Fleet Air Arm.ratings) and a proportion of the second phase (360 officers who hadalready been declared redundant) were allowed to go ahead.   Theremainder of the second phase was modified by cancelling all redundancyfor Supplementary List aircrew and by reducing the planned redundancyof Fleet Air Arm ratings from 21+00 to about 750.    About 150 royal marines other ranks are expected to be made redundant in the second phase.    In the Army about 160 officers ana about 690 soldiers are due to be made redundant In 1971-72, but these figures may be slightlyreduced.    In the Royal Air Force   redundancies were expected to be small under previous plans:    in 1971-72 they will be limited to about30 officers,ENGAGEMENTS policy the Donaldson Report2k.   Last November the Government published the report of theCommittee, under the chairmanship of Lord Donaldson, on Boy Entrantsand Young Servicemen and announced the decisions it had taken.    Infuture all boys who join the Forces below the age of 17  will be ableto choose at the age of 18 either to confirm their original engagement,or to shorten it so that they will serve for three years countedfrom their eighteenth birthday or the completion of training (whicheverAs
is later).   The new arrangements will apply from 1 April 1971 andto those already serving as well as those who join after that date.The Services will still be assured of a reasonable return, in termsof productive service, for the investment they have made in a boy&apos;straining.   This change is expected to go a long way towards dispellingthe misgivings felt by many parents and careers advisers about bindinglong-term engagements.25.   With one minor exception the Committee&apos;s secondary recommendations were accepted by the Government.   The most important of these willdecrease, over a period of years, the length of time which naval ratings and Royal Marines other ranks must serve before they canapply to purchase their discharge, thus bringing the rules of thethree Services on this point broadly into line.General26.   One effect of these measures will be to reinforce the recenttrend towards shorter engagements.   For the Services a long engagementIs generally preferable to a short one:   a serviceman grows moreuseful as he gains experience, and gives a better return for thetraining invested in him.    There are, however, many young men whowill only accept a short engagement and both must be on offer.   TheNavy1 s new form of engagement, introduced in August 1969, which givesentrants to the Seaman and Electrical Mechanic Branches aged eighteenand over the opportunity to engage for nine years with the option of transferring to the Reserve after four years, has now been extended.As from 1 January 1971 it has been made available to all of thenon-apprentice Branches in the Royal Navy and to the Royal Marines.The age at which recruits may join on this basis has been reduced to17if.   The Army&apos;s 3-year engagement, the scope of which was enlargedin April 1969, has proved to be popular and is attracting someL    per centJJ of all male adult and young soldier recruits.    The/Royal
Royal Air Force has a three year engagement in eight trades which require only a short period of training.PAY AND PENSIpNSpay and Allowances27.    In April 1971 single Servicemen are to receive the balance oftheir increases under the new &quot;military salary&quot; arrangements.    Thispayment will put single and married men on the same rate of pay.    Itis hoped that it will improve recruiting and encourage prolongation of service.28.   There has been general satisfaction both with the rates of payissued under the 1970 Pay Code and with the job evaluation methodsused to ensure that Service pay does not get out of step with incomes in the rest of the community.29.   One of the most difficult aspects of Service life is thefrequent separation of married Servicemen from their families.   to alleviate the disadvantages of this separation, more equitable ruleshave been introduced for the payment of an allowance to married menafter they have been away from home for a significant period.Pensions30.   The Government have announced their intention of introducing legislation to maintain the purchasing power of public service pensions by biennial reviews, the first of which will cover theperiod 1 April 1969 to 31 March 1971.    Many pensions will requireonce-for-all increases to bring them up to an equitable base-line from which the reviews can start   and for this purpose all pensions which began before 1 April 1969 will be examined.   The Governmentwill also seek power to reduce, within the lifetime of the present parliament, the minimum age at which public service pensions may beincreased.   The Armed Forces will benefit from all these changes./CAREER
CAREER STRUCTUREOfficers31.   During 1970 changes have been made in the officer structure ofthe Royal Air Force.   Formerly there were two lists of officers ineach branch of the Service;   the General List and the SupplementaryList, the former listing full career officers and the latter those with a more limited career.   There is now only a single list for eachbranch.   Furthermore, officers in these branches will no longer enter upon a career to the age of 55 from the beginning of their service.Initially they will serve on an engagement to a mid-career point(about 16 years&apos;  service) or to the age of 38, whichever is the later,this being the earliest point at which they qualify for retired pay.Those who by then have been promoted to Squadron Leader by about age36, having demonstrated their ability and suitability for command and staff appointments, will automatically have the opportunity of a fullcareer to age 55.   A number of those who do not gain promotion will still be essential to the operational efficiency of the Service andwill be offered retention to age 55 with more limited opportunities for promotion:    in the General Duties (Flying) Branch retention willbe as specialist aircrew with enhanced rate3 of flying pay, resulting in total emoluments comparable with those of a Squadron Leader.    these changes will benefit the Royal Air Force by delaying selection for afull career for all officers until they have demonstrated theirpotential   and by removing any divisions caused by the existence oftwo main categories of officer.   The Royal Air Force is also nowoffering entry to the Engineer and Supply branches at Squadron Leaderrank to mature professionally qualified men with suitable experience and to the Women1s Royal Air Force at Flying Officer level to maturewomen who have held responsible positions in civilian life.larrant Officers32.   As announced last year, it is intended to introduce into the/Royal
Royal Navy and Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service a new rate of Fleet ChiefPetty Officer, which will be the equivalent of the Warrant OfficerGlass I in the Army and Royal Air Force.   Candidates for this newrate will be selected from existing Chief Petty Officers.    The firstselections are now taking place.UNACCOMPANIED DUTY OVERSEAS33.   Overseas unaccompanied tours in Gan, Masirah and Salalah havebeen reduced to nine months.   In many cases married airmen will beable to leave their families in the quarters they occupied on theirstations in the United Kingdom and, after completing their unaccompaniedtour, to return to the same station, thus minimising family disturbance.It is hoped to apply this as a general rule by mid-1972.    The maximumlength of unaccompanied tours for the Army is also nine months.FAMILY WELFARE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM34.   Because of their unsettled life   many of the younger wives ofsoldiers miss the personal guidance and support which they could expect from relatives and friends in moments of family difficulty.Their inability to handle domestic crises is greatly accentuated bythe absence of husbands who are frequently separated from home for service reasons.    This situation has been particularly bad in thelast twelve months because of the high level of emergency tours.To meet this problem the Army has set up the Housing CommandantOrganisation.   Officers with unit command experience are being appointed exclusively to liaise with local authorities and thesocial and welfare organisations.   This will ensure that familiesreceive such support as they require as speedily as possible.   Theorganisation will also help in fostering closer integration betweenthe Army and civilian communities.PERSONNEL MOVEMENTSgree Warrants35.   The number of free warrants allowed to servicemen of all three/services
services for travel within the United Kingdom has been increased.The main beneficiary is the married man separated from his family.Continuous Shi-p Commissions36.   After 1 March 1971 ships will commission after a long refit andwill then remain in commission until the next long refit ordisposal.   This change will enable naval personnel to foresee their future movements with greater certainty.RESETTLEMENT37.   The advisory service which is provided for all personnel tohelp them choose and prepare for a second career has been expanded.In addition to interviews by Resettlement Panels and Boards andcourses which give information about different spheres of employment,a scheme has been introduced of &quot;familiarisation&quot; attachments to civilian firms and organisations.   This scheme is being run with theco-operation of the Department of Employment.38.   Facilities are being extended for training for a civiliancareer available to personnel for study in their own time or forattendance at 28 aay full-time courses run before the end of service.A committee of representatives of the Ministry of Defence, theDepartment of Employment and the Industrial Training Boards has been set up to ensure that the Serviceman, while being trained to meetthe military requirements of his trade is also   Ming fitted for subsequent civilian employment.39.   A careful study is being made of the role of resettlement inthe context of military service in the 1970s.ACCOMMODATION40.   Accommodation Afloat   New standards for ratings have beenapproved and will be applied to the next generation of ships.    ships at present building will show considerable improvements over today&apos;sstandards;    ships already in service should also benefit as far asspace and other limitations will allow./DRESS57ilbimliiiii......Mil.......1............mi........y......1.........in................iaiiilllll..........................1........in............................1..................................i.......................1.....linn......
DRESSill.   Possible improvements in the materials ana styling of navaldress and a possible new tropical uniform for the Royal Marines are under study.   In the Army a new working dress for use in temperatestations is being introduced now and a new range of dress for warmstations should be introduced later in 1971.   Restyled uniforms forairmen ana airwomen in better cloth were introduced in 1970, and better quality tropical uniform for all ranks will be introduced during the course of this year.
CONFIDENTIALVSUPPORTHIGHER DEFENCE TRAINING AND STUDIES1.     On 1 January 1971 the Imperial De-fence College was renamed theRoyal College of Defence Studies,     Plans are well advanced for there constitution of the Joint Services Staff College which, under itsnew name of the National Defence College, will begin a more intensiveand broader based programme of courses in September,     ProfessorL.W. Martin, Professor of War Studies at Kings College, university of London, has been appointed as academic consultant to the NationalDefence College,2.     The close associations which the Ministry of Defence maintainswith universities through Defence Lecturers, Defence Fellows and theprogramme of seminars and study conferences have been further developed during the year,      A seventh Defence Lecturer post is to beadded in October;    its costs, like those of the others, will beborne on Defence Votes.INITIAL AND SPECIALIST training royal EAvY AND ROYAL MARINESNaval Shore Training3*     Concentration of Special Duties Officer Training .     In future allSeaman and Supply rating candidates for promotion as officer to theSpecial Duties List will be given a common course in ship fighting and management matters at H.M.S. St George.ho     Instruetiana1 Techniques   There is a steady increase in theapplication of objective training principles in course design and execution.     It is not always easy to quantify the net gain resultingfrom such changes, but in two projects recently completed the advan-tages are clearly measurable.      In the weapons electrical departments of H.M.S. Bulwark a task analysis of the duties of the junior ratingsformed the basis of an objectively designed system of &quot;on the job&quot;training.     This reduced the senior ratings&apos;  instructional commitment59 /byCONFIDENTIAL
by 80 per cent, freed them for other duties and reduced the trainingtime of junior ratings by six weeks.   In H.M.S. Collingwood.free-running training courses for radio electrical mechanics arenow in operation.   This has reduced their training time by an averageof six weeks ana will result in the provision of twenty more R.J .M.sper annum for service in the Fleet.   The &apos;free-running&apos; system isbeing extended to other electrical courses and is expected to leadto a further gain of forty men per year.5.     Training Costs   At H.M.S. Collingwood a computer programme isbeing developed to investigate the costs of engineering training.The programme is designed to identify areas of high cost so that further investigation may be more efficiently directed.6*     Civilian Recognition of Naval Training Courses   A scheme forawarding City and Guilds Craft Certificates to Petty Officers and leading Rates of the Seaman and Communications Branches has been introduced.General List &apos;X&apos; and 8S&apos; Academic Training &quot; To be drafted later JJARMYAdventurous Training7.

A scheme will be introduced to recruit qualified young men fortraining &quot;straight-through&quot; to fitter standard, under an amalgam ofthe current mechanic and fitter courses.Apprentices11.   The mechanic apprentice scheme introduced for selected trades in October 1969 has met with a good response and its scope has been extended.Flight Simulators12.   Training programmes for the new generation of digital computer-controlled flight simulators for Nimrod, Buccaneer, Harrier, Phantomand Air Navigation are well advanced and those for the Jaguar will soon be compiled.Officer Training13.   The first intake of university graduates to be trained under theGraduate Entry scheme arrived at Cranwell in the autumn of 1970.Graduate entrants receive their initial general service and somespecialist training at Cranwell.   Other entrants are given Initialgeneral service training at the Officer Cadet Training Unit atHenlow, and specialist training at the appropriate training school.FLYING training royal NAVY34.   Recruiting for fixed wing flying training, which has ceased, willnot be re-started to support H.M.S, Ark Royal&apos;s fixed wing squadrons.Shortfalls of naval aircrews will be made up by Royal Air force personnel.

Newly qualified observers have been givenincreased tactical training to meet the needs of the advancedweapons systems in the Sea King and Wessex helicopters.ARMY16.   Aray Aviation has introduced a new course to train air gunnersto operate anti-tank guided weapons from helicopters*   The firstcourse was completed in December 1970.    The air gunners&apos; courses arerun in parallel with the helicopter and fixed wing pilot training at Middle Wallop.ROYAL AIR FORCE17.   During the past year all basic and advanced navigational training has been concentrated at R.A.F. Finningley, thus permitting the closure of Gaydon and Stradishall,18.   The introduction of the Jaguar and its planned front line expan-sion will give rise to a large training commitment.     The enlargedRoyal Air Force Jaguar operational conversion unit will be based atBrawdy in Pembrokeshire which will become a Royal Air Force stationwhen the Royal Navy ceases to use it for flying.19.   The operational conversion of aircrew on the Buccaneer, Harrier,Phantom and Nimrod aircraft has continued throughout the year asincreasing numbers of these aircraft became available to thefront line.   The Royal Air Force will assume responsibility from theRoyal Navy for the training of its own Buccaneer crews in May 1971.COMMONWEALTH AND FOREIGN TRAINING20.   All three services have provided training facilities for the armed forces of Commonwealth and foreign nations.   Last year over3000 officers and men from more than kO countries attended a wide variety of courses within the United Kingdom.    In addition the three services continue to provide personnel on loan and in training teamsto other nations to assist with local training.

During 1971-72 the Dockyards will again he fully loaded.Portsmouth will have the long: refits of two guided-missile destroyers,two frigates and two submarines and the conversion of the destroyerH.M.S. Matapan to a sonar trials ship.     The Devonport programmeincludes the conversion of H.M.S. Hermes to a commando carrier andthe long refits of H.M.S. Tiger, four frigates and two submarines.In addition to the refit and refuelling of nuclear submarines,Chatham and Rosyth will undertake frigate long refits.Productivity22.    Productivity agreements with the unions have been signed at portsmouth, Chatham and Rosyth.      Discussions between local management and unions are still taking place at Devonport.23.    In the Supply and Transport Service the expansion of productivity agreements and work-measured incentive schemes has continued.     Nineestablishments employing 1,500 are now covered by productivity agree-ments and a further six employing 1,900 will have agreements inthe near future.     Work-measured incentive schemes are now in usein 17 establishments with 6,500 employees.Management by Objectives24*   The introduction of management-by-objectives has been extendedto Royal Navy armament and victualling depots in the Rosyth area andto their related headquarters departments in London and Bath.    Short-term improvements have produced savings of at least  33,000 per annum,plus a once-only   saving of  70,000.ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIESOutput25.   The output from Royal Ordnance Factories in 1971-72 is expected63 AoCONFIDENTIAL
to &quot;be  55.5m.,  excluding the value (about  28m.) of componentssupplied to the factories for incorporation in their products.     Mostof the production will be for the Ministry of Defence,  but about 20 percent will be for overseas customers and about 3 per cent for civil purposes where effective use can be made of capacity that must bemaintained for essential defence purposes in the long terra.      Since1 April 1970 fixed prices for production work have become the. rule and are now also being applied where appropriate to design anddevelopment work.Productivity26.   Taking 1967-68 as the base year (^00), manufacturing output peremployee in 1969-70 rose to 11k and is expected to reach 138 in1970-71.     This rate of increase reflects real improvements in factoryefficiency and the results of capital investment;    in 1969-70. forexample, productivity increased overall by eight per cent.27.   Management processes are being improved and new methodsintroduced; production engineering and method study have ledto new techniques in manufacture and assembly.     About two-thirds of royal Ordnance Factory industrial employees are covered by payment-by-results schemes,  including piece-work.      Of the remainder about half are now included in productivity agreements or incentive schemes.Investment23.   An increasing level of capital investment is also leading toimproved productivity, with particular emphasis on the introductionof automatically controlled machine tools.     The computers at royal ordnance Factories Blackburn and Chorley now provide services for five factories and, with the assistance of consultants, a comprehensivesurvey is being made to establish the future computer requirements ofthe Royal Ordnance Factory Organisation.
planning and Control29.   Management consultants during 1970 completed an examination ofthe organisation for planning and controlling the production ofammunition.     The main recommendations of this report, which will havethe effect of transferring a considerable amount of administrative work from the Ministry of Defence itself to the factories, will beput into effect over a period.     As recommended by the Raby Committee,additional responsibility for quality control is also being transferredto the seven engineering Royal Ordnance Factories.     This transferhas already been made in five factories and will be made in theremaining two during the course of the coming year.ARMY SUPPLY AND REPAIR ORGANISATIONComputers for Management30.   A central inventory control point (C. I.C.P. ) is planned forBicester by 1973 when the new computer configurations on order forthe Royal Army Ordnance Corps become available.     The C.I.C.P. willcontrol all aspects of inventory management of stores, vehicles andammunition in the United Kingdom under Army control.     Further studies are now in hand designed to examine the possibility of establishingdata links between the C.I.C.P.  at Bicester- and overseas Commandswith the eventual idea of central control of the R.A.0.C.  inventorythroughout the world.Budgetary Control and Work Measurement31.   The management accounting systems described in Cmnd. h290have been extended to a seventh Royal Electrical and MechanicalEngineers workshop and during 1971 it is intended to install themin a seventh R.A.O.C. depot in the United Kingdom,  in one depot inB.A. 0.R, and in two more R.E.M.E. workshops.      A programme has been initiated for the introduction of work standards based on workmeasurement techniques./Productivity65
productivity Measures32.    Productivity agreements are operating in six R.A.O.C.  depotsin the United Kingdom.     R.E.M.E. have negotiated productivity agreements in eleven more workshops in addition to the originalagreement at 38 Central Workshop, Chilwell.   Productivity negotiations are at an advanced stage in three other workshops.R a ti.pr.al i sat i on33,   The supply, maintenance and repair of the Blowpipe surface-to-air guided-weapon system and the Larkspur and Clansman ground radioequipments have been placed under the management of the Army,      Otherequipments are being studied with a view to single manager supportof this kind.ROYAL AIR FORCE ADMINISTRATION and supply 0:? GAM I SAT ION3k.    In the interests of streamlining the administrative machineryat headquarters, while at the same time improving efficiency andeffecting economy, certain responsibilities have been decentralisedto Royal Air Force Co inlands in connection with major works services.Some responsibilities for manpower complementing have also beendecentralised on a trial basis and other measures of decentralisationare under consideration,35.   As a further measure of simplifying administration and reducingheadquarters staffs, responsibility for routine engineering functionsis also being decentralised to Royal Air Force Commands.     Decentra-lisation is intended to include effective management of all in-usemaintenance functions of aircraft and other equipment,  includingdirect liaison with all related authorities.      It is planned tocomplete this process of decentralisation by early 1972.     Responsibilityfor engineering policies,  for the introduction of new equipment andfor specific problems of particular importance to the Ministry ofDefence will remain with headquarters staffs./36-
36.    The decision tc extend the life of H.M.S,  Ark Royal will not affect the arrangements for the Royal Air Force to take over responsibility for provisioning,  stock control and stockholding ofnaval air stores.370    Further steps are being taken to improve equipment storage.The ready access system of storage will be deveoped into a systemof density activity complexes.      It is planned to establish two ofthese complexes at Carlisle and Stafford.     Both will make extensiveuse of computers and will combine maximum density of storage withconcentrated activity,  and centralised receipt, packing and despatch.SUPPLY CO-ORDINATIONSt and a rdisation and. God i f i c at 1 on38.   Variety reduction in the Services inventories has now led tothe classification of over  50,0007 items as non-standard eventually to be eliminated from the Services inventories.     A process has been introduced to ensure that Defence Standards are used for procurementpurposes,     British Standards Institution standards are made full use of in their preparation.     The adoption of metric standards isan   important feature of the standai&apos;disat ion programme.     The DefenceCodification Authority has made considerable progress in codificationby NATO stock numbers of Service inventories,,      The retrospectivecodification programme will be completed in 1972.Supply, Systems39*    Stxidies are in hand on several major aspects of systemsco-ordination with the aim of developing compatibility between theServices.     For example a standard demand and issue procedure capableof application in the three Services automatic data processing system is under development.WORKS SERVICESkO.

A balance must however, be struckbetween the needs of the Services and other potential land usesincluding recreation.     With this in view a committee under thechairmanship of Lord Nugent has been appointed to review the greaterpart of defence land holdings in Britain.     The review will embraceabout half a million acres of defence land including all trainingareas?  ranges and airfields,  all land held in national parks and other areas of outstanding natural   beauty, and all coastal land holdingsother than dockyards and port installations.     Thus all areas ofamenity interest will be covered,MOVEMENTSPersonnel and Families43.   The repatriation of Service personnel and their families from68 /the
the Far East and the Gulf during the period of adjustment is being planned to take account of the need for economy and to minimisediscomfort and long family separations.     The bulk of the task willbe carried out by Air Support Command using VC 10s from the Far Eastand Britannias for the shorter journey from the Gulf.     Passengerswill use the newly opened terminal building at R.A. F. Brize Nortonwhere facilities are comparable to those at any modern airport.The Services Booking Centre in London is now operational and provides a central passenger booking agency for Service personnel and civilianstaff and their families travelling from the United Kingdom.Freight Movement44*    Overseas     The movement of freight for routine maintenanceoverseas continues to be mainly by sea.     High priority cargo iscarried by Air Support Command supplemented when necessary by civilscheduled services or ad hoc charter flights.45.    United Kingdom     As a result of a study undertaken to devise a new system designed to make the most cost-effective use of all available transport facilities, a pilot scheme has been introduced to try out the system in selected areas of the country.     The service departments are working closely with the transport industry in this project.COMMIJNICATTONS46.    A second standby SKYNET satellite,  launched on 19 August 1970,was lost after an irregular burn of its apogee boost-motor.      Ithas still been possible to continue the SKYNET trials programmesatisfactorily and the system should soon be carrying operationaltraffic.METEOROLOGY47.   With the increasing importance, of meteorological information toall weather-sensitive industries and to the general public, thedemand for Meteorological Office services is growing,from industry and from the public have grown steadily over the years69 /and confidential
and in 1970 exceeded one and a half million.     The use made of the automatic telephone weather service has shown a similar growth.There has also been  a growing demand for meteorological advice from agriculture,  the building industry,  surface transport and otherweather-sensitive industries.     New services are being developedor planned to meet special needs, such as detailed forecasts for areasaffected by foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks.U8.   The powerful I.B.M. 360/195 computer to be installed duringthis year at Bracknell will enable the Meteorological Office toimprove the quality of weather forecasts:    it will employ numericalforecasting methods developed in the Office&apos;s own research programme.I+9.    The Meteorological Office plays an important part in theactivities of the World Meteorological Organisation and in the WorldWeather Watch.     Good progress is being made in automating the telecommunications system   at Bracknell to enable the Office to fulfil its role   as a key centre in the Global TelecommunicationsSystem for World Weather Watch.     The Office is taking an active partin the planning of a major international project known as the GlobalAtmospheric Research Programme,  organised jointly by the WorldMeteorological Organisation and the International Council of scientific Unions.SALES50,   The Defence Sales organisation has elements in the Ministryof Defence and the Ministry of Aviation Supply.     The part of theorganisation lying within the Ministry of Defence was re-organised in August 1970.     Instead of separate directorates for Navy and army Sales   two geographical sales directorates have been createdresponsible for the sale of both Navy and Army equipment within their areas.     These directorates are supported by market intelligence and sales promotion staffs and by a new Directorate of Sales (Supply)responsible for fulfilling orders.70 /51.CONFIDENTIAL
