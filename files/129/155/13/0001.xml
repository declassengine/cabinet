THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS government cp(71) 13 COPY NO     P. -Ii29 January 1971CABINETMAIN PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES IN THE national insurance SCHEME AND PRESERVATION of occupational PENSION RIGHTSMemorandum by the Secretaiy of State torSocial ServicesThis memorandum outlines my proposals for reconstructing theState basic national insurance schemes for establishing a new Statereserve scheme, and for ensuring the preservation of occupational pension rights on change of employment,A,   The Basic SchemeCoverage1. Employed and self-employed people over school-leaving agewhose earnings are above a minimum level will be compulsorily insuredin a comprehensive basic scheme, on which other provision is to be built -mainly through occupational schemes,    Entitlement to benefit will be conditional on the payment of contributions, bat contributions for employed persons, and their employers, will be put on a fully earnings-relatedbasis.    The benefit structure will remain broadly the same as at present,2.        Working wives and widows who have rights to benefit on theirhusband *s contributions will continue to be allowed to choose not to paythe major part of the contributions for benefits on their own record, butthey will have to pay for industrial injuries cover as they do now, andthey wiil also pay for the first time the same 3mall contribution as every -one else towards the cost of the National Health Service,    Non-employedpeople will be able to contribute voluntarily ? mainly for retirement andwidowhood benefits,C controls  ibutions3. The new fully earnings-related contributions payable by employed persons and their employers will be a percentage of the earnings of the employee up to a ceiling set at about lj times national average earnings/&quot;National average earnings&quot; is used, for convenience, to mean theaverage earnings of adult male manual workers in manufacturing industries and certain non-manufacturing industries and services, as obtained fromthe Department of Employments half-yearly enquiries into earnings^/
(about  40 a week at 1970 earnings levels)0    Employees with very lowearnings (very broadly those whose earnings are too low to bring themwithin the PAYE system) will not be compelled to pay contributions under the new arrangements? nor will their employers.    contributions will be collected through the PAYE machinery and employers will nolonger have to stamp cards for their employees,4, A joint contribution of about 12f per cent (This includes anassumed 1 per cent for the Health Service, but does not make anyassumption about the employerJs contribution to the Redundancy Fundcollected on behalf of the Departme nt of Employment, ) will be requiredassuming Treasury supplement in the same proportion as at presentsit is proposed that the employee should pay 5^ per cent with the balancepayable by the employer.    In addition, for those not in &quot;recognised&quot;occupational schemes, there will be a contribution of 4 per cent to theState reserve schemes this will be collected along with the basic schemecontribution and split as to if per cent from the employee and 2f per cent from the employer,5. The self-employed will pay a flat-rate contribution at a rate to bedetermined. The possibility that they may be required to pay some formof earnings-related contribution in addition is under examination.5, Non-employed people will be able to pay flat-rate contributionsvoluntarily, at a level to be determined, mainly for retirement andwidowhood benefits.7, Annex 1 contains at Tables 1 and 2 examples of the presentcontributions for the various groups on different levels of earnings,compared with what the employee will pay on a 5   per cent share of thetotal basic scheme contribution of 12f per cent (plus the if per cent forthe reserve scheme where appropriate).    Two upratings of pension are due to occur before 1974 and these will provide opportunities to loadmere of the cost on to the higher-paid, so as substantially to mitigate theincrease in their contribution in 1974.    The proposals for the reconstruc-tion of the national insurance scheme will be published after the first ofthese increases has been announced, and to that extent the longer-termincrease for the higher-paid will look less steep.Benefits0. The scale and scope of benefit provision under the basic scheme will, with some selective improvements, be broadly as at present, but no new graduated pension will be earned after the new scheme comes intooperation.    Graduated pension earned up to April 1974 (when the new scheme is planned to start) will be paid with the basic pension on retire-ment.    The question whether the purchasing power of graduated pensionsis to be maintained is under consideration.2
Retirement and widows&apos; pensions9. There will be a basic rate of benefit ( 5 a week, in current terms)with a higher rate of pension - initially perhaps an extra 5 s. a week - forpensioners over the age of 80,     Entitlement will depend on a simplifiedcontribution test based on the number of years in which the contributorachieves a minimum level of reckonable earnings.    The level will be theminimum level of earnings at which contributions would normally be payable in that year for national insuranc3 purposes.    (Annex 1, table 4,compares the position of a man on national average earnings under thepresent basic and graduated schemes with the proposed new arrangements. )10.       Minimum pensionable age will remain at 65 for men and 60 forwomen subject, as now, to a retirement condition.    Increments will beprovided for deferred retirement and their rate will be improved.    Thosewho retire and qualify for pension will have to have their pension adjustedin respect of subsequent earnings until age 70 (men) and 65 (women), butthe operation of this earnings rule will be eased from time to time bypreserving its relativity to national average earnings.11.       Widows&apos; pensions will be payable under the same conditions as towidowhood as at present, including the new (reduced) pensions for womenwidowed between the ages of 40 and 5 0 which are due to start in April 1971.An earnings -related widow !s allowance will be payable for the first sixmonths of widowhood.12.       Unemployment and sickness benefit at present consist of a basicflat-rate benefit plus an earnings-related supplement for the first sixmonths.    This structure will need to be reviewed in the light of thechange to fully earnings-related contributions.    The staffing and otherimplications of this are under discussion with the Department ofEmployment and will be the subject of separate proposals.13.       For the purposes of future entitlement to flat-rate benefitsearnings at the minimum qualifying level will be credited during weeks of unemployment or incapacity for work,Invalidity pension for the chronic sick14.       For people who have been sick for 28 weeks, including those already sick when the change is introduced, sickness benefit will bereplaced by a long-term benefit, to be called invalidity pension.    the basic benefit will be the same as the standard rate of retirement pension,with an addition graded according to the age at which the beneficiary fellsick, the maximum addition to begin with being   1 a week for those whofell sick under age 35.    It is also proposed to raise the increases paidin respect of the children of invalidity pensioners to the level of thesubstantially higher increases paid for the children of widow beneficiaries,3
15,        The condition governing the payment of a dependency increase forthe wife of an invalidity pensioner will be made easier than the sickness benefit condition.    At present a dependency increase is not payable ifthe wife ls earnings exceed the amount of the benefit (currently 3, 2s. a week),    Under the new arrangements the level of earnings willbe raised to that which applies under the retirement pensions earnings rule (currently  7. 10s, a week) and earnings above that level will act toreduce the benefit, not to extinguish it immediately as now.    This samerelaxation will apply to the dependent wivv.s of retirement pensioners.Attendance allowance for the disabled16.       An attendance allowance for the very severely disabled, already-enacted, will be introduced In 1971,    It will be paid from the consolidated Fund.     Extension of the scope of this allowance to a wider range of less severely disabled will be considered in the light of experience of the initial stage of operation,    Proposals will be brought forward in due course and it is hoped to be able to start this extendedscheme in late 1973,Review of benefit levels1?,       All the main flat^rate benefits will be reviewed every two yearsand increased by at least the amount necessary to maintain theirpurchasing power.Finance10, .     The cost of the new basic scheme is unlikely to differ much fromthat of the present scheme if it continued but there will be some saving indue course because rights to graduated pensions will no longer build up.The new selective improvements can be financed within the agreedprovision for general upratings.    The cost of the present scheme would itself grow, even in terms of present benefit and earnings levels, by about10 per cent (or  300 million a year) in the next thirty years mainly because of demographic changes,19.       The scheme will continue to be financed on a * pay-as-you-go&apos;basis.    If the Treasury supplement continues at its present proportionallevel of about 18 per cent of contribution income, we shall need to fix the combined contribution at about IZj per cent when we announce the scheme.We shall need to look at the precise figure again nearer the time to take account of the effect of the uprating due in November and the forecast we feel able to make, for use in the Government Actuaryrs published report,of the movement of earnings between the Spring and the time of the uprating.In the longer term, after 1980, there is a prospect of reductions of the contribution even if benefits rise in line with earnings,4
B.   The Reserve Scheme20.       The reserve scheme will be an age**related money purchasescheme which, irrespective of the contributors age and earnings level,will give him value for money and no more,    The scheme will be fullyfunded and wholly free of Exchequer support.    The aim will be to providebenefits on a profit sharing basis such that (though price dynamism willnot be formally guaranteed) a reasonable expectation can be held out thattheir value will be maintained by regular &quot;bonuses&quot;,21.       The scheme will be run by an independent Board of Management,though governmental machinery v/ill be used (and paid for), for example,to collect and record the contributions.    The Board will include membersselected for their financial expertise and people of standing nominated,for example, by the Confederation of British Industry and the TradesUnion Congress.    Power of appointment will be vested in the Secretaryof State.    The Board will look to the Government Actuary for actuarialadvice.Scope22,       Contributions will be pitched at 4 per cent of PAYE earnings upto the same level as the basic scheme, shared as to if per cent for the employee and 2j per cent for the employer,    (Table IB of Annex 1 shows the combined basic and reserve scheme contributions. )   Membershipwill be compulsory for employees between age 21 and 65 (60 for women)who are not members of an occupational scheme &quot;recognised&quot; as adequate for exemption purposes (see paragraphs 3        below)i there will be no contribution option for married women., who will be brought in on thesame basis as other employees.    Contributions will be collected throughthe PAYE system along with the basic contributions and paid over to theManagement Board for investment.Funding^23.       The reserve scheme fund or funds will be separate and self-contained, with no underwriting by the State and with freedom of invest-ment extending to equities and property.    The managers will have a statutory duty to maximise yields for the benefit of contributors.    Therewill be safeguards to provide insultation against government interferenceand to remove any risk of &quot;rigging the market&quot;.    There will be a limit onthe proportion of equity in any company that can be held.Size24.       Estimates of the scale of the scheme can only be speculative.    Butit is reasonable to assume that membership at any one time might be of theorder of 7 million, with perhaps 13 million in recognised occupational schemes.    The immediate annual yield of contributions might be of theorder of  200 million.    (This may be compared with an annual income ofthe Prudential approaching  300 million, of which about  100 million is
available for investment. )   Even if the reserve scheme membershipremained at the same level ^ and it should diminish - the fund might buildup by the end of the century to something of the order of  5,000 millionwith benefit expenditure then running at something of the order of 75 million a year, in terms of present earnings levels.    (By comparisonthe funds of occupational schemes may on the same basis have by thenbuilt up to between  15, 0C0 and  20, 000 million.)Benefits25,       The return on a given amount of contributions will vary accordingto the age when the contributions are paid? the younger the contributorthe greater is the amount of pension secured for a given contribution.There will be no kind of accelerated maturity,    A benefit scale will belaid down showing for each age and sex the amount of guaranteed pensionsecured on an actuarial basis for each unit of contribution.25,      Assumptions as to rates of interest, mortality etc. in working outthe scale of benefit will be conservative ones, so that the investment ofcontributions can be expected to produce the surplus needed to provide&quot;bonuses&quot; both before and after award at a level at which they might reasonably be expected to be sufficient to maintain the purchasing powerof the pension,2?,      Widows&apos; benefits will be paid amounting to half the rate of personalpension payable to the late busband, or if the husband dies below pensionags to half the rate of pension which would have been payable to him stage 65 if he had not contributed further.28.      As under the basic scheme, pensions will be payable from age 65(60 for women) but without a retirement condition.    All pension rights willbe fully preserved, with no refunds.    Very small pensions may, however,be commuted,29,      Table 2 in Annex 1 shows for different ages of entry the rates ofbenefit which might be payable in practice to men, women and widowswhose husbands die after retirement.Exemption from the reserve scheme30, .     Occupational schemes of a minimum standard, which will be fixed at a somewhat higher level than that of the reserve scheme, will be accorded a &quot;recognised&quot; status by virtue of which members of these schemes and their employers will be exempt from contributing to thereserve scheme,31*       Employers who wish to obtain a certificate of exemption in respectof their occupational schemes will be required to apply for this purpose toan Occupational Pensions Board,    The Board will be an autonomousbody of some standing, containing representatives of employers and employees as well as representatives of occupational pension interests.
It will be completely separate from the Board of Management of thereserve scheme.    Its primary duty will be to deal with applications for exemption, but it will also be charged with a general oversight of thepreservation of pension rights on change of employment and with theexercise of powers to approve the modification of schemes where this isnecessary or desirable as a consequence of the legislation.32.       The precise nature of the tests which the Board will apply in considering applications for exemption will be the subject of technical discussions with occupational pensions interests.    The nature of thereserve scheme rules out any test of precise equivalence of benefits and the aim will be to make the conditions as simple as possible,Employees leaving occupational schemes without pension entitlement33.       Employees who leave a recognised occupational scheme before their service is sufficient to entitle them to a preserved pension will,subject to a de minimis rule, have to be brought back into the reserve scheme by payment of a sum equal to the contributions that would havebeen payable but for exemption,Co   Freaervagionof occupational pension rightsQualifying conditions34.       The qualifying conditions for a preserved pension under thelegislation will be the completion of 5 years8 pensionable service e(i. e. service as a member of an occupational scheme) and the attainment of age 26 on leaving.Benefits to be protected35.       The preservation requirement will apply to all those benefits whichwould have been available to the member if he had reached the schemednormal pension age at the date on which he left the employer &apos;s servicee. g. the member !s personal retirement benefit and widows&apos; or other benefits payable on his death after retirement.    Further consideration willbe given to the question whether it is feasible to require the preservation of benefits payable on a memberls death before pension age; in any event,a contributory scheme will be expected to provide the widow with benefitsnot less in amount than her late husbandJs contributions,Preservation to be mandatory36.        The preservation of a leaving memberrs accrued pension rights inrespect of service af ftei the operative date will be mandatory where the member has 5 years service after that date (provided, of course, that hehas attained age 26); in such cases, contributory schemes will no longer be permitted to offer a refund of the leaving memberrs contributions as analternative to preservation.    Pension in respect of service before the operative date will also qualify for preservation but there will be no restriction on a scheme offering, and the member accepting, the alternative of a refund of contributions paid before that date.
Payable age37..      The payable age for a deferred pension will be the scheme&apos;snormal pension age; that is the age at which a member would become entitled to receive a full and immediate pension for his years of service,other than in special circumstances such as ill-health warranting earlierretirement.    But special consideration will be given to the case ofschemes with a particularly early pension age.Calculation of preserved benefits38. .     Benefits v/ill be calculated in accordance with schemes8 ownaccrual rules wherever this produces a reasonable equitable result,the amount of pension to be preserved being that to which the memberwould have been entitled if he had reached the schemed normal pension age at the date on which he left the employer&apos;s service.39.       Where the application of the scheme&apos;s own rules would not produce an equitable result, schemes will be required to provide theleaving member with a deferred pension calculated on the basis of&quot;uniform accrual&quot;; L, e. representing a fair proportion of the finalpension to which he would have become entitled if he had stayed on in thescheme until normal pension age.Pensions increases40. .     Where the rules of a scheme contain contractual provision forperiodic increases in full-term pensions, the scheme will be required toincrease deferred pensions in payment by corresponding amounts.41.        A general requirement that deferred pension rights should similarly be increased during the period between withdrawal from thescheme and the payable age would plainly be unreasonable, since itwould mean that, in many schemes, a leaving member would receive ahigher pension for a particular period of service than if he had continued in the scheme.    In the special case of final salary schemes,however, there seems a good case for requiring that the deferred pension(necessarily calculated on the salary at the time of leaving) should be atleast partially inflation-proofed, either by linking with the retail prices index or at a predetermined rate to be prescribed.    The practical implications of such a requirement will be discussed with the interestedorganisations.EnforosmeKsfc and adjudication42.        The Occupational Pensions Board (see paragraph 31) will havepower to determine applications from scheme members and other interested parties as to whether a scheme&apos;s preservation rules complywith the legislation.    The jurisdiction of the board in this respect willnot extend to schemes for which a Minister of the Crown is responsible,i. e. schemes whose terms are in an Act or Regulations or are determined8COhJPiriFKiiriA
by a Minister of the Crown (as distinct from schemes whose terms are merely approved by a Minister),     Once schemes have incorporatedsuitable preservation provisions in their own rules, it will be up to members to enforce their own rights through the schemed ownarbitration machinery and (in the last resort) in the Courts.Forfeiture of entitlement43.       Pension schemes will be permitted to provide for the forfeitureof a scheme memberss rights to a deferred pension in cases of gravemisconduct, subject to a right of appeal to an independent tribunal.    Inaddition, subject to certain safeguards and the normal Inland Revenuerules, an employer will be permitted to have a lien on the deferredpension rights when he has suffered a quantifiable  financial loss at thehands of an employee.Staffing implications and cost44.       The staff requirement of the Occupational Pensions Board hasbeen taken fully into account in the staff estimates given in CP(71) 12.The extra cost of providing deferred pensions for their leaving members will, of course, fall on occupational schemes themselves and has been provisionally estimated at about  25 million a year at the outset, rising to a total of about  40 million after 20 years,    (The estimate assumes that about two-thirds of members leaving contributory schemes will takea refund of contributions paid before the operative date.)Timetable45.       The intention is that provision for the preservation of occupational pension rights, as outlined above, should be phased in with the programme for reconstructing the national  insurance scheme and should thereforecome into effect from April 3-974.    Before reaching a firm decisionthere will of course be consultations with the employers1 and occupational pension organisations.K department of Health and Social Security, SE128 January 1971
