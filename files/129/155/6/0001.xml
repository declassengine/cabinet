THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 626 January 1971REFORM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i attach the draft of a White Paper on the reform of localgovernment in Scotland, which has been approved by the ministerial committee on Regional Policy and the Environment.2,      The White Paper is based on the findings of the Royal Commissionon Local Government in Scotland (the Wheatley Commission).    It accepts the Commission^ definition of objectives, and the recommended two-tier structure of regional and district authorities.    However, I considerthat the Commissions objectives can be more effectively achieved bymodifying its proposals in order to introduce more flexibility and to bringlocal government closer to the electorate.    The White Paper accordinglyproposes to increase the number of regions from seven to eight, and thenumber of districts from 35 to ^9 (excluding Orkney, and Shetland,which will be given separate all-purpose status) j  and to give morefunctions, including the main responsibility for housing, to the districtauthorities.    These changes will make the proposals more generally acceptable in Scotland.3.      The Ministerial Committee agreed that reorganisation in scotland should follow a year after that in England and Wales.    This will involve legislation in 1972-73, elections in 1974 and the completion of thechange-over to the new authorities in 1975.4. I seek agreement to the publication of this White Paper as soon aspossible,,G scottish Office, SWl26 January 1971COPY NO      62CABINET

REORGANISATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTIN scotland the background. The Government have made it clear that they are committed to the reform of local government. Local authorities form a vital part of the nation&apos;s demo-democracy, and a modern and effective system of local government is essential to achieve the Governments aims of freedom and responsibility at all levels of society.2. Separate investigations have been carried out into the systems of localgovernment in Scotland, England, and Wales, and differing recommendationshave been put forward for each country. The Government recognise that thehistory, tradition, geography and social needs of each of the three countries are bound to be reflected in some differences in structure and allocation of functions. They have sought to devise the systems which best take account ofthe requirements and characteristics of each country.3. The review of local government in Scotland was started in 1963 by a conservative Government with the publication of the White Paper on the modernisation of Local Government in Scotland (Cmnd. 2067). It was continued by the last Government with the appointment in 1966 of a Royal commission which reported three years later. The review has thus continued for more than seven years, and it is now essential to bring to an end this long period of un-certainty. This White Paper sets out the Governments conclusions on the main issues, reached after very careful consideration of the views expressed from many quarters. There will be further consultations on the detailed aspects of reform, but on the fundamental questions the basic structure and the allocation of the principal functions the Governments decisions are firm.The Wheatley Commission4. The Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland was appointed in May 1966 under the chairmanship of Lord Wheatley with the following termsof reference:&quot;To consider the structure of local government in Scotland in relationto its existing functions: and to make recommendations for authorities andboundaries and for functions and their division, having regard to the size and character of areas in which these can be most effectively exercised andthe need to sustain a viable system of local democracy&quot;.The Government acknowledge the great value of the Commission^ carefulanalysis of the structure and functions of local government, and endorse itsconsistent philosophy of local democracy. While the Government do not acceptall the recommendations made in its Report (Cmnd. 4150), they consider thatit provides a foundation on which the new system can be built.b5
5. The Commission proposed a two tier structure of seven regional and thirty-seven district authorities. They recommended that the regional authoritiesshould be responsible for the major services involving heavy expenditure which need administration over a wide area (for example strategic planning, transporta-tion and roads, industrial development, house building and management,education, social work, police, and fire). The district authorities&apos; main task wouldbe to plan and develop the local environment, through their responsibility for local planning, environmental health, housing improvement, clean air, building control, amenity and recreational facilities.Comments and Consultations6. Appendix A contains a summary of the observations which were receivedfrom local authorities, other organisations and individuals following the previousSecretary of State&apos;s request for comments on the main proposals. The Govern-ment have been most impressed by this response and they are very grateful forthe co-operation and patience which the local authority associations in particularhave shown over the last few months. The series of meetings which the Ministerof State has had with representatives of the local authority associations provided an opportunity for discussion of the issues raised by the Wheatley proposals and for elaboration of their written observations. The general trend of opinion,evident in the comments and confirmed by the consultations, favoured a larger number of regions than the Commission had recommended, and also moredistricts, with a wider range of functions. There was no consensus of view,however, on the alterations of the Wheatley proposals which might be made onthese points: those who agreed on one proposal invariably differed on others.7. Most comments reflected the special experience of existing authorities; butthe Government must try to produce the best solution for Scotland as a whole,and not only for particular areas or functions. Many helpful points have beenmade, both in the written observations and in the discussions, and the Govern-ment have taken full account of these in framing their own proposals for astructure of local government. Above all, they have found it most encouragingthat the comments received reveal such a wide recognition of the need for reform, not least by those involved in local government at present. This accept-ance of change bodes well for the future and provides a promising basis forfurther discussion about details of the new structure.
2  THE STRUCTURE FOR THE future the need for Reform8. The Royal Commission have been criticised for allegedly concentrating onthe defects of the present system and failing to do justice to its qualities. TheGovernment also see defects in the structure, but they do not undervalue whatlocal authorities have achieved in spite of these weaknesses. They are well aware of the spirit of dedication and service that is to be found among council-lors, and of the high calibre of local government officers: these were recognised by the Royal Commission. If the new order is to fulfil its potential it must use this wealth of experience to best effect.9. The Government accept the Commission^ conclusion that the structure oflocal government is no longer adequate to cope with present day needs. Manyboundaries are out of date, often dividing centres of population from hinterlandswith which they have close connections, and sometimes even splitting continuousurban areas. Many authorities are too small and, however commendable theirendeavours, they do not have the staff and financial resources to discharge all their responsibilities effectively. Anomalies in the allocation of functions betweenthe various types of local authorities cause fragmentation and friction in theprovision of services. The consequences are evident: the elector is confusedabout who is responsible for what; local services do not achieve the higheststandards; ad hoc or joint administrative arrangements prove necessary, andas a result responsibility to the ratepayer is eroded; local government hasbecome too dependent on central government, with an inevitable loss of localcontrol over local affairs.The Structure Required10. The Commission identified four objectives which they considered the reorganised system must achieve power, effectiveness, local democracy andlocal involvement. The Government believe that these are the corner stones onwhich the new structure must be founded. They aim to ensure that local authori-ties shall be strong enough to carry the burden of responsibility for local affairs and at the same time shall be responsive to local opinion.11. As the Royal Commission noted, the demands on local government will increase, and the new authorities must have sufficient resources to achieve the rising standards of service which the public is likely to expect over the years ahead. This means inevitably that local authorities will have to be larger. Withlarger authorities, however, there must be concern lest local government becomesremote from the individual.12. The key to resolving this difficulty lies partly in the right choice of structure-ture, and partly in ensuring that each authority enjoys independent status andis directly accountable to the electorate for its actions and the conduct of its business. Local interest and attention will then be engaged, and the citizen willknow that he has a stake in an authority which is concerned about his needs.
13. The Government have studied various possible structures. They have examined a system of all-purpose authorities, and a structure involving morethan two tiers. Both have superficial attractions, the former for its simplicity,the latter for the scope it offers for allocating functions to authorities of appar-ently just the right size. But the disadvantages of either of these alternatives faroutweigh the advantages. The Government are convinced that the Royal Com-mission was right to conclude that the particular needs and circumstances ofScotland require a two-tier structure. Nevertheless, within Scotland there is such a wide variation in the character of areas, and in the nature of problems,that considerable flexibility is necessary.The Regional Level14. Radical changes have taken place in society since the last major reform of scottish local government in 1929, but the local government structure has not greatly changed. It must now be adjusted to fit the present social pattern butit must also be shaped to cope with new situations which can be expected todevelop during the rest of this century.15. In recent years people have become more mobile, and there has been a significant broadening of the scale on which life is led. Education, new forms ofcommunication and developing technology have also stimulated expectations,and the pressure on local authorities to expand and improve the scope of their services has grown. For some services this has been impossible because of the size and shape of the authorities; for others local authorities have combinedthrough joint boards, committees or consultative bodies, but it is widely accepted that such arrangements are by no means ideal.16. The Government are satisfied that within the new structure larger regional authorities should be created appointed by, and directly responsible to, the electorate with the power and resources to provide the larger scale services ontheir own account. As the Royal Commission pointed out, there is no necessaryconnection between size and efficiency; but a close examination of the presentsituation leaves no doubt that regional authorities will enjoy substantial advan-tages through economies of scale. Many of the problems which now face localgovernment do not relate to any single local authority area, and many areincapable of solution by the separate efforts of the authorities directly involved.Problems which are regional by nature must be dealt with on a regional basis;the solutions ought not to be hampered by unsuitable local authority boundaries.17. In defining the regions the Government accept the approach adopted bythe Commission: local authorities&apos; areas must be delineated by boundariesdrawn to accord with travel-to-work, shopping and education patterns, recreational-tional and leisure movements, and lines of communication. All these reflect theinterdependence of centres of population and the surrounding areas. Thesesocial and economic ties will become even stronger as mobility increases, andit is important that the new local government structure should acknowledge thesenatural links and not cut across them. Throughout Scotland a regional coherencecan be traced around the main centres of population, and it is by reference tothis identifiable community of interest that the regional authorities should be defined. In this connection the Government accept the Commission^ conclusionthat the four Cities should cease to be all-purpose authorities and should become the centres of the wider areas they already influence.
The District Level18. The Government believe that a second level of authorities is also needed.These district authorities will not be subsidiary to the regional authorities but will be complementary to them. Each type of authority will be independent ofthe other, and, while consultation and co-operation between them will be essen-tial, their statutory functions can be quite distinct, the regions dealing with theservices which require management over a wide area and the districts with themore local services. In this way effective administration of all local government services will be secured, and at the same time there will be ample scope for theexpression of local opinion in the processes of government at both regional and district level.19. The areas of the district authorities must also be worked out on the prin-ciple of community of interest. The Government have studied carefully thevarious types of community -&quot;shire&quot;, &quot;locality&quot;, and &quot;parish&quot; described bythe Commission. In reaching their own conclusions they have also taken accountof the widespread opinion that in the structure advocated by the commission the proposed district authorities are too remote from the electorate, while their functions are too limited. The Government have sought to ensure that the districtauthorities correspond with genuine local communities, and that they have important functions to discharge, with resources to match them.20. The Government therefore accept the main principles stated by the RoyalCommission, but they consider that a number of modifications and improve-ments will ensure that the Commission^ aims can be more successfully achieved.In particular they have concluded that the role of the district authorities shouldbe enlarged, but that for the remoter parts of Scotland there is advantage in acertain flexibility of approach in defining the districts and assigning functions.There are obvious practical objections, noted by the Royal Commission, to introducing variations within a region, but there is some scope for differences between one region and another, depending on local circumstances and condi-tiqns.21. The detailed changes proposed are discussed in the ensuing chapters.The main alterations are that there should be one more region (the Borders);both Orkney and Shetland should be given separate status, with independentcontrol over almost all local government services; the number of districts shouldbe increased by 14 to 49; and additional functions, notably in relation to housing,should be conferred on the district authorities.
3  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS22. In allocating functions to the two levels of authorities the government recognise three requirements: that responsibility for any particular functionmust be assigned to the authority which will do the job most effectively, giventhe character of the function and the resources which its provision requires;that account must be taken of the interconnections between individual servicesand groups of services; and that each level of authority must have substantial and satisfying tasks. The division of responsibilities should be clear-cut: wherepowers are delegated by one authority to another there is an erosion of theprinciple that local authorities should be independent and directly accountable to their own electorates, and confusion or friction is apt to result.Regions23. The Government consider that the functions appropriate to the regional authorities fall into two categories which are not entirely distinct from each other.First there are the strategic services which need to be co-ordinated over a wide area. Secondly, there are a number of major services which only an authority with considerable resources will be able to provide fully and effectively. In allthese services regional authorities must have more than a supervisory or planningrole. They must have executive powers, and the necessary resources to decideregional priorities, budgets and investment plans for all the services under their control.24. Strategic services. The Government endorse the Commission^ view thatstrategic planning will be fundamental to all the regional authorities&apos; activities.This will not be merely land-use planning in the accepted sense, but will involvethe formulation of an economic strategy for the region relating to patterns of settlement, the development of communications and centres of population, andthe use of resources, particularly land and finance. Regional authorities should therefore also have responsibilities for transportation and roads, industrialdevelopment, and the services ancillary to major planning.25. Roads. The Government have examined the possibility of dividing responsibility-responsibility for highways so that regional authorities would plan, build and maintainthe principal roads and district authorities the local roads. However, they con-sider that the entire road network must be planned as a whole, and also that thecreation of two separate levels of highway authorities would produce an ineffi-cient use of resources, particularly scarce professional staff. The link between local planning and local roads can be effectively kept through the consultationsundertaken when the district councils formulate their local plans on the basis ofthe regional strategy for their area, including the road network.26. Police and fire services. The second category of regional services is lessdirectly related to the planning and development of the infrastructure, but these functions involve heavy expenditure and offer opportunities for economies of scale. They also demand specialist staff and technical equipment, and highly specialised facilities. Because of such requirements the police and fire services
should be administered by the regional authorities, although in a few areas jointarrangements similar to those now existing may have to continue.27. Education and social work also fall into this category and the Governmenthave reached the conclusion that these too should be regional responsibilities.The Government share the Royal Commission^ views that these interconnectedservices must be the responsibility of a directly elected authority and that asubstantial population is needed to support an acceptable standard of service.Some of the less populous regional authorities proposed in Chapter 4 may notbe able to provide at their own hand the full range of educational and social work services, for example in further education or for certain disabilities. How-ever, the Government have no doubt that suitable arrangements for such pro-vision can and will be made between these authorities and their neighbours.28. The Government have considered whether, in view of the large concen-tration of population and the many important centres in the west of Scotland,any special arrangements should be made there in order to ensure that the educa-tion and social work authority should not appear too remote from the individualcitizens with whom it is so intimately concerned. They have come to the con-clusion that there is no practicable alternative to placing education and social work at the regional level. To divide this region into several smaller regions would frustrate the overall planning which this part of Scotland pre-eminentlyrequires; and to interpose directly elected, and financially responsible, education and social work authorities of intermediate size between the region and the dis-tricts would cause confusion and administrative fragmentation. The government consider that the risk that the authority might seem remote can be overcomethrough administrative decentralisation, which the regional authority can bestarrange.Districts29. The Government intend, as the Commission suggested, that the role of district authority should be very different from that of the region: the regionalauthority will formulate and carry out a broad strategy, and will administerlarge-scale services; the district authority will concentrate on caring for and improving the local environment. With a coherent set of functions related tothe essentially local matters, the district authorities will have a task that isconstructive, absorbing and important for their local communities.30. Local planning. The Government agree with the Commission that the regional authorities should determine the strategic planning policy and shouldbe required to prepare structure plans, within the terms of the Town and country planning (Scotland) Act 1969, for the whole or part of their areas: and alsothat within this framework the district authorities should deal with day to daydevelopment control, and should prepare local plans under the same Act dealingwith details of land use and specific action areas for redevelopment. this division of responsibility assigns to each type of authority the aspect of planningparticularly appropriate to its own capacity and interest. Policy decisions willbe taken at both levels, and there will be ample scope for direct local partici-pation. The Government consider, however, that these arrangements should notbe applied throughout the whole of Scotland as, the Commission proposed.This would require the creation, in the remoter parts of the country, of undulyextensive district authorities merely in order to support the minimum planning
staffs. A more flexible approach is preferable, and the Government intend thatthe regional authority should be responsible for all planning in the outlyingareas (the Highlands, the Borders, and the South-West).31. Housing. The Commission suggested that district authorities should have responsibility for housing improvement because it is closely linked with their other local environmental functions. The Government agree, but consider thatthe building, management and improvement of houses are interdependent.Existing authorities have become increasingly aware of the importance of acomplete housing policy, for example relating replacement to improvement,and the finance of building to rent policies. To divide the housing function inthe way indicated by the Commission would risk a serious dislocation of re-responsabilities.32. The Government, having studied all the evidence available, agree with the substantial body of opinion that housing should be a district function. Localinterest in housing is understandably intense, and the housing service should beresponsive to this interest. The Government are satisfied that all the new districtauthorities will have sufficient resources of finance and professional skill todischarge their housing responsibilities well. With the main responsibilities for housing, local planning, amenity and the environment, district authorities willbe able to maintain and improve the quality of house-building for local needs,to formulate sound policies for allocation and other aspects of house manage-ment, and to devote the necessary effort to the improvement of old property and the encouragement of private house-building.33. Housing also has wider implications, as a component of the regionalstrategy, particularly in relation to overspill and industrial development. the regional authority must be able to take the initiative in arranging for the buildingby the district authorities or other agencies (for example the Scottish special housing Association) of houses for these purposes. It is not necessary thatregional authorities should themselves build houses, but they will be given thepower to ensure that housing for major redeployment of population, or tosupport substantial industrial development, is provided where and when it isrequired. This need not result in any interference with the practical responsibilityby the district authorities (or other agencies) for the construction and manage-ment of the houses.34. Local health and amenity. The environmental functions related to local health and amenity will clearly be an important part of the district authorities&apos;group of responsibilities. There are, however, a few modifications of the Corn-mission^ proposals which the Government consider desirable: for instance,they believe that refuse disposal, as well as collection, should be a district func-tion; on the other hand the law on food standards and labelling (because of itsconnection with weights and measures and the other consumer protectionservices), and on animal health (which involves the police), should be admini-stered by the regional authorities.35. Building control. As the consequence of the decision about planning in the highlands, the Borders and the South-West, building control, which goesnaturally with planning, should in these parts of the country become a regionalfunction, although it will be a district responsibility elsewhere.
36. Libraries. The Government have come to the conclusion that the responsi-bility for libraries should also be allocated to the regional authorities in the highlands, the Borders and the South-West, but to the district authoritieselsewhere. The main consideration here is that the district authorities in theoutlying regions would tend to lack the staff and other resources to provide asatisfactory library service.37. Appendix B lists the main functions which the Government propose shouldbe exercised by each of the new authorities. Some of these allocations are subjectto further study and consultations, but those discussed in this chapter, whichare fundamental to the work of the new authorities, the Government regard assettled.The National Health Service38. In a Green Paper published in December 1968 the previous Governmentoutlined tentative ideas for reorganising the tripartite National Health Service,including the present health authority services, into a unified service. The RoyalCommission took note of the Green Paper but declined to make a recommenda-tion about the future of the health service in the context of a revised structure of local government. They set out various factors for and against bringing it within local government, but emphasised that the final decision had to be takenby the government of the day against a wider background than they themselveswere able to consider.39. As the Secretary of State indicated in reply to a Parliamentary question on the 5 November 1970, the Government have decided that the reorganisation of the health service should not take place within local government. They find the considerations noted by the Commission against this course overwhelmingparticularly on the financial side. Moreover, opinion within Scottish localgovernment itself is not strongly in favour of such a major change: and medicalopinion is very firmly against it.40. A fuller statement of the Governments proposals for restructuring the health service will be published shortly. They will take account of the vital necessity, to which the Royal Commission drew attention, of continued close co-operation between health and other personal social services, and the bound-aries for health service areas will be drawn in a way which will facilitate this.
4  THE NEW LOCAL AUTHORITY AREAS41. The Government have examined with great care the areas proposed bythe Royal Commission for the regional and district authorities. They accept theCommission^ general approach, but have decided that some modifications ofthe pattern of authorities are necessary in order to produce a structure flexibleenough to suit the requirements of different parts of the country.Highlands Region42. The Government recognise the force of the criticisms which have beenmade of the extent of the proposed Highlands region, covering almost half thearea of Scotland. They have looked closely at suggestions that it might be dividedinto two or even three separate regions. They have concluded, however, thatany such division would entail an arbitrary fragmentation of the growingcommunity of interest in the Highlands. Nevertheless some adjustment must bemade to reduce the practical difficulties which would confront a regional author-ity responsible for such a widely spread region.43. First, Orkney and Shetland, because of their separate identity and remote-ness from the mainland, should become virtually all-purpose authorities, with complete statutory responsibility for almost the whole range of local government functions. It will, however, be necessary to retain for the police and fire servicesarrangements, similar to those at present in force, for administration over a wider area. The Orkney and Shetland authorities will also have to continue to rely on the mainland for assistance in the more specialised aspects of education and social work.44. Secondly, the Government consider that the major part of Argyll hasstronger links, evident particularly in existing lines of communication, withGlasgow than with the rest of the Highlands region, and should be transferredto the West region. Ardnamurchan and the Glencoe district in the present county of Argyll will remain in the Highlands region.45. Thirdly, it is proposed that the number of districts within the revisedHighlands region should be increased from five to ten, so as to bring the localgovernment organisation nearer to the people in areas where the population is widely dispersed. The resulting pattern follows fairly closely that outlined in anote of reservation to the Wheatley report. The Government accept, so far asthe Highlands are concerned, the view expressed in the note that district authori-ties of the size proposed should not exercise planning functions. Responsibilityfor all aspects of planning will therefore rest with the Highlands regionalauthority, which will no doubt find it necessary to adopt a decentralised formof administration. Building control, and libraries, will also be allocated to the regional authority.46. By reducing the area of the Highlands region by almost one quarter, andby shortening the lines of communication from Inverness to the boundaries ofthe region, these changes will make the organisation and administration of the
region considerably easier. At the district level the authorities will be close to thelocal communities, but will also be equipped with sufficient resources to tacklea wide range of local problems efficiently.North-East Region47. The region outlined by the Commission is acceptable, except for the pro-posal that the county of Kincardine, should be split between the North-East and east regions. The whole of the county looks to Aberdeen as its regional centre,and should therefore be included in the North-East region. The district authori-ties, the number of which should be increased from four to five, will have responsibility for local planning along with the other local services.East Region48. Subject to the removal of the southern part of Kincardineshire to theNorth-East region, the Government accept the region proposed by the Com-mission. They have considered carefully the case that has been advanced for aseparate local government unit for the county of Fife. It is true that geographyand tradition have until lately given the county an unchallenged unity; but theCommission rightly took note of recent developments which significantly alter the picture. With improved communications the links between the northern part of Fife and the rest of Tayside have become clearer, as have those betweensouth Fife, with its expanding industries, and the Lothians. It has become evidentthat for the Tay estuary (and also for the Forth) there should be a single regionalauthority responsible for major planning, involving economic strategy, alloca-tion of land use, and transportation. The Government therefore agree that thenorthern part of Fife should be included in the East region.49. At the district level the Government consider that no increase is necessaryin the four district authorities recommended by the Commission.South-East Region and Borders50. Observations received on the Commission^ proposals directed attentionto two particular problems relating to the area of the South-East region. Onthe first of these, for the reasons already indicated, the Government agree withthe Commission^ view that the southern part of Fife should be included in the region.51. The second question is whether the four Border counties should be givenseparate regional status. The Commission concluded that, because of the strongexisting links between the Borders and Edinburgh, and because of doubt aboutthe adequacy of the resources of the Borders to meet regional responsibilities,a separate region should not be created. However, the Commission themselvesrecognised that the Borders have a special character and distinctive problems.The Government believe that, with the evidence that now exists of local deter-mination to solve problems by joint effort, the further development which thearea so urgently needs will best be achieved by a Borders regional authority.Although the population of the region falls below the levels suggested by theCommission for the provision of the major services, these levels, as the Corn-mission themselves accepted, were only a general guide, and population is notthe only, nor always the most important, factor. Operational considerations willmake special arrangements necessary for the joint administration of the police
and fire services over the South-East and Borders regions. The region may alsobe dependent on the neighbouring South-East region for the more specialisededucational and social work services, but otherwise the Borders authority willdischarge the entire range of regional functions.52. In the South-East region, comprising Edinburgh, the Lothians, and southFife, the Government propose that there should be six district authorities, eachcarrying the full range of district functions. In the Borders region there will be four district authorities. Responsibility in the Borders for local planning,building control and libraries will rest with the regional authority, not the dis-tricts, for the same reasons as apply in the Highlands.Central Region53. The Government accept the region suggested by the Commission. Theyappreciate that of all the regions this one has at present the least degree ofconscious identity: but its internal cohesion can be expected to develop asthe considerable potential for economic growth within the region is realised,and it has sufficient resources to ensure that all services are provided to a satis-factory standard. There should be three districts.West Region54. There has been a good deal of criticism of the very large West regionproposed by the Royal Commission, and the Government have examined closely the scope for dividing the region or limiting its size. They have concluded thatthere is no alternative to a single regional authority for the west of Scotland.Despite all the difficulties to which the Commission^ proposal gives rise thereis considerable agreement that the crucial planning and other related problemsof the West need to be approached on a very wide basis. Only a regional authoritycovering the whole of the area will have the broad perspective and the essentialresources of finance, manpower and land to cope with them effectively. More-over, the evidence shows that the interdependence and community of interestbetween Glasgow and the rest of the entire proposed region are as strong asbetween any Scottish city and its hinterland. Thus any solution which did not provide a single regional authority would be a denial of the Government^approach, and would in the long run damage the interests of every part of thearea.55. The West region proposed by the Government will have a population ofabout 2,562,000; the transfer of Argyll from the Highlands to the West regionwill be counter-balanced to some extent by the removal from the West region of the Girvan district council area of Ayrshire (with a population of about11,000), which appears to have closer links with the South-West region than with the West.56. The Government are well aware of the formidable task which will con-front the West authority in administering a region which is by far the largest interms of population, and the second largest in terms of area. They are satisfied,however, that the difficulties are not insuperable, and that by suitable decentrali-sation of organisation the authority will be able to provide services effectivelythroughout the region.
57. The number of district authorities will be increased from 11 to 13 by theaddition of Argyll and by the division of the Hamilton-East Kilbride districtinto two.South-West Region58. The Government accept the region suggested by the Royal Commission,subject to the inclusion of the Girvan area, transferred from the West region,which will raise the population of the region to about 156,000. As in the case ofthe Borders, although the population of the South-West does not fully meetthe criteria established by the Commission, the region has a homogeneouscharacter and sufficient resources for the successful discharge of its responsibilities -ties. However, as in the Borders, it may have to depend to some extent onneighbouring regions for specialised assistance in some aspects of education and social work.59. It is intended that the number of districts within the enlarged regionshould be increased from two to four: and that the regional authority, like thoseof the Highlands and the Borders, should deal with all aspects of planning,with building control, and with libraries.Boundaries60. Appendix C lists the authorities proposed by the Government, with theirpopulations; and the annexed map outlines the authorities&apos; areas. As the Corn-mission recommended, existing administrative boundaries should be followedwherever possible so as to enable the new system of local government to bebrought into operation with the minimum of disruption and delay. The bounda-ries illustrated may be altered slightly after consultations with local authoritiesand other interested parties, which will start shortly, but the general structure,and the number of regions and districts, are not open to adjustment.
5   COMMUNITY COUNCILS61. The Royal Commission suggested that each district authority should berequired to prepare a scheme for the formation of community councils within its area; and that community councils should not be part of the formal localgovernment structure, with statutory functions to perform. But they should beable to express local opinion, to improve the amenity of their areas, and to runcertain local services or facilities, as agents for the district or regional authorities.They should have no right to raise money by rates, local tax or requisition, but could receive grants from district or regional authorities, as well as privatedonations, and could devise their own finance-raising methods.62. There is some support for this concept, and many helpful suggestions andobservations have already been received. On the whole the present local authori-ties have not been enthusiastic, but the criticisms they have made will be helpful in considering how the concept of the community council can most usefully be developed. In many parts of the country there is clearly a strong desire for some means to focus and express public opinion at a very local level, and the needfor this may well become greater in the reorganised structure. The government intend to consult all the interests concerned about the Commission^ detailed recommendations for the scope of activity, financing and composition of community councils, but they incline to the view that any community whichwishes to set up such a council should be enabled to do so.63. The Government agree with the Commission that community councils should not have statutory functions: this is the corollary of the proposal thattheir formation should be optional, depending on local wishes. These councilswill not be local authorities in the familiar sense; they will be outside the localgovernmsnt system. The Government do not consider that community councils should, as the Commission suggested, administer services on behalf of the regional or distric tauthorities: this agency arrangement would run counter tothe principle that authorities should be accountable to their electorates, and experience shows that such an arrangement seldom works well. However, in expressing and representing local opinion on issues which affect the local community, and in safeguarding and improving local amenity, community councils could find a worthwhile and interesting role. In their further consulta-tions the Government will be concentrating in greater detail on how thecommunity councils&apos; activities in these fields would work in practice.64. The Governments provisional opinion is that the areas of community councils should, except perhaps where the population is sparsely scattered, be slightly larger than the &quot;parishes&quot; identified by the Commission. In order toensure that the councils reflect a true cross-section of local opinion and activities,consideration might be given to the possibility of providing for the representation on the councils, alongside individuals chosen by popular local election, of appropriate local organisations. The Government do not consider that com-munity councils will take over from, or remove the need for, amenity associations,village hall committees, or voluntary organisations working in specialised fields;
and it is because a continuing function is foreseen for such local bodies theyshould probably be represented, in a minority, on the community council.65. The financing of community councils obviously presents difficulty. TheGovernment wish to study the Commission^ proposals further, and to discusssuch possibilities as the use of common good funds, the right to receive the product of a small fixed rate from the district authorities, and support frombodies other than local authorities.
6  THE STATUS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT66. The Government intend to seize the opportunity of reorganisation tosecure for local government a new and improved status. Changes in the structurealone are not sufficient. If local authorities are to exercise more independentcontrol over local affairs their relationship with central government must berecast. This involves a fresh look at the financing of local government, and atthe controls exercised by central government. The matters dealt with in this andthe ensuing chapter do not relate only to Scotland: the principles stated are equally relevant to England and Wales, although their application may differ in each country.Finance67. The Government accept, as the Commission pointed out and as subse-quent comments on the report have repeated, that the proposals for localgovernment reorganisation are incomplete without a thorough re-examinationof local government finance. They have therefore been carrying out a compre-hensive study, and propose to publish later this year a Green Paper, as the basis for discussions with the local authority associations. It will deal with the financialrelationships between central and local government, including the grant system,and with the improvement of the rating system. The Government are satisfiedthat the changes proposed in this White Paper will not prejudice the considera-tion of alternative arrangements for local finance.Relations with Central Government68. The Commission concluded that central control over the work and organi-sation of local authorities was excessive, and that within the reorganised structure-ture a new form of relationship between local and central government shouldbe created. The Government agree: they regard it as essential to the successof the new system that the authorities should be, and should be seen to be, thepartners and not the dependants of central government. The new authoritiesproposed in the earlier part of this White Paper will have sufficient professionalskill and technical advice at their disposal to make it possible to reduce the degree of central intervention in the management of local affairs.69. There are two main areas in which central control can be eased. The first is the financial field. It is essential for the proper management of the national economy that some central regulation of local authorities&apos; financial activitiesshould continue. More financial responsibility should be devoted to localauthorities, however, and the Government will be discussing possibilities withthe local authority associations.70. The Government believe that some administrative and technical controls which central departments operate over particular local government services could also be relaxed. There is still supervision in some areas where it has ceased to be relevant to present-day circumstances. The Government and the localauthority associations are already studying the possibility of ending certain
controls. A number of valuable suggestions have been made and, so far aspossible, these will be implemented even before reorganisation takes place.71. The Government intend to remove many of the existing restraints andto operate flexibly those which remain. This should ensure that central depart-ments concentrate on broad national policy, and local authorities on themanagement of local affairs and on regional and district problems.
7  CONSTITUTION AND MANAGEMENTElections72. The Royal Commission proposed that the term of office of all localauthority councillors should be four years and that all should retire together;that there should be single member electoral divisions; and that the regional and district elections should be staggered. The Government will shortly initiateconsultations with all the interested parties on these issues.Disqualification73. The Wheatley Commission recommended no change in the law whichprecludes an employee of a local authority from seeking election to that author-ity, pointing out that in a two-tier system an employee of a district authority would always have the opportunity of becoming a member of the regionalauthority, and vice versa. The Government agree that the present rule is basicallysound and must remain, although they would be prepared to examine any suggestions for improving its detailed application.Payment of Councillors74. The Royal Commission found evidence that, under the present system of allowances, council service involves a degree of financial hardship, for someelected members. This is plainly undesirable, and the Government intend to explore possible improvements with the local authority associations. The Com-mission also recommended that, over and above the allowances, councillorsshould be paid a substantial salary. This is a fundamental point of principle,and the Government wish to give it further consideration before coming to adecision.Management75. The Government endorse the Commission^ view that good managementis vital to the effective operation of local authorities and that as much responsi-bility as possible should be delegated to officials, while councillors decide policy.These questions of internal organisation, however, are mainly matters for eachlocal authority. Imposed solutions would not be satisfactory. Local authorities will no doubt wish to make a further study of these matters and the principlesof management involved and the associations will be invited, in advance of reorganisation, to reconstitute a working party on management topics.Complaints Machinery76. The Commission thought that there might be a case for a commissioner to consider complaints against local authorities, but that no decision should betaken as to the need for such an appointment until after the new structure hadsettled down. The Government agree. They attach particular importance to theconsideration that any machinery for dealing with complaints should notsupplant the responsibilities of councillors and officials.
8  INTRODUCING THE NEW SYSTEMTimetable77. The Government hope that the new system of local government will bein operation by 1975. If this is to be achieved much has to be done in a shortspace of time, in order to decide the detailed changes and to make the necessarypractical arrangements. The Government are well aware of the strains andburdens that the next few years will impose, but they believe that it is essentialnot to prolong the transitional period. This is also the view held within localgovernment.78. The aim is to introduce a Bill in the 1972-73 Parliamentary session whichwill define the new areas, specify the functions of the new authorities and providefor the transition. On this timetable the new regional and district authoritiesshould be elected early in 1974 and start work, in double harness with the existing authorities, as soon as possible thereafter, in order to take over completely in1975.Areas and Boundaries79. The Government will shortly be starting consultations by inviting com-ments on the proposed boundaries of the regional and district authorities shownin the Map and described in Chapter 4 and Appendix C. Their intention thenis to carry out a series of local discussions about the boundaries and areas indifferent parts of the country. Formal enquiries into boundaries would clearlycause too much delay, but by taking account of local opinion an acceptablepattern can be worked out, following existing administrative boundaries where-ever possible. While the main decisions of principle have been taken on the broadstructure, the division of responsibilities and the number of regional or districtauthorities, there is scope for slight adjustments of boundaries in the light oflocal opinion.80. The definition of wards and electoral divisions within the new local author-ity areas is a separate question, which will be pursued in consultations at a subsequent stage.Staff81. The Government agree with the Commission^ proposal that a staffcommission should be appointed to ensure that the transfer of staff from theold to the new authorities is as smooth and effective as possible. The government accept the Royal Commission^ recommendation that the staff commission should have two main tasks: to safeguard staff interests and to provide thenew authorities with advice on staff. The Government intend to discuss thepossible scope of the staff commission^ work, its membership and its remit withthe local authority and staff associations in the near future. They intend also to review the present arrangements for the payment of compensation for loss of office.
Redistribution of Property82. The Royal Commission also proposed that, for the transfer of buildings and property from the old to the new authorities, a second commission shouldbe established. Its terms of reference would cover all assets and liabilities ofexisting authorities, including property and funds held in trust for the benefitof particular areas; and its powers might have to be mandatory rather thanadvisory.83. The Government have no doubt of the importance, and the potentialdifficulty, of the transfer of property. They are not certain at this stage that asingle commission would provide the best means of dealing with all the intricateproblems that will arise, and they intend to seek the advice of the local authority associations.Other Transitional Matters84. Local dignities. Local Government in Scotland has a rich heritage andhistory of which existing authorities are justly proud. It is riot easy to decide how charter rights and privileges, traditional and ceremonial usages can best be preserved in a structure in which the burghs, with which these are most closely associated, merge into wider local government areas. Much will depend on theinitiative of the local residents: the establishment of community councils is one possible approach to a solution. But the Government will study this questionclosely in consultation with the local authority associations.85. Courts. The reform of the structure of local government requires a reviewof arrangements for the lay courts of summary jurisdiction and the licensingcourts. The Government are considering the question of lay summary justice,and the future of the licensing courts will be examined by the Committee of inquiry into licensing law.86. Nomenclature. The Government are by no means committed to the useof &quot;regional&quot; and &quot;district&quot; in describing the new types of authorities. Theyare prepared to consider alternative suggestions. The names of the individualnew local authority areas is also a matter of importance: in the governments view these names should be suggested and decided locally.Review Body87. The Government accept the case made out by the Commission for a thorough and continuous review of local government machinery in the future:and they agree that this can be carried out most effectively by a single standingbody specially constituted for the purpose. The review body should study theneed for changes in areas and administrative boundaries, and probably alsoin electoral boundaries: these are matters which may require early attentionfollowing reorganisation, because some of the present boundaries, although they may have to be adopted at the start to avoid delay, are far from ideal.The Government will be consulting local authority organisations and other interests before making firm proposals.
9  CONCLUSION88. The Government have issued this White Paper within [eight] months of taking office because they recognise that the reorganisation of local governmentis a reform which Scotland urgently needs. The last seven years have witnessedan unprecedented amount of attention given to local government reform,starting with the publication of the White Paper on the Modernisation ofLocal Government in 1963, followed by two Working Party reports in 1964,the Royal Commission^ exhaustive consideration from 1966 to 1969, and numerous further submissions to two governments. All the material for decision is now available, and the time has come for action to put an end to the long period of uncertainty of which local authorities increasingly complain.89. The Governments decisions are accordingly set out in this White Paper.The structural proposals which it contains are intended as a prescription for action and not a basis for negotiation. The time has arrived for a firm prospectusand programme on which to plan, and the Government have now providedthem.90. Throughout their consideration of these issues the Government have been concerned to strengthen local government and yet keep the personal touch.They are confident that their proposals, based on the foundations laid down inthe Royal Commission^ report, will provide a framework within which localgovernment can meet the needs of Scotland for many years to come.
APPENDIX ACOMMENTS RECEIVED ON THEROYAL COMMISSIONS PROPOSALS1. Almost 400 comments were received from local authorities, organisations and individuals on the structure of local government and the allocation of functions proposed in the Wheatley report. A wide variety of views was expres-sed. This summary concentrates mainly on the observations submitted by thelocal authority associations.2. The four associations differed from one another, and in the case of themembers of the Counties of Cities Association amongst themselves, in their actions. The Association of County Councils proposed a three-tier structureconsisting of:(a) 5 indirectly elected provincial councils for each of the Wheatley regionsexcept the South-West and Central, with responsibility for strategicplanning and housing, transportation, and river purification.(b) 16 regional authorities (including the four cities acting as regional and district authorities) responsible for local planning and the Wheatleyrange of regional functions except those allocated at (a) and (c).(c) 50 district authorities with responsibilities for housing (except pro-vincial), refuse disposal, registration of births, deaths and marriagesand the remainder of the Wheatley district functions.3. The Convention of Royal Burghs did not accept the four levels of com-munity identified by the Royal Commission as the only ones on which a new structure of local government could be based. The Convention advocated aflexible system involving more than 7 regional authorities with provision forco-ordination among them in the fields of planning, transportation, and associated -ated services, and powers for them to take over district functions where neces-sary; and more than 37 districts (whose size should be suited to local circum-stances, with a population basis of 40-50,000 in the Central Belt), responsiblefor the Wheatley range of functions and, in addition, for health, social work,housing, refuse disposal, sewerage and minor roads.4. The District Councils&apos; Association recommended that Glasgow and edinburgh, and possibly also Dundee and Aberdeen, should be first-tierauthorities; and that, there should be substantially more district authorities,with responsibility for the Wheatley range of district functions and, in associa-tion with the regional authorities, for transportation, education, social work,housing, development, refuse disposal and sewerage.5. The views of the individual cities can be summarised by indicating thatGlasgow recommended an all-purpose system, supported by local committees;Edinburgh considered the Wheatley structure of 7 regions and 37 districts not unreasonable although they suggested that Glasgow and Edinburgh should beall-purpose authorities, and that health, social work and housing management
should be dealt with by the district authorities; Aberdeen preferred an all-purpose system wherever possible and stated generally that where a two-tier system was unavoidable more functions should be allocated to the second-tier;Dundee were equally divided between the view that the Wheatley proposals were acceptable, subject to housing management becoming a district function, andthe view that Dundee should be an all-purpose authority.6. Although none of the associations accepted without reservation the Wheat-ley recommendations for community councils, both the Association of CountyCouncils and the District Councils&apos; Association made alternative suggestionssimilar in concept to the Commission^ proposals.7. The Convention of Royal Burghs suggested that Orkney and Shetland,and possibly also the Western Isles, should be given special status.8. Almost all of the other observations accepted in general terms the need to reform local government and the concept of a two-tier structure receivedmost support. This support, however, covered a wide range of opinion, from complete acceptance of the Wheatley proposals to alternative recommendations on the lines of the 1963 White Paper on the Modernisation of Local Governmentin Scotland, (Cmnd. 2067) i.e. with twice as many first-tier authorities and atleast 50-60 second-tier units.9. Individual local authorities tended to submit views only when they were inpartial or total disagreement with the views expressed by their respectiveassociations. For instance 18 of the 23 county councils who commented suggesteddifferent structures to that proposed by the Association of County Councils.10. Among the professional organisations whose members are involved withthe work of local government nine supported the structure proposed by theRoyal Commission; a further five, while they favoured the Wheatley solitionas a whole, had reservations on particular aspects; and six proposed entirely different solutions.
