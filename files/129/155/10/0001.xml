(CONFIDE NfJAL)ANNEX ALOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ENGLAND:   GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS FOR REORGANISATION&apos;.: .....Draft White Paper--I.   INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUNDESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT WHITE paper.      The structure of local government in England is that which was bequeathedto us by the legislation of 1888 and 189A.   At that time the motor car had only-just been invented; electric light was available only to the Savoy Theatre; thepopulation of England was approaching 28 million.   It is therefore understandablethat for more than a quarter of a century proposals for the reorganisation of localgovernment have been under discussion. : The magnitude of the problems of theremainder of the 20th century is such that reorganisation is now urgent.2.      In 1963/65 major reform of London Government was completed.   In 1966 a royal Commission was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Redcliffe-Maud toexamine the problems of local government reform in the rest of England, localauthority associations and a wide range of observers all agreeing on the needfor such reform.   The Report of the Royal Commission was published in 1969 andtheir proposals together with the related research studies have provoked consider-able debate and discussions   The time has now come for conclusions to be reached-and action to be taken.   At the last election all three major parties were committed to pursue policies of major Local Government reform and the conservative party were pledged to introduce a system of two-tier government rationalising theoperation of the various functions03.      Local government provides vital services on which the quality of social and economic life in this country depends.   It is an essential part of the wholedemocratic framework of Government.   The stage has been reached when theinterests of local government as a whole will best be served by ending theperiod of uncertainty which has hung over local authorities, their members and officers for so long.The purpose of this White Paper is therefore two-fold.   First, to outlinethe structural changes which the Government believe to be necessary to fulfill their election pledges, these pledges having been made after carefully consideringthe findings of the Royal Commission, Mr Senior&apos;s dissenting memorandum, themultitude of other proposals propounded both before and after the Commission had.... ^ ...reported, and the reactions and views of the various local authority associations.And secondly, to indicate the proposed timing of legislation and of final-implementation.1(confidential)
(confidential)OBJECTIVE OF REFORM5*       Without doubt the opportunities for local authorities to take the vitaldecisions that affect their areas are more exciting than at any other time.   the pace of change and the scale of technological control over that change is such that men and women in local government could influence the environment in which they and their children will live in a way that has never been open to previousgenerations.   The Government are determined to play -their part in creating theadministrative framework within which the real challenges can be met in a way thatmatches the scale of the problems.   The Government   are determined to return powerto those people who should exercise decisions locally, and to ensure that localgovernment is given every opportunity to take that initiative and responsibilityeffectively, speedily and with vigour.6.       The areas of many existing authorities are out-dated and no longer reflect the pattern of life and work in modern society.   The division between counties and county boroughs has prolonged an artificial separation of big towns from theirsurrounding hinterlands for functions whose planning and administration need toembrace both town and country.   There are too many authorities and many of the mare too small in area and resources to support the operation of services to the standards which people nowadays have the right to expect.   The.present divisionof responsibilities between authorities is,in some fields, confusing and illogical.7.      The efficient discharge of local government functions requires that units should be large enough in size, population and resources to meet administrativeneeds,including the maintenance and development of a trained and expert localgovernment service: that boundaries should be drawn so that areas take account ofpatterns of development and travel:   and that services which are closely linkedshould be in the hands of the same authority.8.      A vigorous local democracy means that authorities must be given realfunctions with powers of decision and the ability to take action - without being subjected to excessive regulation by central government through financial or othercontrols.   Local authority areas,,should be related to areas within which people have a common interest - through living in a recognisable community, through the links of employment, shopping or social activities, or through history andtradition.   Local boundaries, the allocation of responsibilities and the system as a whole, should be understood and accepted as sensible by electors, by members and by officers.   And above all else, a genuine local democracy implies that decisions should be taken - and should be seen to be taken - as locally aspossible.2
(confidential)9.      Practical realities prevent all these aims being fully achieved together.There are advantages of simplicity and intelligibility in making the structure oflocal government uniform throughout the country.   But no one structure can be suitable equally for the density and the sparsely populated areas.   Concentratingauthority for all services in the hands of one authority in each area has similaradvantages and makes for coherence in administration.   But it carries the gravepenalty that if such areas are to be large enough for some services they will be too large for others.   Furthermore, the theoretical advantages of radical re-structuring must be weighed against the advantages of building on the existingwell-established authorities and minimising the disorganisation of services duringthe period of transition.     The Government&apos;s aim has been to evolve proposals/thatwill be conducive to the vigour of democracy and to efficiency in operation, whilebeing at the same time flexible and realistic.3
(confidential)II.   THE GOVERNMENT1S PROPOSALS FOR A NEW STRUCTURE:FUNCTIONS AND TIERS10.     Local government reform must represent a balanced judgement based on a wide variety of considerations.   There are certain points, however, which theGovernment regarded, as specially important in reaching their conclusions aboutthe operational authorities.11.     Land-use planning and transportation will increasingly be dependent uponthe framework of a regional strategy but the units responsible for these functionslocally must be adequate in size and in resources to operate with a sensibleexternal independence and internal cohesion.12.     With functions such as education and the personal social services,such asthe welfare of the handicapped, the elderly and children, there is considerable advantage in having units of population sufficiently large that resources of buildings, equipment and personnel will be sufficient to provide a high quality of service.   The Government accept the view that the units of local authorityappropriate to provide such services should come well within the range of250,000 to 1,000,000.   These limits should not be inflexible but it should onlybe in specific circumstances that these services are provided by units withpopulations below this range.13.     In the Governments view, there will always be conflicts between those whoargue for large scale organisation on grounds of efficiency and those, on theother hand, who argue for a more personal and local service closer to the peoplefor whom it is designed.   The Government obviously must seek efficiency, but is determined to exercise its judgment where there is a balance of views in favourof the people who benefit by the services in question.THE OPERATIONAL AUTHORITIES:   FUNCTIONS1^.     The Government therefore intend that the reorganised system should everywherebe based on two forms of operational authorities.   They do not, however, see the relationship between the two as implying that some authorities are answerable to others.   The sole criteria of the Government has been to settle how functions can best be operated; some need wider areas of administration while others are bestdealt with by authorities more closely in touch with local conditions.15.     It would be quite wrong to use terms &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; tier authoritiesand, it is for this reason that the White Paper refers to 1 counties&apos;, 1boroughs1,districts1 and &quot;parishes1.    &quot;County1 seems appropriate for the wider areas needed for some services.   The more local areas will be &apos;boroughs&apos; or &quot;districts1; purelyfor convenience the term &quot;district&apos; is generally used here but without in any way4(confidential)
(confidential)prejudicing how and to what extent the special attributes of boroughs should beretained.    &apos;Parish&apos; appears to be the most generally acceptable name for the smallest units of local government.16.     Two kinds of system are neded.   In certain of the most populous parts of thecountry the areas which must be treated as entities for major functions,such asland-use   planning and transport, will consist of a pattern of districts all ofwhich will be substantial units in terms of population and resources.   Becauseservices should be administered as locally as possible, it would be right for thedistrict councils here to be responsible for education and the local authoritypersonal social services.   Being predominantly urban in character and generally .compact, these districts would also be sensible and effective units for all localfunctions save those which require to be planned and administered over the widerarea.   For these urban counties, the term &quot;metropolitan&quot; is temporarily retainedas a matter of convenience, though it is not one towhich the Government are committed.17.     Elsewhere the districts are bound to vary considerably in size and resourceseven after reorganisation.   In these other counties, outside the &quot;metropolitan&quot;areas, education and the   personal social services must be the undividedresponsibility of the county authorities, each of whom must be in a position toorganise and provide these expanding services throughout the whole of their area.In education, it is the intention to end the provisions for schemes of divisionaleducation by which local education authorities are compelled to delegate certain of their functions to divisional executives.   Similarly, excepted districts willhave no place in the new local government structure.18.     In the Governments view, responsibility for libraries should rest with theeducation authorities - the district councils in the metropolitan areas and thecounty councils elsewhere.19.     It is proposed that responsibility for highways, traffic management andpublic transport should lie wholly with the county authorities, so as to end thedifficulties&apos;  which arise     through the present division of responsibility forhighways and traffic.20.     County responsibilities will also include police and the fire service.The extent to which it may prove necessary to combine counties for the more efficient operation of these services in particular parts of the country will beconsidered when conclusions have been reached on the main units for other localgovernment functions.5
(confide confidential )21.     Planning control, however, raises issues of close local interest.   Allplanning applications should be made to the district councils, both within and outside the metropolitan counties.   The district councils should, as of right,take by far the greater number of planning control decisions, provided that the professional advice comes from officers who are part of a unified staff structure,serving both counties and districts, so that local needs are reflected in the detailed implementation of development plans.   Responsibility for broad planningpolicies and for the development of both structure and local plans must,however,rest with the county councils.22.     Local authorities also provide an increasing range of services for thebenefit of their areas, many of which bear directly on local conditions, facilities and amenities.   The district councils will have wide responsibilities here.   TheGovernment intend these councils to be genuine authorities, existing in their own right, and with responsibilities and powers sufficient to make service with thema reality for both members and officers.   It would be a disservice to localgovernment to establish authorities with functions which were inadequate to arousepublic respect or interest.23.     One of the most important functions of local government is housing.   TheGovernment believe that the accurate assessment of housing requirements and theprovision of housing and housing advice to the individual is of such paramount importance that the service should be operated as close to the citizen as possible.The management of council houses, slum clearance and the improvement of existing houses are all aspects of an essentially local service.   Quality too is vital inthis sphere, and it is in the districts that the expertise exists at the presenttime.   For these reasons housing should be primarily the responsibility of thedistrict councils.   The counties will need powers to deal with those housingproblems that transcend the boundaries of the districts.24.     The Government will consider the future responsibilities for water supply,sewerage and sewage disposal in the light of the /recent report on these and related matters which has been drawn up bv7 the Central Advisory Water Committee.The detailed allocation of environmental health services will need to be discussed with the local authority associations, as will functions in the field of consumer protection.25.     The proposed distribution of local authority functions is summarised in theAppendix to this White Paper.6confidential
(confidential)26.     In the Government&apos;s view, very little change is needed in the present statutory provisions governing planning functions in national parks.   They intendthat the two existing Planning Boards should be reatined.   They will, in due course,consider, with the new local authorities and other interested bodies, whether theestablishment of further Boards in multi-county parks is desirable.   They considerthat elsewhere planning functions in a national park should continue to be carriedout by a special committee of the county council in whose area the park lies.27.    The local authority personal health services will be transferred to the newhealth authorities to be set up on the reorganisation of the National health service.THE OPERATIONAL AUTHORITIES:   AREAS28.    Simultaneously with the publication of this White Paper the Department ofthe Environment will be sending a circular to all local authorities in Englandoutside Greater London setting out in detail, as a basis for consultation, theGovernment&apos;s proposals for the new counties throughout the country and for themetropolitan districts.29.     It must be emphasised that the new counties will in no sense be a continuation of the existing county authorities.   They will be entirely new authorities, binding together in most cases for the first time all of the urban-and rural areas within their boundaries.   Where possible, existing county bound-aries will be retained in order to keep the maximum existing loyalties and to minimise the administrative problems.30.     THE METROPOLITAN COUNTIES.   In the Government&apos;s view metropolitan areas would appropriately be adopted in Merseyside, in South-East Lancashire and North-East Cheshire (Selnec) and in the West Midlands and, in addition^ in West YorkshireSouth Yorkshire and the Tyne and Wear area.   All these areas need to be treatedas entities for purposes of planning, transportation and certain other services;at the same time the districts into which they could be divided would all be bigenough in population and resources, and sufficiently compact in size to beresponsible for major local authority social services and all the more localfunctions as well.31.     In other parts of the country there are big towns now county boroughs, withdistinguished records of service to the community in the fields of education,child care, welfare and the other personal social services.   But if the counties of which they form parts were treated on the metropolitan pattern and divided intodistricts each of whose councils exercised responsibility for education and the personal social services, most of the districts would either have populations too7
(confidential)small to support these major services or have areas too large for the other services.   The metropolitan pattern is suitable only where a county ss divisibleinto districts all of which are populous and compact.   Alternatively, ifresponsibility for education and the personal social services were allotted tothe large towns and,in the remainder of the counties concerned,to the countyauthority, a separation between town and county that experience has shown to be undesirable for these services would be perpetuated.32.     The Government are therefore of the view that the metropolitan type ofstructure should be adopted in the six areas referred to above, and not elsewhere.The boundari es of these areas should include all the main area, or areas, of continous development and any adjacent area into which continuous development willextend.   It maybe right to include closely related built-up areas, too.   But none of these proposed metropolitan counties can practicably contain the solution ofall the planning problems of the conurbations, and where it is impossible to meet all housing and redevelopment heeds within the county boundaries,the answer willlie in development well outside the metropolitan area, in accordance with a carefully worked out regional plan.33.     Outside the metropolitan areas there are now over 900 separate authorities.There is widespread opinion, particularly within the associations responsible forrural and urban district councils, that a sensible rationalisation should takeplace so as to provide districts with the resources to carry out efficiently thevery considerable responsibilities that will continue to be placed upon them.   the bigger cities and towns will retain their identities.   In other places it wouldbe right to re-unite smaller towns with the rural communities associated with them.Where there is no clear centre to act as a focal point for a new unitiit may stillbe desirable to form a new district by the amalgamation of rural areas.   TheGovernment are anxious, in this structure, to ensure that the special interestsof rural areas are not over-shadowed.3^.     Even after the rationalisation of boundaries at this level the districtsare bound to vary considerably in size,from the larger towns and cities down to much smaller populations in thriving rural counties.   Where there is need for thecreation of larger areas than exist at present,the Government would expect themto have populations in the region of 40,000 in sparseley populated areas rangingupwards elsewhere.REGIONS OR PROVINCES35.     There are functions of both central and local government which need to beconsidered in a regional or provincial context - the process has already begun in- &apos; 8(confidential)
(confidential)the eight Economic Planning Regions.   The most important of these is the formulation of the broad economic and land-use strategy which would be the regional framework within which services would be provided.   The Government agree with the Redcliffe-Maud Commission in thinking that areas of this size would be too large to be appropriate for the operation of local government services.36.     For this reason, the Government1s conclusions regarding the operational localauthorities do not depend on or conflict with the matters now under considerationby the Commission on the Constitution whose Chairman, Lord Crowther, has informed the Government that, so far as can be envisaged, there is not likely to be anything in their report to warrant any delay in proceeding with the reform of localgovernment below provincial level.37.     It would be unrealistic to take long-term decisions on any machinery needed for the provinces before the Crowther Commission have completed their work, whenthe Commission^ report is available, decisions can be taken on the constitutionof any regional bodies and on the range of functions they will carry out in relationboth to central, and local government.   In the meantime, the Government will continueto pursue the preparation of regional strategies by the creation of teamscomprising the Standing Conferences of Local Planning Authorities,the regional economic Planning Councils and Central Government.PARISHES38.     The establishment of two operational forms of local authorities does notremove the need for authorities at the parish level.   There has been a substantialrevival of interest in recent years in the part that very small bodies or authorities can play in allowing local people themselves to get things done and infocussing local opinion on matters affecting the neighbourhood.39.     The Government wish to give every encouragement to the existing rural parishesoutside the metropolitan counties.   The general character of parishes should remain unchanged; they should remain bodies with powers rather than duties and as mucha part of the social as the governmental scene.   It would be desirable in due course to review parish boundaries, as there are many places where small parishes could, with advantage, be amalgamated to form fewer units.to.     The establishment of parish councils in essentially urban areas raisesdifferent   problems - in the metropolitan districts, for instance, or in townareas outside the metropolitan counties.   It may be appropriate, if local peoplewish it, to provide for the equivalent of a parish council in a small town whichis now a separate borough or urban district where such a town is included in a new9
(confidential)and enlarged district.   But the views and wishes of neighbourhoods, or smallcommunities within larger built-up areas,might preferably be represented by non-statutory bodies; district authorities should have powers to assist such bodiesfinancially and in other ways.   This is a matter which will be further discussed with the local authority associations as part of the preparations for legislation.10
(confidential&apos;)III.   FINANCE, CONSTITUTIONAL AND OTHER MATTERSLOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE41.     The reorganisation of local government provides the occasion for a reconsider a-tion of the financial system and a thorough review is in progress.   For the propermanagement of the economy,the Government will need to retain general controls over local authority financial activities but, subject to this, the aim willbe to devolve to local government as much responsibility as possible.42.     The Government will publish, later this year, a Green Paper setting out thepossibilities in the field of local government finance.   This will cover suchsubjects as the financial arrangements between central and local government and between local authorities.   It will deal with sources of revenue including revised arrangements for government grants and proposals for the improvement of the rating system.   The Government have already carried their examination far enough tobe satisfied that the structural reforms outlined in this White Paper can go forwardwithout prejudicing alternative financial arrangements.THE NEW AUTHORITIES43.     BOROUGH STATUS AND DIGNITIES.   Throughout this White Paper the more local ofthe proposed executive units are referred to as &quot;districts&quot;.   This is for convenience only, as is made clear in paragraph   1&apos;5 above.     In many instances thefuture units will appropriately be styled boroughs.   In the &quot;metropolitan&quot; counties,for instance, all the authorities at the more local level should be boroughsjaswell as many of the new units elsewhere,which will be direct successors to existingboroughs.44.     However, the whole question of borough status requires consideration.   Atthis stage the Government would wish to say only that they will seek ways in whichthe office of mayor and other traditional attributes and dignities of boroughs canbe retained, as well as special    honours   granted to particular towns - includingthe style &quot;city&quot; and the right of the Mayor of certain cities to the, title&quot;Lord Mayor&quot;.45.     MANAGEMENT - It is of first importance that the internal organisation of thenew authorities should be based on sound management principles and structures.   TheGovernment and the local authority associations are together considering how the lessons of the best modern experience can be made available to the new authorities at the time that they are set up.46.     The Government now intend to pursue, in conjunction with the associations,an examination of the controls which affect the internal organisation of localauthorities and the way in which they administer their statutory services.   It is11
(confidential)the Government&apos;s intention to allow authorities the maximum discretion to take theirown decisions within national policies.   Reorganisation offers the occasion for asearching review of existing constraints.   The accumulated legislation since *l888has provided over 1,000 statutory controls   by   central Government over localgovernment.   It is the Government&apos;s intention to reduce these to a minimum.MEMBERS47.     Those issues dealing with the term of office, the timing of elections andsingle member constituencies, the future of aldermen and co-opted members tocommittees are matters that will be further considered by the Government inconsultation with the bodies concerned.48.     PAYMENT OF COUNCILLORS.   In the Government&apos;s view there is a clear case for improving the allowances at present paid to members and this is a matter on whichthey will consult further with the local authority associations.   The payment of salaries raises important issues of principle, however, which the Government haveunder consideration.49.     DISQUALIFICATION FROM MEMBERSHIP.   Under the present law an employee of alocal authority may not stand for election to his employing council.   This is anaccepted rule, designed to prevent even the appearance of a conflict between anindividuals public duty as a member and his private interest as an employee.   TheGovernment are clear that this rule should be retained in the wider publicinterest.   Their proposals to reorganise local government on the basis of twoexecutive levels everywhere will mean that local government employees, althoughstill debarred from serving on their employing authority, will normally have the chance to stand for election to the other authority within whose area they live.At present, an employee of a county borough who lives in the town has no suchalternative possibility open to him.   In practice, therefore, the proposals for reform will increase the opportunities for local government service.50.     The Government would be prepared, however, to consider proposals on detailedpoints relating to the application of the present law.STAFF51.     The changes proposed will be a source of understandable concern to all local government employees.   The Government propose to set up a Staff Commission,generally to advise on the arrangements for recruitment and transfer of staff, andfor the safeguarding of staff interests.   They will also review the present arrangements for the payment of compensation for loss of office.   There will, ofcourse, be full consultations with the local authority and staff bodies on thoseaspects of reorganisation which affect local government employees.12(confidential) -
(confidential)COMPLAINTS MACHINERY52.    The Government consider that it would be wrong to introduce new machinery for investigating complaints alleging maladministration on the part of local authorities at the time when the authorities are being set up.   They will, however, keep thisquestion under review when the new authorities have been established.13
(confidential)IV   TIMETABLE AND IMPLEMENTATION53.     The Government are determined that the present momentum towards reform shallnot be lost.   They believe the best interests of local government demand that theconclusions they have reached should now be implemented as rapidly as is practicable.5^.     It is accordingly their aim to introduce a Bill during the 1971/72 Sessionof Parliament.   The timetable they propose would bring the new authorities into being at both operational levels throughout the country during 1973^   These new authorities would take over their full responsibilities on 1 April 197^.   the reorganised National Health Service would come into operation at the same time.55.     The Bill would make provision for the exercise of functions at each levelthroughout the new structure of local government proposed.     s   It would alsodefine the areas of the new counties everywhere and of the new districts in themetropolitan counties.   Consultations on the Government1s proposals for these areas are being initiated by the Department of the Environment in the circular sent tolocal authorities on the publication of this White Paper.   The councils for thenew counties and metropolitan districts will be elected early in the Spring of1973.56.   Within the new counties outside the metropolitan areas, the Government are determined to offer the greatest opportunity to local initiative in drawing upproposals for the new pattern of districts that will be needed. The Government intend to establish a Local Government Boundary Commission to make recommendations regardingthe final pattern of the new districts; in so doing, the Commission would take account of proposals made by local communities, authorities and interests,and would,of course, consult fully with the local authorities concerned.   The proposed pattern of districts would be debated in Parliament before the new areas were given effect by order at about the end of 1972; after electoral divisions had   been settled,the elections to these authorities would be held in &apos;(say) November 1973*   these authorities would then, simultaneously with the county and metropolitan district councils, take over from the existing authorities on 1 April 197^-.57.     The Government have in mind that the Boundary Commission should form partof the permanent machinery for keeping local government areas and electoraldivisions up-to-date.58.     The timetable proposed is tight and inevitably it will place a considerableload of extra work on members and officers of individual authorities, and on theirassociations.   But the Government believe that, on balance, the advantages to be gained by pressing forward greatly outweigh the arguments in favour of delaying thelegislation or of extending the^ransitional period.ONI   ExTIAL
V   CONCLUSION59.     In preparing its proposals for the first comprehensive) local government reform of this century,the Government have sought to balance complementary and conflictingfactors.   Decisions will be taken by those most directly affected and every encouragement will be given to local democracy.   Services must be organised on a scale sufficient to command the skilled administration and the concentration of resources that produce the quality which the nation expects.   The boundariesmust be acceptable both to the population and to administrators.   These long-termpolicies can be introduced only after many detailed decisions have been taken-and togive them effect will require application, energy and dedication.60.     The proposals set out in this White Paper constitute a major reform oflocal government in England,ambitious beyond anything attempted this century - but one which retains and improves the essential elements of the present system.,61.     The Government are firm in their resolve that reorganisation should be centredon two tiers of local government throughout the country.   They are initiatingfurther consultations on the boundaries and will consult the appropriate associationson details of the final distribution of functions.62.     In putting forward the changes set out in this White Paper, the Governmenthave several linked objectives:a. The establishment of a new pattern of local authorities which willcreate units within which the major services can be efficiently administeredand developed in the future.b. They wish to establish power under two types of executive authorityi     through which decisions Can be taken and action ensured at a more locallevel;c. The total number of authorities is to be reduced, but the new andrationalised system will be founded upon the organisations of the existing authorities and will preserve wherever possible the loyalties attaching toancient units of local government; the reduced number of authorities will permit the effecitve transfer of responsibility and power from central tolocal authorities;d. They accept the need for the operational authorities to be complementedat provincial and parish level.63*     Finally, by proposing a firm timetable for legislation and implementation,the Government are ending the long period of uncertainty that has hung over localgovernment, and are opening the way for the further expansion and development oflocal government services. 15
