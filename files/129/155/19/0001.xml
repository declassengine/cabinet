4.    This excludesElectricity Pay:    Report of the Court cf Inquiry-Note by the Department of employment    Main Points in the Report1V (I1.      The Wilberforce Court of Inquiry has now reported.    It isunanimous save for a Note cf Reservation by Mr Mortimer concernedwith the general economic policy of the Government in relation toinflation.2.      The main recommendations are:(i)    That from 21 September 1970  (a year after the previousagreement)  to l4 December 1970  (when the &quot;work-to-rule&quot; was called off)  the offer of the Electricity Council  ( 2 a week)should stand without any improvement.(ii)    That  from Ik December onwards there should be 2 improvements in the employers1 offer(a) skilled workers should get 5^s a week rather than40s.    This would increase their rates by the same percentage  (13%)  as labourers.(b) shift allowances should be increased by rather morethan the Electricity Council had intended.(iii)    To speed up the process now going on rather slowly,  ofIputting in incentive bonus schemes,  each group of workers who are prepared formally to undertake to accept  such a schemewhen offered will not later than 1 June get a &quot;lead-in&quot;payment starting at  1 a week,  and rising by 1 January 1972 to 2 a week.    The payment ceases when the incentive bonusscheme is introduced.3.      The Court say that the improvement in rates for skilled workers and in shift allowances involves a &quot;modest increase&quot; in cost over theElectricity Board offer.    They do not quantify it   (there are indeedno % figures in the Report).    But it is in fact 10.9% over the year from September 1970.;    and the increase in rates from December onwardswould be at an annual rate of 11.3%.
k;      This excludes the &quot;lead-in payments&quot;.    The Court says thatthey should cost nothing in practice since they will enable amore rapid run-down in the labour force to take place.    Themaximum      cost  even if the Court is wrong would be about 1 %of the wage bill in the year to September 1971.5.      The Court is severely critical of the Unions for their refusal to let the dispute go to arbitration in breach of their Agreement.It also declares that the work to rule was  in practice conducted in a manner which was in breach of their Agreements.6.      The Court deals at length with the relevance to their task of the &quot;interests of the public and the national  economy.&quot;    they accept that they &quot;should have regard to the existing inflationaryspiral and to the dangers of giving this an extra twist&quot;.    TheCourt recognises the need to have regard to repercussions on other pay settlements.    They also argue that it is in thepublic interest to encourage workers to co-operate in improvedlabour practices.    Finally they say that moderation in wage settlements for a particular group of workers cannot beexpected unless there is &quot;moderation in other pay settlements,a slower rise in prices,  and some prospect of growth in their real  earnings&quot; by whatever means these are achieved.    Theyconclude with an assertion that:&quot;set against past and prospective performance and thespecial factors relating to this case........  thesettlement we recommend ought not to intensify inflationarypressures&quot;.
Bo    Publication of the Report7.        That the Court has  submitted its Report is known,,    To delay-publication will lead to  speculation that the recommendations are found embarrassing.    Publication could take place on Wednesday10 February followed by a Statement in Parliament  (if so decided).If so,  advance copies could go to the parties and the press on tuesday afternoon.C.    Evaluation of the Report8-.  It is disappointing that the  Court have recommended improvements in the Electricity Council offer which (putting the -best faceon it)  raise the increase to just under 11% just when we were beginning to establish a &quot;going rate&quot; of about 10% in the public sector and when we are taking a Post Office strike on an 8%offer,  and Fords are facing a strike on an offer variouslydescribed as 8% or 10%.9 . The &quot;lead-in payments&quot; for the incentive bonus schemes may alsoattract criticism on the grounds that they are merely    a devicefor giving workers some extra cash without putting it on the basic rates.     In fact the proposals are tightly drawn - but there is aelement of truth in the criticism.10 . As against this there are several helpful aspects of therecommendations:(i)    The Court has sustained as fair the  2 a week offer forall unskilled and semi-skilled workers (nearly two-thirds ofthose involved)/(ii)  the
(ii)    the further increase for skilled workers only givesthem the same % increase in pay as for unskilled workers,ie,  the Court is really criticising a flat rate increase,(iii)    the Court is severely critical of the breaches of agreements by the Unions and the refusal to back-datetheir improvements in the Electricity Council&apos;s offer beyondDecember is pretty openly a &quot;penalty&quot;&quot;  for such breaches.(iv)    the Court has obviously designed the whole packageto minimise repercussions  (eg the increase in shiftallowances has little repercussive effect)(v)    the general approach to rewarding workers for higher productivity is sensible.    The stress is on the degreeof co-operation and on specific incentive schemes andnot on mechanical    use of &quot;productivity&quot; figures.ll.  The treatment of the interests of the national economy isprobably as good as we could have expected.    The Court accepts the seriousness of the inflationary situation (the Treasuryoral evidence impressed them). Otherwise it seems likely thatthey would have recommended a good deal larger increase.12. On the other hand the Court was not (probaBly - no Courtcould be) prepared to ignore the &quot;merits of the case&quot; as they saw them, merely to help them in a general process of&quot;de-escalation&quot;  (a word which is pointedly missing from theReport).    And there are passages which could be interpreted as meaning that the Court hankered after a &quot;prices incomes and productivity policy&quot;,  and these,  together with Mr Mortimer&apos;note of Reservation,  can be picked up by those critics of theGovernment&apos;s policy who say we are concentrating excessivelyon holding down wages.    SECRET
13- The unions will certainly violently criticise the Court&apos;sfindings.    They took every step at the Inquiry to discreditthe Court members as prejudiced    against them.    Nearly two-thirds of their members have got nothing more than they were already offered on rates of pay.1^.. The court  s recommendations are however about as muchas the Unions can have been expecting out of the Inquiry.After much noise,  and in the face of sporadic unofficial action,we would expect the Unions to &quot;accept under protest&quot; thesettlement proposed.15- The increase in the wage bill will of course be farlower than 11% in 1970/1.    A minimum of 5*000 industrial workerswill leave the industry,  perhaps 7?000,  perhaps  (with the newincentives)   even 10,000.    The industrial wage bill will riseat most by 7% - at best by 2-3%.    The Court appears deliberatelyto have called little attention to this.- no doubt fearing itwould give a further argument to the Unions that higher pay should have been possible.secret
16.    In. planning the presentation and handling of the report our main objectives should be:i,    to get  an early settlement of the electricity workers1claim within the limits  set by Wilberforce;ii.    to make sure that the report does not lead to a de facto&quot;norm&quot;  of 11 per cent and that de-escalation continues;iii.    to do nothing which might weaken the position of employerslike the Post Office and Fords who are standing firm onpre-Wilberforce offers,17-      The report will give rise to wide public discussion whichcould influence the general attitude to wage inflation for some considerable time to come.     Different commentators will put thejrown interpretation on the Court1s recommendations and the likelyrepercussions and as these are likely to vary widely it will be important for the Government to get in first with its owninterpretation and to make known its general attitude to the reporton the day of publication.    This could be done in a parliamentary statement which might commend the report to the parties as a meansof resolving their dispute;    point out that the proposed increaseof 10.9 per cent was  specifically related to the circumstances ofthe electricity industry; note that the Court had stressed the need to contain inflationary pressures and Satisfied themselves thattheir proposals would not intensify them;    and emphasise the need to continue the process of de-escalation,18.      A settlement within a couple of weeks within the Wilberforceceiling is desirable.    It would be helpful if the Electricity Councilgot in touch with the Unions as soon as they get the Report   to seek to arrange a meeting as soon as possible after publication.    Itwill be important in Governmental comment on the Report not to suggestthat it represents a complete defeat for the Unions since they will certainly have to argue with their rank and file that the &quot;lead-inpayments&quot; at any rate represent   ronuething of real value from the inquiry./19 A number
19*      A number of negotiations are closely related to theelectricity manuals and have been held up pending Wilberforce;(i)    Electricity.      Engineers    and Clerical WorkersLast month the    engineers    withdrew a threat to work to ruleduring the industrial action by the manual workers,  in supportof their claim for restructuring of their pay as well asa substantial increase.    The clerical grades have a claim in for 15%.    Discussions on both claims will have to beginshortly but the aim should be to keep things in play until after a settlement with the manual workers.    The restructuringto which we are committed on the    engineers    means that theymay well get an increase as large on average as the skilledmanuals.    But for the clerical workers it will be important to get something lower - preferably below 10%.(ii)    Gas.    It will be important to get a settlement on gaswhich can be presented as less than the post-Wilberforcesettlement in electricity.    Early discussions are needed withthe Gas Council to see how this  can be achieved.d^l)    Water.    The settlement here is likely to be broadly thesame as for gas.    Officials will need to discuss with theemployers the handling of the negotiations.(iv)    Local Authority Craftsmen.    At the request of Ministerslocal authority employers delayed offering 50s a week increase to their electricians and engineering craftsmen untilWilberforce had reported.    Since Wilberforce has recommendedover 50s for craftsmen, we need not raise further objectionsto the local authorities offering 50s shortly.(v)    Police.    The next meeting of the Police    Council isarranged for 11 February and Ministers are considering what line should be taken at it.(vi)    NHS Craftsmen.    There is a special problem here.    Longdrawn out negotiations for re-structuring craftsmen&apos;s payhave run into difficulties.    And since this covers electriciansthere is a direct link with Wilberforce.    Ministers will need to take a decision before a meeting arranged with some ofthe Unions on 11 February./20.    More generally
20.      More generally it will be important to ensure that offersmade in the public sector in the immediate future are not raisedmerely because Wilberforce has recommended 11% rather than 10%for electricity.21.      Immediate Decisions RequiredDecisions will be required on:(l)    The date of publication of the Report  (para 7)(2)    The objectives to be followed after Wilberforce (para 16)(3)    Whether a Ministerial Statement  should be made and if so its content  (para 17)(4)    The handling of the related negotiations  (para 19)DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT SW16 February 1971
