Memorandum by H.M. TreasuryDuring the past twelve months the rate of increase of retail prices in the United Kingdom has been faster than at any time since 1951 when the Korean War led to a temporary boom in worldcommodity prices.   The rate of increase in wage and salary earningshas been the fastest since the short-lived boom immediately afterthe First World War.   A continuation of this rate of inflationwould have grave economic and social consequences, and it wouldfrustrate rather than promote the objective of increasing the realstandards of living of the community.   Slowing down the pace of inflation therefore has a high priority in current economic policy.Historical perspectiveDuring most of the inter-war period the major economic problem inthis country was not inflation but unemployment.   Following theimmediate post-war boom and slump, earnings remained virtuallystable in money terms in the 1920*s and 1930&apos;s but there was adownward trend in prices.   This was the way in which real earningswere increased.   There was however a&quot; very high level of unemploymentduring this period and a marked cycle in trade and commerce: factors which strongly influenced the attitude of both unions and employers to wage demands and pricing policies.Since the Second World War there has been an almost continuousincrease both in money earnings and in prices.   The increase in real earnings has come from a faster rise in the former than in thelatter.   The inflationary trend has been more or less world wide.It has coincided with the acceptance by Governments in most advancedcountries of responsibility for high levels of employment.   In mostof these countries there has been a speeding up in the pace of inflation during the last couple of years or so.   How far therehave been common factors at work is an open question.   More recentlyour costs have been rising faster than those of industrial countriesgenerally.For a time it seemed plausible to attribute the post-war inflationin the United Kingdom largely to the ending of wartime controls and
the consequent release of pent-up demand, and to the rise in import prices which roughly doubled between 194-6 and 1951; and to regard the increase in wages and salaries merely as a response to theincrease in retail prices rather than as an initiating factor.But when import prices levelled off after 1951 and tended to fallfor a good many years, and yet inflation continued, it became clearthat this explanation of inflation was not valid.   It has become increasingly recognised in industrial countries generally that increases in money earnings which exceed the growth in productivityare an important autonomous or self-generating factor driving upprices.The maintenance, over a long period of years, of high levels ofemployment is now generally regarded in this and other advancedindustrial countries as a major factor influencing the post-warcourse of pay and prices.   The belief that Governments will not allow aggregate demand to fall below a relatively high level hasaltered the climate of opinion in wage bargaining.   Unions havebeen led to think increasingly that there is little risk that pay increases would price their members out of a job or that, even ifthey tended to do so, it is the Government&apos;s responsibility tosafeguard the level of employment.   Employers have been led tothink that increases in labour costs can be passed on without pricingtheir products out of the market or that, if in the face of foreigncompetition the higher prices caused markets to be lost, it is theGovernments responsibility to put things right.   Nonetheless, a return to the conditions which appeared to prevent inflation before1959? whether the chronically high levels of unemployment of theinter-war years or the recurrent high levels brought about by thetrade cycles of the years before 1914-, would involve the sacrifice of what.has been one of the major achievements of the post-war period,namely the maintenance of high levels of employment.   It follows that, if an intolerable rate of inflation is to be prevented,the determination of pay cannot be just a question of the apparentimmediate self-interest of the direct parties to an individual&quot;bargain.   Considerations of the national interest, and of theinterests and standard of living of others, have to be taken intoaccount in the process of determination of wages and salaries.
Recent developmentsvDuring the ten years or so up to the devaluation of November 1967,retail prices rose on average by about 3 per cent a year.   Therate of increase was higher in some years, lower in others, andvaried by and large (with a time lag) with the pressure of demand.But during the two years following devaluation, although the levelof unemployment was high by post-war standards, retail prices rosehy 5-!?  per cent a year.   Over the last twelve months there hasbeen a further acceleration, and in November (the last month forwhich a figure is available) the retail price index was nearly8 per cent higher than a year earlier.   Price inflation is likelyto remain at around this rate so long as the present rate of increase in wages and salaries continues.The fact that the rise in prices during the two years following devaluation was faster than the long-run rate of increase can be explained by two special factors: first, the increase in import prices caused by devaluation (which raised retail prices by-3 per cent); second, the associated increases in indirect taxa-tion- designed to restrain domestic demand and thus make room forthe necessary transfer of resources into higher exports end importsubstitution (these increases raised retail prices by nearly4 per cent).   The temporary reduction in the rate of growth of real consumption caused by these changes was deliberate andunavoidable if the balance of payments was to be put right; and ithad to be put right, for we could not have gone on consuming morethan we were producing and living beyond our means.   The temporaryreduction in the rate of growth of consumption cannot be made goodnow by a faster than average rate of increase without undoing theessential improvement in the balance of payments.The acceleration in retail prices since the autumn of 1969 hasoccurred at a time when these special post-devaluation factors were no longer significant.   It has been due to an acceleration in labour costs.   Import prices have risen by only about 2-  per cent duringthe last twelve months^^ compared   with over 8 per cent a year on(1)   See chart in Annex(2)   i.e. between the September-November periods of 1969 and 1970.

Excluding the December 1970 instalments ofthe 1968 long-term agreements in the engineering and alliedindustries, the figures are: 4 million, 11-J per cent and12ijr per cent.There has been a growing tendency for the period between settlementsto be less than twelve months.Earnings per head, which rose by an average of 5 -6 per cent a year in the ten years up to 1967, and by 8 per cent a year during thetwo years following devaluation, have risen by nearly 14 per centin the last 12 months (i.e. between October 1969 and October 1970).^?In this same twelve month period average weekly earnings ofelectricity manual workers rose by 151 Per cent.^^During the past twelve months prices generally have risen substantially less than earnings (which constitute a major part of total costs).^?^(1)   No figures of earnings are available beyond October.(2)   This figure is extracted from the Department of Employment half-yearly earnings enquiry covering manual workers.   The figure for allmanual workers is not yet available, but it usually changesclosely in line with the monthly index of average earnings coveringall employees on which the figure of 14 per cent is based.(3)   See Annex.
for three main reasons: first, wage costs per unit of outputhave risen less than earnings per head because there has been somerise in national productivity (this factor normally operates);secondly, import prices have risen much less than wage costs;thirdly, profits have not risen at all (which has meant a fall inprofit margins),The gross trading profits of companies have in fact risen verylittle for several years.   Between 1964 and the first threed)quarters of 1970 they rose by 11 per cent,    J and all of this increase can be attributed to higher stock appreciation.   Duringthe same period income from employment rose by 52 per cent.   the resulting sharp narrowing of profit   margins(2) is having adverse effects on investment plans, both through reducing cash flow andby reducing the expected profitability of new investment.

Implications of the continuation of the present rate of inflationIf the present rate of inflation were to continue, the consequences would be serious, both domestically and externally.   Domestically,it would lead to an arbitrary redistribution of income in whichthe sufferers were mainly people living on small fixed incomes andothers in weak bargaining positions.   An expectation of continxiinginflation would also lead to a growing tendency for people to manage their affairs on the assumption that prices would continueto rise rapidly.   This could result in unwillingness to save inconventional forms and a tendency to spend money on goods as quickly as possible before prices ro3e.   There would then almost certainly be an acceleration in the rate of inflation.The consequences of continuing inflation are further illustratedin the following passages contained in a recent OECD report^^ onthe problem of inflation in member countries?-&quot;The social and political consequences of continuing inflationmust also give great cause for concern.   They are not easy topin down because the impact of inflation on individuals and groups is extremely haphazard.   Also, under inflationary con-ditions, income gains and the accumulation of wealth oftenappear to result not so much from work or sacrifice, but rather from ingenuity in the exercise of economic and politicalpower and influence.   Resentment against inflation is incoherentand diffused through the  community.   It therefore tends tostrengthen other forces making for disenchantment with government and existing political parties. * . .To sum up, the essence of the problem today is that the cumulative economic, social and political consequences of inflation, which up till now some may have regarded astolerable, could begin to build up rather quickly.   Further,the relation between inflation as the cause, and its effects -. growing distortion,   friction and discontent - may not be either clearly or immediately apparent to large segments ofpublic opinion.   This is why such a heavy responsibility lies(1)   The Present Problem of Inflation, OECD, December 1970
on informed opinion to stress the dangers in the presentsituation, and the urgent need to give a higher priority to price stability.&quot;Externally, the effects of a continuation of the present rate of inflation in the UK would depend very much on cost and pricedevelopments in other countries.   The competitive cost advantagegained by the 1967 devaluation was largely preserved until theearly part of 1970 partly because of the inflation in other industrial countries generally, and partly because, given thecharacter of our markets, our relative position was more assisted by the German revaluation in the autumn of 1969 than it wasadversely affected by the French devaluation in the summer.   Butthere are now signs that British costs are rising faster than the costs of most of our main competitors.   Moreover, with costs ofproduction rising much faster than export prices, the profitability of exporting must have been steadily eroded during the past year(1)or so.   (During the last two years,    &apos; wage and material costs per unit of output in manufacturing have risen by nearly 14 per centwhile export prices of manufactures have risen by 8^- per cent.)Looking ahead, other countries are talcing action to deal with inflation; and the latest forecasts show the pace of inflationslowing down quite markedly next year in the other main industrial countries.Before very long, if UK costs and prices developed on the lines ofrecent trends, while in other countries the rise slowed down,there would be a serious deterioration in the balajice of payments.Foreigners would stop buying our goods if our prices becameuncompetitively high; our exporters would stop selling if theycould not get an adequate profit.If our competitive position were to deteriorate in this way therewould be a direct loss of jobs in export industries and in industriescompeting with imports, and this would have a cumulative effect on those employed in other industries and services.   There would alsobe an indirect loss of jobs if it became nefcessary to reduce demandfurther to prevent a serious loss of foreign exchange.   It may be(1)   I.e. between the third quarters of 1968 and 1970.
argued that the balance of payments could be restored by a lowering of the exchange rate; but apart from the other costs involved (forexample the likely adverse effects on the capital account) thiswould give a further twist to the inflationary spiral, and make itstill more difficult to slow down the rise in prices.For all these reasons it is essential to slow down the pace of inflation.The implications of slowing down the pace of inflationIt is necessary to concentrate attention on wage and salary bargain-ing because the biggest single element in the cost of total finaloutput is income from employment and because this is the elementthat is rising most rapidly.   The other main elements, apart fromindirect taxes which are required to finance a large part of collective consumption and investment, are import costs and profitincomes.    &apos;   In general, the level of prices will continue to riseso long as wages and salaries per head increase faster than thegrowth of national productivity (output per head) which is estimated to average about 3 per cent a year.   The effect on the price levelof an increase in earnings per head in excess of the increase in productivity might to some extent be offset by reductions in import prices or by a slower growth of profits.   But there seems little prospect of import prices falling - they are more likely to rise on average; and the profits figures given earlier show that there isno scope for a growth of earnings at the expense of profits ifinvestment is not to be further jeopardised.   Indeed it is doubtfulwhether the higher level of investment that is required for our future grov/th will take place unless there is a rebuilding of profit margins.The Government has made clear its view that the interests of thepublic and of the national economy require a progressive and substantial reduction in the level of pay settlements.    It considersthat this can be achieved - and can only be achieved - if all those responsible for pay determination accept the over-riding need toreduce the rate of inflation.    The Government is acting on thispolicy in all negotiations where it is responsible.    It has made it(1)   See Annex Table 1 for details.
clear to all other public authorities,   to private industry and commerce, and to the trade unions that the national economic interest requires them to conduct pay negotiations with this objective in mind.It would be unrealistic to estpect the rate of increase of earningsto be brought down overnight to the rate of increase in national productivity.    But if the domestic and external dangers described above are to be avoided it will be necessary to carry through theprocess of de-escalation and to bring about quite rapidly adeceleration in the rate of settlements to levels far below thoserecently experienced.This will not be easy.   The process of wage negotiation goes on more or less continuously with no clearly defined &quot;rounds&quot;.What is  deemed to be equitable as between one settlement andanother often plays an important part.   The sise of one settlementinfluences the next; only too frequently the special arguments usedin the attempt to justify a large settlement for one group arediscounted or dismissed as irrelevant when other groups then claim the same amount or more.   This is a process which generates itsovm. acceleration and to stop it it is necessary to break into thecircle somewhere.   To accept the argument that each group musthave as large an increase as the last or that one group cannot accept a smaller increase until someone else has done so would mean that the slowing down of the inflation could never start.   Diffi-culties, and even breaks in previous relativities, in the short runmay be a necessary price to pay for the avoidance of much more serious and widespread difficulties end hardship in the future;and the longer the present rate of inflation is allowed to persistthe more damage it will do and the more  painful   and drastic willbe the measures required to slow it down.   Some of these difficulties will be reduced as the process of de-escalation progressivelyaffects subsequent settlements.Is there an alternative?In theory an alternative method of closing the gap between earnings and productivity would be to raise the growth of national
productivity nearer to that of earnings.   But there is no way of bringing about at all quickly a significant speeding up in theaverage growth of productivity over a period of years.   Even atemporary speeding up could not go far to close the present widegap between the growth of earnings and that of productivity.There were in fact periods of temporary acceleration during 1959and 1963 when productivity rose at a rate of some 5-6 per cent,but in neither case was this rate maintained in the following years, when there was a marked acceleration in the pace of wage and cost inflation and a sharp deterioration, in the balance ofpayments.   Such, a policy now would merely initiate another cycleof &quot;go-stop&quot; - and in present circumstances the &quot;go&quot; phase wouldnot last for long.repercussions in the present inflationary position it is particularly important that full account should be taken in each major pay settlement ofthe influence which it is likely to exert over other pay negotiations in many cases there are long-standing and close links between the pay settlements reached in certain groups of negotiations.   Thisis manifestly true in the case of public utilities - electricity,gas and water.   The settlements have not in the past beenidentical but have clearly been, on many occasions, substantiallyinfluenced by each other.   Indeed at the present time further negotiations in both the gas and water industries have been post-poned until after the Court of Inquiry into electricity has completed its report.But the repercussions of major settlements are by no means confined to further closely related negotiations.   The outcome of all majornegotiations influences the general expectations of both employersand workers in other industries about what is a fair and reasonableincrease, and this must be taken into account in considering whatis appropriate in a particular case.   To say that a somewhat smallerincrease than might otherwise have been agreed for a particulargroup of workers will not &quot;arrest&quot; inflation and that therefore no account need be taken of wider repercussions is a false approach tothe whole question of pay determination.
Productivity-It is sometimes suggested that any industry which is increasingits productivity at a particularly fast rate ought to increase itswages and salaries faster than industries where productivity isrising only slowly.   In practice such an indiscriminate approach which ignored the causes of increased productivity would be seriously inflationary and could not be justified.    In many casesthe increase in output per head is simply a reflection of a highinvestment of capital, on which a return has to be earned, and does not in itself involve more exacting work or require greatereffort or skill by the workers; and though in some cases the levelof responsibility may be raised, in others the higher capital investment produces both higher productivity and easier   working conditions.   It is to a large extent these increases in productiv-ity which enable the general living standards of the vihole community- including the workers in the industry - to rise.Experience shows that if there are high wage increases in particular industries where productivity is rising rapidly, this will lead topay settlements at or near the same level in other sectors wherethe rise in productivity is far smaller.   The consequence will inevitably be to raise costs and prices in these latter sectorsand thus in the economy as a whole.   If the price level is toremain broadly steady it will in general be necessary for prices to come down in industries where productivity is increasing at afaster than average rate, to offset inevitable price increases insectors where productivity rises at less than the average rate orcannot rise at all.   This will be the result if earnings generallygo up at roughly the same rate as that of the national growth of productivity.This is not to say that there may not be scope for specific arrange-ments for relating pay of particular groups to the acceptance by workers of changes involving more exacting work in order to improveproductivity.   The Electricity Boards are in course of introducingsuch schemes.   However, the fact that the level of earnings ofworkers engaged in these specific productivity schemes will heincreasing substantially faster than the increase in basic rates is relevant when determining basic rates, and in considering repercussions-sions of their total pay increases on wage claims and settlements inother industries.
Cost of livingAn argument commonly used to justify the size of pay claims is that increases ought both to compensate for the increase in the cost ofliving since the previous settlement and permit an improvement in... Ireal terms.    If this results in the average of pay increases beingabove the national productivity trend (as it would do in presentcircumstances) the general rise of costs and prices must continue;but provided it is consistent with a process of de-escalation of wage settlements, there would be a gradual slowing down of therise leading eventually to reasonable price stability.   Some ofthe arguments adduced recently to justify particularly high wage claims are likely however, if accepted, to lead to acceleratedprices increases.   A formula for determining the level of pay by providing an element for rises in prices since the last settlement,an element for anticipated rises in the period ahead and an elementabove this for a further substantial increase in real earnings would give a dangerous upward twist to the inflationary spiral.In an economy with a rising productivity trend it will normally bepossible for the real as well as the money value of wages to rise.But this cannot be taken for granted for all periods, especiallyafter real domestic consumption (public and private) has grown atthe expense of the balance of payments.   In the period following the 1967 devaluation, for example, it became necessary to restrain the growth of real incomes in order that the greater part of theadditional resources becoming available from higher productivitycould be devoted to Improving the balance of payments.However, the figures which have been quoted demonstrate that therecent rate of settlements, and even more so the increase in earn-ings, have been substantially in excess of the rise in the costof living so that real earnings in general have been risingrapidly.   Even after allowing for tax on the increases in pay, and despite the fact that other forms of personal incomev J have risenmore slowly, the real volume of personal consumption has risen byM per cent during the past year^^- an above average rate by past(1)   Dividends, self-employment incomes, national insurance benefits, etc.(2)   I.e. between the third quarters of 1969 and 1970, the latesttwelve month comparison available.
standards - and savings have also increased.   As lower wage increases lead to lower price increases it should be possible to achieve a substantial deceleration in the rate of inflation withoutthere being any question of actual falls in real wages for thosein employment; and those on fixed incomes would suffer less.Application to particular casesThe precise application of .these general considerations to particular cases will be affected by the special factors which apply to the case in question, including the recent pay history.But, on 2rJ^a^a ie grounds, it cannot be suggested that a groupwhose earnings have increased by 151 Per cent over the past year,and who already have an offer on the national level which would increase earnings by 10 per cent and which, together with the progressive implementation of local productivity schemes, should give a substantially larger increase in average earnings over theyear ahead, have been falling back in relation to the increase inthe cost of living, or are in danger of falling back in relationto other wage and salary earners generally.ConclusionIt is clear from this analysis that the problem of slo\d.ng down the pace of inflation is a complex one and will not be overcomewithout difficulties and without the wider acceptance of responsi-bility.   But this must be a worthwhile price to pay in order toprevent the serious consequences, both domestic and external, of continuing inflation.   Since there is no further scope for areduction in profit margins if the investment on which our futuregrov/th depends is not to be jeopardised, the slowing down of thepade of inflation requires a slowing down of the increase in labour costs.   And since there is no way of bringing about at allquickly a significant increase in the average year by year growth of productivity, this means a slowing down in the rate of increaseof money earnings.   This in turn requires a de-escalation in thelevel of pay settlements.   In the process of bringing about thisde-escalation, all settlements are important.   Apart from directeffects on the general price level, each settlement has anindirect effect through its influence on other settlements.   While
some settlements may appear to have quite a small or even no effect on the price level as a whole, they can if generalised havea very important impact.   Each individual settlement must make its own contribution to the total result of slowing down the pace of inflation.
