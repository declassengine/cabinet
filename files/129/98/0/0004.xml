confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1959C. (59) 104 Copy No. J26th June, 1959CABINETEDUCATION: TEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Minister of education on 17th June the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Minister of Labour, to consider the implications of accepting the recommendations of the Burnham Committee for a minimum of  520 for the teachers&apos; basic salary scale instead of the  510 which I had stipulated, and the meansof obtaining satisfactory assurances on the 21-year period for which the Committeenow propose that the award should remain in operation (C.C. (59) 36th Conclusions,Minute 3).2. At our last meeting there were, I think, three points over which difficulty was seen in my accepting the Burnham Committee&apos;s recommendation at theminimum of the scale. There was the question of the effect which this might have over the wages field generally (which, of course, has been our prime motive in seeking to intervene in the negotiations); there was the difficulty of reversing aGovernment decision already publicly announced; and there was the danger that by so doing we should make it more difficult to influence the course of future salarynegotiations.3. As to the first of these, I believe that my colleagues feel that the situation has been materially affected by the 2^-year currency for a new agreement whichthe Burnham Committee have now proposed to recommend. I had expected that,if the teachers were to be held down to no more than a 2\ per cent, increase at theminimum of the scale over the present salaries to avoid undesirable repercussions on industrial wages, no stated period for the operation of the new scales would beagreed; and that it would, therefore, be difficult to resist claims for a further reviewafter a short period. Under the present proposals, however, the new scales would remain in operation from 1st October of this year jintil 31st March, 1962, and thereafter from year to year unless either side should give not less than a year&apos;notice. It is not, of course, possible to preclude the teachers from submitting someinterim claim, for example, because of a marked rise in the cost of living, but this could not be entertained by the Burnham Committee unless the Local Authorities&apos;Panel of the Committee were agreeable. The history of their negotiation since thewar shows how this works out in practice.4. An agreement was negotiated for the period beginning in April 1945 andit ran for the full three years specified, helped by the fact that the cost of livingfigure remained pretty steady. The next agreement was negotiated to run for threeyears from April 1948, and again ran for the full period. The teachers claimedan increase in 1949 when the cost of living had increased by 6 per cent, over18 months, but this was rejected by the Authorities on general economic grounds.In 1951 a further three-year agreement was negotiated but at the end of that year the teachers claimed a special addition because of the sharp rise in the cost of livingwhich had resulted from the Korean war (about 12 per cent, in one year). The;.Authorities refused any revision whatever, and it was only after deadlock had beenreached and the teachers had appealed to the then Minister that the Committee55402
2CONFIDENTIALagreed to take independent advice, as a result of which a  40 addition was granted in July 1952. A new agreement, again for three years, came into operation on1st April, 1954, and at the end of 1955 the teachers again sought a cost of livingincrease, the retail prices index having risen by about 9 per cent, over 18 months.Only after considerable negotiation, however, and some prompting from theMinister (who was concerned to have the salary question settled before increasedsuperannuation contributions became payable by the teachers), did the Authoritiesagree to negotiate a new agreement, to come into operation from October 1956,instead of April 1957.5. This is the current agreement. As a result of the special circumstances inwhich it originated, its date of operation does not coincide with the financial yearand no period of operation was stipulated in the agreement as settled between thelocal authorities and the teachers. It was left for the Minister to emphasise hisown view that the new scales should continue for the normal three year periodof time, i.e., till October 1959, and to say that he would not be willing to approvean increase before then unless there were some major change of circumstances.In spite of this, the teachers submitted a new claim in the spring of 1958 for animmediate substantial increase. The local authorities resisted them on the groundthat there had been no major change of circumstances until the Governmenteffectively took the matter out of their hands by approving a 5 per cent, increase for teachers in Scotland. This led to the interim increase of .5 per cent, which took effect for teachers in England and Wales from 1st February, 1959.6. In short, apart from the special revision of salary scales made at thetime of the Korean war, no post-war salary settlement has been revised before the agreed date except when the Government has forced the Burnham Cornmittee&apos;shand.7. It is, of course, very much better to have the agreement of both sides toa period of currency for an agreement. That now proposed, which is longer thanthe teachers wished, has been put at 2\ years in order to restore the coincidencewith financial years, and I am sure that we can rely on the authorities not to discussproposals for new salaries to operate from a date any earlier (i.e., before April 1962),unless some altogether exceptional circumstance supervenes.8. It is not yet certain that the associations of local authorities and teachers,especially the teachers, will ratify the Burnham Committee&apos;s provisional agreement as described in paragraph 2 of C. (59) 100. If they do, and the Committee submitthis to me as their formal recommendation, they will almost certainly accompanytheir submission by some statement of the reasons which led them to adhere totheir proposals in spite of the arguments that I had put to them. I should expectthem to lay emphasis upon the 2\ year currency of the agreement as evidence ofits anti-inflationary intention. If I were to approve the proposals, my reply, whichwould preface the published report of the Committee and thus form part of the operative document, could take particular note of the proposed currency of theagreement. When I look at the Committee^ report on this particular matter,and when I consider my relations with the Committee following my recentintervention with them, I conclude that this would be more effective than seekingfor specific assurances as to their intentions.9. Annexed is the draft of a letter showing the lines on which I should proposeto reply to the Committee.G. L.Ministry of Education, W.1,25th June, 1959.
. . ANNEX   &apos; ,DRAFT LETTER FROM THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION TO THECHAIRMAN OF THE BURNHAM COMMITTEE&quot; You wrote to me on enclosing a summary of the salary, ^scales which the Burnham Committee have recommended to operate from&apos;31st October, 1959, for teachers employed in primary and secondary schools and special schools maintained by localeducation authorities. -  -  ;I see that the basic scale now recommended is the same as that upon whichI earlier made my views known to the Committee. As you are aware, I did notthink that a sufficient case had been made out for the increase now proposed atthe minimum of the basic scale either on educational grounds or in the light ofthe Government^ policy of encouraging stability of wages and prices.I remain of the opinion that the needs of the education service could havebeen better met if the total expenditure involved in the Committee&apos;srecommendations had been distributed in other ways. As regards my second point, however, I note that the Committee have endeavoured to meet my concern that their proposals should not be inflationary in their effect by including in their recommendations the proposal that the new report should remain in force for atleast 2\ years from October 1959.In all the circumstances, I do not now wish to press my objection to theproposed minimum of the basic scale to the point of refusing my approval of thereport as a whole. I should expect, however, that due note would be taken ofthe views which I have expressed on this occasion when the time comes toundertake a further salary review.When, therefore, I receive full details of the Burnham Committee&apos;srecommendations in the form of a new report, you may take it that, if this confirms the recommendations contained in the documents which you sent to me, I shallbe prepared to give my formal approval and to make the necessary Order underSection 89 of the Education Act, 1944.&quot;June 1959.
