Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1959.C. (59)119 Copy No.   3223rd July, 1959CABINETTHE IMPERIAL AND NATIONAL SERVICES GRANT TO THEMETROPOLITAN POLICE FUNDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy SealSection 1 of the Police Act, 1909, provides that there shall be paid in eachyear out of monies provided by Parliament in addition to the sums so payable for other police purposes such sum as the Secretary of State, with the approvalof the Treasury, may determine in respect of the services rendered by theMetropolitan Police for imperial and national purposes. The Home secretary at that time said that the object of the provision was &quot; to provide the necessarysum which shall cover all those charges .... which may be imperial charges and certainly ought to be borne by the State and not by the ratepayers of London.&quot;2. ,Since 1910, the special grant paid under this provision has been at therate of  100,000 a year. The local authorities, not unnaturally, have been pressing for an increase; and the Home Office agreed in 1956 that the costs in 1957-58of the various services covered by the original grant should be recorded. Thetotal expenditure in that year on these purposes was  640,000; and it is now estimated to be  760,000. I do not regard the whole of this sum as attributable to &quot; imperial and national purposes &quot;; but I am satisfied that the cost to theMetropolitan Police of services properly so described the protection of membersof the Royal Family, members of the Government, and foreign dignitaries andembassies; the internal protection of Royal residences both in London and elsewhere; the additional cost of the regulation of traffic near Parliament whenthe House is sitting; the protection of Government buildings; and a considerable part of the cost of the Special Branch is approximately  475,000. I feel no doubt,therefore, that the present contribution of  100,000 should be increased to this amount. The net additional cost to the Exchequer of such an increase would(taking account of the normal police grant of 50 per cent.) be  187,500.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer opposes this increase on the grounds that:-(a) since the grant was introduced in 1909, the whole system of exchequer support for police expenditure has been placed on the basis of a comprehensive 50 per cent, grant; and(b) on balance the London ratepayer gains greatly from the fact that london is the metropolis.4. The first of these arguments does not seem to give adequate weight to thefacts:  (a) that there was a Metropolitan police grant of about 45 per cent, in 1909;f  and(b) that when the 50 per cent, grant was introduced in 1918 the imperial contribution was continued and has been maintained ever since.55551THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
5. The second argument will certainly cut no ice with the metropolitan localauthorities or with their Parliamentary representatives. The principle of a specialcontribution to the Metropolitan Police has been accepted not only since 1909,but in fact since .1833; and while some parts not all of the metropolis arewealthier than the rest of the country, the cost of the normal work of the police inLondon apart from the special services with which we are now concerned is I also greater and so involves a heavier charge on the ratepayer.&quot; 6. If the argument of the Chancellor of the Exchequer were accepted, thelogical conclusion would be to withdraw the imperial contribution altogether: thatis plainly out of the question. We could not now repeal the obligation underwhich we are placed by the Act of 1909. If, however, the imperial contribution is to be continued, I can see no ground on which I can defend its continuance ata level considered right 50 years ago. I must therefore ask for authority to increaseit to a realistic figure, which I estimate on the basis of current conditions to be 475,000 a year.   (Exchequer cost  187,500.)R. A.
