secret this DOCU1VIENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT^ Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1959C. (59) 133 Copy No.    3221st July, 1959CABINETTHE SMALL FARMER SCHEME AND MARGINAL ASSISTANCEIN NORTHERN Ireland memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy SealOn 14th July the Cabinet invited me to circulate a memorandum on the effecton Northern Ireland of the Governmenfs decision to terminate the marginalagricultural production schemes (C.C. (59) 41st Conclusions, Minute 5). This hasto be considered along with the impact on Northern Ireland of the Small FarmerScheme and of the Governmenfs general agricultural policy.2. Marginal assistance in Northern Ireland took two forms, one a scheme of grants for special seeds and fertilisers in Fermanagh and West Tyrone, the other asupplement to the basic fertiliser grants to farmers with 50 acres or less. some,300 farmers benefited from the first of these schemes, and some 43,000 from thesecond. Total expenditure in 1958-59 was  238,000 for the first scheme and 355,000 for the second.3. Out of some 75,000 farmers in Northern Ireland about 60,000 have holdings of between 10 and 100 acres. It is thought that 20,000 to 25,000 of these will be eligible for assistance under the Small Farmer Scheme, and another 15,000 will be eligible only for supplementary assistance until 1962. Approximately 20,000 to25,000 farmers who previously received marginal assistance will not be coveredby the Small Farmer Scheme, will get no supplementary assistance and will losemarginal assistance of the order of  200,000 to  300,000. Most of them are probably in the non-viable category, which the Government have announced willbe the subject of a special study. Some may be part-time farmers or those whoseoperations are too small to merit financial help on agricultural or economic grounds;but a large proportion contribute materially to agricultural output. They producemilk, pigs and eggs, and also rear calves for ultimate finishing as beef cattle. Thereare also some among this group who fail to qualify as &quot; Small Farmers &quot; becausethe assessment of standard man-days in their case exceeds 450, but who neverthelessdepended to a material degree on the marginal assistance grants to keep their farmsin a reasonable state of productivity. As a whole this group plays an important part in the overall economy of Northern Ireland. The ending of marginal assistance is likely to result, in many cases, in fairly rapid deterioration of their land.4. The Small Farmer Scheme has barely got under way in Northern Ireland,and it is too early to be certain about its eventual effect. It seems likely that annual expenditure in Northern Ireland under the Scheme, while it lasts, will be perhaps 11 millions, compared with under  600,000 which was spent in the last year onmarginal assistance. There is thus no doubt that the Small Farmer Scheme will bring considerable benefit to many Northern Ireland farmers. This, however, isno more than a reflection of the fact that Northern Ireland is mainly a land of small farmers, and it was always implicit in the Governmenfs decision to give special assistance to small farmers.5. The Small Farmer Scheme provides only for once-for-all grants to farmerswho are eligible; supplementary assistance comes to an end in 1962.  Those who55537
benefit from the Scheme will then have to stand on their own feet.  One of themain objects of the Scheme was to make possible further cuts in the guarantees on milk, pigs and eggs, commodities on which a majority of farmers in NorthernIreland rely heavily.   The long-term prospect of smaller guarantee payments,,in respect of these commodities must therefore be offset against the current benefidP-of the Small Farmer Scheme.*- 6. The present issue, however, concerns those farmers who are not coveredby the Small Farmer Scheme but previously enjoyed marginal assistance. Asubstantial proportion of these farmers are in Northern Ireland, and it would bedifficult to explain why a concession was being made to those in Scotland whilenothing was being done to help those in Northern Ireland who were sufferingsimilar difficulties. It seems hard to justify the distinction on social any more thanon agricultural grounds.7. The Minister of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, like the Secretary ofState for Scotland, has received many representations about the effect of the sudden withdrawal of marginal assistance. Hitherto he has replied that increasedbenefits will accrue under the Small Farmer Scheme to a large number of NorthernIreland farmers, and that many of those not covered by the Scheme, who willlose marginal assistance, may be in the non-viable category which the Governmenthave announced will be the subject of a special study. This reply has not satisfiedthe Northern Ireland farmers concerned, and the Minister would be gravelyembarrassed by a concession to Scotland, even though it is made clear that marginalagricultural production assistance as such will not continue beyond 1962.8. In these circumstances it would seem equitable that any concession shouldnot be restricted to Scotland. The Minister of Agriculture for Northern ireland has suggested that if a concession is to be made in part of the United Kingdom,the most straightforward solution to the problem would be an amendment of the supplementary Assistance Scheme to remove the lower acreage limit, for thetime being at least, and also to adjust the standard man-day requirements in thecase of former recipients of marginal assistance so as to bring in, say, those with100 to 150 and 450 to 550 standard man-days. Such an amendment would haveto apply in the United Kingdom as a whole; it is estimated that the cost inNorthern Ireland might be  200,000 in a full year. The only other way of meetingNorthern Ireland&apos;s difficulties would seem to be to reject the proposed schemefor Scotland.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W.1,21st July, 1959.
