confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1959C. (59) 120 Copy No.13th July, 1959CABINETABOLITION OF VISAS BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND SPAINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the colonies problem has arisen over the proposed visa abolition agreement with Spain.2. The Spanish Government, which was the last country in Western europe to require tourist visas, unilaterally abolished visas for United Kingdom visitorssome three months ago, at the same time inviting Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto conclude a bilateral agreement abolishing visas for the citizens of both countries and their overseas territories. This has involved consulting all British colonial governments and it is only within the last two or three weeks that we have beenin a position to respond to the Spanish invitation. A draft visa-abolition agreement has now been prepared and despatched to H.M. Ambassador at Madrid, who hashowever been asked to wait further instructions before taking action. The questionof Gibraltar in relation to the proposed agreement remains outstanding.3. The Spanish Government imposed a number of exceptional restrictionson the Gibraltar-Spanish land frontier (La Linea) in 1954 following the Queen&apos;visit to Gibraltar in that year. The more important of these restrictions, whichhave nothing to do with visas (Spanish visas have, in fact, been abolished forGibraltarians as well as for visitors from the United Kingdom), are as follows:  (a) Anyone, whether Gibraltarian or not, entering Spain from Gibraltar byland is restricted to three visits in any one quarter.(b) Spaniards and foreign residents in Spain (including British subjects) canonly enter Gibraltar with the greatest difficulty. (Spanish labourersare, however, allowed day passes to work in Gibraltar, but even these have since 1954 been subject to severe restrictions.)4. Gibraltarians may, however, enter Spain any number of times by sea atAlgeciras (which for most means leaving behind their cars), or alternatively, theycan buy cheap day passes, provided they do not wish to go beyond the immediatehinterland of Gibraltar the Campo comprising the area within approximatelya 50 miles radius of the frontier at La Linea.5. The people of Gibraltar greatly resent these restrictions which, sincemany of them have business interests or relations in Spain, involve inconvenience and hardship. The restrictions also affect the tourist trade, upon which Gibraltarmust increasingly depend for a livelihood, especially since the reduction of thegarrison. It has become a matter of increasing grievance with the Gibraltariansthat the steps taken by Her Majesty&apos;s Government since 1957 to improve relations with Spain have not so far been matched by the slightest modification of theSpanish restrictions at La Linea. The conclusion of a visa-abolition agreementwith Spain which did not result in a substantial improvement at La Linea, wouldbe interpreted in Gibraltar as meaning that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had moreregard for relations with Spain than for the interests of Gibraltar. H.M.Ambassador at Madrid, on the other hand, has frequently warned us that nothing55488
will induce the Spaniards to lift their restrictions on the Gibraltar frontieraltogether and that if we ask for too much we may find ourselves in a position from which it would be hard to retreat; the difficulty being that the Spaniardswill not formally admit that there is an international frontier between Spain and gibraltar, while we cannot formally recognise that any special restrictions thereare justified.- 6. In order to get round this impasse it is proposed that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should conclude, at the same time as the visa-abolition agreement andwith reference to it, an exchange of notes of which the text is shown at Annex.This text has been agreed by H.M. Ambassador at Madrid, the Governor of gibraltar and the two Gibraltarian members of the Legislative Council speciallyinvited to London for the purpose. The exchange of notes, while recognising thespecial military nature of the Campo area which, it can be maintained, justifiescertain special restrictions on the movement of foreigners, would abolish altogetherthe special restrictions on travellers passing between Gibraltar and Spain proper,through the Campo area.7. The Spanish Government have been warned that we attach importanceto the proposals to be made for improving La Linea frontier arrangements andwe have promised the Gibraltarians that we will press firmly for Spanish acceptanceof the draft note and in the last resort will not conclude a visa-abolition agreementwithout some appreciable improvement on the La Linea frontier.8. Before instructing H.M. Ambassador to proceed accordingly, we have considered what we should do do if, as seems likely, the Spaniards refuse to exchange notes on the lines of the Annex. The practical alternatives would be (a) to break off negotiations for a visa-abolition agreement, indicating that west and ready to conclude it when the Spaniards accept our draft exchangeof notes or something very near to that draft; or(b) to continue discussions so as to elucidate what improvements the spaniards are prepared to make on the La Linea frontier and then to consult the Government of Gibraltar again before deciding whether thereis a satisfactory basis for concluding the visa-abolition agreement.9. If we were to take course (a), it is possible that the Spaniards would allowtheir present unilateral abolition of visas to continue in order to earn the maximum amount of foreign exchange from tourists. But we cannot be sure that this will beso, and for prestige reasons they might feel bound to reimpose visas. This would no doubt lead to parliamentary questions and other forms of pressure on her Majesty&apos;s Government, both from the tourist interests and, if the Spaniardsimposed further restrictions at La Linea, on behalf of Gibraltar. This would onlyworsen Anglo-Spanish relations without achieving any benefit for Gibraltar.10. The real danger of course (b) is that, once we depart from the text of theexchange of notes as we have drafted it, we shall be back to arguing about thenumber of permitted visits across the frontier. H.M. Ambassador at Madridbelieves that the best offer we might get from the Spaniards might be twelve visitsin twelve months as compared with the present three visits a quarter; and this, tothe Gibraltarians, would certainly not be the &quot; appreciable improvement &quot; referredto in paragraph 7 above. On the other hand, provided we show the Gibraltariansthat we have pressed our full requirements with conviction and vigour, and havethus wholeheartedly supported Gibraltar&apos;s interests, they would accept some reasonable accommodation over the La Linea frontier rather than have no improvement at all on the present arrangements.11. In these circumstances, the best course seems to be that H.M. ambassador at Madrid should be instructed to press the draft exchange of notes on the SpanishGovernment as strongly as possible without putting himself in the position of representing the exchange as an absolute requirement from which we shall in no circumstances retreat. If the Spanish Government reject the draft exchange, heshould as the next move ask them to state what they are prepared to do in viewof the helpful attitude which we have adopted towards them over a number of Jmatters including their desire for membership of O.E.E.C. He should then reportthe results of this approach and further consideration should be given to the nextstep in consultation with the Government of Gibraltar. This would leave thepossibility open for us to reach agreement with the Government of Gibraltar to gofor the best terms we can get from the Spaniards. Since the Spanish Government
leaves Madrid in the middle of July and business is virtually impossible for twomonths thereafter, we should have ample time for further consultation once we know the Spanish reactions to our first approach and before we decide upon thenext step.12. The above is to inform our colleagues of the action we propose to take.We shall need to consult them again once the Spanish reaction to the proposed exchange of notes is known, if the terms that H.M. Ambassador at Madrid thenfeels he can get are not acceptable to Gibraltar.S. L.A. L-B.13th July, 1959.DRAFT NOTE TO THE SPANISH MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSYour Excellency,With reference to the Exchange of Notes between your Excellency and myselfof to-day&apos;s date, which constitute an agreement for the abolition of visas between her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of Spain, Ihave the honour to confirm that it is recognised by the United KingdomGovernment that the Campo of Gibraltar, as at present established, has a specialmilitary character. It is therefore understood that, without prejudice to existinglocal facilities for entering the Campo area, persons coming from Gibraltar may notstay overnight in this area without special permission from the competent Spanishauthorities.2. At the same time, it is the understanding of the United KingdomGovernment that the Spanish Government will not restrict or limit the entry by landor sea from Gibraltar into Spain of holders of valid British passports issued in the territories covered by the visa-abolition agreement referred to above, or of holders of other valid passports, bearing any necessary visas, except in conformity withthe special arrangements referred to above concerning the military area of theCampo of Gibraltar.3. Similarly, it is the understanding of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that theSpanish Government will not limit or restrict the entry from Spain into Gibraltarby land or sea of British or foreign holders of valid passports, provided such persons,if resident in Spain, have complied with the necessary regulations.4. I have the honour further to propose that, if the proposals set out in this note are acceptable to the Spanish Government, this Note, together with yourExcellency&apos;s reply in that sense, should be regarded as constituting an agreementbetween the two Governments, which is supplemental to and an integral part of theagreement for the abolition of visas under reference and shall enter into force immediately.July 1959.
