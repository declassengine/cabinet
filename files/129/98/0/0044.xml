confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  August 1959C. (59) 144 Copy No. 3!12th August, 1959CABINETCOMMONWEALTH EDUCATION conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations attach a report on the Commonwealth Education Conference, held in Oxfordin July.2. The Conference was an outstanding success, and marked a positive and important step forward in Commonwealth collaboration.3. The Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme, which had already been accepted in principle at Montreal last year, has been established on a basis which should enable it to make the maximum contribution in the future to coherence and mutual understanding in the Commonwealth. It is in a sense the extension of the Rhodesconcept to the modern multiracial Commonwealth and its adaptation to thepostgraduate field.4. Even more important is the promise of progress in extending educationalhelp to the less advanced Commonwealth countries. So far this vitally importanttype of assistance has been almost entirely a charge on the United Kingdom. Asa result of this Conference other more advanced countries (not excluding Indiaand Pakistan) have not only come into the field with specific offers of help, but have accepted that mutual assistance in education is a Commonwealth responsibilityof first importance.5. The recommendations of this Conference must be followed up with energy,and the United Kingdom will have to give a lead. But I think it is fair to say thateducation has been established as the object of the same kind of close and continuous collaboration within the Commonwealth as already exists in, forexample, the fields of trade and finance and economic aid. The decision to hold afurther Education Conference in 1961 is an earnest of this intention.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,11th August, 1959.55663
....   ANNEXCOMMONWEALTH EDUCATION CONFERENCE, OXFORD15th TO 28th JULY, 1959Introduction1. The Commonwealth Education Conference was convened by the UnitedKingdom in accordance with a decision of Commonwealth Ministers at the Tradeand Economic Conference held at Montreal in September 1958.2. The Conference was attended by some 140 delegates from all commonwealth countries: attached to the United Kingdom delegation were 27representatives from 16 British Colonial territories.3. The Conference was opened at Rhodes House, Oxford, on 15th July underthe Presidency of Lord Halifax. The Chairman of the Conference wasSir Philip Morris, Vice-Chancellor of Bristol University.Objects of the Conference4. The objects of the Conference, as adopted at its opening Plenary Session,were the following: -(a) to work out arrangements for the scheme of Commonwealth scholarshipsand fellowships (which had been proposed at the Montreal Conference);(b) to review existing arrangements for co-operation between the countries ofthe Commonwealth in education generally, and to recommend in whatway those could be improved or expanded, particularly in regard to thesupply and training of teachers.Organisation and Recommendations of the conference.  The main- work of the Conference was undertaken in four Committees: -(a) Scholarships and Fellowships Scheme Committee;Chairman: Dr. O. F. Curtis (Canada).(b) Supply of Teachers Committee;Chairman: Professor K. O. Saiyidain (India).(c) Training of Teachers Committee;Chairman: Mr. E. E. Esua (Nigeria) and subsequently Mr. P. Wilson(United Kingdom).(d) Technical Education Committee;Chairman:&apos; Mr. H. B. Basten (Australia).6. Responsibility for the general progress of the Conference, and for thepreparation of its Report, was vested in a Steering Committee composed of headsof delegations and chairmen of Committees, under the Chairmanship ofSir Philip Morris.7. The main findings and recommendations of the Conference, may besummarised briefly as follows:  Scholarships and Fellowships(i) The Montreal Conference hoped that &quot; a few years after its inception &quot;the plan would cover 1,000 Commonwealth scholars and fellows. In factoffers of scholarships made at the Conference exceeded this total,.and furtherawards may be made. (Largest contributors: United Kingdom, 500; Canada,250; Australia, 100; India, 100.) &apos;(ii) The scholarships, which will be mainly post-graduate (but some ofwhich can be at under-graduate level where facilities for such training inparticular subjects are not available locally), are designed to recognise and promote the highest standards of intellectual achievement; while the needs ofthe less developed countries must be given careful attention in theadministration of the plan, the basis must be mutual co-operation and asharing of educational experience.(iii) A few Commonwealth Visiting Fellowships will be awarded to seniorscholars of established reputation and achievement.
Supply of Teachers(i) It was recognised that the need of the less developed countries for teachers, particularly in secondary and technical schools, was greater than could possibly be overcome by the secondment of teachers from the more highly developed countries. The emphasis must therefore be on the supplyof teachers for key posts, particularly in teacher-training institutions.(ii) To allow the secondment of teachers on a larger scale than is at present,,a practical proposition, teachers undertaking service abroad must be financiallyassisted, and the responsible authorities should be encouraged to ensure thatsuch service is regarded as an asset in a teacher&apos;s career and is not (as it oftenis at present) a disadvantage.(The United Kingdom proposals envisage the recruitment of anadditional 400 teachers for service overseas in the course of a few years, at a cost, in a full year, of some  700,000. Canada, Australia, India and Pakistanalso made offers of assistance.)Training of Teachers(i) The shortage of teachers, common to a greater or lesser extent to all commonwealth countries, can only be overcome in the long run by theindividual efforts of each country. On the other hand, carefully selectiveassistance given in the immediate future could be decisive in stimulating the required development. Most of the additional places offered to overseasstudents should therefore be used for specialist training at an advanced level.(ii) The teaching of English as a second language is of major importance,and its future development should be widely disseminated throughout theCommonwealth; the problems involved should be reviewed at a meeting of experts in the next year or so in Asia or Africa. (The United Kingdomoffered 500 additional teacher training places, at an annual cost of  250,000.Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India offered similar assistance.)Technical Education:(i) The pace of development of industry in all Commonwealth countries,but particularly in the less developed, has given.rise to an urgent demand fortechnically qualified people, and thus for an expansion of technical educationfacilities. More places should consequently be offered in universities and higher technological institutes for students from countries at present deficientin such facilities.,. (ii) Smaller Commonwealth countries might consider establishingregional technical teacher-training colleges on a co-operative basis.(hi) The supply of technical books and periodicals is inadequate andshould be improved. (The recent announcement by the United KingdomGovernment was welcomed.)(iv) Training in industry is essential for craftsmen and technicians.Industrial firms should be enco.uraged to offer training facilities for overseasstudents. (The United Kingdom offered 4,000 additional places in technical colleges over the next 10 years for students from overseas; it is hoped thatBritish industry may be able to offer increased facilities for training.)Future Action8. The Conference unanimously recommended that a further CommonwealthEducational Conference should be held in 1961. It was also recommended that, to supplement normal bilateral contacts between Commonwealth countries, some temporary machinery should be established to follow up the recommendations ofthe Conference, to act as a centre for the exchange of information and to preparematerial for the 1961 Conference which will review the future of this interimCommonwealth machinery.Finance. 9. The arrangements agreed at the Conference will involve new expenditure by Commonwealth Governments of at least  10 millions over the first five years.Of this amount, the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship plan will cost about half.10.  The United Kingdom share of the  10 millions will be  6 millions.
General Observations11. It would hardly be too much to say that most of the overseasDelegations arrived without having had much detailed briefing and therefore thatthe proposals that the United Kingdom had circulated became the basic papersfor the Conference. The attention of the Canadians was, in addition, at firstconcentrated wholly on the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme. However,exposure in committee to the frankly expressed views of other Delegations, coupled with the very precise offers of assistance which had been tabled in each committee by the United Kingdom, soon drew from the Canadian and from other commonwealth Delegations specific offers of assistance as well as generalexpressions of a readiness to help over as wide a field as possible.12. By the same token, the less developed countries were forced, by the hardfacts of the possible limits of assistance that they were likely to receive, to a more specific definition of the points at which assistance could be of the greatest value to them, both in the short and in the long run. Thus, the main emphasis of therecommendations on the supply and training of teachers, and on technical education, was on qualitative rather than on merely quantitative assistance.13. The proposal for a further Conference in 1961 was in itself a measureof the success of the Oxford Conference, since it showed that the Delegations had become convinced of the necessity of increased multilateral exchanges in the educational field and the consequent importance of not allowing the momentumgenerated by the Conference to be lost.14. The quality of the delegates was high and indeed was such as to ensurethat the recommendations of the Conference will be given serious attention in all commonwealth countries, both by Governments and by non-official educationalauthorities. The Delegations of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and pakistan all made effective contributions: of the smaller Commonwealth countries the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was perhaps the best representedalthough the West Indian representatives on the Colonial wing of the UnitedKingdom Delegation were also outstanding. Even the South African Delegation,which was purely official and which came with entirely negative instructions, wasshaken by the atmosphere of the Conference and has gone back to its Governmentwith recommendations that South Africa should at least offer some scholarships.15. The officials and non-officials on the United Kingdom Delegation workedtogether well as a team, and there can be no doubt of the value of the contributionmade by the non-officials, many of whom will be closely concerned with the implementation in the United Kingdom of the Conference^ recommendations.The effective chairmanship of Sir Philip Morris, and the selection in advance of theConference of Committee Chairmen, contributed greatly to the success of theConference.August 1959.
