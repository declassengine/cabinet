H.-0 *-ImENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;s GOVERNMENT)0.(59) 112 COPY NO.4th July, 1959CABINETAGRICULTURAL POLICY; WITHDRAWAL of marginal PRODUCTION GRANTSMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food in his paper (C.(59) 111) the Secretary of State for Scotlandproposes that he should make a statement in Parliament about thefuture of marginal agricultural production assistance in Scotland.This statement as now worded would create serious difficulty inEngland, Wales and Northern Ireland.2.        The statement leaves open the question of the date of termination of the scheme in Scotland.   While it does not contain any positive commitment to continue the scheme after 1962, I am convincedthat the reference to the review in the last paragraph will be generallyinterpreted as implying that further assistance may be given to somemarginal producers beyond 1962.3.        In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the marginal production schemes have already been brought to an end.   assistance is being continued to some former marginal producers in thesecountries through the Supplementary Scheme under the Agriculture(Small Farmers) Act.   But statutory authority for this expires in 1962.4.        The statement of the Secretary of State will make it clear thatmarginal producers in Scotland will be getting preferential treatmentat least up to 1962.   I think I can resist pressure for similar treatmentfrom those excluded in England and Wales so long as it is evident thatthere will be a limit to the period of preferential treatment.   But unless this is made clear I am sure that we shall not be able to maintain theposition.   As it is, strong representations are already being received in Northern Ireland from marginal producers who do not qualify underthe Supplementary Scheme.   Some 25,000 farmers who formerlyreceived marginal assistance in England, Wales and Northern Irelandhave now been deprived of it, and any reversal of this policy would inevitably be expensive.   In contrast, I understand that by 1962 only4,300 marginal producers in Scotland will still be receiving assistance,and of these nearly half will have non-viable farms and most of theremainder will have farm businesses above the maximum size for theSmall Farmer Scheme.5.        It is part of the Governments announced policy that theexisting marginal production schemes should be brought to an end in accordance with the principle of economic production rather than
maximum production at any cost. The Cabinet agreed on 10th Marchthat, although a more gradual withdrawal of assistance in scotland should be arranged, pressure for the indefinite continuation of marginal agricultural production assistance in that country must be resisted (C.C.(59) 15th Conclusions, Minute 4).6.        1 am convinced that we must adhere to this policy and 1 must ask my colleagues to agree to the insertion in the parliamentary statement of some form of words which will make it clear beyond doubtthat marginal agricultural production grants in Scotland will not go onafter 1962.   What 1 suggest is that the following sentence should beinserted at the beginning of paragraph 4:-&quot;The Government adheres to the view that the marginal production schemes as such shall be brought to an end. &quot;and that the word &quot;however&quot; should be inserted after the word&quot;scheme&quot; in the first line of paragraph 4.J.H.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S.W. 1.3rd July, 1959
