2o/7    ,hSECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE. PRQPERTY QF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted jor the Cabinet. July 1959C. (59) 128&apos; Copy No. jj&apos;2&quot;20th July, 1959CABINETUNITED STATES AND CANADAOUR INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTSNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will have seen the note by Sir Robert Hall, the EconomicAdviser to Her Majesty&apos;s Government, which I circulated to the Cabinet with my paper C. (59) 122. In the meantime the Economic Policy Committee have discussed the United Kingdom balance of payments prospects and the liberalisation ofimports.2. The balance of payments prospects are good and we seem likely to have a surplus on current account of about  400 millions in the year ending 30th June, 1960.This would follow a surplus of about  350 millions in the previous 12 months and a surplus of  450 millions for the calendar year 1958.3. With the balance of payments as strong as this we cannot possibly pleadbalance of payments difficulties as a reason for import restrictions, and our international obligations do not allow us to continue them for any other reason.Even more important, however, is that with the pound convertible on current account there is neither good sense nor justification in buying goods from germany which we are not prepared to buy from the United States, or from France whichwe will not buy from a member of the Commonwealth Canada.4. I have, therefore, reached the conclusion that we must dismantle our import restrictions as rapidly as possible and officials have been examining the implications of doing so. There is a relatively short list of items which would cause us a greatdeal of difficulty, but I think that we could expect other countries to tolerate the exemption of these items if we removed the rest of our restrictions as quickly aspossible.5. The way would then be clear for us to move from the post-war transitional provisions of the International Monetary Fund to its permanent provisions. Thiswill bring into use the stronger long-term rules which will help us to protect our ownexport markets against restrictions applied by others. I think it desirable, on political as well as economic grounds, to bring about a concerted move by as many countries as possible. We know that some European countries, notably Germany,would feel unable to delay their move beyond the spring, and it would be damaging to our prestige and to our currency if we lagged behind. At the Annual Meetingof the International Monetary Fund in September this question is bound to beprominent and I would like to fall in with the proposals which will then be made that the Executive Board should work out a programme for a concerted move duringthe first half of next year.6. In the meantime, the Economic Policy Committee have accepted the viewthat we ought to take a further step towards liberalisation of imports, but have some doubts about the timing. Our own economic interests certainly require thatwe should liberalise as widely as possible as soon as domestic circumstances allow.55527
7. As Sir Robert Hall has said in his note (which I circulated as C. (59) 122)there is great danger that, with a continuing balance of payments deficit, the UnitedStates Administration will come under heavy pressure to correct the position by increased protection and reduction in overseas lending. The lending might also be tied more directly to her own exports. All these courses would be extremelydamaging to our interests and to world trade. I should emphasise the fact that ourown favourable balance of payments position is to some extent a reflection of theliberal policies of the United States. Our interests will best be served by making it clear that the rest of the world is giving her every opportunity to correct herdisequilibrium by trade; we can do this by taking the lead in removing restrictionsagainst her imports.8. It is difficult to see how we can expect to continue to sell over  60 millionsworth of cars a year in North America when imports of cars from North Americaare restricted by quota to  .1 - 5 millions. The protests we make to the United Statesagainst her tariff-quota restriction of the import of woollen textiles (which are notdesignedly discriminatory against us though in practice they have this effect) ringhollow when the Americans can reply that, although we buy woollen textiles fromother countries, our market is closed to them entirely except for a quota of  1,500a year under the Token Import Scheme. It is really not possible on any grounds of logic to justify not according to Canada the same treatment for her exports offish as we accord not only to Norway, but also to Iceland, with whom our relations in respect of fish are far from friendly, and to Japan.9. I am sure therefore that we should make a further move in the reductionof restrictions and the removal of discrimination as quickly as possible and I wouldlike the agreement of my colleagues in principle to the announcement of a furtherlist of import relaxations some time during the Recess. It is for consideration whether such an announcement should be made during August or should awaitfurther examination by Ministers in the early part of September. But in view ofthe importance of strengthening the hands of those in America who wish to resist the protectionist lobbies, I think the sooner we can make the announcement the better. It is worth recalling that there was almost a complete absence of public criticism of the last announcement. I would aim at agreeing with those of mycolleagues who are concerned a short list of non-controversial items for thispurpose.10.  I therefore seek authority:  (a) To support at the Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund inSeptember proposals for the working out of arrangements for a move to the permanent provisions (Article VIII) during the early part of 1960.(b) To agree with my colleagues who are directly concerned a short list ofnon-controversial items for liberalisation, to be announced if possiblein the early part of the Recess and in any case not later thanmid-September. The sort of list I have in mind would add up to about 20 millions per annum, leaving about  60 millions of imports stillrestricted, apart from the hard-core items which are referred to inparagraph 4 above.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,17th July, 1959.
