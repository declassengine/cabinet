THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTANGLO-EGYPTIAN AGREEMENT, 1959INTERIM PAYMENT ORDER IN council memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs as my colleagues will recall, an Order in Council was made on 6th April, 1959,providing for the reception and assessment by the Foreign CompensationCommission of claims by persons whose property in Egypt had been&quot; Egyptianised &quot; or sequestrated. This Order did not authorise any payments tosuch persons. Since that date some 234 applications in respect of &quot; Egyptianised &quot;property have been received and on some of them the Commission is in factbeginning to reach the point at which partial payments could be made if authorised.In addition some 45 applications have been made in respect of sequestratedproperty, but no specific amounts have been claimed and the question of payments in these cases does not immediately arise.2. We cannot, of course, determine what should be the scale of finalcompensation until we have received and studied all the claims, but 1 am convincedthat we lay ourselves open to serious political criticism if we do not make arrangements for some form of interim payment to be made. This would, of course,require an Order in Council and, unless we take action before Parliament rises, wemay well find ourselves under fire with no further Parliamentary opportunity, andwith criticism raising the whole issue of Suez in the late summer and autumn.3. Politically, therefore, there are very compelling reasons for arranging for interim payments to be made in some form and to do so would be in keeping withour publicly stated intention of dealing generously with claimants.4. Such a decision would, of course, present certain difficulties, the chief ofwhich is how far it would be safe to go in making such payments in order not tocreate problems when we come to the final settlement. I have worked out a formula which is shown in the Annex to this paper. In arriving at the proposedscales, I have had in mind that it is the smaller claims which represent the greatesthardship, and that, even though we only have  27i millions without resorting to public funds, the final distribution, when we come to make it, will have to representa reasonably high proportion of the proved claims or it will be unacceptable to thegeneral public. Thus, to make interim payments on the basis I have suggestedwill not prejudice our eventual decision on final payments.5. I cannot at this stage accurately assess the cost of making interimpayments on the scales I have in mind on the Egyptianised claims which have sofar been presented, but if the claims on all such property registered by the ForeignOffice were admitted at their claimed value, the maximum possible cost of makinssuch interim payments would be about  4 millions.6. The sequestration cases are less easy to deal with since evidence of loss or damage is difficult to secure; yet they must clearly be covered in any interimpayments arrangements.  On the evidence available, I think it is safe to assumePrinted for the Cabinet. July 1959C. (59) 11510th July, 1959Copy No.   32CABINET55483
that claims for damage and loss will average less than 50 per cent, (we know thatsome of the largest concerns do not intend to present any claim at all). Interimpayments at the proposed rates on claims made on this basis for all sequestratedproperty registered by the Foreign Office would amount to a maximum possible of  9 millions though, in fact, no figures of amounts claimed have yet been presented.C* C 7. The highest figure that the interim payments could cost, therefore, isEstimated at  13 millions and even allowing 50 per cent, for errors in calculationthe figure would be well within the total of  274- millions available, and the probablecost very much less indeed. To be quite certain that we did not risk overshootingthe  274.- millions on a scheme for interim payments, we should have to wait untilat any rate the majority of the sequestrated claims had been evaluated. I am toldthis will take at least a year and I do not consider that a delay of this sort before we make any payment is politically acceptable.8. The other main problem about making interim payments is what to doabout the ex gratia loans which, in accordance with the Prime Ministers statement in the House of Commons on 16th March, have so far been left in abeyance. Totake them into consideration when making interim payments would mar the good effect of the payments themselves and, incidentally, to do so would createconsiderable administrative difficulties. I recommend, therefore, that they shouldcontinue to remain in abeyance until we come to decide how to make finalsettlements, except in those cases where the calculated interim payment plus theex gratia payment and any assets recovered would be more than the registered assets.9. If, as I hope, my colleagues share my view that interim payments shouldcommence, I will arrange for the necessary Order in Council, which is already indraft, to be completed immediately. To enable the Order to be laid before theParliamentary Recess, it will have to be considered by the Privy Council at its meeting on 28th July. A decision is therefore a matter of great urgency.&apos; - / ..s.:l/:.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,9th July, 1959.ANNEXCalculation of Sums for the Purposes of Article 2 (1)Where the amount of the loss assessed by the Commission under Article for Article 9 of the DeterminationOrder:  (1) does not exceed  5,000(2) exceeds  5,000 but does notexceed  10,000(3) exceeds  10,000 but does notexceed  25,000(4) exceeds  25,000        ......Sum Payable under Article 370 per cent, of the amount assessed 3,500, and 50 per cent, of the balanceof the amount assessed over  5,000 6,000, and 25 per cent, of the balanceof the amount assessed over  10,000 9,750, and 5 per cent, of the balance ofthe amount assessed over  25,000July, 1959.
