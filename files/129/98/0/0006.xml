confidential this DOCUMENT.IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. June 1959C. (59) 106 Copy No.     3223rd June, 1959  -CABINETRELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THEEUROPEAN ECONOMIC community memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe time is now approaching to establish formal diplomatic relations with theEuropean Economic Community (E.E.C.).2. At present, the United Kingdom has a diplomatic representative,Mr. A. H. Tandy, accredited to both the European Coal and Steel Community(E.C.S.C.) and the European Atomic Community (EURATOM). A member ofMr. Tandy&apos;s staff has special but informal responsibility for keeping in touch withthe Commission of the E.E.C. in Brussels.3. The reason for not establishing formal relations with the E.E.C. earlier wasthat the machinery envisaged for a European Free Trade Area (E.F.T.A.) wouldhave provided the means and determined the method of contact with the E.E.C.Since the breakdown in December 1958 of the negotiations for the creation of theE.F.T.A., there have been tactical reasons for delay.4. Nevertheless, in view of the economic impact on the United Kingdom ofthe trade and economic policies of the E.E.C., the establishment of formal relationswith the Community is inevitable sooner or later. The main arguments for establishing formal relations with the E.E.C. now are as follows. The absence ofsuch relations has not so far been interpreted by the Six as a manifestation of hostility. The accreditation of a representative now would not therefore amount toor appear to be an embarrassing volte-face on our part. It would, in fact, be anentirely neutral act if undertaken at this stage. It is, however, unlikely to remainso (a) if the Stockholm Group decide to go ahead with their plans for an &quot; outer &quot;Free Trade Area, the subsequent accreditation of representatives to theE.E.C. could be interpreted as a hostile act, underlining the separationbetween the Group and the E.E.C.;(b) if the Group do not reach a decision to go ahead with their plans, an approach to the Six after this has become known would be taken as a sign of weakness and submission to the necessity to cultivate the E.E.C.5. On the strength of these arguments I have come to the conclusion that her majesty&apos;s Government should now take steps to put their relations with the E.E.C.on a formal footing by accrediting a diplomatic representative. The delegations atpresent attending a meeting of the Stockholm Group agree and, with the exceptionof Denmark which already has formal relations with the E.E.C., have recommendedthat their Governments should take similar action.6. I have therefore instructed Mr. Tandy to make an informal approach to theSecretary-General of the Council of Ministers of the E.E.C. asking him to ascertain the views of the Governments of the Six on the establishment of formal relationsbetween the United Kingdom and the E.E.C. At the same time, Mr. Tandy will inform M. Rey, Director-General of External Affairs of the Commission, as amatter of courtesy of the action he is taking. If the response of the Governments55384
of the Six is favourable, the Community will be consulted about the procedure they wish us to adopt in accrediting a representative. My intention is that Mr. Tandyshould act in this capacity. The United Kingdom will then have a singlerepresentative accredited to the three Communities of the Six (E.E.C., EURATOMand E.C.S.C.).7. The Governments of the Commonwealth, the United States, the StockholmGroup and of the remaining members of the Organisation for European economic co-operation will be kept informed.8. Legislation will be required in due course to provide for appropriateprivileges and immunities for the E.E.C. representative in London. This will takethe form of a single Bill dealing with the privileges and immunities of therepresentatives in London of the three Communities.9. I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of theBoard of Trade, the Minister of Agriculture and the Paymaster-General agree withthis course.S.
