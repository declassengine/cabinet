Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1959C. (59) 129 Copy No.   3220th July, 1959CABINETDISTRIBUTION OF industry memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeSome of my colleagues, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister,discussed recently what should be our distribution of industry policy. We had before us a report prepared by officials at our request, and I am annexing a copyof it. I was invited to submit policy proposals.2. The first need is to clear up the present tangle, both of legislation and ofpolicy, by revoking the Distribution of Industry Acts, 1945-58, and bringing ina new Bill which would give us in one instrument the powers needed to deal withthis problem. We should also revoke the provision in the Town and country planning Acts about industrial development certificates (I.D.C&apos;s) and incorporateit in amended form in the new Bill.3. The Bill that I have in mind would get rid of the outmoded concept ofDevelopment Areas and provide that we could use the powers we take whereverin Great Britain they are needed.4. The qualification for places in the 1958 Act is that a high rate ofunemployment exists and is likely to persist. We should keep this definition butadd to it &quot; a clear and imminent threat&quot; of unemployment so that we can actwhen we see a crisis coming. We already take account of threatened unemploymentin the administration of I.D.C&apos;s.5. The Development Areas&apos; boundaries can be changed only by affirmative resolution and after consultation with local authorities. This is hampering and we thought that the list of places should be settled without Parliamentary sanction orconsultation with local authorities being required. Most of us thought that thisshould be done by the Board of Trade in close consultation with the Ministry ofLabour and National Service, though some of my colleagues saw advantage ininterposing an independent body.6. The Bill should reproduce the present power to build factories for sale or letting and extend it to commercial buildings; it would be exercisable in any placeon the list. The extension to commercial buildings should apply only wheresubstantial additional employment would be provided, e.g., an office block, orconceivably a big new hotel or a warehouse. We do not want to rebuild local shops,&amp;c, and the definition will have to be worked out with some care.7. We ought also to take the power as an alternative to building and lettingto make a capital grant equal to the subsidy element which the present method of fixing rents gives to our tenants. At present the capitalised value of the subsidyelement in the rent averages somewhere about 40 per cent, of the cost of the factorybuildings. The grant would not exceed the difference between what the Board ofTrade estimate is the reasonable cost of building a standard type of factory of the size required, without special features, and the current market value of such a building in the area, as determined by the District Valuer. This formula takes care of variations between one place and another in current market values and of changesTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT55528
over the years in building costs. The immediate value of the factory would be equalto the amount of its own money the firm had invested; only the difference between this and the building cost would have been provided by the grant. The firm wouldhave made a substantial investment in the area, but, on the other hand, it would havethe advantage of the capital gain if property values rose in the area. The initial costto the Exchequer would be substantially less than if we build the factory; and manother advantage would be the Government was not the landlord. The Chancellorof the Exchequer accepts the principle of this grant but thinks that the amountshould be scaled down.8. The report of officials proposed a power to make capital grants on outlayon plant and machinery in new enterprises at, say, 10 per cent. This would be anew power. On the one hand it would be new expenditure, though at  70- 100 ajob it would be very much less than the factory building cost. On the other hand it would be a powerful additional inducement to get firms to go to the right places,particularly if they could be got to go to existing empty factories for which otherwise there is no inducement. It might give rise to complaints from competitors of discrimination, though it is worth noting that there has been little complaint againstthe power of the Development Areas (Treasury Advisory) Committee (D.A.T.A.C.)to provide money or the capital grant system in Northern Ireland. The grant wouldnot be automatic, nor would it be given for ordinary replacement but only for expansion. It would be available only for new enterprises (which would includenew branch factories of existing firms) and major extensions. The additional employment would have to be substantial in relation to the size of the grant. Tothe extent that this additional grant induced more firms to expand in the rightplace it would, of course, increase the cost. I believe this would be justified for aperiod of years to try to break the back of the problem. The Chancellor does not feel able to accept the proposal for this additional grant-making power.9.  Officials also looked at the possibility of discriminatory tax concessionsbut the objections are overwhelming.10.   D.A.T.A.C. would still continue to provide financial assistance in the last resort subject to some modifications in its terms of reference.11. I should like to continue the power to deal with derelict sites in umemployment areas and extend it to cover sites which are not ownerless orabandoned. The aim would be to clear away the old industrial blight and make these places more attractive to new industry. On the other hand, there wouldbe an overlap with planning grant which has now been included in the general grant, and this will need further consideration.12. In recent years the Development Fund has been used--on a ratherstrained interpretation of the relevant statute to finance the building by non-profit-making organisations of factories for letting in certain rural areas. Thiswas because the Board of Trade had no power to act outside the development areas and there was no prospect of comprehensive new legislation. Now thatthere is that prospect, it seems clear that this untidy and anomalous arrangement should be terminated.13. We should keep the power to restrict industrial building by means ofindustrial development certificates and continue to use it toughly. At present this power is quite arbitrary, though its exercise has not given rise to complaint onthis score. There is a question whether the Board of Trade should be put underobligation to give reasons for their refusal of a certificate, or possibly there shouldbe some right of appeal.14. Getting away from the Development Area concept and building factorieswhere they are needed will make it necessary to get rid of the present EstateCompanies (one for each Development Area with local people as members anddirectors) and to reorganise the administrative machinery for building and managingBoard of Trade factories. The simplest way would be to create a new companytaking over the assets and the functions of the existing companies, but it wouldrequire the consent of the members and I do not think this could readily be obtained. AThe members represent many different interests, their political affinities are diverse, &quot;and many are elderly. I think, therefore, we shall have to provide in the Bill fora new statutory body taking over and managing the existing property and buildingnew factories under the policy direction of the Board of Trade.
15. The life of these powers might be limited, to, say, seven years. Thiswould compel the Government of the day to have a new look at the problemtowards the end of that period!16. The cost of these proposals cannot be estimated with any precision(because the main expenditure is on factory buildings and depends on the rate at which tenants can be found. Factory building now costs roughly between 700 and  1,000 per job but the rent brings a return over the years though less&apos;than the interest cost. The building grant proposed in paragraph 7 might costas much as  300 or  400 per job with no return. To bring the unemploymentrate in the old industrial areas (the Scottish Lowlands, Merseyside, &amp;c.) down tothe national average requires something like 80,000 jobs. Without the capitalgrant proposed in paragraph 8, however, I do not think we could attract enoughnew firms to provide jobs on this scale in the next few years. For the sake of comparison, the Board of Trade has spent on this service since the war  73 millions and the average in the last five years has been about  4 millions a year.17.  The following is a summary of the heads of the new Bill:  (i) Repeal of existing legislation, involving the Abolition of development areas (paragraph 3).(ii) Amendment  of  the   provisions   governing   Industrial   DevelopmentCertificates (paragraph 2).(iii) Addition of &quot; a clear and imminent threat&quot; of unemployment as anadditional criterion of eligibility for assistance (paragraph 4).(iv) List of places to be settled by the Board of Trade and Ministry of Labourand National Service without Parliamentary sanction (paragraph 5).(v) Powers to build factories for sale or letting to be extended to commercialbuildings if substantial additional employment will result (paragraph 6).(vi) Power to make a capital grant not exceeding the subsidy element in thepresent method of fixing rents (paragraph 7).(vii) Power to make 10 per cent, capital grants on outlay on plant and machinery in new enterprises (paragraph 8). (This proposal is not agreed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.)(viii) Some modifications in D.A.T.A.C.&apos;s terms of reference (paragraph 10).(ix) Extension of power to deal with derelict sites to cover sites which are notownerless or abandoned (paragraph 11).(x) Abolition of power to use Development Fund to finance the building of factories (paragraph 12).(xi) Abolition of present Estate Companies and reorganisation of administra-tive machinery for building and managing Board of Trade factories, i.e.,creation of a new statutory body (paragraph 14).(xii) Limitation of powers to seven years (paragraph 15).18.  I invite my colleagues (i) To say whether they accept the policy set out above.(ii) To agree that a Bill should be drafted incorporating these proposals.(iii) To decide whether the grant making power suggested in paragraph 8should be taken.D.

A Committee under Board of Trade chairmanship, consisting of officials from thersury,Inland Revenue,the&apos;Scottish Office,the Ministry of Labour,,the Ministry ofJjusing nnd Local Government and the Board of Trade, has been considering the issuesliaised in regard to distribution of industry policy in the minute of the PresidentWm the Board of Trade to the Lord Privy Seal of the 9th March, 1959? and thetconsents of his colleagues upon it.   Treasury and Inland Revenue officials haveIfeken a full share in the preparation of this Report, hut their Departments areIfii no way committed to any of the vie\?s expressed on matters involving expenditure and taxation.   By proceeding in this way we have been able to explore these central&quot;questions more fully and usefully than would otherwise have been possible,is,   The phrase &quot;distribution of industry policy&quot;, as used in this Report, means the policy of talcing work to the ?;orkers in parts of the country where unemploymentRs serious.   It does not cover town and country planning policies, though itiijnpinges  on them.   The objective of the policy is to secure, so far as isIracticable in the national interest, the provision of new industrial andommercial employment in areas of serious unemployment.   We have, therefore,iken our remit to be that we should examine how far the existing powers of theovernment are suitable and effective for encouraging the expansion of industryin the broadest sense) in these places and to consider how these powers mighte modified or extended in order to make them more effective.   The scale and character of local unemployment are described in some detail in Annex I.3-    Our review of the existing position has left us in no doubt that the present^arrangements, which have been built up over the years to meet changing circumstances,cave become unnecessarily complex and could be streamlined.   The existing powersand the differing, and sometimes overlapping, places in which they operate are described below.   In addition to this streamlining, we think that there are someinducements which, if available, might give greater encouragement to industry topove to or expand in places of serious unemployment.But while there are anomalies in the present arrangement much has beenchieved.   The scheme of assistance embodied in the Distribution of Industry Acts1945/1958* goes a good way beyond what was envisaged before the war for the Specialreas.   In particular the Board of Trade&apos;s factory building powers have had aKiese are:   (i)   Distribution &quot;of Industry Act, 194-5.(ii)   Distribution of Industry Act, 1950.(iii)   Distribution of Industry (industrial Finance)Act, 1958.1gHPORT OF AN INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON DISTRIBUTION OF INDUSTRY POLICYINTRODUCTION
very considerable impact on the Development Areas.   Since the war factories havebeen built by the Government in these areas at a cost of about  80 m. and directeaployment given in them for nearly 200,000 workers.   It is true that for mostof the time the tide has been flowing in the same direction.   In the early years,when there was a ready market for virtually everything that could be produced,industry&apos;s overriding concern was to get production facilities;   location and costwere secondary.   But nevertheless the Distribution of Industry Acts have undoubtedlyassisted towards equalising the level of unemployment over the country, even thoughprogress has been uneven.),   In recent years about l+Ofo of the unemployed have been in places where theemployment situation is clearly better than average and likely to remain so and afurther 25$ in areas where unemployment has been somewhat higher but not highenough to give cause for concern.   About 28$ live in areas where unemployment hasbeen high for an appreciable period;   each of these areas has a   pool of laboursufficient in numbers and quality for a reasonably wide range of new manufacturing industry.   Smaller places of persistently high unemployment, mainly rural and coastal areas, account between seasons for the remaining 6% or 7$ of totalunemployment and for a good deal more in January and less in July.6.   This distribution reflects changes in the problems in some parts of thecountry.   With the notable exceptions of Glasgow and Liverpool the large townsin the blighted areas whose problems gave rise to the pre-war legislation now haveor are in sight of attaining unemployment rates not greatly higher than thenational average.   On the other hand a number of smaller (though a few of the mare quite large) pockets of unemployment have emerged since the war and presentintractable problems.   In most of the smallest pockets the major difficulty isremoteness from distribution centres;   here it may be possible to mitigateunenploynent by trying to establish small scale new activities likely to be viable de-spite the secular trend,but in many cases a gradual loss of population is probablyinevitable in the long-term. In other new problem areas the cause is the decline of a---Jor industry (occasionally beoause of changeB in the Defence programme).   Neitherthese last places nor the substantial parts of the old Development Areas which&apos;till present a problem necessarily suffer from physical disadvantages so acutethat new industry, once it has been established there, is likely to be uneconomic;t-o aim in all these places is to get new industry to them to an extent which will&apos;-&quot; least stabilise their position.   2
I independent body appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for considering Plications under the Distribution of Industry Acts.-   The Treasury cannot act^cept on its recommendation.PRESEftlT POSITIONjyjstiJig Powersi    (a)   The Board of Trade have power to &quot;build factories in Development areas for rent or sale and to acquire land or premises for this purpose.(b) The Treasury have power on the advice of the Development Areas Treasury-Advisory Committee^ (D.A.T.A.C.) to make loans or annual grants to under-takings (industrial or non-industrial) in places of high and persistentunemployment and also to make loans or annual grants to industrial under-takings in Development Areas.(c) The Board of Trade have power to control industrial building by the refusal of an industrial development certificate which is a pre-conditionof obtaining planning permission.The above are the main powers for operating distribution of industry policy.There are also the following subsidiary powers:--(d) The Board of Trade have power to clear or to make grants for clearingderelict land in Development Areas in order to bring it into use or im-prove amenities of the neighbourhood.(e) Ministers have power to make grants for the provision of basic services in Development Areas.(f) The Board of Trade may make grants in exceptional circumstances inrespect of expenditure or loss directly incurred by industrial under-takings in establishing themselves in a Development Area.(g) The Ministry of Labour may make payments towards the cost of transferringkey workers to undertakings or branches established in Development Areas.(h) The Ministry of Labour may also provide or contribute towards the train-ing of workers for employment and their maintenance during training.(i) The Board of Trade may build houses as ancillary to their factory build-ing and may make grants or loans to housing associations for this purpose.(j) The Ministry of Housing and Local Government and the Department of health for Scotland have the power to pay subsidies on houses built by localauthorities for the accommodation of incoming key workers.The Development Fund, which&apos; is administered by the Treasury on the advice of the Development Commission, is available among other things for build-ing factories to relieve unemployment.yment or to prevent depopulation in rural areas.
gt   Great Britain may be classified for distribution of industry purposes in3ix categories :(a) Places which are both statutory Development Areas (that is, places includedin the schedules to the 1945 Act) and D.A.T.A.C. places (that is placesadministratively judged by the Board of Trade under the 1958 Act to beplaces of high and persistent unemployment).     In these the Governmentare exercising their power both to build factories and to grant financialassistance.     There is a further sub-division within this category in-as-much as there are a few places (e.g. Jarrow, Wrexham and Rhondda) in which,by administrative decision, the power to build factories is not beingexercised.(b) D.A.T.A.C. places which are not in Development Areas, and in which, there-fore j the only power is that to give financial assistance.(c) Development Areas which are not D.A.T.A.C. places.   In these both thefactory building and the financial assistance powers are available butneither is being exercised, except for necessary extensions to factories.(d) Places in which industrial development certificates will not normally be refused but in which there is no power either to build factories or grantfinancial assistance.   There are various refinements here, e.g. an industrial development certificate might be granted for Portsmouth to a london firm but not to a Midlands firm.   Again industrial developmentcertificates for a new town in the Home Counties would normally be grantedto a firm moving from London but not from elsewhere.(e) Places in which industrial development certificates for new projects will normally be refused.(f) Places in which the Development Fund may be available for factory building.5*   The distinction between 8(d) and 8(e) is on the whole readily understood and accepted.   But the overlap between Development Areas and D.A.T.A.C. places has given rise to a great deal of criticism and confusion.   This confusion is increased the unfortunate similarity of name of the Development Fund,t10, There is also some confusion arising from the necessity for firms wishing to ktilft or extend industrial premises to obtain both an industrial developmentcertificate from the Board of Trade and planning permission from the planning4
authority.   (The considerations which determine whether the certificate and the permission respectively should he granted differ.   Broadly the industrial- develop-nent certificate certifies that on economic grounds a project has a reasonableclaim to be located at X and planning permission accepts that the proposed use ofthe particular piece of land at X is appropriate in the local conditions.)Limitations of gxisting PowersAi   Factory Building(a) The power is limited to the scheduled Development Areas. Any amendment to,the schedule, whether to add to or to subtract from the places on it, requires(i) prior consultation with every local authority concerned, and (ii) an affirmative resolution of both Houses.   In these circumstances there are great difficultiesin making any change in the schedule and particularly in making any deletion.   a secondary effect is that the aggregate of the scheduled areas tends to increasetill it reaches a size at which it becomes impossible to help the worst placeswithout treating the others administratively as though they were descheduled.The schedule at present covers nearly 20% of the insured population of GreatBritain.(b) There is no power to build non-industrial premises, e.g. offices or hotels.12.   D.A.T.A.C. Assistance(a) Assistance is available only in places in which high unemployment exists.A threat of unenrploymont, however certain and imminent, e.g. an announcement    iof the forthcoming closure of a dockyard, does not make a place eligible unless and until unemployment has reached a high level.   Likewise a place is ineligibleif emigration from it alone avoids the existence of high unemployment.(b) An applicant for assistance must show that the result of his receiving itwill be to reduce unemployment from its present level.   It is not enough to showthat the result will be to maintain employment or to diminish an increase in umemployment that would otherwise take place.(c) The assistance must take the form of loans or of grants on an annual basis,,.U)  An applicant for assistance must show that he cannot obtain the capital)-required on the requisite terms elsewhere.   Thus firms with ample resources orgood credit, which are the ones most likely to give enduring employment, tend toruled out. c
13&apos;   Other Limitations(a) The power to clear derelict land is limited to Development Areas and legal advice is that derelict land means for this purpose land which is ownerless orabandoned.(b) Local authorities have no power to &quot;build factories in Development Areas inEngland or Wales, though they have in Scotland.(c) Industrial development certificates are not required for industrial buildions or extensions of less than ^,000 sq,ft. or for non-industrial-buildings.14,   We do not wish to imply that all these limitations are undesirable? still less that they can &quot;be removed without creating other greater difficulties.   Butwe have examined the existing position with the general aim of seeing what powers the Government need (whether they exist already or would have to be taken) to givea rational and effective scheme of inducements to industry to establish itself orexpand in places of high unemployment.05aNFIDE NTI^^Lo
Election of Places15,  The larger the area for which inducements are available the greater will bethe cost;   or alternatively, on the assumption that the total cost is limited or that the real limiting factor is the number of firms prepared to expand their capacity in the selected places, the less effective will the inducements be for creating employment in the worst hit of these places.     It is therefore important that the coverage should not be unduly wide.     At present the D.A.T.A.C. areascover 12$ of the insured population;   and pressure to add places will continue eventhough economy is now expanding.     In. this context it is relevant that many of theless prosperous areas are assisted economically and socially by other government policies and this to some extent has the effect of maintaining employment.     these policies are described in Annex II.15(a).   There is a difference between the large old industrial areas, likeClydeside and Merseyside, and the scattered smaller pockets of unemployment, manyof t/hich, round the coast, are not industrial in character.     There is also a difference in size of firm which will help these places.     But the addition of too many small places to the list, even though the statistical effect would not be significant, would make it more difficult to help those small places where thereis a serious problem.16. The Act of 1945 did not expressly define the criteria which resulted in the-selection of the Development Areas originally specified in the First Schedule tothe Act, but Section 7(2) provided that &quot;where at any time it appears to theBoard /of Trade/ that the distribution of industry is such that in any area notspecified in the First Schedule there is likely to be special danger of unemploy-nent, the Board may by order direct that the area shall be added to that Schedule&quot;.Thus an actual high level of unemployment was not statutorily required.     Thecondition was a danger of unemployment arising from or connected with the distri-bution of industry.places
But the White Paper of 1948 states that the principle guiding the Government wasthat &quot;to justify scheduling it must be shown that an area not only has a high rateof unemployment but that the numbers of unemployed are high in the aggregate&quot;.17, Under the 1958 Act the requirement is that the place is one &quot;in which in theopinion of the Board of Trade a high rate of unemployment exists and is likely to persist.&quot;   No reference to the distribution of industry nor to the number of thoseunemployed is imported.   The word &quot;place&quot; is generally interpreted as a travel to work area.18.  The yardstick used for determining whether high unemployment exists has sofar been a rate of 1$ wholly unemployed.   But it has always been recognised thata substantial change in the national average might necessitate a change in thisyardstick.   Because so many places with wide seasonal variation were on the firstlist persistence was established by the average of 2$ being taken over the previous12 months.   But it was recognised that in places where seasonal factors are notnarked this was too restrictive.   In the amendments this year these requirements have not been rigidly adhered to where there has been a knowledge of factorsivhich are expected to worsen the position or at least to make any improvement init unlikely.19.  This statutory requirement of high unemployment likely to persist, as. it hasbeen administratively interpreted, seems to have worked satisfactorily and we can see no better formula save possibly for the slight modification mentioned inParagraph 21..20.  We have considered whether a threat of high unemployment, as distinct fromactual high unemployment, should be sufficient to make the place eligible for inclusion.   This was considered when the Bill of 1958 was in preparation and ministers rejected the idea on the ground that the test it provided was toonebulous.   Any threat will give rise to fears and lead to pressures to take immediate action.   But experience has shown that discharges do not result in anything like acorresponding increase in the register of unemployed.   While the threat to employ-Q2nt can be clearly seen the threat of persistent unemployment is much more^retain.21. Nevertheless, we should.be in favour of an extension to take into account a clear threat of imminent unemployment expected to he persistent. If a largeemployer in an isolated place has announced the closure of the enterprise on a7
given date (e.g. the Admiralty of a dock or the National Coal Board of apit) it is hard to justify the refusal to offer inducements (which, if -accepted,would not be transformed into new jobs for a year or two) untilthe enterprise has actually been closed.   This extension would lead to agood deal of pressure but it is thought that it would not open the door toowide because the Board of Trade would have to be satisfied that the resultantunemployment would persist.22.   Town planning and slum clearance are leading to a dispersal of population from Liverpool and Glasgow which are areas of high unemployment (though thelatter is not on the list of places for which financial assistance is currentlyavailable).   The places to which the population is to go may not themselvesqualify but where there is an approved scheme of &quot;overspill&quot; it should bepossible to assist some of these places under the extension proposed in thepreceding paragraph,23.   We do not consider that the fact that an area is losing population toother parts of the country is of itself a ground for according to it thesame facilities as are accorded to areas suffering from serious unemployment.But there is a definite, though not invariable, connection between local employment difficulties and &quot;emigration&quot;.   For this reason, if the area alsosuffers from high unemployment the fact that there has been continuedemigration can properly be regarded as evidence of a lack of resilience inthe area and so of a probability that the high unemployment will persist.24.   Any policy designed to help the areas with most serious unemploymentmust be so devised that it covers only a small proportion of the insured population of the country.   The worst spots are almost by definition theleast attractive, and as soon as places which are suffering from unemployment,but less seriously so, are included the chances of helping the worst areasbecome diminished.   We have considered the possibility of safeguarding against this danger by including in any legislation a provision that the insured population of the places in which the inducements were available should notat any one time amount in total to more than a specified fraction of the insured population of Great Britain.    (The size of the fraction ^rould ofcourse have to be determined to some extent in the light of the inducementsoffered.)   Such a provision would both lessen pressures for additions (all8
the more necessary if threatened unemployment is to be a qualifying element)and, as the local situation changed, would force the deletion of some places in order to make room for others which had become more deserving, even thoughit could be said that the Government had not clone anything to improve their position and that unemployment was in fact rising in that place.25.   On the whole we think that a limitation of this kind would be a valuablesafeguard for Ministers and, though it would lead to controversy, would improve the working of the policy.One List or Two?26.   While it is agreed that there is no justification for two overlappinglists the question remains whether there should be a single list of places-for which all the inducements would be available or two or more lists, oneof places in which all the inducements would be available while in the otheror others only, some would be available.   The choice between a single list and two lists must be influenced by the nature of the inducements offered.The arguments against a single list are stronger in so far as the inducementsare automatic and less strong in so far as they are at the discretion of theGovernment.27.   The arguments against a single list ares-(a) Unless the proportion of the country to be covered is kept smaller than is likely to be politically practicable, we should be making available the full range of inducements to a large number of places inmany of which a more limited inducement might well be sufficient.   Weshould,therefore, be involved in more expensive forms of aid than mightnecessary.   Moreover, the availability of all the inducements in everyplaoe on the list would make it more difficult to persuade firms to set in the less attractive places.   As described in Annex II a good dealof indirect assistance from expenditure under other Government policiesis given to many of these places,(b) Factory building has so far been confined (with a few exceptions)to areas with a large industrial population and a good.spread of industThe Government&apos;s incursion into the property-owning business has thusbeen limited to a few more or less compact areas.   The existing D.A.T.Aareas are so widely scattered that they could not be grouped into fewer9
than 15 &quot;fcQ 20 separate units.   If Government factories are to be builtfor leasing in all these places the managerial problems would be such asthe existing estate companies are not set up to undertake.   Moreover, theGovernment will be taking the risk of finding itself the owner of emptyfactories in the remoter parts of the country where tenants are difficultto find.281 The arguments against having two (or more) lists ares-(a) There would be continuous pressures to get from the lower (in termsof inducements available) list to the higher, and it would never be practicable to demote a place from the higher to the lower.(b) It would be very hard to find a satisfactory basis of classification.If the distinction between the lists were based solely on the percentage ofunemployment there would be some very odd results.   On present percentagesthere could be faxtory building in Scarborough but not in Hull, in Penhancebut not in Plymouth, in Blackpool but not on Merseyside.   If it were based onthe percentage of unemployed plus an absolute number of unemployed (say 5*^00)all depends on the unit taken.   Travel to work areas vary widely.   In some places one or two hundred people represent a rate of 2$, and in the bigcities twenty or thirty thousand.   The boundaries are drawn in the light ofexisting local habits, which are liable to vary from time to time and, in thecase of extensive industrialised areas, are to some extent arbitrary in that two or three towns some miles apart draw their labour force from surroundingareas, the fringes of which overlap.   There would be continual pressure tolump together adjoining areas.A Statutory List?29&quot; The question also arises whether the list (or lists) should be statutory aswith the Development Areas or the subject of administrative decision as with theD.A.T.A.C. places.   It is relevant that the D.A.T.A.C. list has been extended three times this year and that some areas still not on the list have claims which arearguably at least as good as some of the places which have been added.   Even ifIjhe list is to be statutory it is for consideration whether the provisions in the1945 Act requiring affirmative resolution and prior consultation with localauthorities ought to be reproduced.   If they are, the extreme difficulty of setting places off the list will continue.10
30.     An alternative to leaving the selection in the hands of Ministers, orof Parliament, is to set up an independent advisory body to which proposalsfor additions and deletions would be referred and without whose authority nochange in the list could be made.     Such a body would have to be of thehighest standing, such that it would not be open to local pressures andthat its decisions would be acceptable to public opinion.powers31.   As stated above the three main powers which the Government at presenthave ares-(l) The negative power to refuse industrial development certificates.(2) The power to build factories for letting at favourable rents.(3) Certain powers to give financial assistance.32.   These powers and possible extensions to them are discussed in detailbelow.   They are not mutually exclusive.   For instance a firm can have a factory built for it and also have financial assistance for equipment or working capital.   The pov/er to refuse an industrial development certificateis at present complementary to the powers to give inducements^   if it were abandoned the inducements would have to be greater (and so potentially more expensive) than they are now.Industrial Development Certificates33*   An industrial development certificate by which the Board of Trade certifythat the proposed development is &quot;in accordance with the proper distributionof industry&quot; is needed before planning application can be made for factorybuildings or extensions over 5? 000 square feet in area.   The Act containsno guidance as to the interpretation of the phrase &quot;proper distribution ofindustry&quot;.   In practice, planning considerations proper such as amenities and land use have not been taken into account, and a broad balance has beenstruck between considerations of industrial growth and efficiency on the onehand and the state of local employment and industrial congestion on the other.34*   Each case presents its own peculiarities and the application of any policy requires a good deal of judgement.   Broadly, there is a choice between three policiess-(i) a &quot;tough&quot; policy11
(ii) a &quot;soft&quot; policy(iii) abolition of the industrial development certificateAt one extreme the toughest policy would involve refusing all applicationsfor industrial development certificates in congested areas and places with low unemployment.   At the other extreme industrial development certificateswould be granted in these places to every applicant making a bare declaration that he could not go elsewhere, and in all other places would be grantedautomatically.   But there are many cases in which refusal of the certificatewould be plainly unreasonable (e.g. a factory boiler house or a laundry),and on the other hand even a soft policy must pay s^ome regard to the merits of individual cases, &quot;A tough policy&quot;&apos;in, therefore,used to mean one tending tothe forme-.- direction,as at present,and &quot;a soft policy&quot; one tending to the latter.35*   A &quot;tough&quot; policy.   There is no doubt that readiness to refuse industrialdevelopment certificates in areas of high employment does do something tosteer industry to areas of high unemployment.   There are substantial areas inthe country where the unemployment prospects are not such that industrialdevelopment certificates can be refused and refusal in a &quot;congested&quot; areamay simply mean that the firm moves to one of these other places;   alternativelyit may be able to acquire an already existing, empty factory not in an unemploy-ment area.   But once a firm accepts that it has got to move, it may be willingto go the whole way to an unemployment area.   The recent big example is thePressed Steel 7/orks which was refused an industrial development certificateat Newbury and has gone to Swansea.   On the other hand,this policy cannothelp industrial expansion and may hinder it.   If the policy is acceptable to industry expansions will be planned accordingly;   if not, the expansion maybe delayed.   In a time of boom delay may be less acceptable to the firms but when the wisdom of early expansion is more debateable the stricter policyencourages ideas of postponement.   There is no evidence that firms have failed in an unemployment area who would have succeeded had they been allowedto expand in the place of their first choice,but&apos;it cannot be known whetherthey have expanded as rapidly as-they otherwise would have done.   Very littleindeed is known - though a good deal is confidently asserted - about theeffect of location on industrial growth and efficiency.   The economic pricepaid for a &quot;tough&quot; policy is therefore not measurable.   In the long run itnay or may not be substantial.12
)o...   A   &quot;soft&quot; policy.   The industrial development certificate system gives the Board of Trade an opportunity to put before every firm undertakingexpansion the inducements and advantages to he gained by moving to an unem-ployment area and to try to persuade it to go there.     This opportunity can beretained even if in the end a certificate is rarely or never refused to apersistent applicant.   Such a policy would certainly do less for the unemploy-ment areas than a &quot;tough&quot; policy,but it would also do less harm to industrialgrowth and efficiency - though the extent of the harm, as explained above,is unknown - and it would be more acceptable to industry.   In the extreme case, if it were not intended to do more than provide an opportunity forinformation and persuasion, it would be better to abandon the presentrequirement and substitute a procedure simply of prior notification of intention to the Board of Trade, giving the Board a fixed time in which toundertake its work of persuasion.37&apos;   Abolition of Industrial Development Certificates.   As an alternative to a&quot;soft&quot; policy it would he possible tc get rid of industrial developmentcertificates entirely and rely on the planning authorities to refuse consentfor expansion in the congested area.   The present system is not entirely satisfactory because the possession of an industrial development certificateenables the applicant planning expansion to claim to the planning authority that the Government has already approved his plans and if the authoritytakes the view that the firm can be moved to another area seme embarrassmentmay result.*   In some of the major conurbations the planning authority does infact do a good deal to check industrial expansion for its own reasons. But inother places the authority may have no reason for refusing planning permissioneven though employment is very high, as local opinion may well favour further expansion,    (The planning Ministers have power to call in cases but this power could only be used sparingly.) In any event refusal of planning permission of itself does nothing to steer to desirable places.   Largerinducements would seem to be the counterpart to this policy also to the &quot;soft&quot;policy.*If the industrial development certificate system is retained, the opportunityof legislation should be taken to alter the statutory formula;    the Board ofTrade might simply certify that they had no objection to the development.
38.   the choice for future policy seems to lie between(a)A &quot;tough&quot; policy, taking the view that for an area to be afflictedwith industrial stagnation and unemployment is plainly an evilwhereas the risks to expansion and efficiency are hypotheticaland unraeasureable - or if they can be established in a particular case then a certificate can be granted.   In areas of congestion and high employment however the onus would be very much on theindustrialist to prove that there would be some substantial and specific loss if he had to move,(b) A system of notification to the Board of Trade in order to giveopportunity for persuasion, coupled with reliance on the planning control to deal with the major areas of industrial congestion.From the point of view of assisting areas of unemployment the tough policyis more effective, particularly in times of boom.Factory Building39*   The Board of Trade&apos;s power to build factories in the Development areas for renting on favourable terms has undoubtedly been an effective means of stimulating new industry in these areas.   The provisions of the 1945 Acthave worked satisfactorily and we consider that they should be substantiallyreproduced in any new legislation.   The scope of operation of the power would of course be not the old Development Areas but whatever list (statutoryor administrative) of unemployment areas was considered appropriate.40.   We think that this power should be extended to non-industrial buildingse,g. office blocks or even hotels, where it could be established that theprovision of these would help to give a reasonable amount of additional employment.14
We have considered whether instead of fixing the rental on the basisof current market value we should recommend the adoption of the Northern Irelandpractice of a flat rental, say l/6d. per square foot.     Ministers rejected thisparticular possibility when they considered rental policy last February.Presentationally it is attractive.     But it is our experience that tenants are more attracted by the availability of rented premises than by &quot;the precise levelof rent, which is a small element in the cost of production.     Moreover, thesuggestion has serious disadvantages.     Apart from the cost - and it wouldsooner or later have to be extended to all existing tenants - it would deprive the remoter areas of the rental advantage which they at present enjoy by comparison with the nearer areas such as Merseyside, so that pressure would develop for even lower figures in some places.     With no objective standard to appeal to, it would be difficult to know where to stop.     Another difficulty isthe effect which such low rentals would have on the rateable value of the areas concerned.42.    The building and subsequent management of the Board of Trade&apos;s factoriesis at present in the hands of five Industrial Estate Companies, each operating in its own geographical area.     Annex III contains a discussion of the ways inwhich this machinery would need to be changed or adapted to meet the new situation.     Provision would have to be made for Carrying out any continuingobligations to the Board of Trade1s tenants in their factories in those parts ofthe Development Areas which were not put on the list of unemployment areas.Financial Assistance under Existing Powers43-    As explained in paragraphs 16 and 17 the relevant section of the Act of1945 does not import any unemployment test into the giving of financialassistance.     The Act of 1958, however, requires that financial assistance shouldbe given only where the Board of Trade are satisfied that it would be used fora purpose likely to reduce or contribute to a reduction in the rate ofunemployment in the locality.     On the whole, the 1958 test has been found to bea suitable one.^4-    There is however one possible modification.     The requirement that a project must be likely to reduce unemployment from what it now is precludesthe Board of Trade from approving a project designed to maintain employment.
rCONFIDENTIALFor instance a firm now employing 100 workers which asks for a loan tore-equip is not eligible for assistance if the result of equipment is that itf        employ 100 or less people more profitably, even where the firm could alsoshow that in default of equipment it would have to close down or reduce itslabour force to 50.     It is for consideration whether the Board of Trade shouldhave power to approve a project if it would reduce unemployment below the level at which it would be in default of financial assistance.45.    A project approved by the Board of Trade as likely to contribute to thereduction of unemployment in an appropriate place must then satisfy D.A.T.A.C.in accordance with Section 4 of the Act of 1945*(a) that it has good prospects of being successfully carried onwithout further assistance;(b) that without assistance the capital required cannot be obtained on the requisite terms.46.    The safeguard at (a) is not only necessary in order to avoid wasteful useof public money?   it also helps to ensure that Government finance will go onprojects which will make a permanent contribution to the relief of unemployment.If a firm sets up in a new place and provides jobs, but then goes out ofbusiness in a few years, the place itself, as well as the national economy andthe Exchequer, is likely on balance to be a loser.     We think it essential toretain this safeguard.hi&apos;    The purpose of the condition set out at (b), is to ensure that sound plans for development in areas of high and persistent unemployment should not be held up by lack of finances   Government assistance is not given automatically to any new development likely to create employment in such an area.     In assessingwhether this condition of the Section is met D.A.T.A.C. have regard not only tothe applicant&apos;s prospects of raising the finance required in the market, butalso to his own existing resources and liabilities and to the estimated capacityof the project for making profits.     On such tests it is likely that a companythat can raise capital at, say, 6fo at the present time, or which has ample cash$resources, would not be eligible for assistance under the Section for
a project that was likely to inako.reasonable profits,     if on the other hand, the project was bound to be uneconomic at first, theterms on which capital could be raised or employed might well be regarded aaunreasonable, taking into account all the circumstances of the undertaking;in such circumstances even a company with large resources might qualify forassistance in respect of a new development.   If, even with Treasuryassistance, the project was likely to continue to be uneconomic, e.g.because of its remote situation, the application would be unlikely tosatisfy condition (a).   It follows that the Section does not offer a directinducement to an undertaking to move to an unemployment area, but ensures only that the undertaking is not prevented from developing there solely by inability to raise capital on reasonable terms from normal commercial sources.48.   It is essential to maintain the principle that the Government is the lender of last resort.   The cost to the Exchequer would be greatly increased if every applicant had the option to borrow from it, on more attractive terms,instead of from commercial lenders.   Moreover, it would be wrong in principle to compete with the banks and other financial institutions in their properfunction of lending for this kind of purpose.49&quot;   Under present powers we see no escape in the majority.of cases from the dilemma that the sounder the firm is. the less is the likelihood of its being able to show that it cannot finance its development.   If, however,powers were available to give assistance for a maximum of, say, five years to enable the firm to be as successful in the unemploynent area as it wouldbe elsewhere a number of firms might be encouraged to develop in those areas.The assessment of the difference between their likely profitability in thetwo places would present great difficulties and require judgement to be taken on very speculative material.   The case would be still more speculative ifthe firm were anyhow setting up in a new place so that the choice was only be between a place of high unemployment and a new place which did not rank for financial assistance.     Nevertheless if the body which examined applicationsfor assistance were enabled to take these matters into account wc believe thata number of the cases now rejected by D.A.T.A.C. would be susceptible of somesatisfactory arrangement and, more important, that more large and successfulbusinesses could be induced to go to places in need of help.   On the other17
hand the tests which the applicant would have to pass and the forecasts hewould have to produce would he burdensome to him and would then requireclose scrutiny;   the processing of each case would inevitably be prolonged and the delay give rise to public criticism..   In short, while, it would be an inducement, it would be less of one then the others discussed below.50,   Branch factory grants.   A power to make removal grants exists but it ishedged round with qualifications which have hitherto prevented its effective use.   ViThere a firm is willing to set up a separate plant in an area of high unemployment while retaining its existing plant in other parts of thecountry it may be faced with additional capital costs from duplication of plant or the like.   A power to make grants offsetting removal costs of this type would be a useful inducement in a small number of important cases.18
NEW FORMS OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE51.   The preceding paragraphs have discussed the scope of the existing powersBut experience since the 1958 Act came into force has been that&apos;so far onlyfifty-five firms - and those nearly all small local firos wishing to &quot;expend *&quot;have been able to satisfy the conditions of the Let.   The minor modificationsuggested above would make little difference.    We have therefore considered whether financial assistance could be provided on an altogether different basis.52.   We discuss below four new forms which financial assistance to firms in umemployment areas might take.   They ares(i) Grants to assist towards the cost of factory building (paragraphs53-58).(ii) Grants to assist towards new capital expenditure on plant and machinery (paragraph 59)&apos;(iii) Tax concessions (paragraphs 60-63), or alternatively,(iv) Automatic capital grants (paragraphs 6I+-66).The first two of these are selective in the sense that the assistance would not be given as of right to all firms in the area but would be avail-able at the Government&apos;s discretion to firms which satisfied whatevercriteria were laid down.   The first is a logical extension of existing powersdesigned to put firms building their own factories in much the .same positionas those renting Board of Trade factories.   The second is also an extensionof existing powers, designed to assist firms with other capital expenditure but on a less restrictive basis than at present.   The third and fourth formsof assistance, on the other hand, go much wider;   they would be automaticallyavailable to all businesses in unemployment areas whether or not they wereproviding additional employment*Assistance for Buildings53-   An anomaly in the existing arrangements is the difference in value tothe recipient between the assistance towards the building of his- own factory and the provision of a Board of Trade factory.     A Board of Tradefactory is let at a rent which is negotiated by the District Valuer with thetenant on the &quot;basis of current market rental values for comparable property19
in the locality.     The average of these rents is about 2/9d. per square footin the places where new building is being done but this average conceals a fairly wide range.     This is a little over half the amount which would berequired to give an economic return to the Government on the capital costof building (about 4/9d. per square foot).     D.A.T.A.C. loans are currently-granted at 5% which, taking into account the obligation on the private ownerto maintain his factory and allow for depreciation on it, oannot give him the equivalent of a factory rented at current market value.     If the places for which factory building is available are to be the same as those for which grants are available, it is clearly desirable that the benefits should be of equal value, or at least it is undesirable that those accruing from the possession of a Government-owned factory should be greater.54*   This anomaly would be removed if firms building their own factories in umemployment areas were enabled to obtain a grant equivalent to thecapitalisation of the rent subsidy on Board of Trade factories in the samelocality.   For instance, if the cost of the factory were  100,000 and thevalue of the factory when built, according to the District Valuer&apos;svaluation, would be  60,000, a grant of  40,000 would put the firm in much the same position as if it were renting the factory from the Board of Trade.55*   The grant would have to-be an initial capital grant rather on the linesof the facility in northern Ireland under the Industries Development Act,1945*   Annual grants of (on the above illustration) 40% of the cost of borrowing would not meet the case because the firm would not be able to borrow  100,000 on the security of a building saleable at only  60,000,The grants would tend to be a higher proportion of the cost in places wherethe current market value was lower, but by and large those are the placesto which it is most important to steer industry.56.   We consider that the facility of a grant of this kind, as an alternative to a Board of Trade factory, would be a valuable inducement.   Some firmsnot wishing to become Government tenants would be attracted.   It would bepossible to assist firms already in that area to expand, thus incidentallyavoiding local friction which arises occasionally.   The ownership of the freehold would in some circumstances be advantageous, there would be an20
incentive to develop the property and the area generally and, if the areabecame prosperous and the value of property in it rose, the firm would makea capital gain.57,   There would also have to be safeguards.     First the cost could be based onthat of a standard factory of the kind and size required:   frills would be forthe account of the firm.     Secondly there would have to be provision forrecovery if the factory were disposed of in the early years.58.   To the extent that firms opted to go for the grant for building their ownfactory, the amount of property owned by the Government up and down the country would be diminished. &quot;   Indeed, if in the remoter places the Government were tomake the grant the only facility on offer they would avoid the danger of findingthemselves the owners of white elephants scattered round the coastline.     Theadministration of such a scheme would most naturally be put with the Board ofTrade since it is 30 closely linked with their factory building, subject to reference to the Treasury on each case as there is with factory building.     Thefacility could be extended to commercial buildings, though these might find it more difficult to satisfy the Board of Trade that the employment thoy v.:ouldprovide (and continue to provide over a long period) was commensurate with thegrant.Selective Capital Grants59.   On the lines of the Northern Ireland practice it would be possible to take power to make capital grants to firms setting up a new enterprise in an area of high unemployment;   they could conveniently be calculated by reference to thecost of the depreciable assets for Inland Eevcnue purposes.     The grants, at say10/&amp; of this capital outlay excluding outlay on buildings assisted as proposed inparagraphs 53-58, would bo available to firms already in the area.     This would cover plant and machinery but would not apply to replacement of or minor additions to the capital stock.     (Capital assistance to existing enterprises would stillbe available under the D.A.T.A.C. machinery.)    The firm would have to showthat additional jobs would be created on a reasonable scale and othercriteria would need to be worked out.     This facility would replace the branchfactory grants and much of D.A.T.A.0 Ts lending.     It would be much widerin scope and it could be more effective,     Enough money would have to beprovided to enable assistance to be given to all those who satisfied whatever
tests were laid down.   It would not be practicable to limit the expenditurearbitrarily since all applications would have to be treated on a uniformbasis.   Control of expenditure could, therefore, only be exercised bystiffening the tests - an awkward operation unless unemployment were falling.Tax Concessions60.   Appropriate discriminatory income tax concessions in favour of firms in areas of high unemployment would encourage industrial development inthose areas.   Without having made any close calculation either of the costto the Exchequer or of the benefit (in terms of the proportion of his fixedcosts) to the individual, we have had in mind that the sort of concessions which might be offered is an increase in the investment allowances on buildings and on plant and machinery from the current rates of 10% and 20%respectively to rates of 20% and 30% respectively, the initial allowances of 5% and 10% respectively remaining unchanged.   The annual cost of such a concesjsion if it covered about a fifth of the insured population might be of theorder of  10 m. without allowing for any industrial expansion.   Vehiclesshould be excluded because they could so easily be used to operate outsidethe area and their inclusion would lead to hopelessly difficult problems in framing and administering anti-avoidance provisions.61.   If it is accepted that there are certain areas with long-standingeconomic and social problems different from those in other parts of thecountry, a tax concession of this kind would recognise this   it would assist all business activity in these areas without regard to the effect ofthe capital investment on employment in the area.62.   Other arguments for a tax concession&apos;of this kind ares-(a) Industry would become immediately and continuously aware of it.Its influence in steering firms to the favoured places would thus be working automatically and would not be dependent, as the otherinducements are, on the Government becoming aware at the crucialtime, of the plans of individual firms.    (The industrial developmentcertificate requirement does not always necessarily do this).(b) The benefits would be substantial and the beneficiary v/ould be ableto judge how much he was going to get?   long negotiations with government Departments would not be needed,22
(c) The attraction waild bite not only on those directors who are willingto plan the company&apos;s future development on the broadest considera-tions (including labour supply) but also on the finance directorwhose advice must normally be based on the company&apos;s duty to look after the shorter-term interests of the shareholders.(d) Many of the minor inducements described in this Report would becomesuperfluous.   A firm which saw its way to going to a favoured place and getting the tax advantage would not be likely to boggle athelping its key workers with housing.   Indeed, experience mightwell show that the industrial development certificate control was unnecessary.   YJhile the general principle must be that theindividual firm is the best judge of where it can most profitablyexpand, it is sometimes found in practice that firms choose alocation for rather arbitrary and extraneous reasons.   But if a firm decided against going to a favoured place notwithstanding the tax advantage ex-hypothesi available in it, there would bo a strongpresumption that it had good commercial reasons for its decision.The arguments against a tax concession ares-(a) To grant tax concessions on a geographical basis would introduce anew and dangerous breach in the principle that all tax payersshould be treated alike.      There is already a measureof discrimination in the capital allowances system between broadclasses of readily definable assets, and discrimination of this nature has been extended to confer a special benefit onnthe shipping industry (but no other one industry) in recognition of that industry&apos;svery special circumstances.   Discrimination has not yet gone to thelength of taxing one man at different rates from his competitors.   Itis one thing to tax a chemical firm in Plymouth less favourably thana ship-owner in the same city?   it is another to tax the Plymouthchemical firm more favourably than its competitor in Exeter.23
(b) The taxing machinery works because it is generally accepted and would break down if it were widely regarded as unfair.   Any -breach in the principle of equality between equals lessens theacceptance of the system, the more so if the inequality appearsunfair.   A good deal of criticism from firms outside the favouredplaces would have to be expected.(c) The value to a trader of a scheme of investment allowances depends on the extent to which he makes profits to absorb the relief, therate of tax at which any profits are chargeable, the proportionof the total capital expenditure on a new project which is attributable to qualifying assets and (so far as a permanent schemeis concerned) the frequency with which the assets are likely to be scrapped.   Thus for any given capital outlay on a new project,different concerns are likely to derive widely varying benefits from the investment   allowances, and this variation in benefit willhave no necessary relation to the contribution of the projecttowards reducing unemployment in the area.   Also, for these reasons,and because there is a lag between the time when the expenditure is incurred and the benefits are realised, which may be an important factor where there is difficulty in obtaining finance, it must bea matter of conjecture how widely the suggested taxation concessionswould operate towards inducing expansion in the area.(d) Whether effective or not the concession would be expensive.   it takes the form of a grant, i.e. it is not eventually recovered as areD.A.T.A. C. loans or represented by a saleable asset as is part of thecost of Government factory building.   Moreover, most of the cost would be on replacement and would, therefore, have no direct impact on the overriding object of creating new employment.   In other words, the concession would cost some  10 m. a year if it were completely ineffective?   the Government would get additional employment in exchange for its contribution only to the extent thatthe annual cost exceeded this figure.   Furthermore, allowances ata level to attract those who get the least relative benefit from them would be unnecessarily extravagant in relation to those whoget the most relative benefit.24CONFIDENTIAL
(e) The fact that the concession would he provided for in the annualFinance Bill would subject the Government to annual pressures to add more places.(f) It would he very difficult to withdraw the tax concession from anyplace, even in conditions of the fullest employment, because itwould be said that the fall in unemployment at that place wasonly temporary.(g) Investment allowances have been and are being used as an economicregulator;   a discriminatory concession would either have to be withdrawn to meet the general needs of the economy irrespective oflocal unemployment, or have to he retained permanently with a weakening of the efficacy of the regulatory instrument.(h) In default of fairly elaborate provisions against avoidance the concession would be open to abuse by the owner of the assetdisposing of it second-hand to a person outside the favoured area.(i) The boundaries of the favoured areas would be difficult to draw,It would be manifestly objectionable to keep to the existingD.A.T.A.C. areas with their often narrowly drawn limits.   E.g, itwould be difficult to justify taxing firms situated round the norfolk coast at one level and in Norwich at another.   On the otherhand there are difficulties in aggregating the D.A.T.A.C, placesinto a few large units.   Some areas, e.g. Devon and Cornwall, mightbe formed into a single unit but then the benefits would be goingto places of low unemployment like Exeter.   If Scotland were taken as a single unit a firm in Edinburgh would enjoy the same advantagesas one in Dundee and this would make steering to Dundee virtuallyimpracticable.   There may he broad social and economic arguments for encouraging industry in, say, Scotland, Wales, the South West, andpossibly the Northern Counties of England, but these go wider than the problem we are studying. In short, it would bedifficult to escape from the dilemma of either including a largenumber of places with low unemployment and extending the concession(at much greater expense) over a large proportion of Great Britain_rONFIDENTlAL_
on the one hand, or on the other hand operating the concessionover a large number of small and arbitrarily defined places,with manifest unfairness to a firm just outside the boundary.Automatic Capital Grants6Zf.   An alternative to a tax concession is to give automatically a capitalgrant equivalent to the investment allowance discussed above to every firmin or coming into the area.   The cost would he about the same, or slightly higher, because the benefit would be uniform irrespective of the profit andtax position of the recipient (it would be made equal to the benefit the allowance would give to a company paying tax at the average rate and havingadequate profits.)65.   The arguments set out in paragraph 62 in favour of a tax concessionapply also to an automatic capital grant.   In addition a grant would provideworking capital earlier.   Of the arguments against a tax concession, those set out in sub-paragraphs (b) (c) and (e) of paragraph 63 would not apply toa grant and that in sub-paragraph (a) would be weakened.   The remainingarguments against a tax concession would however apply to substantially the same extent also to an automatic grant.     In addition a new administra-tive machine would be required for making such grants.MINOR MATTERSClearance of derelict land66.   Under the Act of 1945 the Board of Trade have power to clear or make grants for clearing derelict land in Development Areas in order to bring it into use or improve the amenities.   But the legal interpretation of &quot;derelict&quot;as meaning abandoned or ownerless has limited the usefulness of the power.Since specific grants are no longer available to local authorities under other legislation for clearing sites we think that the Board of Trade should retain the existing powers and that the condition that the land must be ownerless orabandoned should be so relaxed as to make the power exercisable where theowner of the land is not putting it to any use and is not likely to do so inthe foreseeable future.67.   On the other hand, we think that the power might well be restricted toblighted tracts of land where the removal of eyesores would improve the prospodts oj26
industrial development.   This kind of limitation on the power would notrule out grants to local authorities for the clearance of sites for amenity-purposes provided that the Board of Trade was satisfied that the proposedamenity, as well as the removal of the eyesore, would he a factor influencingindustrial development.Factory Building by Local Authorities68.   At present, local authorities in England and Wales have a power underthe Planning Acts to build factories but only where no other statutory powerto build factories exists - so that they cannot build in the development areas.   We think that this restriction might be removed,    (it does not exist in Scotland.)69.   There are difficulties about subsidising local authorities for thisparticular purpose, either by special interest rates or by grants5   and since local authorities would therefore have to charge an economic rent, itis unlikely that they would build on such a scale as to make a major contri-bution towards the relief of unemployment.   The power would in practice beused mainly for planning purposes, for example to relocate a factory in thecourse of replanning an area or carrying out an overspill scheme.   Butoccasionally there might be circumstances in which it might be useful forthe relief of unemployment for the local authority to have this power;   andwe suggest that the law should be amended accordingly.Grants in Aid of Basic Services70, Under section 3 of the 1945 Act, contributions can be made to the costof providing basic services in development areas. Water supply and sewerageare virtually the only services which have been assisted in this way. Manyschemes were grant-aided up to 1952, but in that year it was decided as an economy measure that no new applications could be entertained save in casesof exceptional industrial urgency (a test under which only one major schemequalified).71.   The Ministry of Housing and Local Government circular 22/59 of12th March, 1959j and the corresponding circular issued by the Department ofHealth for Scotland stated that applications could again be entertained -from areas which were both development areas and   areas of high unemploymentin respect of particular industrial projects and also in respect of proposals27
to improve tlie general standard of water and sewerage services in the area.Applications have since been received from twenty-one authorities inEngland and Wales, and from nineteen authorities in Scotland.72.   We think that similar powers at any rate for water and sewerage shouldbe taken in any new legislation;   it is not likely that there would be much-call for heavy expenditure under this head (it might be proportionatelyhigher in Scotland).Extension of Industrial Development Certificates73*   As explained above, industrial development certificates are notrequired for s(a) buildings (including extensions) not exceeding 5*000 sq.ft.(b) non-industrial buildings.74*   As to (a) no doubt a certain number of small buildings are erectedwhich need not have been located in the area, and no doubt a small proportionof these result in an increase of employment.   We are satisfied, however,that the removal of this exemption would create administrative work altogetherdisproportionate to any saving in additional jobs that it would make possible.75*   As to (b) there exists no material on which Government departments could judge, in most cases, whether the building proposed was necessary ornot.   It may be that over a period a fund of experience could be built upbut it is very doubtful whether the Government would over know enough to makethe control of real value.   Office buildings, which appear the most flagrantcase of unnecessary building in congested areas, are often put upspeculatively, the eventual occupiers being unknown.   In any event theseeventual occupiers will very often be firms housed less conveniently in thesame place, so that no additional employment results from allowing them totransfer to new premises.   Moreover, as office use is much more mobile thanindustrial use, any control based on the character of the tenants&apos; occupationwould require a new and elaborate system of enforcement.   These objections,added to the difficulty of definition and to the fact that, in London atleast, so much office building has already been completed or received planning permission, force us to the conclusion that industrial development certificatecontrol would not achieve enough to make it worth while.
76.   To help to attract new industries to areas of high unemployment itKay be necessary to make houses available for &quot;key workers&quot;.   To some extent,this need might be met by the provision of privately built houses for salebut the main demand is likely to be for rented accommodation.   To meet this demand it will be necessary to look to the local authorities.   (The extentto which firms setting up in the areas are likely to be prepared to establishhousing associations for this purpose is, for various reasons, very limited).77.   If the local authorities are to be persuaded to build houses for keyworkers, some form of financial assistance would undoubtedly be necessary.The Ministry of Housing and Local Government has power under section3(2)(d) of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1953* ^Q pay  a subsidy of  24 a year for 60 years on houses built by local authorities &quot;for the accommodation of persons coming from outside the area of that authority inorder to meet the urgent needs of industry where the dwelling has been soprovided in accordance with arrangements approved by the Minister as beingdesirable by reason of special circumstances.&quot;78.   These powers are probably wide enough to enable this subsidy to beused to encourage local authorities to provide houses for key workers in umemployment areas.   The subsidy was, however, introduced as an exceptionalexpedient to help the coal industry and although the application of thesubsidy was later extended, it has been administered on a narrowly definedbasis.   Under present policy the subsidy is paid only -(i) where at least 50 houses have to be provided?(ii) where a large new factory or large extension of a factory is being established;   and(iii) where the work being undertaken by the factory is of really major importance.Furthermore, there is Ministerial agreement that this subsidy should be abolished (it can be done by Order) as soon as it is considered expedient todo so.   If the use of this particular subsidy were tc be extended therewould be a danger of its becoming a general subsidy for housing - industrial workers,29
79.   In Scotland the Secretary of State has power under Section 2(2)(b)of the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act, 1957 to pay a subsidy of  30 a year for 60 years for houses built for persons coming into an area &apos; to meet the urgent needs of industry&apos;.     However, as there is stilla basic subsidy of - 24 a year for 60 years in Scotland for local authority housing the  30 subsidy is relatively less attractive to Scottish localauthorities than the  24 English subsidy is to English authorities.     More-over, it is administered on just as narrow a basis as the English subsidy.As a result, little use has so far been made of it.     Unlike the Englishsubsidy the Scottish subsidy cannot be abolished except by fresh legislation,80.   In the light of these considerations, we think that there is much tobe said for taking a new power for the special purpose of subsidising theprovision by local authorities in unemployment areas of houses for keyworkers.CONCLUSIONS81.   This report will have shown that in our view the present legislationinvolves untidiness and confusion and in particular gives Ministers noescape from the dilemma that on the one hand the scheduled Development Areasinclude areas no longer in need of help and on the other hand the de-scheduling of these prosperous areas has proved politically impossible.   Weare agreed also that, within the existing legislative framework, there is little more that can be done to speed the process of getting industry toplaces of serious unemployment.     For one or both of these reasons we are agreed that it is desirable to repeal the Distribution of Industry Acts andreplace them with new legislation.    Additional powers would give the bestresults if taken and applied in a period of industrial expansion.. 82.    Places eligible for assistance(1)   The criterion in the 1958 Act, namely high and persistent unemploy-ment, should be retained but we think that a clear and imminent threat of high and persistent unemployment should also be a relevant factor (paragraph21).(2)   There should be some obligation to keep the coverage of the listwithin bounds.     A statutory limitation of the proportion of the country atany one time eligible for assistance would be a useful safeguard againstpressures (paragraph 24).30CONFIDENTIAL
(3)   We express no view whether the places eligible should be.,statutorily named or subject to administrative decision.     If they arestatutory we think that the list and any amendments to it should besubject to negative resolution only and that prior consultation with local authorities should not be required (paragraph 29).(4)   The establishment of an independent advisory body has a numberof advantages and is worth serious consideration (paragraph 30),83.   Existing Powers(1)   We think that the present factory building power should beretained in substantially its present form but extended to non-industrial building (paragraphs 39 and 40).(2)   We think that the present power to grant financial assistance should be retained subject to three qualifications:(i)   There should be a specific power to make once-for-allgrants.(ii)   Assistance should be available for maintaining employment as well as reducing unemployment (paragraph 44).(iii)   The phrase &quot;requisite terms&quot; should be amended if theinducements described in paragraph 85 below are not given(paragraph 49).(3)   Whether control by industrial development certificates needs to be retained for employment purposes depends on whether-additional powers of the kind described in paragraph 85 below are taken and on.thejudgaent.made as to their efficacy.     So long as it is retained itshould be operated toughly (paragraphs 34 and 38).(4)   We think that there should be a power to make transfer grants to firms setting up branch factories in areas of high unemployment,designed to offset their additional costs arising from duplication of plant, etc. (paragraph 50).(5)   The power to make grants for clearing derelict land should beretained but its exercise confined to blighted tracts of land;   thelimitation that the land must be abandoned.or ownerless should be relaxed(paragraphs 66 and 67).31
(6)   There should be a specific power to subsidise the provision by localauthorities in unemployment areas of houses for key workers (paragraph 80).(7)   The restriction on local authorities1 factory building in England andWales should be removed (paragraph 68).(8)   The powers described in sub-paragraphs (e), (g), (h), (i), and (k) ofparagraph 7 should be retained.Further Powers84,    We think that there should be a power to make capital grants available to firms building or extending their own factories (or non-industrial buildings) in areas of high unemployment, designed to put them in much the same position astenants of Board of Trade factories, so far as building costs are concerned(paragraphs 53 - 58).85.    To go further involves a choice between?-(a) The power to make capital grants to firms setting up or expandingin areas of high unemployment equivalent to a percentage of their capital outlay other than that assisted under paragraph 84(b) A tax concession for all firms in areas of high unemployment onthe lines indicated in paragraphs 60 - 63).(c) Automatic capital grants equivalent to the tax concession(paragraphs 64 - 66).86.     In the study of local unemployment attached as Annex I, the view is expressed that with a national average of unemployment running at about 2$, about one-tenth of the employed population will be in areas with an unemployment rateof at least 4%, or double the national average.     The places affected willchange from time to time but they will tend to be drawn from the smaller townsdependent on one industry or even one firm.     Remoteness, a poor transport system, or a geographical location at the head of a valley or on the coastwhich limits job opportunities will add to the difficulty.     But, in addition,there are still some old industrial areas where the rate of unemployment persistsl&apos;&apos;ell above the average, notably much of industrial Scotland, Merseyside, and part of South Wales, though there is now a prospect of substantial improvementin the case of the last, possibly offset by the reappearance of heavy unemploymentin Durham.32
CONFIDENTIAL37.    While the problem is not soluble in the sense that we can look forward tothe tine when no part of the country will have unemployment much above thenational average, there seems no reason why these larger industrial areas shouldnot he brought into line with the rest of the country.     Much has already beendone, in particular through the power to build factories.     If the exercise ofthis power is limited, not by financial control, but only by the number of firmsrilling to move into a rented factory, progress will continue, though it will be slow.88.    We think that the availability of capital grants (paragraph 85(a)) would substantially speed up the pace.     The effect of a tax concession or an auto-uatic capital grant (paragraph 85(b) and (c)) would be much more widespread.It would be more expensive (and cost vory substantial sums in benefits to thosewho are contributing nothing to additional employment) and it might beobjectionable to other tax payers, including businesses in other parts of thecountry.     We see no way of limiting the benefit of a tax concession or automaticgrant to certain classes of business in the areas concerned.     Moreover, thebenefit of a 10^ investment allowance or an equivalent automatic grant would beless than that of a 10fi selective grant0     (it would be worth about half as muchand would not be forthcoming so soon).09.    So far industry has accepted the policy of assisting the unemployment areas and individual protests have been very rare.     Anything in the nature of an automatic concession to all industry in one part of the country as against another would be a very different matter.     We therefore think that, even fromthe limited point of view of dealing with local unemployment, there would be considerable dangers in embarking on these extreme policies.     The provision of a.discretionary capital grant of say 10?o, with power tc reduce it if conditionsinprove, would probably give rise to some protests, but not, we would think, ona scale likely to be damaging.90.    The scale of the problem presented by the larger industrial areas is not^*lly formidable.     The following calculations give some indication cf its size.^Se number of unemployed in these areas in excess of the national average is of&quot;he order of 80,000.     (There are at present 187,000 people working in33
Board of Trade factories).     There are other factors which cannot be easilymeasured.     On the one hand, there would be a &quot;multiplier&quot; effect on employmentresulting from increased activity in transport, distribution and other services,end in ancillary industries.     On the other hand, there is the decline which still tends to take place in some older industries, and increased employmentbrings more people into the working population.     Experience has shown that thereia never a drop in the number unemployed equal to the number of new jobs provided.91.    It now costs about  700 to provide factory space for one worker and perhapsas much again for plant.     An investment of  56 million would, therefore, berequired if the Government were building factories to provide 80,000 jobs.     Onthis the Government would get a return of somewhere about 3^ to 3f^ with apossibility of rather more in the distant future.     If a 10$ capital grant(costing  5.6m.) induced enough firms to come forward a total expenditure ofabout  12 million a year for five years would thus be required.     This would bethe maximum outgoing.     If the jobs were provided in factories built by theemploying firms capital geants of  22 million would be required (on the assumptionthat the grant was equivalent to Lfifo of the cost) and this, with the 10$ capitalgrant for plant and machinery, would require about  5-5- million for five years with no return.     There would be an offset in other Government expenditure, forexample under those heads mentioned in Annex II.92.    If after five years or so the problem were broken down into one of what should be done for scattered pockets of unemployment, it would take on adifferent character, and it would then be right to make a fresh judgement onthe position.18.6.59.I34
ANNEX ITHE SCALE AND CHARACTER OF LOCALISED UNEMPLOYMENTNote by the Ministry of Labour, the Board of Tradeand the Economic Section of the treasury.   We were asked to provide an appreciation of the probablenature and distribution of unemployment in Great Britain duringthe next few years, on the assumption that the Government&apos;s maineconomic policies were reasonably successful and that the general level of unemployment during the period would be somewhere betweenthe levels of 1955 and last winter.2.   This paper is divided into three parts.     The first summarises the facts about the geographical incidence of unemployment in therecent past;   the second sets out some general considerationsbearing on the likely scale of the problem of localised unemploy-ment in future;   and the third discusses the prospects for particu-lar areas in the light of this general forecast.I-   The geographical incidence of unemployment, 1955-593.   The geographical pattern of unemployment has been remarkablystable during the past four or five years.     Taking the month ofApril as a convenient mean in most places between the seasonalpeak and trough of unemployment, the lowest national total (about252,000 or 1.2$) was in 1956, and the highest (531,000 or 2.4$)in 1959.     At both these dates about two-fifths of those unemployedlived in areas   where unemployment rates have on the whole beenbelow the national average for most of the   post-war years, wherethere is a reasonable diversity of employment within daily travel-ling distance of most inhabited places of any size, and where thenumbers in employment have since 1950 grown at a faster rate thanthat for the country as a whole.     Although particular placeswithin these areas may in future be exposed to special dangers ofunemployment (e.g. a serious and lasting setback in motor vehiclesmight create difficulties in Oxford, Coventry or Luton) it isdoubtful whether local problems there would persist except in acontext of widespread general recession.k.   Similarly about one-third of the country&apos;s total unemployment(82,000 in April 1956 and over 174,000 in April 1959) has been inthe scheduled development areas (which now cover nearly one-fifth of the country), the April percentage rates being 2.1 in 1956 and .5 in 1959.     Some parts of the development areas - mainly theeastern fringe of South Wales and the fringes of the North EasternD.A. - have been consistently prosperous.     The development areashare in total unemployment fell between the end of 1956 and the1These areas are (a) the whole of the London, Southern, EasternMidlands and North Midlands Regions except for North StaffordshireIpnd some rural and coastal places, (b) the South Western Regionexcept Devon and Cornwall, and (c) the Leeds, Manchester and edinburgh areas.
middle of 1958, but in the last nine months has increased again, withthe result that some three-quarters of   the working population ofthe development areas is in places where unemployment has &quot;been highfor a substantial period and that two-thirds of the people living in areas of high unemployment are in the development areas.5,    The fundamental causes of the problem vary in individualdevelopment areas.     Heavy dependence on the traditional &quot;heavy industries&quot; continues in the North Eastern, West Cumberland,South Wales, Wrexham and Central Scottish development areas.     Thelabour force engaged in both coal and shipbuilding and repairing(although not in metal manufacture as a whole) has declined inrecent years.     The direct contribution of the heavy industries to unemployment in these areas has however varied and although totalunemployment has risen when these industries have been in diffi-culties, there is no consistent statistical relationship betweendependence on these industries and the levels of unemploymentreached on these occasions.6.    Barely k per cent, of total unemployment at present is inseven sizeable towns outside the development areas but on theD.A.T.A.C. list.     Two of them are on the fringes of Merseyside.The others are on the coast, more or less isolated, but are bigenough to have a substantial unemployed population suitable forfactory work of which there is a deficiency.     Unemployment in allthese towns has always been well above the national average, butthe increase since 1955/56 has been proportionately rather less thanin the country as a whole.7.    The smaller places of persistently high unemployment outsidethe development areas, including most of the coastal resorts, atpresent account for 6 per cent, of total unemployment.     this proportion is a good deal higher in January and  appreciably lowerin July.     The areas concerned are mainly in Scotland, Wales andCornwall and in addition to being comparatively isolated havecomparatively small working populations within reach of any onecentre.     Individual rates of unemployment are extremely high inmany of these places and have varied much less than the national average in the past, whether that average has been falling orrising.     Except where there has been an appreciable inflow of new industry (mainly in the North East coast of Scotland) the long termtendency has been for unemployment to rise and the working popula-tion to fall.     The problem here is one of declining employmentprovided by agriculture and fishing and their ancillary industries,accompanied in many cases by a decline in the employment providedby looking after holiday visitors.8.    In the &quot;cotton belt&quot; (East and Central Lancashire andadjoining districts of Yorkshire, Cheshire and Derbyshire) levels of unemployment have been comparatively independent of thoseobtaining in the rest of the country and have followed the fortunesof the cotton industry (the area now has nearly 30,000 unemployedof whom nearly half are temporarily stopped).     North Staffordshire(with at present about 5,000 unemployed) shows similar characteris-tics in relation to the pottery and building materials industries.II    General considerations affecting the scale of the problem in future9.    We have assumed that the level of unemployment over the wholepuntry will run somewhat higher over a run of future years than it;f.s done in the years between 1948 and 1957.     In that period theannual average percentage of unemployment varied between 1.1 and2*0.    It seems likely that in future it will be the aim of policy
not to allow the pressure of demand to be built up to levels as high as it was in the boom years of the post-war period.     We havetaken this to mean that in future years the unemployment percentageis not likely to fall much below 1.5$ (seasonally adjusted) forany considerable period (say a year), nor to rise much above 2.5$.On this basis an average future year would have a percentagearound 2.0, compared with 1.5 in the period 1947-57.10.   The number of areas in which the rate of unemployment is sufficiently high to create a serious problem of local hardshipmust of course be expected to be higher if the national level ofunemployment over a period of years is higher.     On the basis ofrecent experience we have made a rough estimate of the effect ofour assumption about the future, taking as a yardstick theD.A.T.A.C. formula of unemployment remaining over 4$ for twelvemonths continuous.     With a national unemployment percentage of1,5$, experience suggests that the proportion of the employedpopulation living in areas which have had a percentage above 4$for twelve months will be 4-5$.     With a national unemploymentpercentage of 2.0$, the proportion would be about 10$,     It doesnot, of course, necessarily follow that the area to which selectivemeasures should be applied should be defined as those which at thetime satisfy this or any other fixed statistical criterion.     Inorder to prevent intolerably high local rates of unemploymentdeveloping at times when the national level of unemployment is comparatively high, it may be necessary to take measures in moreprosperous times, and an unvarying statistical criterion for their application would not be appropriate.     There is also the problemof border-line areas where the statistical criterion is not quite satisfied   but there may be other considerations   which tell infavour of according special treatment.     The D.A.T.A.C. criterionhas been adopted here merely as a convenient yardstick formeasuring the probable effect on the scale of the problem of thehigher level of unemployment which we expect on the average of future years.     On this basis, as the figures given above will show, what may be expected is roughly a doubling of scale comparedwith the early 1950&apos;s.11.   A much more dubious field of argument is opened up when anattempt is made to forecast whether the &quot;kind of structural changein employment pattern which creates problems of localised unemploy-ment is likely to go on at a faster or slower rate in future thanin the past.     In so far as these changes arise from the applica-tion of scientific knowledge to industrial technology it seemsmore likely that they will increase in frequency than that theywill diminish.     On the other had, the continued improvement inmeans of transport and communication, by steadily reducing the effective distance between different areas, should also reduce thedivergences in economic advantages.     This latter effect is however perhaps more theoretical than real:   recent experience suggests that the eeonomic disadvantages of remoteness is increasing, rather than diminishing, as time goes on.     Certainlyit appears likely that the smaller isolated towns and industrialregions will have an increasingly difficult time in the future.The potential benefit from further improvement in means of trans-port and communication seems likely to accrue in strongest measure to areas where there is a considerable industrial concentrationand a large population, such as South Wales.     Por regions likeJhis the trend in future seems much more likely to be on balanceyavourable than it does for the isolated industrial town one of whose principal industries is decaying or moving away.
12. -As one method of considering where local unemployment problemsmight arise in future we have examined the treilds in employment ina number of industries over the past ten years.     There are a few cases where there has been a fairly steady decline which seems likely to continue in the future.     Agriculture is one case,though the decline here may be too widely dispersed to be ofimportance in the present context.     Fishing has declined, andcauses local problems, but it is a pretty small industry(26,000 in 1957).13.   Textiles are one of the more important cases?   the trend inJute (which is concentrated in Dundee) has been steadily downwardssince 1954?   and the numbers employed in linen (which is concen-trated in Northern Ireland) have been falling since 1951.Employment in cotton fell sharply after 1951, but rallied a littlein 1953 and 1954?   since then it has again been falling steadily.Employment in the pottery industry has been falling gradually butsteadily since 1951, and the same trend is observable in the manu-facture of tools and cutlery.1L.   These seem to be the main cases, apart from a few instanceswhich should create no great problem (e.g. textile machinery,where   employment must be relatively non-specific, and somesectors of the clothing industry, which are fairly widelydispersed)?   though there are some industries where so far therehas been comparatively little decline in employment but where a future decline seems possible (coal, aircraft manufacture,shipbuilding).     It is however difficult to forecast with any confidence the industries in which employment will decline in ^future.     The probability seems strongest in cases like cotton,(in Lancashire) and linen (in Northern Ireland) where the existenceof the problem has been known for years.15.   One group of areas which at present present a special difficulty is that of towns dependent on holiday visitors.     Despite more people taking holidays away from home the traditional seasideresort town seems likely to face a continued decline in itsclientele.     In particular, the medium class hotels and boardinghouses in holiday resorts are likely to continue to lose trade.By contrast with this, the tourist centres such as London and edinburgh should see continually growing trade owing to the influx of overseas visitors which tends to be more concentrated on thesecentres.III.   Future Prospects for Particular Areas16,   About 6%fo of the insured population can be expected to be in parts of development areas where the unemployment rate will be inexcess of 4$ when the national rate is about 2$.     Only when thenational rate falls below about 1-1$ is there likely to be nopressure for special measures in these areas.     The future distribu-tion of unemployment between particular development areas is moreproblematical.     The Central Scottish development area with nearly58,000 people now unemployed (about 11$ of the national total)seems likely to present the most obstinate problem becausealthough changes in the level of unemployment follow the national level closely, the problem is due to general difficulties (probablymainly high transport costs) and is reflected in a higher rate ofunemployment in every separate industry rather than in specificindustrial difficulties.     Dundee depends principally on the jute^iustry and the Highland development area should be. classified withtue small rural areas *     A revised demand for coal and steel andsome increase in world seaborne trade would be sufficient at least in the short term to restore the North Eastern development area toa position of comparative prosperity but since it includes a declin-ing coalfield high unemployment in Durham is liable to recur even
after such a revival.     Whilst the coalmining industry is widelyspread over much of the country, it is significant that the mostprofitable coalfields are in the Midlands and Yorkshire and theleast profitahle and therefore the most vulnerable are in thedevelopment areas (especially Scotland, South Wales, SouthLancashire and Durham).     As the economy revives generally thedemand for steel is more likely to revive and even to expand thanthe demand for coal.     This would help the North East and moreespecially South Wales where the problem might well be reduced toone of employment for women and girls throughout the area and for both sexes in the more isolated places.     At present the principaldifficulties in the shipbuilding and repairing industry arc on therepairing side and are in those ports (including Merseyside,Southampton and a number of smaller places) where repair workespecially of a short term nature is most important in relation to new construction.     This industry can have a very high marginaleffect on the total unemployment position in particular placesboth in and out of development areas.     Unemployment on Merseysidewill continue to vary primarily with the volume of traffic throughthe ports especially as the present tendency.is for a static work-ing population in spite of a high rate of natural increase of total population.     Although the percentage rate of unemployment is lesshigh than in other places the absolute numbers create a problemunparalleled except perhaps for Glasgow.17.   About 1$ of the insured population is likely to be in large towns outside the development areas which are at present on theD.A.T.A.C. list and 2$ in smaller places on this list.     These arelikely to present comparatively serious problems especially in themore isolated cases irrespective of the general level of activity in the country as a whole.     The proportion the unemployed in these areas form of total unemployment will be greatest when the national level is low but the numbers of unemployed involved in that eventwould fall below their present level of over 50,000.18.   The cotton belt is not and is not likely to become an area where the wholly unemployed rate averages over W/o.     Taking thearea as a whole total unemployment is now about 1-g- times thenational level and in particular places considerably higher.     Ifthe cotton industry&apos;s contraction is evenly spread geographicallyit seems likely that the problem will be confined to the eastern and Northern parts of the cotton belt covering between one-third and one-half of its present working population of just over 980,000.Forecasting is particularly difficult because emigration from thearea, which has been substantial in the recent past, will dependon opportunities in other parts of the country and because thepopulation is elderly but will experience a particularly sharprise in school leavers until 1962.19.   Unemployment in North Staffordshire is liable to risesignificantly above the national level (it is about the national average at the moment but was somewhat higher during 1957 and1958), with fluctuations in home and export demand for pottery andsome building materials.20.   Individual towns in the South, South Wast and Midlands areheavily dependent on the aircraft industry which is undoubtedly-declining.     The industrial capacity concerned, including thelabour, is however fairly easily adaptable to other metal usingf&apos;industries and as none of the places concerned are very distant fromhe major growing points of these industries it seems likely thatthey would present a problem only in the context of a general depression.
21.   There are, particularly in Scotland, isolated villagesdependent on basic industries principally mining of coal and metal ores.     The steps so far taken by the National Coal board to retain miners in the industry and the availability of other work elsewhere may well lead not so much to unemployment as tothe removal from these villages of most of the younger and more efficient workers.     The possibility that such removals maydisrupt the smaller communities cannot be ruled out.     In presentcircumstances these changes are likely to be more abrupt than thedepopulation processes which have occurred in the past (forexample in the Highlands),     The departments concerned are alreadystudying the problems which arise at these villages most of whichare not very far from populated centres.T.699-59
EXISTING ASSISTANCE TO HIGH UNEMPLOYMENTAREAS(Note by the Treasury)This annex lists the principal ways in which assistance is given to the relatively poorer areas of the United Kingdom(most of which have higher unemployment rates) over and abovethe assistance given on the recommendation of D.A.T.A.C. andunder the Distribution of Industry Acts.It will be seen that the range of help is very wide andcovers both measures deliberately designed to help worse-offareas and a large measure of concealed subsidy which arises fromthe prevailing uniform price structure, e.g*, in the Coal Board,G.P.O. and on British Railways.A.    PUBLIC UTILITIES, ETC(i)   Coal*   The published figures of the National Coal Boarddo not give a complete picture of the profitability of individualDivisions.     The operating loss in the Scottish Division in 1953(excluding the profit on open-cast working but also its share ofinterest charges) was  1li.,2 m.;   the corresponding figure forthe South-Western Division (mainly Wales) was  650,000.     Thetotal losses of Divisions operating at a deficit were  20 m. andthe net operating profit over the country as a whole (on thesame basis) was  11 m.     It can therefore be said that the coal board&apos;s operations in Scotland and, to a lesser extent, in Yifalesare subsidised by those in the rest of the country.(ii)   Electricity.     The development of hydro-electric power in Scotland was very largely undertaken by the Governmentbecause it was unattractive to commercial undertakers.     TheNorth of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board is, moreover, requiredto collaborate in the economic and social development of theNorth of Scotland.     The capital cost of generating hydro-electric power is over three times that of thermal power, andthis very heavy capital assistance is nearly all provided by theExchequer.     Since most of the cost of generation arises from theservice of the capital, the provision of capital at Exchequerlending rates enables the cost of generation to be kept below that of thermal power;   but distribution costs are heavy, so thatthe Hydro Board earns only 3&amp; net on its capital compared withan average of 1^% on the other nationalised electricity under-takings.(iii)   Railways;    It is to be expected that railways in rural areas lose money.     It has been unofficially estimated by theBritish Transport Commission that  20 m, is the annual loss onr ailways in the north of Scotland.     The loss in Wales and theremoter areas of England must also be substantial.(iv)   Roads, etc. :    The Scottish main road programme at  2+0 m.from 1958/62 is larger than the  33 m. which it would be on a population basis.     In 1959/60 Wales gets the generous allocation of  9.3 m. out of the English and Welsh programme of  55 m./About
About  ij.00,000 a year is paid for roads, piers, etc. in theScottish Highlands under the Congested Districts (Scotland) Act1897;   and elsewhere in the U.K. there is a temporary ruralroad programme for  k m. of which Wales ( 2m,) and LowlandScotland ( 1 m.) receive a large share.(v)   Airways:      Scotland loses relatively more than Englandon internal air services aid aerodromes.(vi)   Ships:    There is the subsidy ( 282,000 this year) to theMacBrayne Steamers.     Further help is forthcoming for the orkneys.(vii)   G.P.O.    Apart from the contribution of  5 m. per annumto the Exchequer from its revenue of about  hOO m. , the PostOffice does not make a profit, taking one year with another.This means that in the rural areas of England, the North ofScotland and Wales it must incur a loss, though actual figures are not available.B.    OTHER ASSISTANCE(i)   The Development commission the Commission are empowered to assist rural activitiesgenerally and spend, with Treasury approval, about  1.1 m. ayear in a variety of ways.     The Development Fund may once morebe used to finance the building of factories.     The areas where this may be done are N.W. Wales, the Scottish Highlands andthe Buckie/Peterhead District.(ii)   Highland DevelopmentProduction grants to crofters are at a higher level than similar grants elsewhere.     A new plan has been approved tspend up to  2 m. a year for several years on - inter alia -roads, crofting, fishing and tourism.(iii)    Grants to Development AreasAfter some years of suspense, capital grants may be madefor water and sewerage.     The scheme under which grants aremade favours poorer areas.     Scotland may be getting a higherpercentage of grant than England and Wales.(iv)   Rate Deficiency Grant (England and Wales)Any local authority whose rateable resources fall belowthe national average gets a grant on any expenditure not already met by a Government grant.     The percentage of thegrant tov/ards the cost can be anything from 1^.- to an authority which only just qualifies up to 53/- (Merthyr Tydfil), 5870(Houghton-le-Spring) or even more.     The estimated cost for1959/60 is about  80 m. in England and about  1k m. in Wales.(v)   Equalisation Grant (Scotland)This is the analogue of the previous scheme.     Under itthe Scottish local authorities get more than they would ifthe grant were related to average resources in Scotland and only 12 local authorities (out of a total of about 230) donot qualify.     The estimated cost of 1959/60 is  &apos;\5i m./(vi) Housing
(vi) housing in England and Wales the main types of subsidies are for slum clearance and overspill;   these are supplemented (upto a total of  30 p.a. a house for 60 years) in the case ofa few poorer areas.     Up to the end of last year, all but one of the areas to get this supplement were in Wales.In Scotland, the subsidy for overspill is  1+2 p.a. a house as against  21+ in England and Wales.     There is alsoa general needs subsidy of  2k a house.     Moreover, the scottish special Housing Association relieves the burden on poorerauthorities by building about 2,000 houses a year.House building in the public sector in Scotland is running at the rate of something over 20,000 houses a year.     This isabout one-fifth of the rate in England and Wales, andproportionately a bigger share in relation to the populations of the two countries.      It also costs the Exchequer morebecause of the higher rates of subsidies;      In additionScottish local authority rents are a good deal lower than inEngland.     As a result Scottish local authorities make biglosses on their housing accounts, and these losses count forequalisation grants (3(v) above).     Scotland needs more localauthority housing than England because private enterprise isreluctant to build because home rents are low.(vii) Rural Water and Sewerage GrantsGrants are made towards the co^t of water and seweragein rural areas on the same sort of formula as the grants to development areas (B(iii) above).     There are some variations,but for the most part the higher the rate poundage in the area,the higher the percentage rate of grant.     In so far as areas with higher rate poundage are poorer areas, this means that the poorer areas get more grant.     It certainly means that thehigher rates of grant apply in Scotland and Wales.(viii) ColvillesThis strip mill scheme, which was approved last October,is to cost about  50 rn. , the whole of which may be borrowedfrom the Exchequer at Government rates.     The expected return onthe investment is smaller than that on the larger scheme at newport, and the division of the project into two has greatly reduced its economic merits.T.1-.66-59
ANNEX IIIMANAGEMENT OF GX)WdM5NT FACTORY BUILDINGS(Note by the Board of Trade);,t    The Question of organisation,    As explained below, the present system is that five Estate Companies, threein England, one in Wales and one in Scotland, are responsible for building and subsequent management of factory premises in the Development Areas,     The Boardof Trade are responsible for the selection of tenants.     The Boards of directors of the Companies are local people drawn from various interests.2,    This&apos;system of management is preferable to direct management by the Boardof Trade itself.     It has worked reasonably well, though the policy of representing a proper balance of local interests has led to Boards more suited in size andmembership to discussion of policy matters than to their actual task of realestate management.3,    The question of organisation of the companies was examined in 1952 bySir Thomas Phillips and Sir Edward Gillett who proposed a gradual change to smallprofessional boards with one local employer and one trade unionist.     In fact ithas not been considered advisable to make changes on these lines while relatively little new building was being done.     In the meantime, the Boards are ageing, and questions of retirement and introducing new blood are a continuing source of trouble,k.    If factories are to be built in other parts of the country a new organisationvdll be necessary.    We must envisage the building and management of a number ofscattered properties, and probably their sale from time to time as the tenant&apos;swish, possibly even a sale on the property market of factories in an area nolonger suffering unemployment.     Separate local companies do not fit this concept.This implies that there should be a single body responsible for factories inGreat Britain,     Ministers many consider that for political reasons there shouldbe separate subsidiary organisations for Scotland and Wales, in which case itwould be logical to provide a parallel subsidiary for England too.     There is no advantage to efficiency in this particular grouping, but a geographical groupingmight anyway be convenient,5,    The existing five companies are non-profitmaking bodies limited by guarantee,with members-consisting of the directors and other local people (mostly now elderly)^The creation, of a new company taking over the assets and responsibilities of these bodies would require the voluntary co-operation of all concerned.     It would be aprotracted and perhaps painful operation.     The more straightforward way would beto provide in legislation for a new statutory body (with a functional board) witha duty to act as agents of the Board of Trade to take over the existing companies&apos;duties.    The pension rights, etc, of existing employees would have to. be safe-guarded and tenants&apos; right should not, of course, be upset in any way.^&apos;    History and particulars of property :..1.    When the Board of Trade became responsible in 1945 for the provision and management of industrial premises it was decided to utilise the machinery and experience of the Industrial Estate Companies,     These Companies ( three inEngland and Wales and two in Scotland) had been set up by the Commissioners forSpecial Areas to acquire and develop trading estates,,     The Companies were limited by guarantees, without share capital, and not profit-making,2,    Against approved development schemes which were submitted by the companies,Ipps were made out of the Special Areas Fund,     These were secured by debentureonswhich, after the first five years of the company&apos;s operations, interest waspayable half-yearly at the rate of 4 per cent (a lower rate or no interest was paid for any period where the Commissioners were satisfied that the company&apos;financial position warranted such a course),1
3.     The Commissioners themselves acquired and retained the freehold ofcertain few sites for individual or grouped factories.     They used the estate Companies on an agency basis for the development and building work.The Companies were given a 99-year lease of these properties and they paiddirectly to the Commissioners the net revenue (i.e. rents less the adminis-trative expenses).4.     The Board of Trade took over the liabilities and assets of the commissioners and subsequently carried through all acquisition of land and the provision ofindustrial premises under Section 1 of the Act by direct ownership and financing,The predominant function of the Companies in their relations with the Commissionerswas to develop an estate which they themselves owned.     Under the Board of Tradethey are the agents for the Department for the building and subsequent management of the Board&apos;s own property which is assigned to them on 99-year leases.     in only two instances do the loan arrangements in respect of the company&apos;s ownestates continue to apply, viz:-Treforest Estate Wales and MonmouthsireIndustrial Estates Ltd.Various small sites in The West CumberlandWest Cumberland Industrial Development Co. Ltd0As.from January, 1955, the Board of Trade replaced the Treasury Solicitor asthe holder of these two debentures. In all other cases the agency arrange-rnents are operative,5.     The two Estate Companies in Scotland were merged into one in 1945. . a fifth Estate Company, was set up in February, 1946, when South Lancashire was.scheduled as a Development Area.     The Estate Companies and particulars ofthe properties administered by them as at the 30th April last are;-(a)   Industrial premises administered by Estate Companiesr-PQQ Space No. of       Employment as at,- :   -..

6.     As is shown in the published Trading Accounts and Balance Sheets 1957/58the total of the Board of Trade&apos;s fixed assets was valued at the 31 st March,1958, at about  60:f million.     The outstanding loans to the two industrialestate companies secured by mortgage was approximately       million.     Incomeby way of rent was . 2.8 million.     Other income accruing for services providedfor tenants (electricity, gas, water, heating and process steam canteens, etc.)and also loan interest was just over  l^ million.     The net deficit for theyear was  2.8 million and therefore if the Board&apos;s operations on the provision and management of industrial property were required to break even rents wouldhave to be doubled.     The basis for rents is current market values asnegotiated by District Valuers directly with the tenants.C.     Factory Building by the Development commission the Development Commission&apos;s powers derive from the Development and RoadImprovement Fund Act of 1909 under v/hich a fund was provided to assist thedevelopment of agriculture (including fisheries) and rural industries.The Commissions experience with various agents in the building of factories in rural areas has not been altogether satisfactory.     In recentyears the Commission has sought the help of the Estate Companies,     Threefactories have been built by Scottish Industrial Estates with money provided on loan from the Development Fund in the Buckie/Peterhead area and extensionshave been and are being added by the Este.te Company to these factories.     Theuse of the YJales and Monmouthshire Industrial Estate Co, agreed to more recentlywas for a factory in Caernarvonshire which is now under construction.     other schemes are under discussion for Wales including the advance factory whichis to be located in Holyhead.Because of the statutory requirement that issues from the development fund can only be made by the Treasury to or through a Government Department, theBoard of Trade have been, and continue to be, required to accept a measure ofresponsibility in these factory building cases additional to those which are carried cut by their Estate Companies in the building and subsequent management of the property.3
