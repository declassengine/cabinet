AFRICA: THE NEXT TEN years. The purpose of this report is to survey the African scene over the next tenyears not in order to make detailed recommendations on individual problemsbut rather in order to provide a framework within which we can discuss with our friends and allies, particularly the United States, the policy which the West should adopt towards the rapid march of events in the African continent. It is limited toAfrica south of the Sahara, since the Mediterranean littoral is a geographicallyseparate area and its problems are rather different; but it can, if necessary, be madethe subject of a separate enquiry.2.  The report is divided into five sections:  I. A brief historical introduction.II. A survey of the influences currently at work in tropical Africa.III. A forecast, in general terms, of the probable outcome of these influencesduring the next ten years, i.e., a rough picture of Africa South of theSahara in 1970.IV. An attempt to define both the interests of the West in Africa and theproblems with which the continent confronts the European Powers,particularly the United Kingdom; and to suggest possible means bywhich the Western position in Africa might be safeguarded during thenext ten years.V. A conclusion summarising the main considerations which emerge fromthe survey.I.  HISTORICAL BACKGROUND3. Although the outside world had made contact with the coastal areas of africa from very early days, it was only within the last century that any effectiveoccupation or administration of Africa south of the Sahara by Europeans tookplace. The history of Africa before the establishment of European influence is largely one of primitive tribes overrun by stronger and better-organised groupsfrom the north and east. The subsequent intermingling of races led to the emergence of peoples broadly described as Negro in the west and Bantu in theeast. In West Africa Islam crossed the Sahara and, in an adulterated form,became the basis of a series of extensive native empires such as Ghana, Mali andSonghai, whose influence and trade spread well beyond their territorial limits. in what is now French West Africa there were seats of Arabic learning of internationalrepute such as Timbuktu. There was no comparable tradition in eastern orsouthern Africa.4. War was a regular feature of the African scene. The damage caused bywars and raids was greatly magnified when Africa became the victim of large-scaleslave-trading. Faced with the threats and bribes of traders, in the east mainlyArabs and in the west Europeans, the tribes nearer the coast found it profitableto raid their neighbours further inland for slaves, ivory and minerals for export.Thus the impact of the outside world acted as a stimulus to the coastal tribes inmany parts of Africa but led to ruinous exploitation of the interior. Lord Lugardwrote: &quot; The condition of Africa when Europe entered the continent wasdeplorable .... On the east coast Arabs and half-castes were engaged in alucrative trade in slaves .... In the west powerful armies of Moslem Statesdepopulated large districts in their raids for slaves. Inter-tribal warfare was an ever-present condition of native life, and extermination and slavery were practisedby African tribes upon each other.&quot; Nor should it be overlooked that in thecenturies immediately preceding European occupation Europeans were the chiefbuyers of African slaves.5. Although European traders and explorers had been active on the westcoast for several centuries and Portuguese colonisation dates from 1444, the greatmissionary movement started only just over a century ago in the west and just under a century ago in the east. There followed the period known as The Scramble55447b
for Africa, in which European Governments began to interest themselves, manyof them with some reluctance, in carving out spheres of interest and securinginternational recognition of them although the frontiers were in many casesdrawn arbitrarily and without regard to tribal or economic considerations. Thefirst task of the new administrations was to establish law and order and to createconditions which would make trade and economic development possible. Often,and especially in the case of the United Kingdom, European intervention took theform of protectorate treaties made with chiefs. But force was also frequently used,either in establishing authority or in maintaining it. This was especially so in areas where the southward migration of the Bantu peoples collided with the advance of europeans.6. Education on Western lines had an especially rapid impact in the West of africa. This was due partly to the historical reasons described above; partly tothe greater virility and adaptability of the Negro and Berber elements as opposedto the Bantu; and partly also to the greater fertility of much of West Africa, whichpromoted better nutrition and denser population. The same greater virility and enterprise were to be seen in isolated areas of high fertility elsewhere in Africa.Many West Africans tended to look on Europeans as employers and teachers whowould help them to advance; whereas in East and Central Africa the Bantupopulations frequently came into conflict with European settlers over the areas of relatively fertile land. In general, the areas of European agricultural settlement arethose where relations between the races have been least harmonious.7. Until the second World War it was not normally considered incumbenton a colonial Power to finance development in its colonies from its ownmetropolitan budget. The major contribution to the economic transformation of africa was therefore made by private enterprise, which exploited the natural resources of the continent, especially minerals and land, and stimulated trade and commerce. The traditional role of government was first to establish the rule oflaw and to constitute an efficient administration, where possible making use ofindigenous institutions; then to lay the foundations for education, health and other social services; and at the proper moment to introduce the machinery of representative government.8. In the more naturally fertile areas such as West Africa and Bugandaeconomic development mostly took the form of trade in primary products produced by Africans, such as palm oil, cocoa and cotton; and European enterprise andtechnical skills were confined to commerce, processing industries, cash cropimprovement and mineral exploitation. But in the vast less fertile tracts of africa the production of wealth from the soil was far more difficult and indigenouseconomic progress was slow. Only Western skills and capital could wrest wealthfrom the barren soils; and progress was often further handicapped by poor anduneven rainfall and by pests, such as tsetse fly. Thus in East and Central african territories much of the wealth required to support Government services wasproduced by external enterprise, skills and capital; and the task of developing the indigenous economy was and remains a costly, difficult and protracted one,still only slowly bearing fruit in these less fertile regions. In some areas theconditions are so adverse that little wealth can be generated except from minerals.9. In the aggregate, however, the contribution of the European occupying powers to African development during the past 60 years or so has transformed the scene described by Lord Lugard. The administrations have established law andorder and have provided education, health services, water supplies, communications,technical and research services of all kinds. Slavery has been abolished; disease,poverty, ignorance and violence have been greatly mitigated; and the Africanpeoples are for the most part free to trade and to raise their standards of living inaccordance with their abilities. Moreover, a growing African intelligentsia isemerging, able to meet on equal terms the educated representatives of othercontinents. Africans administer governments of several countries which have achieved, or are achieving, independence. Indeed, successive governments of metropolitan France have contained at least one African Minister; and the seministers have filled their posts with distinction. In the political, administrative and judicial spheres democratic processes have been progressively introduced and developed to accord with the diverse local circumstances; local government is being built up, based almost always on indigenous institutions; and the rule of law hasbeen established.
II.-THE INFLUENCES AT WORK IN AFRICA10. It is necessary to view the influences at present at work in Africa, both from within and from without, against the general historical background presentedabove. They are all in some sort consequences of, reactions to, or exploitationsof the historical and social evolution of Africa over the last two generations. Theymay be distinct in origin or purpose: but they all interact and are likely to do soincreasingly.Pan-Africanism11. There is one simple and recognisable common factor in the politicalferment at work in all African territories to-day namely, the desire on the partof Africans generally to be rid of external European domination and their belief in their right and ability to govern themselves. This &quot; Africanism &quot; (to avoid the term &quot; African nationalism &quot; which, in the absence of any African &quot; nation &quot; inthe European sense, can easily be misleading) represents a natural, unco-ordinatediip-surge of emotional racialism; and it would be wrong to regard it as the outcome of an organised political &quot; movement.&quot; Nevertheless, it is now a major factor in africa, as a strong motive force which provides the immediate local politicalobjective of educated leaders and a rallying cry to which the great mass of theuneducated may be expected readily to respond.12. Drawing strength and stimulation from this feeling of common purpose,there is now emerging among African leaders a common political philosophy, basedon rather more sophisticated conceptions, to which the term &quot; Pan-Africanism &quot;may be applied. This first saw the light of day at the so-called Pan-AfricanConference in Manchester in 1945; but since Ghana gained its independence it hasshown signs of more vigorous development, particularly in the Conference of independent Governments of Africa (with the exception of South Africa) held inAccra in April 1958 and in the All-African People&apos;s Conference also held in Accrain December 1958. Further governmental conferences are likely to be held at fairlyfrequent intervals. One is scheduled in Addis Ababa next year. In addition, theAll-African People&apos;s Conference has established a steering committee, which islikely to meet frequently in order to keep under review current developments in africa. Its Chairman is Mr. Tom Mboya; but it contains also relatively moderateelements, such as the Tunisians.13. On the 1st May Dr. Nkrumah and Dr. Sekou Toure, the President ofGuinea, announced in Conakry the project of a Union of Independent States of africa, whose main objective will be to assist dependent African States to achieveindependence and to widen and consolidate their association in the Union.Membership will be open to all independent African States which are prepared to subscribe to certain principles outlined in the draft constitution. The preamble to the constitution, among other things, condemns &quot; every community based upona system in which colonised territories are subject to colonising States &quot;; and theprinciples include a common citizenship, flag, defence policy and Bank of Issue.The degree of sovereignty to be surrendered to the Union will be determined bythe member States in common and their economic policies will be co-ordinatedthrough an Economic Council; but each member State will have its own foreign representatives. The Union will not act &quot; in obedience to any one group or blocbut will take account of the external forces working for or against them.&quot;14. This is the first attempt to give practical effect to the concept of&quot; Africanism &quot; and of an &quot; African personality &quot; which can play its part as anindependent influence in world affairs equivalent to that of European or Asiannations. It may well appear to African eyes as an imaginative and constructivedevelopment and will be liable to exert a powerful emotional appeal on the risinggeneration of African politicians. On the other hand, in present circumstancessome African States, whether from jealousy of Ghana or preoccupation with theirown problems or preference for other competing conceptions such as that of theFrench Community, may not be much moved by it. It is not likely, for instance,to have much attraction for M. Houphouet-Boigny in the Ivory Coast or for leadingpoliticians in Nigeria. Moreover, as the experience of the Mali confederation hasalready illustrated, it will have many difficulties to overcome if it is to be translated into effect.  The practical problems of association will be serious enough even asSECRET55447 B 2
between Ghana and Guinea the one a member of the sterling area, the other inthe franc zone; the one speaking English, the other speaking French and neithersharing a common African language. They will become the more formidable the wider the area over which the Union attempts to extend its influence. In the end thesentiments underlying the British Commonwealth and the French Community may prove to exert as much appeal to African opinion as that of a United States of Africa.Again, while there are obvious cases where existing boundaries separate peoples of the same tribe and speech, there are equally &quot; national,&quot;&apos; or at least &quot; tribal,&quot;patriotisms which may run counter to closer association. Although the eradicationof tribalism is a prerequisite to the development of the &quot; modern &quot; Africa whichthe political leaders wish to see, tribal loyalty still remains a potent force and theproblem of adjustment between the tribe and the State will not be easily solved.Indeed, there are signs which are discussed below under &quot; The Changing Orderof Society &quot; that the prospect of the withdrawal of the colonial Powers and the fear of domination by other political groups has the effect of stimulating &quot; tribalparticularism &quot;: and this may result in fissiparous tendencies in States which attainindependence, unless the central Governments are either strong enough to suppressthem or skilful enough to retain tribal adherence by a judicious measure of devolution of power. Alternatively, when independence has been attained theremay be pressure in some cases to redraw the frontiers imposed by Europeans inorder to make them correspond more closely with tribal boundaries.15. In the longer term the aspirations of Pan-Africanism could prove to be ofadvantage to the United Kingdom and the West. The idea of a &quot; Pan-African &quot;personality might develop into a strong, because indigenous, natural defence against the external influences, particularly from the Soviet Union and the arab republic, to which African countries will increasingly be exposed. And the emergence of a grouping of African States as an international entity distinct from the &quot; Afro-Asian &quot; bloc or the Arab bloc might well be to the advantageof the West. Moreover, political and economic collaboration between newlyindependent States should make for greater order and stability within thecontinent. On the other hand, in the early removal of colonial rulePan-Africanism has a more simple and straightforward objective, to whichimmediate expression can be, and is being, given. The stimulation which currentPan-African activities are giving to this basic impulse is having two effects: first,it is making African politicians still more impatient and intransigent in their approach to local political issues; second, it is tending to cause African thinkingto put the emphasis on African domination rather than on &quot; non-racial &quot; or&quot; partnership &quot; solutions. It would be dangerous to under-estimate the effect ofthis tendency in the immediate future; and so long as problems of political development and European-African relationships persist in the territories wherethe West remains responsible, the immediate &quot; anti-colonial &quot; objective of Pan-African activities is bound both to make the solution of those problemsimmeasurably more difficult and greatiy to increase the risk that the Africans will seek solutions through violence rather than negotiation. This may not be thepurpose of individual African leaders in the Pan-African movement; but it can easily be the effect of their activities, as recent events in Nyasaland have demonstrated.European Racialism16. The stresses between Africans and European (and other non-African)immigrants into the continent are inherent in the historical background. Theyspring from natural fear of economic, cultural and political domination. Africansfear that non-Africans will dominate, exploit and hold them back and, particularlyin the areas of European settlement, will deprive them of their land. Non-Africansfear that they will be submerged by Africans and that their standards and identitywill be threatened. Africans resent the fact that non-Africans enjoy greaterpolitical power than their numbers warrant; while non-Africans are apprehensive that Africans will gain political control to the detriment, above all, of their security.Differences of culture, customs and standards of hygiene inhibit the mixing of races and create social colour bars wherever there are considerable non-Africanminorities.17. The deliberate pursuance by South Africa of the policy of &quot; apartheid &quot;(i.e., racial segregation combined with white domination), which makes Africans
elsewhere particularly sensitive to any supposed threat of suppression and permanent domination by Europeans, has undoubtedly contributed a good dealsince the war to the growth of &quot; Africanism &quot; as a potent force to the North.Similarly, this African reaction, together with the emergence of independent african states, such as Ghana, professing a deliberate policy of disseminating &quot; Pan-African &quot;concepts throughout the continent, has produced a counter-reaction in Europeanminds, the effect of which can be seen in recent public criticism in the central african Federation of the assistance given by the Accra Pan-African Conferencein December to subversive African movements within the Federation and in thewilder talk about declarations of &quot; independence &quot; on the part of the Federation.But in East Africa, in the Belgian Congo and, to a lesser extent, in part of theFederation itself the Europeans are becoming reconciled to the idea that therewill eventually be African majorities in the Governments and are hoping that, whenthe Africans gain the predominant political power, they will recognise thepermanent value and importance of the non-African communities. In East Africathis hope is already tending to make the non-Africans endeavour to come to terms with African aspirations.Soviet Penetration18. The strategic objective of the Soviet Union is to remove Western influencefrom Africa and ultimately to bring the peoples of the continent within theCommunist system. In February 1958, Mr. Khrushchev told the SovietCommunist Party Congress that support of the struggle for African liberation wasa principal aim of Soviet policy. In pursuance of this objective the Soviet bloc is taking an increasingly direct and positive interest in the continent, marked by a significant intensification in recent years of studies covering all aspects of life and social organisation in Africa a research effort comparable in scale with that which preceded the irruption of the Soviet Union into the Middle East some years ago.19. This threat is not at present a &quot; Communist &quot; threat, in the sense thatthe Soviet Government are not pursuing their aims through internal penetrationon orthodox Communist lines. Indeed, their very failure to make substantial progress on those lines (there is, for example, no organised Communist Party inany of the British territories in Africa) probably contributed a great deal to therecent reappraisal of their tactical approach which has resulted in a &quot; newlook &quot; at Africa. The Soviet theorists have now decided that they must reconcilethemselves to a long interim period of &quot; bourgeois nationalism &quot; in the african territories before the &quot; dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; becomes a practical proposition. The course which they have set in the immediate future is, therefore,not to build up Communism from within the African territories but to ingratiatethemselves with African &quot; nationalist&quot; movements, in particular by supportingdemands for the ending of colonial rule. Their exploitation of &quot;anti-colonialism &quot;and racialism serves both to weaken the Western hoid on Africa and to providea respectable approach to the peoples of Africa behind which the ultimate objectives of extension of the Communist system and world domination can be concealed.This concealment will go to the extent even of leaving local Communistorganisations in the lurch if overt Soviet support in this phase might prejudice the establishment of good relations between the Soviet bloc and &quot; bourgeois &quot;Nationalist parties.20. The Soviet Union is now making use of all the conventional techniquesof diplomacy, trade, economic assistance and cultural relations in order to becomeaccepted by Africans as a powerful, respectable and sympathetic friend. TheSoviet Government will seize every opportunity to establish links with Africanpolitical movements while at the same time, but more cautiously, preparing for theultimate penetration and subversion of the African territories. In general, theirtechnique is at present to represent themselves to Africans as an alternative source of economic and technical help and an alternative political sponsor; meanwhileoffers of scholarships and goodwill visits to the Soviet Union are the means ofindoctrinating African opinion and of forming potential cadres for the ultimateCommunist revolution.21. This Soviet approach, freed to some extent from the old doctrinalinhibitions, is all the more dangerous.  Although the West has a long lead over
the Soviet Union in Africa in terms of association, friendship and shared effort,the present Soviet tactics of exploiting &quot; anti-colonialism&quot; are directed at itsweakest spot, where the Soviet Government, as compared with the western powers, can present a facade of disinterested generosity. Moreover, they have theadvantage of being remote, unknown and un-involved in Africa. Above all, theyare believed to be free of ideas of racial superiority; and we must expect soviet propaganda and subversion to exploit racial conflicts to the full. This danger isof particular concern to the United Kingdom, since tension between white settlersand black Africans exists only to a limited extent outside the Commonwealth.The Soviet Government will seek to identify all United Kingdom policy with thatof the Union of South Africa; and by deliberately increasing the tempo and pressure of political agitation in the still dependent territories they will endeavour to retardthe steady advance of the African States towards independence based on stableconstitutional government, while increasing their own ability in the later phase tosubvert those States by the infiltration of local political movements, their perversionto Communist ends and their final overthrow by a Communist regime. If theWestern Governments appear to be reluctant to concede independence to theirdependent territories, they may alienate African opinion and turn it towards theSoviet Union; if, on the other hand, they move too fast, they run the risk of leaving large areas of Africa ripe for Communist exploitation.22. This is not to say that there is no suspicion among Africans themselves of Soviet designs on the continent. Dr. Nkrumah was concerned to ensure thatthe Soviet representatives at the Accra Conference last December were restricted to &quot; observer &quot; status without the right to vote, and that the Conference did notendorse the forthright demand for the use of violence put forward by some of the delegates and applauded by the Soviet delegation. There is also evidence that theeffect of Soviet activity at the Conference was to put some other african representatives on their guard against Communism. Present Ministers in Nigeria,both Federal and Regional, have for some years adopted a forthright anti-Communist line in matters of trade and travel control. But the less sophisticatedareas of Africa will be increasingly exposed to the efforts of the Soviet Governmentto identify themselves with all the different manifestations of &quot; anti-colonialism.&quot;A particular example is the establishment of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council andSecretariat in Cairo in 1957. From the start, the Soviet Union has sought to exploit the &quot;Bandoeng&quot; movement; and the Cairo &quot;Solidarity Conference&quot; in1957 was a typical illustration of this exploitation. It claimed to be a developmentof the Bandoeng Conference; but it was not supported by any Governments except those of the United Arab Republic and the Soviet bloc. It represented a majorstep by the Soviet Union in establishing a grip on the &quot; Afro-Asian movement &quot;and turning it into an instrument of positive subversion against the West. Itwas also an attempt to bring &quot; Africanism&quot; under the Bandoeng umbrella,and so to turn what had previously been only &quot; Arab-Asianism &quot; into genuine&quot; Afro-Asianism.&quot; The predominant interest of the Cairo Conference was directedsouthwards. No doubt the inspiration in this move was as much Egyptian asSoviet, since it was equally the object of the United Arab Republic to obtainhegemony of the Afro-Asian movement and to use it for the extension of their influence in Africa south of the Sahara. At that time Afro-Asianism provided acommon platform on which both the Soviet and the Egyptian Governments couldclaim to identify themselves with Nationalist aspirations while leading themovement for their own purposes into an attack on the Western position in Africa.How long this identity of immediate purpose may persist is discussed briefly below:but at least the permanent &quot; Afro-Asian &quot; organisation in Cairo must for the timebeing be regarded as a thoroughly Communist-penetrated &quot; front &quot; organisationand one of the main vehicles for Soviet activities in southern Africa.23. Similarly, the Soviet Union have sought from the outset to present the pan-African Conferences in Accra as being directed to the same purpose as theBandoeng meeting and the 1957 Cairo Conference: and, together with the united arab Republic, they have made every effort to associate themselves closely withsuch Pan-African activities. Whatever suspicion of Soviet motives the Africansthemselves may entertain, in Communist eyes &quot; Pan-Africanism &quot; is no more than atypical &quot; nationalist&quot; movement of the kind which the Soviet Government areskilled in penetrating; and it would be too much to hope that they will completelyfail to do so.
Islam and the United Arab Republic24. The influence of Islam in tropical Africa is increasing. Of Africa&apos;spopulation of some 220 million over 80 million are Muslim; and of the tenindependent States of Africa six have a predominantly Muslim population. Forseveral reasons Islam has a greater attraction for primitive peoples thanChristianity; and it is known to be spreading faster in many of the pagan territories.Nevertheless, it is doubtful whether, as a religion, Islam will exert a decisiveinfluence on the course of events in Africa during the next ten years. It is no morea unified political force than Christianity; and all attempts in the past to establishsome form of Pan-Islamic movement have always failed. Although the Sudan, theSomali territories and Zanzibar have recognised cultural affinities with the arab world which largely offset their doctrinal differences, the rest of the African Muslimworld is culturally separate. Nor does adherence to Islam necessarily implyacceptance of a politically stable form of government. Indeed, the semi-feudalform of Islam which has hitherto characterised much of West Africa is likely to giveplace gradually to a less authoritarian conception of the Muslim faith; and this,being more &quot; democratic &quot; and more emotionally unstable, will contain potentialdangers to the West. It is the political, rather than the religious, overtones of Islamwhich may give rise to concern.25. Thus, Egyptian policy naturally seeks to exploit the common bonds ofIslam wherever they exist. But Cairo harbours with equal impartiality politicalrefugees from Mauritania, which is a predominantly Muslim territory, and fromthe French Cameroons which have only a minority of Muslims. Admittedly,Egyptian policies are more likely to be effective in those areas where Muslims arepredominant (and particularly in those areas where they are of Berber rather thanBantu/Negro stock, e.g., Mauritania, Niger and Chad); and the Islamic appeal whichEgypt can exert will be reinforced in the case of those peoples whose racial originshave some Arab affinity. (For example, both the Sudanese and the ZanzibarArabs have an admixture of Arab blood, and the Somalis, although of Hamiticstock, are proud of their tradition of Arab descent.) Nevertheless, the main appealof Egypt to the African peoples and therefore the main danger to the West islikely to derive less from the social and religious doctrines of Islam than from the deliberate support and sympathy, backed by the massive propaganda effort ofCairo Radio, which the Egyptian Government offer to African political movementsnot merely in Muslim areas but throughout the continent. The immediate purposesof this policy and the immediate effects on the position of the West in Africa arethe same as in the case of the Soviet Union. Since the aim of both theUnited Arab Republic and the Soviet Union is ultimate predominance. overthe emergent countries of Africa, it has always been clear that ultimately the twoGovernments may well clash. There are now signs that they may run foul of eachother even during the first phase of subverting the Western position in the continent:and, so far as use of the &quot; Afro-Asian &quot; concept as a vehicle for this purpose isconcerned, both Egyptian attempts to dominate that movement and Russian efforts to exploit it have already met with some reaction from Asian and Arab countries.But, even if the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic were soon to partcompany (and this is not yet certain) and the &quot; Afro-Asian &quot; organisation in Cairowere to become a rather less effective instrument for either of them, we must assume that the Egyptian, like the Soviet, Government will continue independently their&quot; anti-colonial &quot; activities against the Western position in Africa.The Changing Order of Society26. When the European Powers first established their hold on Africa, themajority of the inhabitants lived in closely knit tribal societies of varying size and social complexity, usually based on a subsistence economy. Within thesecommunities the individual^ life was regulated by recognised rights and obligations.Little was left to his own initiative and there was little incentive or opportunity for him to raise himself above his fellows. Indeed, he was often bound to share his property with other members of his group and to help them in need. these arrangements provided a system of social security which was well adapted to theconditions which then existed. But the impact of Western education, of a casheconomy and of industrialisation (often based on the employment of migrantlabour) is progressively changing the old order of things, with the result that manyAfricans, especially perhaps the more educated, now feel a lack of security and
display a certain psychological instability. The process of change has reacheddifferent stages in different parts of Africa; and it is bound to continue. But whilethe social and economic aspects of the old tribalism are bound to disappear, mostAfricans still retain instinctively a basic loyalty to their tribe which, in some cases,appears even to be increasing. In British territories this tends to be most markedas the time approaches for British control of the country to come to an end. Asthe cohesive force of anti-colonialism weakens, the sentiment of tribal unity isreinforced as a protection against the unknown future perils of independence and government by fellow Africans.27. The focus of the tribe is the traditional chief, who is its embodiment andusually the spokesman of the corporate will of its members. He exerts a personalinfluence, depending on his own qualities and status; but only in exceptional cases would he express a view on subjects affecting the tribe without first consulting them,usually through the tribal elders. The personal influence of the chief is oftenenhanced by his religious status, particularly in Muslim areas, such as NorthernNigeria and parts of French West Africa, where the Emirs or Sultans have verygreat spiritual and temporal authority. At the other extreme, e.g., in Kenya, thereare chiefs who derive their position entirely from Government appointment forwhich there may be no traditional basis. Within this range there is very widevariation in all parts of Africa, depending on history, personalities and policy. Insome instances non-traditional chiefs have acquired personal power and influence;in others, traditional chiefs have tended to become little more than Governmentagents, especially in French Africa. But, whatever the status of chiefs, it isgenerally true that their influence is a stabilising one.28. This is particularly true of British territories where policy has beenfounded on &quot; indirect rule &quot; or rule through native authorities whose inherentpowers were formally recognised and developed as instruments of local administration. It is true also of the Belgian Congo. In the early years the powerof the chiefs and the system of tribal organisation were seriously disrupted; but more recently the Belgians have moved progressively towards a system rather likethe British, and chiefs have found their place in local authorities, have been givenjudicial powers and have been held responsible for the maintenance of law andorder among their people. French policy, on the other hand, has been directedrather to replacing indigenous tribal arrangements at all levels; and administrative units have been deliberately framed without regard to tribal areas in order to counter &quot; tribal particularism.&quot; Chiefs have been recognised as having authority(which is very considerable in the case of the more important Muslim chiefs); butthey have not been employed for the purposes of local administration except asagents of the central Government.29. Inevitably there has been friction between the chiefs and the detribalisedand &quot; Westernised &quot; class of African from which emerges the African politicianand &quot; national&quot; leader. The tribal chief tends to conserve the old communalsociety of which he is head, while the African politician, although often stronglyinfluenced by tribal ties, seeks to replace the chief in leadership, and on a territory-wide, as opposed to a tribal, scale. Where chiefs are very strong, as inthe Emirates of Northern Nigeria or in Buganda, the politicians may be chary, atleast in the early stages of their rise to power, of clashing openly with them; equally,the chiefs may come to terms with the political leaders and may themselves assume the dual role of chief and political leader, at any rate for a time. But, while theremay be exceptions (for instance, in Buganda), the indications are that, in the end,the politicians win and the chiefs either submit to them, as in the Western region of Nigeria, in many parts of Ghana and perhaps in Tanganyika, or disappear, asin Guinea.30. Nevertheless the chiefs will have an important role to play for manyyears in maintaining stability and law and order in many parts of Africa. Asconstitutional advance proceeds, they will tend to lose any powers which they may still claim to exercise by inherent right; but they may expect to keep their traditionaland ceremonial functions and, if they retain the respect of their people and are ableto move with the times, the influence which they derive from those functions islikely to continue. Indeed, they may even find new functions being conferred on them. &quot; What is needed &quot; stated one pronouncement of French policy &quot; is not tore-establish chiefs in the social structure which is dying but to establish them in a modern Africa which is being born.&quot;
31. Moreover, the issue is not simply one between, on the one hand,&quot; nations &quot; formed by the devolution of European authority within frontiers drawnby Europeans and, on the other hand, individual African tribes. Groups of tribesform linguistic and cultural entities, often of considerable size, which transcendexisting administrative boundaries. Some groups have greater awareness of theircultural affinities than others. Conspicuous examples are the Somalis in the East,who aspire to a union of what are now five separate territories; the Bakongo, whoare spread round the Lower Congo in French, Belgian and Portuguese territory and whose cultural association has now taken an openly political form; and theWolofs who are becoming increasingly aware of their cultural entity which stretchesacross Senegal and the Gambia into Portuguese Guinea. These cultural affinitieswill be fostered by the growing practice of giving children primary instruction intheir native language.32. Whatever the future of chiefs, therefore, &quot; tribal particularism &quot; is likelyto remain a force to be reckoned with throughout Africa for many years. although in Ghana and Guinea it would seem that &quot; national&quot; loyalty is at the momentsubmerging tribal loyalty, in most parts of Africa it will be a long time before thelatter entirely disappears. This will not necessarily make for disunity. Triballoyalty may, indeed, come to be a supplement to &quot; national &quot; loyalty and astabilising factor which will tend to limit authoritarian tendencies in a &quot; national &quot;government.   This could well happen in Nigeria.The Economic Factors33. The economic significance of Africa lies mainly in the number of rawmaterials which the continent produces, many of which are essential in the sense that they could not easily be replaced from elsewhere. The most important aregold, uranium, diamonds, manganese, chrome, asbestos, copper and iron ore, whichare concentrated mainly in the areas of central and southern Africa which havebeen settled by Europeans; and sisal, cocoa, palm oil, coffee, cotton, groundnutsand lithium in East or West Africa. Africa produces 50 per cent, or more of theworld&apos;s supplies of gold, diamonds, sisal, lithium, cocoa and palm oil. On theassumption that the world economy is not violently disturbed during the next tenyears by a major war and that the general tendency of demand and productioncontinues to be expansionary, the opportunities for economic development in africa should be very considerable. The past ten years have seen rapid social andeconomic development in almost all the territories of the continent; and the newlyemerging countries are setting their sights still higher for the next ten years. Inparticular, the opening up of the oil deposits in the Sahara and elsewhere may markthe beginning of a wholly new era in the life of large parts of Africa, in whichprofound political and economic changes will be effected by this new source of wealth and power.34. It has been suggested that an economy is within reach of modernisation and self-sustained growth when it can devote about 15 per cent, of its national income to productive investment. It follows that &quot; to him that hath shall be given.&quot;This can be seen happening all over the world ; and it is very clear in Africa. in west and Equatorial Africa, where agriculture is the foundation of livelihood andthe main source of export income, investment rarely exceeds 12 per cent, of thenational income; and the average is probably not much above 8 per cent. But inthe southern Congo, the Rhodesias and South Africa, which have grown rich bythe white man&apos;s exploitation of mineral deposits, investment (much of which hasbeen derived from private lenders overseas) has been equivalent to anythingbetween 20 and 30 per cent, of the national income for the last decade. Conversely,the areas where no large scale white settlement has occurred have seen the mostrapid political change, while the white man&apos;s preserve in the southern regions of africa has resisted the political advance of the coloured peoples. As a result the african&apos;s prospect of economic improvement tends to vary inversely with hisprospect of political improvement; and the highest standard of living for the african to-day is probably to be found in South Africa, where his chances ofpolitical advance are nil. It has been well said that &quot; the fate of Africa in the next decade depends upon economic advance catching up with political advance in the&quot; Africanised&quot; north and west, and political reconciliation matching economic growth in the plural societies of the centre, east and south.&quot;55447c
35. But there are certain obvious limitations to the rate of economic growth in Africa which can safely be assumed; and the attractions which the continentoffers to the external investor should not be exaggerated. It is true that, by comparison with Asia, Africa is not subjected to the grinding pressure ofover-population and to the problems of disease and starvation which are itsconcomitants. Indeed, large areas of Africa are under-populated. Nevertheless,regarded as a whole, the continent is not rich in natural resources; the standard ofgeneral education is very low; and there is an almost universal shortage of personnel technically competent to deai with economic problems. Moreover, thecountries of Asia offer wider and more varied scope for profitable investment;and the African temperament, easy-going and volatile, is not conducive either tothe accumulation of local saving or to the attraction ,of the private investor whothinks in terms of hard-headed and slowly-maturing enterprise rather than of projects promising a glamorous and rapid return. He will be liable to be furtherdiscouraged by the doubtful prospect of political stability in Africa; and he mayhesitate to contribute substantial quantities of capital to African development unless he can foresee a secure and expanding market for African production. And the uncertainty on this point which is inevitable in the case of a continent so heavily dependent on primary products may be aggravated by changes in the pattern of african trade.36. The relative importance of trade between the West and Africa hasalready shown some tendency to decline; and this will probably continue. Forexample, although the United Kingdom in 1957 still took 47 per cent, of the exportsof Commonwealth countries in Africa, those countries took from us only 38 percent, of all their imports as compared with 48 per cent, in 1950; and this declinemay be accentuated when the countries of the Far East, particularly India, Japan,China and Hong Kong, concentrate, as no doubt they will in the next ten years,on developing their exports to East and West Africa, which are very suitablemarkets for them. Admittedly, the rate of decline in our share of these marketshas not been consistent in recent years; and at the moment we are possibly evenholding our own. With 38 per cent, of the trade we still have the predominantshare. On the other hand, it has been to the industrial markets of Europe and north America that our export trade has expanded most since 1950; and, if wemay assume that this tendency will continue, the relative importance of Africa asa market for our goods may well continue to decline. At the same time, standards of consumption in the Soviet Union and its satellites will probably rise and themarket for tropical produce behind the Iron Curtain may expand very rapidly.Within ten years, if not five, the present small trade between tropical Africa andthe Soviet bloc may increase substantially, even though rising industrial output and consumption of raw materials in the West should increase the Western demandfor African produce at the same time.37. This forecast may need to be modified when it is possible to assess moreaccurately the ultimate effects of the clauses in the Treaty of Rome which&quot; associate&quot; French and Belgian territories in Africa with the european economic Community. At present these effects are speculative. In the first place it is uncertain how far it may be possible to secure through the G.A.T.T. somemitigation of the effect which this association will have on the trade with the six of those African territories which are not brought within its scope. Moreover,the common tariff of the European Economic Community on some items ofimportance to African countries, e.g., tropical timber and vegetable oils, has still to be negotiated. Finally, it is not clear what countries in Africa the principleof &quot; association&quot; will eventually cover. Attached to the Treaty of Romeare &quot; Declarations of Intention&quot; on the part of its signatories, indicatingtheir readiness to negotiate conventions with the independent countries ofthe franc area, Libya and Somalia; but it is not certain, for example,whether or not Guinea will retain her &quot;association&quot; with the european economic Community and whether the French Cameroons and Togolandwould be granted this status. But, although the exact limits of the area which will eventually be comprised within the association are uncertain, it maywell come to include nearly half of the continent, centred round an unbrokenstretch of territory from the Mediterranean to the Rhodesian copper belt.38. Despite all these uncertainties, however, the implications of the presentsituation are already clear and can be analysed in broad terms.  The association
clauses of the Treaty of Rome do four things. First, they provide over the initialfive years in which the Treaty is in force for an investment fund of $580 millions to be devoted to the development of the associated territories by the Governmentsof the Six and for negotiations at the end of the five-year period for the extensionof such arrangements. Second, they require the Six, over a period of twelve to fifteen years, to eliminate their customs tariffs against goods coming from the associated territories, while their common tariff is being progressively appliedduring the same period to similar goods from elsewhere, thus creating newpreferences in those countries of the Six which have not hitherto had a preferentialsystem. Third, they permit managed market techniques (i.e., non-tariff preferences)to be applied to the &quot; products of the soil,&quot; including many tropical agriculturalexports. Finally, they provide that in the overseas territories goods coming fromthe Six will receive equality of tariff and quota treatment.39. It can be argued that these provisions will not necessarily be to the disadvantage of the West as a whole and that, by stimulating Western investment in Africa, they may strengthen the links, both political and economic, between thecontinent and the free world. On the other hand the benefits which they may provide will accrue, immediately and obviously, only to certain of the african territories; and the discrimination which is inherent in them may introduce intoAfrican politics a new element of discord which cannot be to the ultimate advantageof the Western Powers. In particular, unless the Six accept some mitigation ofthe tariff provisions, the new preferences which will be created in Europe will be liable to be damaging to territories in Africa outside the association. Some of the six, e.g., Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, have provided important markets for British colonial produce. For example, Nigeria and Sierra Leone sent about33 per cent, and 40 per cent, respectively of their total exports of cocoa in 1957to the Six. The equivalent figure for Ghana in 1946 was 47 per cent. Cocoaexports from these territories will henceforward have to face a preference of 9 percent, at the end of the transitional period of the Treaty of Rome. Similarly, inthe case of coffee over half of Kenya&apos;s exports are taken by the Six, as are 40 percent, of Tanganyika&apos;s and Sierra Leone&apos;s and 20 per cent, of Uganda&apos;s. TheTreaty of Rome tariff on coffee is 16 per cent. Tea and banana exports fromBritish territories, which are likely in any event to need new markets in comingyears, will eventually have to surmount duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent,respectively. British colonies and . Commonwealth countries producing these commodities have therefore the prospect, at best, of being residual suppliers inmarkets to which they now have equal access with other parts of Africa; and theymay be shut out of these markets entirely.40. It is an open secret that the association clauses were included in theTreaty of Rome at French insistence and that the French have been the heart ofthe opposition to attempts to modify the new preferences. French statesmen,who have their own difficulties with the African Governments in the Franco-African Community, try to disarm criticism in two ways. First, they claim credit for the association clauses as an unselfish attempt by the Six to benefit the Africanpeoples and to strengthen the ties between Europe and Africa. At the same time they maintain that the fears which the United Kingdom and other countries haveexpressed are exaggerated because the African territories of the Common Marketcannot satisfy the requirements of the European countries and the products ofother African territories will not, therefore, be entirely excluded by the newpreferences. The furthest the Six have been prepared to go so far has been toexpress readiness to consider representations if and when it can be proved that trade has been diverted. But in fact it seems clear that the preferences grantedto the African territories of the Six are intended to be of substantial advantage to them; and the other countries have not unnaturally replied that, when the damage is shown by the trade statistics, it may well be too late to repair it.41. As it affects Africa, therefore, the Treaty of Rome may have a twofoldeffect. It may increase the flow of European capital for African development, tothe general advantage of the West in the longer term. But its commercialprovisions will be liable to aggravate the threat to the Western position in the more immediate future, unless they are mitigated to some extent. The Governmentsof the African countries not within the ambit of the Treaty of Rome are alreadyapprehensive that those provisions will injure their interests; and their resentment55447
against the Six has been heightened by the fact that most of them have themselvesalways accorded to the Six equality of tariff treatment with other countries(including the United Kingdom) and, in accordance with O.E.E.C. principles, have very substantially liberalised their trade with them. If, as they fear, the tariffchanges envisaged by the Treaty of Rome significantly affect the pattern of their trade in the future and the Six show no willingness to take action to mitigate the damage, their indignation may be expected to grow. They are important markets gfor the manufactured products of the Six; and this fact may enable them to induce the Six to adopt a more reasonable attitude. But their bargaining power will be offset by the counter-pressure of those African territories which have benefitedfrom the operation of the Treaty of Rome. Those territories are bound to clingjealously to the benefits which they will have gained and to seek to resist attemptsby others to reduce the measure of their advantage. If, therefore, the african territories outside the Treaty of Rome find that their trade with the Six does suffersignificant damage, the outcome may be to make Eastern European markets moreimportant to them; and the rulers of the Soviet bloc can be expected to exploitto the full the resultant opportunities both for dividing large parts of Africa fromthe West and for dividing Africa itself.III. THE NEXT TEN YEARS42. In this section of our report we attempt to forecast the manner in whichAfrica south of the Sahara may react over the next 10 years to thevarious influences which we have outlined in Part II. Any attempt topeer into the future is bound to be speculative; and in the case of africa it is particularly so for a variety of reasons. In the first place the African peoples have little in the way of common history; andthey have no significant inheritance of shared culture or religion. In other areas ofthe world where the Western Powers have transferred sovereignty to the native population e.g., in India and the Far Eastern territories the political immaturityof the new society has been to some extent compensated by the fact that the peopleshave an indigenous culture of their own, with roots stretching far back into the past.They have inherited a tradition of social organisation, even if they have had littleexperience of political unity. In most of tropical Africa this element of stability islacking; and in transferring sovereignty to thelocal inhabitants the West will in manycases be surrendering power to peoples who are not far removed from primitivesavagery. Moreover, the outstanding personalities are few and disproportionatelyimportant; and much will depend on what happens to a handful of key men Dr. Nkrumah in Ghana; Abubakar, the Prime Minister of Nigeria;M. Houphouet-Boigny in the Ivory Coast; and half a dozen more. If these few menwere to disappear from the African scene, the whole future of the continent wouldbe affected. It is considerations of this kind which make it particularly difficult to predict with any confidence the future of Africa in 10 years&apos; time.43. With these reservations, however, we would hazard the following forecast of the political pattern in Africa as it may emerge during the next decade. for convenience we have divided the territories concerned into two main areas first, the predominantly black area north of the Congo, extending from Senegal in the west to the Somali territories in the east; second, the area south of the Congo which is,and is likely to remain during the next 10 years, an area of multi-racial societiesdominated, though to a decreasing extent, by the European element.(a) North of the Congo44. Looking 10 years ahead, we believe that we can discern in this area anemerging patchwork of independent or semi-independent States, the principalexceptions being relatively unimportant Portuguese Guinea, the SpanishPossessions and, possibly, French Somaliland. And even these are likely to be underpressure by 1970. In particular most of the French African territories will probablybe independent, although they may maintain some form of association with Franceunder Article 88 of the new French Constitution. They may have established some kind of federal link between themselves; and, if so, they will probably haveconstituted two main federal groups, comprising some (though not all) of the territories of French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa respectively. Thetendency towards federation is likely to be encouraged by the legacy of Frenchadministrative practice, which has established &quot; capitals &quot; at Dakar and Brazzaville,
and by the fact that the organisation of the native political parties and Trades Unionstranscends the frontiers. It would also be more in conformity with natural economicalignments, which are distorted by the present artificial territorial frontiers. Buteconomic forces will not be wholly in favour of federation. Rich territories such asthe Ivory Coast and Gaboon dislike sharing their wealth with poorer areas.Moreover, French policy now seems to prefer each Republic to maintain substantialdirect links with France rather than to join African federations within theCommunity. Thus, the federation of Mali, which was originally intended to includefour Republics, has now been reduced to two (Senegal and Soudan) Dahomeyand Upper Volta having yielded to economic and political pressure from the IvoryCoast and to the fear by the Christian ruling class of the two Muslim partners. Thisepisode admirably illustrates the cross-currents of nationalism and sentimentthrough which Pan-Africanism will have to steer its course.45. In Sierra Leone all the political parties are pledged to independence as their ultimate aim; and in the light of recent developments elsewhere in West Africa,particularly in the French territories, it seems likely that the United Kingdom willbe asked, in 1960, to name a date for full independence not later than 1963. hither to the Government of Sierra Leone have maintained a fairly non-commital attitudetowards Ghana and Guinea; but, if their request for independence is granted, theColony may enter into some form of association with the neighbouring territoriesduring the decade.46. The Gambia provides one of the more striking examples of territorialanomaly in Africa. The Protectorate is a thin strip of land, no more than 20 mileswide at its maximum breadth, extending for some 180 miles inland on both sides ofthe river. The result is to hinder the efficient use of the only important river in thearea, to make it impossible to develop the only good natural harbour, to create asmall enclave of territory which can only with difficulty sustain an economicexistence and to maintain an artificial barrier between peoples of the same race.Hitherto, however, the Protectorate has shown a considerable sentiment of loyalty to the United Kingdom; and since from every point of view social, constitutional and economic -it is a backward and impoverished country, its real interest may lie in maintaining the British connexion for as long as possible. On the other hand, itis wholly surrounded by Senegal; and Senegal is now governed no longer by theFrench but by Africans themselves. The Prime Minister of Senegal has alreadyspoken in public albeit in moderate terms of the possibility of establishing&quot; Senegambia &quot;; and although the economic interests of the two countries do not entirely coincide, we must recognise that some form of closer association betweenthem will become increasingly probable, especially if the Gambia, by joining Senegal,could sell its groundnuts at  30 a ton in the Common Market instead of  20 a tonoutside it as at present. In that event the United Kingdom may be confronted witha difficult decision in relation to the important airfield at Yundum.47. In Ghana it seems probable that the present political system will bemaintained, a semi-authoritarian control being enforced by a &quot; democratic&quot;party under the leadership of some dominant personality (possibly stillDr. Nkrumah); and that the Government will continue to ensure by increasingly-ruthless methods that the Opposition is demoralised and that the tribal chiefs areeliminated, except for ceremonial purposes. Ghana should therefore be capable ofmaintaining internal political stability, for as far ahead as one can reasonably foresee,by a continuation of the present methods of administration. Her relations with herneighbours, however, will probably involve new forms of association; and theresults are not easy to predict. It is unlikely, on balance, that the association of ghana and Guinea will mature into a federation in the conventional sense; but itmay form the basis of a wider and looser grouping of several states with little or no real merging of sovereignty. ,We are perhaps on surer ground in forecasting that,although Ghana is likely to remain a member of the Commonwealth, she willprobably become a Republic at some point in the next five years; and that theforthcoming exchange of formal diplomatic representatives with the Soviet union will not prevent her from suppressing internal Communist cells as a threat to the regime.48. By 1965 Nigeria will have had five years of independence. Regionalpatriotism will still remain strong, but with the passage of years the sentiment ofNigerian unity will probably have grown. The Federation will have held together;and the conservative North will probably be playing the major part in the federal government, although it may have had to ally itself with the leading party from
one of the other Regions. Although authoritarian tendencies may haveincreased in the Regions, it will probably be necessary to maintain a coalition at the Centre; and this may ensure the continuance there ofparliamentary government. There is little or no evidence at present tosuggest that Nigeria wishes to become a Republic; and this is unlikely to happen during the first half of the decade. On attaining independence she willhave signed a defence agreement with the United Kingdom; and, if we have playedour cards well, she will still, in 1965, be a fully co-operative member of theCommonwealth, although much will depend on our policy in East and central africa. Preoccupation with her own internal problems may at first reduce herinfluence outside her own frontiers; but by virtue of her size and position she shouldbe beginning to play a leading part in the affairs of tropical Africa. By 1970 it isconceivable that she may have become a Republic, although we repeat there isno present evidence of such an intention. In addition, the aristocratic party mayno longer be dominant in the North (and hence in the Federation) but may havehad to give way to a more &quot; advanced &quot; party, a development which may affect tosome extent Nigeria&apos;s attitude to external affairs. But again if we have playedour cards well she should still be a loyal member of the Commonwealth.Moreover, the country should be wealthier, particularly if oil resources prove to be-large. In addition, the sentiment of unity should have grown stronger; and, being less preoccupied with her own problems, Nigeria should be able to exert a greaterinfluence outside her own borders. In any event she is likely, throughout the decade,to be deeply concerned by, and opposed to, the designs of the Soviet Union andthe United Arab Republic.49. Guinea, which voted overwhelmingly for independence in last year&apos;sreferendum, found itself cold-shouldered by France as a result; and this gave an opening to the Communist influences which are widespread among the intelligentsiain French West Africa. In consequence Guinea has already become alarminglyinvolved with the Soviet bloc and may well become more so unless greater Westernefforts are made to preserve the political and economic balance between East and west. In any case Soviet influence is likely to retain its present foothold, withdisturbing effects throughout West Africa. It is not certain how far President SekouToure will respond to Ghana&apos;s pressure for closer association or whether other states will be drawn into this association. Mali, with which Guinea has commonfrontiers, language and religion, may well be attracted. The Cameroons,which will be independent at the end of this year, will probably reflect considerableCommunist influence. Both the political and the economic future of the territoryare uncertain; but it seems unlikely to associate itself closely with France. german economic influence, however, is still considerable; and West Germany may provewell fitted for the task of maintaining links between the Cameroons and the West.There is a possibility that the Southern British Cameroons may vote to join thisunstable State; and, even if it does not, there may be difficulties and tension betweenit and Nigeria. The small trust territory of Togoland is also to become anindependent State at the end of the year. It is reluctant to join Ghana; and, if someFrench influence is maintained, it may gradually be drawn into association withDahomey. But it will not wish to forgo its independent statehood and its vote inthe United Nations once it has gained them. Liberia is likely to continue its presentconservative course, so long as President Tubman&apos;s relatively enlightened rule ismaintained; and assistance from the United States and other sources will graduallyyield a dividend of economic and social advance. President Tubman is anxious toestablish friendly relations with Nigeria and ultimately to promote a looseAssociation of West African States, each retaining its own sovereignty.50. Further to the east, European influence is also likely to have diminishedby 1970 in the Sudan and the Horn of Africa. The Sudan has become more aware of its African connexions since it achieved independence. Its future dependsessentially on whether the standards of administration can be maintained and the economy can be developed sufficiently rapidly. The future alignment of the Sudanshould not be unfavourable to the West, provided that economic assistance can beprovided and used in such a way as to diversify Sudanese production. The Sudan,probably under military Governments, will play a fairly important part in Africanaffairs as a genuinely independent country, following a Nationalist and neutralistexternal policy not unfriendly to the West, but maintaining cordial political and trading relations with the Soviet bloc. Relations between the Sudan and Nigeria may become of special importance.
5,1. Somalia will become independent next year; and the British SomalilandProtectorate may shortly afterwards be united with it. The new State may seek tojoin the Commonwealth although this seems, on the whole, unlikely. Somalia will inevitably be the dominant partner in the union; and the Somali Youth League willprobably establish the familiar African pattern of one-party government. Somaliawill be strongly Muslim and, at least culturally, pro-Arab; economically unviable;and politically committed to furthering the plan for a Greater Somalia which would include French Somaliland, a part of Ethiopia and certain areas in Kenya.Economic realities, however, may force the Somalis to reach an accommodationwith Ethiopia, in order to preserve the grazing rights in Ethiopia which are essentialto the tribes in the present British Protectorate and are guaranteed to them by treaty.52. In Ethiopia itself the system of strong centralised governmentre-established by the present Emperor may have weakened if he is no longer aliveand in power. But the country is likely to remain comparatively stable; and the dominant Amharas will probably allow the other races, including Muslims, a somewhat greater share of responsibility. Politically, Ethiopia is likely to moveincreasingly towards neutralism and association with other African States; but shewill probably still allow the United Kingdom and United States certain strategicfacilities.(b) South of the Congo53. In the non-Commonwealth territories the pace of political advance willprobably be rapid particularly in the Belgian Congo as a result of the far-reachingplans for constitutional advance which were announced by the Belgian Governmentin January 1959. Moreover, the territory should be witnessing considerableeconomic development, partly as a result of its association with the EuropeanCommon Market. By 1970 the advance towards independence will probably bein full flood and the country will be in the final stages of colonial rule. At thesame time it may be the scene of considerable tribal tension and rivalry. Ruanda-Unmdi is a Belgian Trust Territory which is only in the early stages of political development. Belgium may decide, however, to move rapidly towards concludingher trusteeship; and this would have obvious repercussions elsewhere. InAngola and Mozambique the first stirrings of African nationalism will be visibleby 1965, and the white population in these territories may have drawn further away from Portugal and closer to South Africa and Rhodesia. By the end of the decadethe Portuguese will probably have been forced to realise that they have neitherthe political nor the economic resources to maintain indefinitely singlehandedcontrol of their African provinces. Madagascar will certainly have achievedindependence by 1970; but the identity of the group controlling political power isvery doubtful the island may continue to be divided between factions engaged incivil strife or, if a dominant group has established itself, it may well, be underCommunist control.54. The form and pace of constitutional advance in much of British Eastand Central Africa are likely to vary from those typical in other parts of Africaowing to the presence of considerable non-African settled communities onwhich most of these territories are largely dependent both economically andadministratively. Ministers have recently reviewed the position in the territories which comprise British East Africa. They have rejected, at one extreme, a policyof rapid withdrawal of British control and, at the other extreme, a diehard policyof &quot; digging in &quot; and refusing to contemplate any possibility that we may relinquishour control in the foreseeable future. They have decided in favour of a &quot; middleof the road &quot; policy, implying that we will continue to promote the constitutional advance of the territories step by step but that we will also seek sufficiently to prolong the period in which the United Kingdom will retain control in vital matters to ensure that the territories will be reasonably equipped to discharge the responsibilities of self-government by the time when they achieve independence.The British East African territories are to a large extent economicallyinterdependent; and constitutional developments in each of them will have a profound effect on the other two. For this reason, if for no other, policy must bedirected to promoting constitutional advance at roughly the same pace in all three territories. But although they are all primarily African States, Tanganyika is a trust Territory, Kenya contains an important non-African settled population (on whom the economy largely depends and to whom we have special obligations)while Uganda, dominated by the powerful Buganda Agreement State, is
comparatively advanced. These differing factors make the policy of approximately equal advance particularly difficult to achieve.55. In Uganda, if the present conflicts persist, on the one hand, between thetraditionalists, headed by the Rulers, and the nationalist movements drawn fromthe young educated elements and, on the other hand, between Buganda and therest of the Protectorate, it is unlikely that by 1965 full internal responsibleself-government will have been reached. But it will probably be attained by 1970.If, however, these conflicting elements come to terms, the United Kingdom may be forced to grant internal self-government rather earlier, although this at presentseems unlikely.56. In Kenya, our policy is to build up a viable, non-racial State, in whichthe interests of all communities will be secure, and to maintain full responsibilityuntil this has been achieved. Our aim is unlikely to be realised by 1970; and on present indications Kenya will lag behind Uganda and Tanganyika in attainingresponsible self-government as is probably inevitable if the legitimate interests ofail communities are to be safeguarded.57. In Tanganyika the African nationalist movement is particularly strong and undivided; but the people are educationally backward. Here the mainretarding factor will be, for many years, lack of personnel capable of governingwith any hope of success. Even so the pressure for advance is likely to result inthe territory&apos;s being well on the way to responsible government by 1965. By 1970it will probably have achieved internal self-government but will still rely largely on external economic and administrative help.58. Thus, if we succeed in holding to our own policy against both internal and external pressures, by 1970 Tanganyika and Uganda will have attained internal self-government and Kenya will be moving in that direction; but, owing to thebackwardness of the majority of Africans in all three territories and the multi-racialnature of Kenya in particular, British authority will remain and will still, in thelast resort, prevail. If these forecasts are reasonably accurate, the interests of theWest should be reasonably secure in East Africa. But the pressures for more rapid advance will be considerable; and great skill and judgment will be requiredin order to prevent a dangerously rapid advance which can only result in economicand political chaos and throw the door wide open to influences hostile to the West.59. In Central Africa the circumstances are different from those in EastAfrica; and they present even greater difficulties. The Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland consists of Southern Rhodesia, a self-governing colony which tookits present shape after conquest, with an independent, strong, numerous and rapidly increasing European population; and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, whichare British Protectorates. The politically vocal part of the European population,unlike the Europeans in East Africa, are anxious for independence from UnitedKingdom control, although they are intensely loyal to the Commonwealth. the africans in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on the other hand, look to theUnited Kingdom connexion to protect their interests against encroachmentby local Europeans although there is at the same time a rising pressure foruniversal adult franchise leading to African political control and independence.The Federation was created as a compromise between two different forms of possible association between three territorial units whose economies are unevenbut to some extent complementary. The Europeans in Southern Rhodesia andthose in Northern Rhodesia wished to amalgamate, with or without Nyasaland,in a &quot; Dominion &quot;; but the Governments of the two Northern Territories &quot;preferreda looser type of association which promised economic advantage but did not implypolitical links. As a result the compromise concept of Federation was evolved;and it was argued in its favour that it would bring economic and political benefits to the area as a whole and that, by promoting the development of multi-racialpartnership based on &quot; civilised standards,&quot; it would prevent Southern Rhodesiafrom passing under the control of the Union of South Africa and would avoid a direct clash between a white-dominated Africa south of the Zambesi and ablack-dominated Africa to the north.60. While the Federal experiment is of vital importance to the maintenanceof stability in this area, and, indeed, in all Africa, and while it already hasconsiderable economic achievement to its credit, it is bedevilled by African fears of being dominated by local Europeans and by European fears of being submergedby an &quot; uncivilised &quot; African nationalism. It is in order to counter these fearsthat the United Kingdom has insisted, on the one hand, that, as stated in the
pledges contained in the Preamble to the Constitution and reiterated by UnitedKingdom Ministers when that Constitution was debated in Parliament, ourprotection of African interests will be maintained so long as the majority of thepeople so desire and, on the other hand, has agreed to a high qualification for the franchise, based on a necessarily arbitrary interpretation of &quot; civilised standards.&quot;61. In 1960 a Conference of the Governments concerned is to review theFederal Constitution, to agree on the constitutional advances which may bemade and to &quot; consider a programme for the attainment of such a status as wouldenable the Federation to become eligible for full membership of theCommonwealth.&quot; If this Conference succeeds in finding a course which is bothacceptable to the Federal Government and compatible with our pledges to the africans, we may perhaps infer that by 1965 the Europeans will still beproviding the main driving force of government in Southern Rhodesia andin the central Federal Government; that the United Kingdom Governmentwill still be in ultimate control of the Governments of the two northern territories; but that in Northern Rhodesia Africans will probably be playingan increasingly substantial part in the Legislature as well as participating in the Executive and in Nyasaland will be likely to have a majority of the unofficial members in the Legislature and to be playing a prominent part in the Executive.In the following five years the position should remain reasonably stable, withAfrican influence gradually increasing in the Legislatures and Executives of theNorthern Territories and in elections to the Federal and Southern RhodesianLegislatures but Europeans still providing most of the effective direction in theFederal and Southern Rhodesian Governments.62. But, if the 1960 Conference fails to find a solution which is bothreasonably acceptable to the parties concerned and capable of providing stable and progressive administration, the picture grows darker. For in that event theFederation will be rapidly subjected to an increasing strain which may soonbecome intolerable. Confidence between the races will deteriorate sharply; therewill be a grave risk that the Europeans will adopt increasingly restrictive policies;and in the end they may attempt to force the issue by declaring the Federation,or at least the two Rhodesias, fully independent under predominantly european governments. The Africans (if they have not already taken the initiativethemselves in seeking to disrupt the Federation) will then react no less vigorouslyin the opposite direction by adopting the more extreme forms of resistance; andthe white population will be compelled to resort to force in order to maintain their position- to the discredit of the United Kingdom, to the detriment of theFederation^ economy, and to the embarrassment of the policy of moderationwhich we shall be trying to pursue in East Africa. Alternatively, the Federationmay simply break up under the mounting pressure of the internal conflict ofopinion; and in that event either Southern Rhodesia may gradually drift into theorbit of the Union of South Africa or some general regrouping of territories may take place on more specifically racial lines. On either assumption the Afrikanerracial policies will then have advanced northwards to the edge of the Zambesi,towards the heart of Central Africa.63. The policies of the Union of South Africa seem unlikely to change for as far ahead as one can see; and the relationship between the Union and the blackindependent States is likely to continue to be one of increasing bitterness. At thesame time economic expansion will probably continue steadily; and the materialwelfare of the African population may well improve faster in the Union thananywhere else in Africa. As a result the Government of the Union may be ableso to develop their economic plans for the native population (through resettlementin native areas, &amp;c.) that the Africans will have both less chance and less desire torise against their white masters. And, although tension between the black and white communities is almost certain to increase, it is unlikely that the africans in the Union will be able to rise against the Europeans on a scale with which thelatter could not deal (probably by unnecessarily violent means). Under theinfluence of these pressures the Union will be liable to retreat deeper and deeperinto isolationism. By 1970 it may have become a republic and may well haveresigned permanently from the United Nations. It may seek to maintain links withthe United Kingdom and Portugal as its last remaining friends in the free world;but even.though we should hope to retain South Africa within the Commonwealth
during the next decade, it is virtually certain that in 1970 we shall be no more ablethan we are at present to express any support for the policies of the UnionGovernment in face of the increasingly hostile criticism which they will attract fromthe rest of the Commonwealth and from world opinion generally.64. In this context the future of the three High Commission Territories of IBasutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland is likely to continue to present a delicateproblem. We must expect the Union Government to maintain their pressure forthe incorporation of the three territories in the Union; and our reactions to this pressure particularly in view of our commitment to consult the inhabitants ofthe territories before taking any suoh step will be regarded internationally as acritical test of our sincerity.Summary65. The picture which finally emerges is a picture of a continent which, inten years&apos; time, may at least as far as Black Africa is concerned -be largely&quot; balkanised,&quot; i.e., divided into a large number of nominally independent States,in which the black peoples will have achieved de facto control and will have established governments which, though professing to be democratic, will in fact be largely authoritarian in their outlook. But they will not necessarily be any theless stable on this account; and although it would be unrealistic to assume thatnewly independent African States will be either able or willing to sustain the fullburden of responsible representative government as it is known in the Westerndemocracies, their authoritarian regimes will probably command a wide measureof popular support. Nigeria alone may be an exception, in that, although the regional administrations may well be semi-dictatorships, the central federal government (which is likely to constitute the real focus of power and authority)may be established on a basis of parliamentary democracy.66. The States constituting this patchwork will be likely to be linked moreor less loosely together in various forms of federal association or, more probably,in shifting alliances; but it would be unwise to assume that, at least by 1970, theywill be integrated into a relatively small number of competent and viable units.There will be a good deal of jealousy and friction between each State and itsneighbours, mainly over issues of boundaries and frontiers; and this will be liableto manifest itself in the accumulation of arms and, possibly, a tendency towardsmilitary adventures. In Ghana and Guinea the old structure of tribal loyaltieswill have been largely overthrown; but elsewhere the tribal chiefs, although oftenin conflict with the new authoritarian politicians, will probably survive and may,indeed, assume a new importance, albeit in a modified and more sophisticated form,as an alternative source of psychological reassurance when European protectionis withdrawn.67. In the areas of Africa settled by Europeans the picture in ten years&apos; time is different. In East, Central and Southern Africa the risk is not, as in Africanorth of the Equator, a risk of the &quot; balkanisation &quot; of a large number of self-governing black communities but a risk of conflict between, on the one hand,black majorities and, on the other hand, either dominant white minorities orColonial Governments seeking to ensure that constitutional advance proceeds inan orderly and moderate manner and that the legitimate interests of minorities aresafeguarded. In British East Africa there is perhaps a reasonable chance that,given patience and goodwill on both sides, the problem can be resolved withoutexcessive friction and that by 1970 the three territories may have advanced, by peaceful and constitutional means, significantly nearer to what is almost certainlytheir ultimate status, i.e., non-racial but mainly African States largely controlled by the African majority. But in South Africa there is no likelihood, so far as canbe foreseen at present, that the Union Government will modify their intransigentpolicy of apartheid within the next decade. The pattern of development in theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland is therefore critical. It is impossible to predict that pattern; but, if the concept of Federation can be sustained and canbe encouraged to take organic root in the three territories with the consent and support of their inhabitants, 1970 may see a primarily multi-racial communityinterposed, as a shock absorber, between the European-dominated Union at the
southern extreme of Africa and the predominantly black societies which will beemerging in the central part of the continent. But if, by the end of the decade,the Federation has disintegrated, the racial separatism of the Union will be directlyconfronting the new black states; while, if it is maintained under white dominationby force and without the consent of the African inhabitants, the whole of theWestern position in black Africa, even in those territories (such as Nigeria) whichare at present well-disposed towards us, will be gravely shaken.68. But, whatever the course of events, the West will need to remember thatthe new African States, although deficient in administrative experience andorganisational ability, will be proud of their independence and abnormally sensitiveto anything which they regard as threatening it or derogating from it. This willlargely condition their reactions both towards the cold war (where positive neutralityand non-alignment will be the watchwords of many) and towards offers of economicand financial assistance, on which they will be very heavily dependent. It willalso tend to make them less attractive to the foreign investor. And if the battlebetween the West and the Soviet bloc for Africa will turn mainly on the ability of the democracies to solve the acute racial and constitutional problems in east and Central Africa, its outcome will also depend partly on the extent towhich the West is able to provide appropriate economic assistance on termsacceptable to the pride and self-consciousness of inexperienced and newly-awakened peoples.IV.-PROBLEMS OF POLICY FOR THE WEST IN AFRICA69. The countries of the West have certain common interests in Africa; andthey face certain problems which, although differing in detail from one area toanother, present much the same fundamental features. The purpose of this sectionof our report is to define Western interests in Africa; to outline the problems whichconfront the West; and to suggest how these problems should be approached.The Interests of the West in Africa70. These can be summarised as the maintenance of peace, stability, economicsecurity and goodwill, and the exclusion, so far as possible, of Soviet and otherhostile influences. In addition, each of the Western countries most directly concerned with African affairs has particular interests of its own, which can besummarised as follows:  (a) France. The special French purpose in Africa is the creation of anamalgam of substantially autonomous territories in the west and centre of the continent, constitutionally and culturally linked to France and providing within a protected system a developing market and sources of economic strength. The French recognise that the existingconstitutional links between metropolitan France and the dependent territories, together with the present system of centralised control from paris over such questions of policy as foreign affairs, finance and justice,may weaken; but they expect nevertheless to be able to keep the arealinked economically and culturally with themselves, and thus with theWest, and perhaps to attract certain other African territories into theirorbit. They also propose to set up a military command for FrenchAfrica south of the Sahara, which would establish a close workingrelationship with United Kingdom and United States commands in thearea. But they may be under-estimating the extent to which - this attempt to maintain the voluntary co-operation of a substantiallyMuslim African population will be frustrated by other French purposes in Africa, especially the use of force in Algeria and the staging of nuclear tests in the Sahara.(b) Belgium. The Belgians have come to accept the fairly rapid evolution of the Congo into a self-governing African State; and they hope that economic and other links with Belgium can be maintained in the process.If the French and Belgian economies become more closely integratedin the Common Market, the Belgian interest may lie in seeking to associate the Congo with the French African system. Both Powers willhave a growing interest in promoting policies towards other parts of africa which find support among their own self-governing Africans.SECRET55447 d 2
(c) Portugal. So long as the present regime in Lisbon endures, the portuguese government will conceive their interest as being to maintain for atleast the period under review the present dependence of their&quot; Ultramarine Provinces &quot; on Europe and Portugal.(d) The United States. Among non-administering Western Powers the mostimportant is the United States, whose interest in Africa is rapidly increasing. Their main concern is political and strategic i.e., to ensurethat, as Africa emerges into independence, it remains associated withthe West. While public attitudes may still be somewhat anti-colonial and affected by the negro vote, the United States Government and theleading philanthropic Foundations are becoming increasingly aware ofthe real problems of Africa and increasingly anxious to co-operate withthe United Kingdom. In particular, the International Co-operation administration, an organ of the United States Government, has shown itself concerned to collaborate with appropriate British bodies in orderto accelerate the pace of technical and scientific advance in Africa. the implementation of American policy towards Africa has sometimessuffered from the fact that the local representatives of the United StatesGovernment have departed from the policy formulated in Washington;but this difficulty seems to be diminishing as African affairs receiveincreasing attention at high levels. If we are prepared to co-operate with the Americans, we have an opportunity to guide and to benefit from their growing interest in Africa which is bound to become a major factor in the future of the continent.The United Kingdom71. The United Kingdom has particularly close interests in Africa partly asa result of the special responsibilities imposed on us by history and by our present or past possession of large parts of the continent; and partly for strategic reasons.These interests can be grouped under the following headings:  (a) Our share in the general Western interest in the maintenance of peace and political stability in Africa, the exclusion of subversive influencesand the encouragement of pro-Western sentiment.(b) The maintenance and development of our trade with Africa and the encouragement of British investment.(c) The safety and welfare of white settlers and other minorities in present orformer British territories. We have a particular responsibility to do everything we reasonably can in order to ensure that peoples of allraces who have made their homes in such territories with the encouragement of successive British Governments will be able to livethere in security and to contribute to the development and prosperity of their own part of Africa.72. In addition, we have certain defence requirements in Africa which need to be examined in rather more detail. They derive partly from considerations ofinternal security and partly from considerations of global strategic policy.73. It is unlikely that, except in cases of emergency, we shall wish to introduceBritish troops, solely for purposes of internal security, in African territories after they have achieved internal self-government within the Commonwealth. It is evenmore improbable that British armed intervention will be either necessary or feasiblein former British African territories which have achieved full independence withinthe Commonwealth, except conceivably at the invitation of the government concerned if it was threatened or attacked by an aggressive neighbour. On the otherhand, so long as a territory remains dependent and our consequent responsibilityrequires and justifies the use of British troops for the maintenance of internal security,we shall require facilities for the accommodation, training and reinforcement of forces for this purpose. It may become progressively more difficult to insist on our right to use these facilities as the territory in question approaches nearer to independence. But, formally, the responsibility for internal security will remain with the United Kingdom; and, so long as this is so, we shall need to retain themeans to discharge that responsibility.
74. In the wider context of global strategy our current defence policy requires that:-(i) In certain circumstances we should be in a position to use armed force inArabia and the Persian Gulf. This implies, given present logisticpossibilities, that we need to maintain in Kenya an element of the strategic Reserve in order to reinforce the small detachment which wecan station in the Persian Gulf; and to retain certain modest but important naval facilities which we at present enjoy at Mombasa. we also need over-flying and staging rights in certain African territories inorder to be able to reinforce Kenya and Arabia by a route otherwise than via the air barrier of the Middle East.(ii) We should be able to reinforce South-East Asia by air eastabout from thiscountry. This requirement similarly calls for over-flying and stagingrights in Africa.75. During the next ten years the only aircraft so far planned which arelikely to be available in quantity will have ranges which require, for rapidreinforcement, the use of Kano (Nigeria) and either Entebbe (Uganda) or Nairobi(Kenya); or, alternatively, if the airfields were developed, either Bathurst (Gambia)or Freetown (Sierra Leone) and Nairobi. Another possible means of reachingEast Africa would be by the route Gibraltar, Bathurst, Ascension Island, SouthernRhodesia and Kenya; but this would involve costly engineering work at ascension island. There will, however, be a continuing need to retain the existing intermediatestaging posts in order to stage medium-range aircraft of all types to Kenya andAden. The requirement for staging and over-flying rights will not, therefore, changematerially during the next ten years.76. In short, our present defence policy and resources require the presence in Kenya of elements of the Strategic Reserve; staging rights in Nigeria, Gambia(or Sierra Leone) and Kenya; and rights to overfly territories between the stagingpoints.77. While the ability to station and reinforce troops in Africa for themaintenance of internal security is essential so long as our responsibilities requireus, and our authority enables us, to exercise the right of intervention, the requirement deriving from our global strategic policy is a relative one for two reasons. In the first place, we may find in the long run that, in relation to independent African governments, we are more likely to achieve our primaryobjectives of goodwill, commercial and economic security and the exclusion of Sovietinfluence if we refrain from using or demanding certain defence facilities and meet our defence needs by means which do not involve a use of particular african territories. (The practicability of developing these alternatives needs further investigation. They would certainly involve substantial expenditure and wouldtake time to complete; and the decision to develop them would depend on a balanceof many conflicting factors.) Second, our defence requirements in Africa, as wehave defined them in the context of global strategy, depend on the assumption thatit will remain our policy to be able both to apply force in the Arabian Peninsulaand to reinforce South-East Asia direct from the United Kingdom or Africa.But it is not certain that these elements of our current policy will remain unchanged;and, if they are modified, our defence requirements in Africa will be correspondingly reduced.78. Over the next ten years, therefore, we should be able, if we so decide, tomaintain a Strategic Reserve in Kenya (part of which may need in any event to be stationed there during this period for internal security purposes) and to securethe requisite staging and overflying rights. But we must expect political pressuresto build up increasingly against us, even though in Kenya they may be mitigatedto some extent by the economic benefits which the territory should derive fromthe presence of British troops. Moreover, we may find it expedient to modify our strategic requirements in Africa in the interests of conciliating African opinion and promoting political goodwill in the longer term; and our defence requirementsmay therefore have to be modified in the light of other more fundamental needs ofour future policies in Africa. At the same time our strategic policy as a whole maychange; and Africa may become less important in relation to our defence requirements in other parts of the world.  We hope, therefore, that the extent of
our strategic needs in Africa during the next decade will be examined in greater detail in the light of the considerations in this report. At the same time we must recognise that it may become necessary to apply force in the Arabian Peninsulabefore any alternative to the use of our facilities in Kenya has been developed.In that event we may expect violent criticism from some of the independent african countries, which may have repercussions on internal security in Kenya itself.The Problems of the West in Africa79. The impact of European power and civilisation on Africa and the rapidsocial and economic revolution in the life of the African peoples which has resultedhave created acute stresses within the continent and have confronted the West with grave new problems. Basically, these problems are two first, the pace and timing of the progress of still dependent countries towards self-government in the context of the inter-racial problem; second, the means by which the West should seek toretain the sympathy and support of newly independent States in Africa and toprevent them from being subverted by Soviet influence. These problems needseparate discussion.Constitutional Advance and Racial Tension80. The colonial policies of the United Kingdom have themselves led the african peoples to believe that independence is the ultimate goal to which they arebeing directed. And the other European Powers who are involved in Africa are equally tending to grant the Africans an increasing degree of responsibility for themanagement of their own affairs. But it is essential both to the completion of thetask of colonial trusteeship and to the safeguarding of the general interests of theWest in Africa for the future that power should not be transferred until there is atleast a fairly firm prospect that the territories concerned will remain reasonablystable and viable and will be capable of standing on their own feet. If power were handed over before these conditions were satisfied, internal chaos would develop and the territories would be a prey to the hostile external forces which are now seeking to penetrate the continent. The rising African politicians, however,stimulated by internal and external pressures, naturally desire to achieveindependence in their time. In seeking, therefore, to bring the process of &quot; nation-building &quot; in Africa to its logical end, the metropolitan Powers face the dilemma ofarousing bitterness and hostility if they appear to be going too slowly: or, if theygo too quickly, of failing to fulfil their obligations and jeopardising the future ofthe territories both for their own inhabitants and for the West generally.81. This problem has not proved impossible to resolve in West Africa, wherethere is no substantial settled non-African population and a substantial degree of social and economic progress has already been achieved. All the French west african territories are now wholly self-governing members of the FrenchCommunity, apart from Guinea, which is independent, and the French Cameroonsand Togoland, which are to become independent on the 1st January, 1960. Of theBritish territories Ghana is independent, Nigeria is on the verge of becoming so, andSierra Leone has an advanced constitution.82. But in the British East and Central African territories the problem arises in a more acute form, partly because, for historical and economic reasons, the african peoples in these regions are more &quot; backward &quot; and partly because in theeastern half of Africa the problem of establishing a genuine partnership betweenAfricans and non-Africans in all walks of life and on a workable and equitable basisassumes a particularly acute form. In East Africa there cannot be much doubtthat the African majority will ultimately gain political control of the territories.But, although it is important that they should be raised to the economic, educational and administrative levels at which self-government can be sustained, it is also important to safeguard the future of the non-African minorities. These generatemuch of the wealth of the territories and contribute much of the skill and enterprisewhich are engaged in them. . They play a vital role, therefore, in the prosperityand development of East Africa. Moreover, in Kenya, in view of the economicand political power which they wield at present, any attempt to sacrifice their essential interests might still lead to serious political conflict. We shall onlysucceed in safeguarding the interests of all parties and ensuring the prosperity of the territories if we can build up &quot; non-racial&quot; States where the non-Africanminorities will continue to make their important contribution to the general goodof all the inhabitants.
83. The Belgians are faced with a similar problem in the Congo, where whitesettlement, especially in the copper-belt, has created much of the wealth of the area.Both the Belgian Government and the leading companies seem to be moving to theconclusion that Belgian interests will best be served by fairly rapid moves towards self-government on the principle of &quot; one man one vote,&quot; without attempting to achieve over a period a defined basis for partnership. Indeed, Belgian policy nowtends to regard the non-alienation of the native majority and their moderate leadersas the only effective safeguard for the future. As this policy is progressivelyimplemented it is bound to have major repercussions in British East Africa,especially in territories where the white minority is less important than in the Congo.84. Further to the south, in Central Africa, the problem is even more acute-partly because the United Kingdom is not, as in East Africa, in sole control of thewhole area and partly because the Federation includes one territory, SouthernRhodesia, where the numerical disparity between Africans and non-Africans is less pronounced. But here also, as in East Africa, the problem is essentially one ofsecuring time for the further &quot; development&quot; of the African people and for the gradual evolution of the right kind of relationships between the African and non-African inhabitants. The handling of the Central African problem is thereforecritical for the future interests of the United Kingdom and the West. In this area,sandwiched between Black Africa in the north and European-dominated Africa inthe south, the stresses of European and African racialism meet and, as they become increasingly exacerbated, imperil the solutions which we are striving to reach. Ifthe bold and difficult experiment of &quot; partnership&quot; and &quot; federation&quot; fails,Southern Rhodesia may be forced into the orbit of the Union of South Africa whilethe two northern territories in whole or part may join the African bloc in the north.On the other hand, if Federation is maintained by force and without the consentof the African inhabitants, the Western position in black Africa will be seriouslyweakened.85. This risk is so grave that we are bound to underline it. It must not be forgotten that, after Nigeria becomes independent in 1960, the period of Britishleadership of the advance of African colonial territories towards independence willappear to be over; and unless we can solve the problems of East and central africa, our past record of benevolent government will be forgotten and it will bethe French and perhaps the Belgians who will be regarded by world opinion as theleaders, while we may be classed with the Portuguese as the obstacles to further advance. Moreover, although conditions have hitherto enabled us to adopt anapparently more simple and unambiguous approach to the problems of black WestAfrica than to those of the multi-racial societies in East and Central Africa, thegrowth of Pan-Africanism on a continental scale will make it increasingly difficult for us to continue to pursue policies which, to the African mind, seem to differentiate between the two areas. We have emphasised earlier in this report that, givenreasonable luck, Nigeria should emerge during the 1960&apos;s as the most importantpower in Black Africa but that she will watch, with increasingly influential concern,our handling of the racial tension which is steadily building up on the easternside of the continent. If we fail to solve the problems of East and Central africa in a manner which will satisfy all reasonable aspirations and will demonstrate that we are not seeking to perpetuate an unqualified white supremacy, we may loseWest Africa as well.The Political Alignment of Africa86. The second main problem which faces the West is the problem of ensuring that, as the African States achieve independence, they retain an active sympathy with the free world and do not succumb to Soviet penetration. If our forecast of probable political developments in Africa is correct, this purpose may not be easilyrealised. If, as we have suggested, a large part of Africa resolves into a patchworkof independent States, politically at odds and economically weak, we shall not beable to take for granted either the will or the ability of their Governments tomaintain internal stability and to resist external aggression. Moreover, we must assume that they will follow a mainly neutralist policy, which might at best bevaguely benevolent towards the West but at worst would be actively hostile. Onthe other hand, the West has certain assets a long connexion with Africa; theEuropean personnel who occupy key positions; the large areas of territory which
the Western Powers still control; the fund of goodwill which they have graduallyaccumulated over many years; and the economic assistance which they provide.How can they use these assets in order to ensure that, without detriment to the welfare of the Africans themselves, the interests of the West in Africa aresafeguarded? It is not the purpose of this report to make detailed recommendations on specific issues. But certain general principles of association between africa and the free world political, strategic and economic links suggest themselves.The Political Link87. The Western Powers will have done not a little to achieve their purposeif they succeed in solving the complex of racial and constitutional issues whichobstruct the road towards independence-if they succeed, that is, in transferringpower to African or multi-racial administrations in a manner which does notsacrifice political and economic realities to emotional pressure but also leaves no great legacy of bitterness behind. But even when independence has been attained the new States will be inexperienced and volatile entities, liable to be easilyinfluenced and easily subverted. It should therefore be the purpose of the West tomaintain some degree of formal political association between themselves and theindependent African Governments. We have suggested, earlier in this report, thatthere will be a tendency for the new States to come together in various forms of federal grouping or regional alliance, although many practical difficulties will need to be overcome before these links are likely to be very close or, indeed, verypermanent. This situation confronts us with another variation of the basicdilemma. From a purely mercenary and short-term point of view it might well beto the advantage of the Western Powers to encourage the centrifugal forces on theground that they are more likely to secure the defence facilities which they need ifthey have to deal with a multiplicity of weak and divided States than if they are confronted with a relatively small number of organised and competentconfederations, capable of bargaining on level terms. On the other hand, it can hardly be in the ultimate interest of the free world that Africa should disintegrateinto a medley of feeble and quarrelsome communities, an easy prey to every kindof subversive intrigue; and there can be little doubt that the Western governments would be wise to foster the forces making for unity and association wherever theycan do so on the basis of a generally pro-Western sentiment.88. Under the new French Constitution the French Community has comeinto existence. Each Member State of the Community enjoys almost completelocal autonomy and has its own elected Legislature and Council of Government.But control over foreign policy, defence, currency, common economic andfinancial policy, higher education, the supervision of justice and external andcommunal communications is reserved to the organs of the Community i.e., toan Executive Council, composed of the Prime Ministers of France and theRepublics and the French Ministers responsible for the reserved subjects, togetherwith a Senate, composed of members chosen from the legislatures of France andthe Member States, in which France, with her overseas Departments (Algeria,Sahara, &amp;c), holds a majority. The effect of these arrangements is to retain in french hands final control over major issues of defence, foreign policy, &amp;c; andthere is no question of the metropolitan Government being one among equalpartners. For this reason many observers doubt whether the Community canendure for long in its present form; and there is a growing conviction that, if Franceis to retain her links with her former African colonies, she will be compelled to substitute some arrangement resembling our own conception of the Commonwealth.It is perhaps with some such thought in mind that, while Article 86 of the newConstitution lays down the procedure for a Republic to leave the Community,Article 88 contains the concept of &quot; association &quot; between the French Republic (orthe Community) and &quot; States which desire to associate themselves with it in orderto develop their civilisation.&quot; This could comprise not only States already withinthe Community but also others, such as Guinea and the French Cameroons, whichare now outside it. The Belgians also seem prepared to discuss their ultimaterelationship with the Congo in terms of an association between two sovereignindependent States linked chiefly by economic ties.89. If the British territories Central Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika,Zanzibar, Somaliland, Sierra Leone and the Gambia were to follow the patternset by Ghana and Nigeria, they too would all eventually become sovereign
independent States and members of the Commonwealth. But a development ofthis nature would create obvious difficulties. Many of the territories concerned would be very small and all would be to some extent immature and hypersensitive.The other members of the Commonwealth might well think twice about admittingall of them as full members of the Commonwealth. Indeed, it is hardly a practicableproposition; and, in any event, other destinies seem likely for Somaliland and,possibly, the Gambia. But an examination is currently in progress of the possibilityof devising for smaller colonial territories some new status which, while short of full Commonwealth membership, would satisfy their desire for recognition withinthe Commonwealth family. Such a status, if it can be devised, might cover theBritish African territories, apart from the Federation and Kenya, Uganda and tanganyka. The Federation, if it holds together, will be a sizeable and viableunit. The same may prove to be true of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika, especially if, as we hope, they eventually come together in some degree of association. TheCommonwealth is in any event changing, and we may hope that it should be ableeventually to accommodate itself to receive this more limited number of new members.90. It seems, therefore, that for French, Belgian and British territories thereis a prospect of some form of association with the former metropolitan Power onthe basis of equal political sovereignty. This association would no doubt retain thepresent economic links in the case of the French and Belgian territories, a franccurrency and access to the Common Market; and, in the case of the british territories, a currency based on sterling and the advantage of Imperial preferences.By different ways all the territories concerned may be converging on a commonconstitutional destination.91. At the same time we must recognise the possibility that some form of union of independent African States may emerge, transcending the arbitrary andlargely accidental divisions of European linguistic and administrative frontiers.The Ghana-Guinea experiment deserves close attention from this point of viewbecause it proposes itself as a pilot scheme for a Federation open to all african states. In a milder form the same concept is advocated by President Tubman ofLiberia. But a development of this nature would not necessarily disrupt theeconomic and cultural ties on a &quot; Commonwealth &quot; basis which individual states might still wish to retain with the European Powers; and the best hope of thatstability in Africa which the West should seek to promote lies in maintaining and strengthening those ties.The Defence Link92. It is for consideration whether the European Powers should endeavourto reinforce the political connexion by some form of collective defence organisationbetween African States which would link the defence of Africa with the defenceof the free world generally and would provide a measure of deterrence against external aggression and many forms of subversion. But there are several objectionsto this concept. It is improbable that, at any rate for some years after independence,the new African States would wish to be parties to collective defence arrangements in association with any of the NATO Powers (although the Nigerian leaders arenot at present neutralist and have undertaken to enter into a defence agreementwith us). There are also dangers in our encouraging any efforts on the part of african States to associate with each other in this way. In particular, relationswith the Union of South Africa and the Central African Federation would be acomplicating factor. Moreover, it is possible that the emergence of anything inthe nature of an African defence pact might make it more difficult for us tomaintain overflying and staging rights in the independent African States. our attitude towards any moves by African States in this direction would therefore have to be assessed at the time in the light of the risks to our defence interestsand the counter-balancing factors.93. But, whether or not a collective African defence organisation is found tobe practicable, it is important, that the African States should be encouraged tomaintain sufficient local forces for their own security, and should, if necessary be assisted to do so. It is also vital to Western interests that they should be helped to devise their own security intelligence organisations, capable of meeting theSECRET55447 e
threat of subversion, espionage and sabotage inspired by the Soviet Union andthe United Arab Republic. The links between the metropolitan security authoritiesand the intelligence organisations in African territories should be used to educateAfrican administrators and to train African intelligence officers in the techniquesof security intelligence organisation in order that an association may develop instep with constitutional changes and regional groupings as they emerge. experience has already shown that professional liaison of this kind can create a degree oftrust which cuts across political differences and not only ensures a pooling of security intelligence, which is of mutual value, but also provides the opportunityto guide the local authorities in their task of guarding against Soviet penetration.There are obvious risks in promoting a policy of this kind in partnership withinexperienced peoples; but they are less than the dangers of inaction in the face of the growing threat of hostile subversion.The Economic Link94.  The economic development of the independent States will call for aconsiderable degree of practical sympathy and support from the West if africa is not to be driven to turn to the Soviet Union for advice and assistance.  the africans are ambitious to achieve rapid economic, as well as constitutional,advance; but they lack both the means and the experience to do so unaided. Thepolicy of the West must therefore be realistic as well as generous, taking accountof economic limitations no less than of political ambitions.   At the same timeeconomic advance must measure up to the conditions of political success; and,if self-government and independence are to be substantial realities, they must be accompanied and reinforced by progressive economic development and risingstandards of living.  It is impossible to predict the additional capital which Africawill need if these conditions are to he satisfied; and the statistical survey of thecontinent which is being undertaken by the Economic Commission for Africa, the newly-created agency of the United Nations, is not likely to throw significant lighton this problem. But on any reckoning very considerable investment will be needed.This points to an international approach to the problem, designed to ensure thatAfrica will receive special consideration from the various international agenciessuch as the International Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the projected International Development Association and the United Nations SpecialFund.  (The International Bank, for example, has lent muoh less to Africa in thepast than to any other continent.) An approach on these lines could have political as well as economic advantages to the West, particularly in those cases wherecapital provided through an international agency may be more acceptable to anindependent State than bilateral aid.  Moreover, international institutions may bebetter placed to give effective and acceptable advice on development planningthan metropolitan Governments, whether individually or in association.   TheInternational Bank in particular has now had considerable experience of helpingunder-developed countries to formulate development plans on sound lines and of ensuring that the supply of capital is related to a realistic assessment of needs andpotentialities and that individual projects are accommodated to the pace ofeconomic development as a whole.  It can therefore exert considerable influence in inducing under-developed countries to concentrate on a steady expansion ofproduction and dissuading them from schemes on which they may overreachthemselves.  At the same time it would be unwise to assume that internationalsources will by themselves provide sufficient funds for African development; andit should therefore be one of the purposes of the United Kingdom to seek to interest the United States, Western Germany and other industrialised countries ofthe West in the development of Africa and to persuade them to provide capital ona muoh greater and more widespread scale than hitherto.95. If capital will be needed for productive investment, it will be requiredno less urgently for social investment for education; housing and home ownership(coupled with a review of systems of land tenure); and the other social services.Here again we should seek primarily to promote an international approach to this problem; and we should endeavour to secure the support of the proposed IInternational Development Association for the social, as well as the economic,development of African territories. Education will be particularly important. Tothe aspiring African it is a matter of overriding concern. To the United Kingdom
and to other European Governments with interests in Africa (especially theFrench, who have suggested a greater co-ordination of our policies with theirs inthis field) it offers an opportunity of promoting a sense of political responsibility and a means of controlling to some extent the subversion of the young. the dangers of a semi-literate proletariat are well known and well authenticated by experience; and it is as politically dangerous as it is financially extravagant to suppose that education is in itself a panacea for all other social and economicdisabilities. But if it is carefully related to the needs of the recipients and properlyintegrated with other plans for their social and political advancement, it should pay a handsome dividend both in terms of economic betterment and in terms ofa lowering of political tension. Education, and particularly the teaching of theEnglish language, is the essential pre-condition of the most efficient use of all theother, more sophisticated, forms of assistance which the West will need to provideto Africa.96. Technical assistance will, indeed, be required on a scale considerably greater than any which the West has so far envisaged. It is debatable whetherWestern interests will be best served by making such assistance available on a bilateral basis in each case or under the aegis of some multilateral organisation.There is much to be said in favour of the bilateral approach. It makes for speed and for relative simplicity of administration. It enables each donor country to direct its contribution to those areas of the continent, or to those sectors of an individual economy, in which it has a particular interest. It would obviously bedesirable, for example, that Nigeria should look to the United Kingdom for thetechnical assistance which she will continue to need after attaining independence.(A scheme of this kind is, indeed, already being worked out in collaboration withNigeria.) Moreover, the United States Government tend to prefer the bilateraltechnique; and if we are actively to engage their interest in Africa and to encourage them to provide practical support for the African endeavour to achieve economicadvance, it might be unwise to seek to dissuade them from using the means of theirchoice. On the other hand, bilateral assistance might be regarded by some of the recipient countries as perpetuating the appearance of dependence and tutelage;and they might be more disposed to accept assistance if it was offered not by asingle Western Power from whose domination they had recently escaped butthrough some international agency. Moreover, a multilateral approach of thiskind, while not necessarily resulting in any significant increase in the aggregate ofassistance provided for Africa, might gradually help the donors to distribute theirbilateral aid more rationally and equitably among the beneficiaries; and, given thatresources for this purpose will inevitably be limited, there might be advantages,both of substance and of presentation, in an organisation which would be seen to spread the butter more systematically over the bread.97. For this reason it has been suggested that some initiative corresponding tothe Colombo Plan in Asia might be launched in Africa. But the circumstances inwhich the Asian venture was promoted were probably unique; and the analogywould be misleading. Moreover, a &quot; Colombo Plan for Africa &quot; would probablybe interpreted by the Africans as implying that the West was prepared to allocatelarge sums of capital for which the African States could scramble. But the originalColombo Plan has never had a task of allocation of this kind; and although itsBureau has oiled the wheels of the Technical Co-operation Scheme, it has equallyhad no responsibility for allocating technical assistance, which remains on a bilateralbasis.98. This is not to say, however, that there would be no advantage in theexistence of some organisation to foster mutual co-operation between the western powers and the independent African States on a footing of equality and partnership.Within such a framework the existing arrangements for the provision of technical assistance on a bilateral basis could continue substantially unchanged; but such assistance would bear the &quot; stamp &quot; of the new organisation in order to indicate thatit was part of a comprehensive attempt by the West, in partnership with the newStates, to assist them to promote their economic development. The nucleus of suchan organisation may possibly be found in the existing Commission for technical co-operation in Africa South of the Sahara (C.C.T.A.) which comprises the mainEuropean Powers with territorial interests in Africa; the Union of SouthAfrica; the Federation; and Ghana, Liberia and Guinea and in the Foundation
for Mutual Assistance in Africa (F.A.M.A.) which the Commission has recentlyestablished as a centre for arranging technical assistance to the countries of tropical africa. F.A.M.A. is still a very new creation; and the scale of its activity is verymodest. But it could he encouraged and helped to grow, and the recent decisionof C.C.T.A. to move its headquarters to Lagos implies that it will be administeredhenceforward in the African State which is not only the most favourably disposed to the West but is also likely to play a major role in the Africa of the future.99. If an enterprise of this kind were to succeed, it would need to be launchedwith due regard to the risks which it might entail and to the susceptibilities of the newly-independent states. In the past they have been suspicious of C.C.T.A. as a&quot; colonial club,&quot; and, while these suspicions are diminishing as the black Africanmembership of the Commission increases, this development itself contains certaindangers. The position of Ghana as would-be leader of the Pan-African movement and at the same time a member of C.C.T.A. is an ambivalent one, and the GhanaianGovernment may at any time press for the extension of the Commission to includethe North African countries. Moreover, the association of the black african countries and South Africa within the Commission is, naturally, not an easy one.Three, or possibly four, more independent countries may join the Commission in1960 (Nigeria, French Cameroons, Togoland and, possibly, Somalia); and this increase in membership may be regarded as completing the evolution of theCommission into an independent association of African states, albeit one whichmaintains special links with the West.100. Nevertheless, this development need not be to our disadvantage. If itis true that it is the willingness of the West to provide economic assistance whichwill be regarded by the Africans as the touchstone of our sincerity, it must be inour ultimate interest to demonstrate that willingness as convincingly as we can and to be prepared, for this purpose, to work with an organisation which african states have helped to create and will increasingly control. And, while technical assistance outside the United Nations must continue to be based on bilateral agreements, there may be a part, even if a comparatively modest one, for a non-United Nations international organisation to play. Such an organisation wouldassociate the independent African states with the West as equals in a mutualenterprise; and it would avoid any implication that the help and encouragementwhich we were prepared to provide were being imposed by a superior people fortheir own profit or were being offered in a spirit of patronage. It might also engagethe interest of the United States and other Western Governments, including perhapsCanada and Western Germany, who are. likely to be both willing and able txOcontribute to the development of Africa. Properly presented, a scheme on theselines could be of psychological value in demonstrating the desire of the West toassist Africa on an organised and continuing basis and on terms of equality.101. The details of such a scheme do not lie within the scope of this report.They would need to be worked out with care; and the scale and nature of theUnited Kingdom contribution would need to be determined in relation to the considerable assistance which we are already providing to those territories where we retain direct responsibility and are likely to continue to wish to provide even after they have attained independence. Moreover, the venture would serve at least initially only a supplementary purpose as an addition to the main streamof bilateral assistance; and it would be foolishly optimistic to overrate its immediatepractical effect. The relationship of Member Governments with C.C.T.A. willprobably remain a loose one, and neither the Commission nor F.A.M.A. is likelyto develop into a strong organisation for some time. But, subject to thesereservations and to a more detailed examination of its implications, a scheme ofthis nature, providing for bilateral assistance to the African States under the aegis of an international organisation which might well be built gradually on the foundations of the existing F.A.M.A., could provide the opportunity for a usefulgesture of practical and co-operative assistance by the West to Africa.V.- CONCLUSION102. The purpose of this report has been to survey the forces at work in africa, to attempt to predict their outcome in terms of the African scene in 1970,
to indicate the problems in Africa with which the free world will be confrontedby these developments during the next ten years and to suggest certain basic principles by which Western policy should be guided during this period. We havenot sought to solve individual problems; we have attempted only to set them inperspective. So considered, they appear as a series of dilemmas. It may be helpful to restate the more important of these as briefly as possible:  (a) Racial Relations and Constitutional Development. The pace of the advance towards independence has become rapid in much of Africa.France has granted all her colonies internal self-government, with theright, at least in theory, to opt for independence at any time; and theBelgian Congo is likely to reach the same position in a short period.We ourselves have moved even faster in West Africa. But in the eastand south the position is different. If, on the one hand, we retreatthere too rapidly before the rising tide of Pan-Africanism, we shallrun the risk of transferring power to local Governments before theyare competent to exercise authority or to maintain stable and viableadministration. We shall expose volatile and unsophisticated peoplesto the insidious dangers of Communist penetration. And we shalljeopardise European interests and investments, which have made the major contribution to the development of large parts of Africa and canclaim the main credit for the gradual improvement in the Africanstandard of living. This danger is particularly acute for the UnitedKingdom in relation to East Africa. If, on the other hand, we are toointransigent in opposing African aspirations or, where Europeanminorities are dominant, are too ready to appease them, we run the riskof being identified with the extreme racial doctrines of the Union ofSouth Africa, of exacerbating African hostility towards the european and of provoking the African States, when they finally achieveindependence as in the end they must to turn more readily towardsthe Soviet Union. This danger arises with particular urgency for theUnited Kingdom in relation to Central Africa. The West must therefore seek to steer a middle course between these extremes, bearingwell in mind that, while the Soviet Union will be alert to seize every opportunity to exploit our dilemma, Pan-Africanism in itself is notnecessarily a force which we need regard with fear and suspicion. Onthe contrary, if we can avoid alienating it and can guide it on linesgenerally sympathetic to the free world, it may well prove in the longer term a strong, indigenous barrier to the penetration of Africa by theSoviet Union and the United Arab Republic.(b) The Strategic Interests of the West in Africa. In the short term it may appear to be essential in the interests of the West, and particularly theUnited Kingdom, to demand the retention of defence facilities in africa as a condition of conceding independence. But in the longer term wemay well gain, rather than lose, the sympathy and support of newlyindependent States if we are able to refrain from seeking to acquire,retain or use facilities which appear to be necessary from a purelystrategic point of view. On each occasion the West will have to choose;and the difficulty of the choice for the United Kingdom lends additionalurgency to the need for a re-examination of our global strategy in anattempt to determine whether we can devise some alternative defence policy which will provide adequate protection for our world-wideinterests but will make us less dependent on the good will of african states which are likely to be predominantly neutralist in sentiment.(c) The Economic Development of Africa. If Africa is to remain loyal to theWestern cause, its economic interests must coincide with, and reinforce,its political sympathies; and one of the major problems of the relationship between the West and Africa will be to ensure an adequateflow of economic assistance, and particularly capital, through variouschannels to the newly emerging States. On any reckoning the amountsrequired will be considerable; and, if the Western Powers areunreasonably insensitive to the economic aspirations of independentAfrica, the Governments of the new States may be compelled to turn to the Soviet Union for the assistance which they will certainly need.
In the longer term the European Common Market may increase the flow of European capital for African development. But the commercialprovisions of the Treaty of Rome, particularly the new preferentialarrangements which it envisages, will be liable to work to the more immediate disadvantage of those States (particularly British colonial jterritories) which are debarred from entry into the Common Market.Here again the Western Governments will have to choose. If they attach sufficient importance to avoiding African disunity, they will need to negotiate some modification of the Treaty of Rome in orderto mitigate its commercial effects. On the other hand, if the Six refuseany mitigation of the serious disadvantages for some African territories which may result from a changed pattern of trade, a dangerous new-divisive element will have been introduced into the continent.103. Each of these problems needs further detailed consideration. Moreover,they are all inter-related not only in terms of their impact on Africa itself but also interms of their effect on the metropolitan Powers involved. Neither the UnitedKingdom nor any other administering Power in Africa can consider its policy towards African territories in the light of the issues arising in those territories alone;and the Western Governments must seek to strike a balance between their particular interests and obligations in individual territories and their more general interests and responsibilities both in other parts of Africa and in the world at large. For theUnited Kingdom it is especially important to harmonise our policies towards theemergent countries of Africa with the policies which are prescribed by our relationswith other colonial Powers in Africa. Until about 1957 the former factor hardlyarose; and after 1965-70 the latter should largely have ceased to be relevant. Butat the moment we are compelled to take both factors into account; and the problem is aggravated by the fact that the position and influence-of the United Kingdom in theworld depend to a large extent on what other countries think of us. Their reactionsare liable to be brought into particularly sharp focus at the United Nations; and wecan never afford to forget, for example, that Tanganyika, (like Ruanda-Urundi inthe neighbouring Belgian Congo) is a Trust territory, whose welfare is in some sensethe special concern of the United Nations and provides our enemies in that organisation with an opportunity to indict our African policies before world opinion.104. For this reason there is much to be said for our entering into moresystematic and continuous discussion of African problems with our friends andAllies than has hitherto been customary. Various members of the Commonwealthare now displaying considerable interest in Africa; and this provides us with a valuable opportunity to secure a wider hearing for some of the problems whichhave been discussed in this report. In addition, we are already in touch with theUnited States about various aspects of African affairs. The most important current discussions cover scientific and cultural co-operation; but a few months ago theForeign Secretary agreed with Mr. Dulles that, when both Governments were ready,we should embark on a more general exchange of views with the Americans about future developments in Africa. The French also have for some time been pressing for general discussions about Africa, with the particular purpose of securing agreater co-ordination of our policies. While it would be necessary to avoid committing ourselves as much as the French appear to wish, Ministers have agreed in principle that more regular meetings should take place between representativesof the two countries, both at the Ministerial and at the official level; and a french representative is to arrive in London early in June to prepare the way for formal discussions. The French are likely to attach particular importance todiscussing education, economic development and strategic requirements as wellas the general shape of political development. The Belgians have not so far shown the same desire to exchange views, although they have recently respondedfavourably to a suggestion on these lines. But the French appear to have developedcloser relations with the Belgians than we have; and after independence theBelgian Congo will be liable to become more intimately linked with the Frenchterritories not only by the community of language but also by the shared benefits jof membership of the Common Market. The French have suggested that theexchanges between themselves and the United Kingdom should be extended to belgium, and perhaps to Portugal, in due course; and there might be advantage inan enlargement of the discussions at the appropriate time.
105. If, therefore, this report is approved by Ministers, it might perhapsprovide the basis for further discussions with the other Western Powers in anattempt to ensure that the Governments of the West are broadly in agreement intheir diagnosis of the problems of Africa and in their attitude towards thoseproblems. But once this is clear it will be possible and very desirable-toconsider in more detail how the Western Powers can contribute towards meetingthe needs of the continent in such a way as to enlist African sympathy on the sideof the free world. We have indicated, in Part IV, various means by which we might seek to achieve this objective by maintaining political and constitutionallinks with newly independent African States within the framework of suchassociations as the British Commonwealth and the French Community; by encouraging them to maintain sufficient forces to ensure their internal security andto organise themselves to resist subversion by hostile influences; by promotingsocial progress particularly in education and the teaching of the English language concurrently with constitutional advance; and, above all, by seeking to ensure,primarily through appropriate international agencies, that the new States receive from the West financial and technical assistance on a sufficiently generous andimaginative scale to enable us to hope that their constitutional progress will rest upon a secure and stable foundation of economic development and will be accompanied by the prospect of a higher standard of living. Each of these possibilities needs more detailed examination; and it should be our objective to explore them, in concert with our friends and allies and with other Members ofthe Commonwealth, as rapidly as we can. The problems are many and complex;and the urgency is great.106. It is seldom profitable to attempt to peer very far into the future. Andwe do not claim that the forecasts contained in this report are any exception tothe rule that expectations are often belied by events. Nor do we claim that thereis anything novel in the policy proposals which we have made. The novelty liesrather in the situation which those proposals are designed to meet in theunprecedented pace of political adjustment in Africa. It is impossible to carryout even a superficial survey of the continent without being impressed by two considerations-first, the long lead over the Soviet Union which the West atpresent enjoys in Africa after a century of association; second, the rapidity withwhich the African scene is changing under the impact of new political and socialpressures. The former is an asset to the free world in the twentieth centuryversion of The Scramble for Africa; the latter need not be a liability if the western powers are willing to present a common front to the problems of Africa and to approach them with patience, imagination and courage.May, 1959.
