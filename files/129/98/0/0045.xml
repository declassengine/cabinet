secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1959C (59) 145 Copy No.   3 %4th September, 1959CABINETCONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR Cyprus memorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesAn Act of Parliament will be necessary for the purpose of granting independence to Cyprus. The Cabinet have already agreed (C.C. (59) 44th Conclusions, Minute 4)that the Bill should be regarded as an essential item of the legislative programme.Decisions are now required on the content and timing of the Bill so that instructionsto Parliamentary Counsel can be prepared.The Constitution and United Kingdom Legislation2. The first question for decision is whether provision should be made inUnited Kingdom legislation with respect to the Constitution of the Republic. the drafting of the Constitution was entrusted by the London Conference to a JointCommission in Cyprus on which there are Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot but noUnited Kingdom representatives. The United Kingdom subscribed to the BasicArticles of the Constitution (Cmd. 679, Document II (a)) and will be guarantorsof these basic provisions as parties to the Treaty of Guarantee. We may also wishto reserve to ourselves the right to ensure that the Constitution meets therequirements of the United Kingdom Declaration at the London Conference(Cmd. 679, Document III). The Constitution, however, is not a matter of primaryconcern to the United Kingdom and it might be unwelcome to the Cypriots to have it embodied in Imperial legislation. On practical grounds it might well be impossibleto have an agreed text of the Constitution ready in time for inclusion in the Bill.This technical difficulty would not, however, prevent embodiment of the constitution in an Order in Council.3. It is not strictly necessary for the Act to say anything at all about theconstitution. It could merely provide that from a date to be appointed by Orderin Council Cyprus shall be an independent country and cease to be part of her majesty&apos;s dominions. This procedure, which was followed when Burma was givenindependence, would leave the constitution of the Republic to be adopted and brought into force by whatever local process the Cypriots may agree upon. Therewould, however, be a danger though perhaps a remote one of a hiatus betweenthe transfer of sovereignty and the adoption of a constitution.4. The most satisfactory procedure would be for the Act of Parliament toauthorise Her Majesty in Council to make provision for bringing into operation for the Republic of Cyprus such constitution as may be specified in the Order.The effect of this would be that the constitution would not be actually embodied in the Order, but would be identified as the draft constitution produced by theJoint Constitutional Committee and formally approved by the Governments of greece and Turkey and the representatives of the Cypriots, and (preferably butnot necessarily) by the United Kingdom.5. The Governor of Cyprus has been consulted and agrees with the aboveprocedure.55794
Timing of the Act of Parliament6. There are two factors which may have an important influence on the timing of the Act:  (a) Delimitation of the United Kingdom Sovereign AreasThese will have to be excluded from the operation of the Act (i.e.,&quot; Cyprus &quot; in the Act will mean the Island less the Sovereign Areas);For this purpose the Sovereign Areas will have to be fairly preciselydelimited. This could be done either by the Act itself or by an Order,.. in Council made under the Act. It is suggested that it should be doneby the Act. Parliament will naturally wish to know what areas we areretaining and a question of such importance to the United kingdom should not be undecided at the time when the Bill is introduced. Evenif the delimitation were done by Order in Council, the Ministerintroducing the Bill would have to be able to say, within fairly narrowlimits, what areas were being retained.(b) Cyprus and the commonwealth the modifications that will require to be made to existing Acts ofParliament as a consequence of the changed status of Cyprus will vary according to whether or not Cyprus is to remain within theCommonwealth. In such circumstances the normal practice to-day is for the main modifications to be made by the Independence Actitself, and for the Independence Act to confer on Her Majesty inCouncil power to make any further modifications that prove necessary.If this practice is to be followed in the case of Cyprus, then the Actcannot be passed until the relationship of the Republic of Cyprus tothe Commonwealth has been settled.Elections7. Both Archbishop Makarios and Dr. Kuchuk, the leaders of the Greek -and Turkish-Cypriot communities, have told the Governor they would wish elections for the President and the Vice-President, for the House of Representatives, andfor the two Communal Chambers to have taken place before the establishmentof the Republic. Both leaders had in mind that the first election would take placein December, followed by the others after an interval of a fortnight or so.Archbishop Makarios has recently told the Governor that he would like theelections for the President and the Vice-President to be as early as November,and the Governor has suggested that the plan might be to have elections for thePresident and the Vice-President towards the end of November; for the House ofRepresentatives in the middle of December, and elections for the CommunalChambers at the same time or possibly held over until January. He reports that both Archbishop Makarios and Dr. Kuchuk understand that it will be necessary toprovide that neither the President nor the Vice-President will undertake their dutiesuntil the Republic comes into being.8. There is of course a danger that once elections have been held there maybe some added difficulty for our negotiators, since the President and vice-President-elect will already be in existence even though not vested with their new offices. I do not think, however, that this danger is sufficient reason for not going ahead with preparations for elections. The Order in Council will benecessary to enable the Governor to hold elections, and its terms should be settledas soon as possible. This will entail discussion with the Joint constitutional commission, and I propose to authorise the Governor to go ahead with technicalconsultations, and when these are completed, to submit a draft Order to Her majesty in Council. At the same time I propose to instruct the Governor that he should notat this stage enter into any commitment regarding the date of any elections since it will probably not be desirable to fix a date until it is clear that all the treaties and other documents have been agreed and that there are no outstanding points of substance.recommendations.  I recommend-(a) That the Governor of Cyprus be authorised to raise with the leaders ofthe Greek and Turkish communities the procedure to be followed for introducing the constitution on the lines described in paragraph 4
above. If there are difficulties and a disposition on the part of theCypriots to propose a procedure similar to that in paragraph 3 above,the Governor should refer back for instructions.(b) That a provisional time-table should be drawn up for the introduction andpassage of the Bill bearing in mind the factors referred to in paragraph above.(c) The Colonial Office, Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations office should jointly draw up draft instructions to Parliamentary Counsel forconsideration by the Cabinet Official Committee on Cyprus.(d) That in due course an Order in Council should be made enabling theGovernor to hold elections in Cyprus, and the Governor should be instructed as proposed in paragraph 8 above.&quot;&apos;&quot;     A.
