&quot;SECRET, THIS DOCUMENT IS THE, PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1959C. (59) 103 Copy No. 3 220th June, 1959CABINETRELATIONS WITH THE MALDIVESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations-Negotiations with the Maldivian Government about the re-establishment ofthe air staging post on Gan island were suspended by the Maldivians on17th March. We invited them to resume negotiations in London if they wished.I have now heard that they have declared their willingness to do so. In view ofthis it may be useful to my colleagues to have a general paper summarising thesituation. This is attached at Annex A together with a note on politics andpersonalities at Annex B.2. I summarise the main conclusions in paragraph 3 below, and inparagraph 4 deal with the question of the timing of the negotiations. In viewof other preoccupations and commitments I have held up a reply to the MaldivianGovernment to see first what my colleagues feel about it.3.  The main conclusions are (i) Our sole interest in the Maldives is that we should be able to use thestaging post on Gan island with the maximum possible security and length of tenure.(ii) The present position  is  that we have  practically  completed  theconstruction of the staging post (the runway is completed) and see noobstacles in our way. We have a most friendly and co-operativerelationship with the local population. Our legal title to be there is sound.(iii) Ideally it would be convenient and helpful from the propaganda pointof view if we could get the Maldivian Government to sign the detailedagreements covering the day-to-day operation of Gan. This is, however,neither essential nor even urgent. On the whole, delay is on our side and to their harm.(iv) It follows that we do not want to appear over-anxious for negotiations to be resumed. The Maldivians will only put up their price, as theyhave done before. As we have now almost reached the limit ofconcession we should have to reject their demand. There would thenbe no further stage of negotiation in sight and our position would be worse than now.(v) The revolt of the Southern atolls is of practical benefit to us.  It has enabled us to complete the staging post without friction and hasfrightened the Maldivian Government who fear we may recogniseSuvadivan independence. Recognition is a good tactical card to have in our hand but we should avoid playing it if at all possible. It wouldsaddle us with a heavy burden, cause justified alarm in other ProtectedStates and Protectorates, destroy the legal basis for our presence in Ganand remove the last restraint we have on the Maldivian Government.They might throw in their lot with any country which would protect them.(vi) Even if the Maldivian Government do eventually sign the agreements weshall have a difficult and slow task in reconciling the Suvadivans to therestoration of their authority.55380b
4. On 15th June the Maldivians informed our High Commissioner, and simultaneously announced to the Press, that they accepted our invitation to resume negotiations and would be ready to leave for London about 25th July. They couldnot have chosen a more inconvenient time. We could suggest to them that theyshould come earlier in July. But having regard to their dilatoriness, it is most unlikely that they could get themselves ready in time. Also, there is a lot to be said for, having them here later, at a time when Parliament is not sitting. However, after having had to wait for some three months for them to reply, it would seemparticularly undesirable to risk protracted controversy during the months of august and September. So the alternative is to put them off for two months and invitethem to come here at the end of September for discussions early in October.Convenience is not, however, the only reason. Such a postponement would alsodemonstrate to them that we are not in any hurry. This might be quite a salutaryblow to their confidence; and, besides this, it would give the Royal Air Force more time to bring the staging post still nearer to completion, without interruption.5. I therefore recommend that we should ask them to postpone their visit for two months.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,19th June, 1959.ANNEX a present State of Relations with the MaldivesThe importance of the Maldives to us dates from the decision taken in 1956 toreactivate the airfield built during the war at Gan. Our only object is to complete the airfield and obtain the maximum possible length of security of tenure at Gan.If that is attained, the affairs of the rest of the Maldives will be of no more interestto us than they have been in the past hundred years, although we should perhaps be more alive than in the past to our moral responsibility for their welfare.2. Despite ineffectual attempts by the Maldivian Government to hold up theconstruction of the airfield, and their continued unwillingness to fulfil their obligations by signing a lease agreement for Gan, we have succeeded in bringing the airfield near to completion while at the same time avoiding any irreparablerupture in our relations with them, with ail the unpleasant consequences this couldentail. The runway is finished, although the airfield will not be up to standardfor Britannias and Comets until the end of the year. But it can now safely besaid that whatever happens we have our airfield. It would be virtually impossiblefor the Maldivian Government to turn us out. Moreover, we have an excellentworking relationship with the local people at Gan. In other words, we have goteverything we want and the Maidivian Government have so far got nothing. Theseare the facts that count.3. Ideally, for the sake of world opinion, we should like to complete the picture by settling the Gan lease and status of forces agreements. We have a goodtitle to be at Gan by virtue of the 1953 Protection Agreement, but having embarked on the detailed agreements covering our day-to-day use of Gan it is unsatisfactoryto leave them unsigned. Their existence unsigned lends colour to stories that wehave no right to be at Gan. So long therefore as there remains any possibility of persuading the Maldivian Government to sign it should remain a subsidiary objectto do so. But our need for their signature is neither great nor urgent; we are gettingon quite happily without it. So long as they do not denounce the existing ProtectionAgreement, and we keep open our offer to resume negotiations, our position is satisfactory both legally and from the point of view of world opinion. Resumptionof negotiations would present problems in-any case, (unless they are prepared togive way) because on the all-important revision pf the. Protection. Agreement weare already within a very small distance of the limit of possible concession.; Sofar as can he seen there is no particular advantage to us in signing the present not \very satisfactory text,.in 1959 rather than in 1960 or 1961. Delay works to ourjadvantage.; \Jl^&apos;TZ \\ .. ^ ino;^:-^&apos;;^ sril V^&amp;AVA
Possibility of Recognising Dissident government. Nevertheless, if an agreement does not mature, a time will come when itwill be tempting to consider throwing over the Male Government in favour of full support of the dissident Suvadivans who, in exchange for a guarantee ofprotection, would probably sign an acceptable agreement about Gan tomorrow.The consequences of such action however would be very grave as compared withthe consequences of carrying on as we are:-(i) We should be taking under our wing a non-viable group of three atolls,the northernmost being some 60 miles from Addu atoll, with a total population of only about 20,000. We should certainly be obliged tosupport them economically for an indefinite period and very likely alsoto defend them from attack by the Male Government, which would bean exacting commitment.(ii) Having recognised the Suvadivan dissidents we should have done ourworst so far as the Maldivian Government were concerned. Th^ywould have no further cause for restraint. It is reasonable to assume that one reason why they have never demanded our departure fromGan is fear that we would thereupon recognise the Suvadivans and make our agreement with them. Recognition is, tactically speaking,a most valuable card which we are glad to have in our hand but shouldnot play if we can avoid it.(iii) Recognition of the Suvadivans would be treated by the MaldivianGovernment as repudiation by us of the 1953 Protection agreement which is the legal foundation for our position at Gan. It would besurprising if they did not seek to raise the matter in the world forumand to muster pressure for our departure. It would be difficult for usin the circumstances to adopt the attitude, as we otherwise could, thatas the Maldives were a Protected State the dispute was a domesticmatter.(iv) To sponsor the disruption of a Protected State would set a most unfortunateprecedent and might have serious repercussions on our relations withother Protectorates and Protected States. Our treatment of theMaldivian Government, however much we had been provoked, wouldappear as an act of bad faith motivated by our determination to haveGan. We would risk raising doubts in the minds of other protectedrulers of our trustworthiness and might raise the hopes of dissidentminorities of our readiness to recognise them.5. But short of recognising the Suvadivan dissidents there are ways in whichwe have profited from the rebellion and can continue to do so. Our good relationswith Afif, the Suvadivan leader, have enabled the work on the airfield to proceedapace since he took over. It is due to him that the frustration and delays imposed by the Male Government have been removed. With his co-operation we have made an arrangement whereby the last of the islanders will be removed from Gan leaving it completely free for the airfield. We have the full co-operation and goodwill ofthe local populace who know they are ultimately dependent upon us for their safety.In return we have given certain assistance to Afif. We sent food when there v/asstarvation in Huvadu. We have given Afif a credit on the Navy, Army and AirForce Institute of  10,000 for foodstuffs. We have helped him with the collectionof taxes. We are planning to go ahead with an anti-filariasis campaign which,while primarily for the protection of the R.A.F., will also benefit the local Adduans.We are also allowing the local islanders to move into houses built in Addu as partof the resettlement scheme for the islanders displaced by construction of the airfield. We are now seeing what can be done to help market the Suvadivan catchthis autumn. Generally our aim is to keep ,the Suvadivan economy in good shape and the islanders in good heart.ANNEX BDifficulty of Negotiating with Maidivian government. If we are to continue to seek to do business with the Maldivian government it would be valuable to know more about their internal politics than we do at thepresent. (A note on this aspect is attached at Annex B.) We are seriouslyhandicapped, however, by the lack of a representative at Male. We have been pressing the Maldivian Government since construction of the airfield started to55380
receive a United Kingdom representative; but they have consistently refused.They have also refused to allow an airstrip to be built near Male which would givea representative some freedom of movement. The Maldivian Government were again reminded of our wish to build this airstrip earlier this year. The opportunitywas also taken of the appointment as -United Kingdom Adviser on MaldivianAffairs at Gan of Mr. Arthington-Davy to replace Major Phillips to remind theMaldivian Government, at the end of April, of our wish to have someone at Maleand to suggest as a first step a courtesy call by Mr. Arthington-Davy. No replyhas been received to either suggestion. Our right to have a representative at Malebefore the Male Government receive representatives from any other countries wasalso written into the latest draft of the Protection Agreement. However, in the face of the Maldivian Governments blank refusal to accept a representative, it isnot possible to carry the matter further, particularly when it is remembered thatMale is an isolated atoll some 400 miles away from Colombo and 350 miles fromGan with no regular means of oomimunioation whatsoever, so that unless hisposition was adequately safeguarded any representative, who would be entirelydependent on the Maldivian Government for housing, food and so on, could be prevented -by them from performing his functions at all. (A map is attached at appendix.)7. There have been suggestions that we should seek to pursue the negotiationswith the Maldivian Government by sending a special envoy to Male, but here again similar objections exist. Both the High Commissioner and Deputy HighCommissioner in Colombo have on occasion been to Male to attempt to forwardmatters. On both occasion they were treated with scant courtesy, left to cool theirheels while the Maldivians purported to deliberate and were obliged to leave withoutany progress whatever having been made. On the former occasion we wereaccused of &quot; gun-boat diplomacy &quot; because the High Commissioner travelled, as hasbeen the custom, in a naval vessel, and the Maldivians sought to make a stirinternationally about the matter. There is the additional and very serious objectionto offering to send someone to Male, that it would be likely to be regarded by theMaldivian Government as a sign of anxiety on our part and would encourage themto put their price up yet again.8. In any case it now appears that the Maldivians are willing to come toLondon. There are positive advantages in this. To begin with it is essential tothe maintenance of the posture which we have taken before world opinion with reasonable success to date that we should show ourselves at all times ready tonegotiate; and as we have already had rounds of negotiation in Male and Colomboit is natural now to offer London. Moreover, the Maldivians have specificallyasked to come to London and it would look bad for us to refuse. They are anunsophisticated lot and may be impressed by their surroundings here. They will certainly have no room for doubt that they are now dealing direct with thoseultimately responsible and must either settle or break. This may help them to make up their minds.Possible Consequences of a Break with Male9. It must be recognised that, however much patience we show in the comingnegotiations in London we may not be successful, and a time may come whenagreement with the Maldivian Government is clearly out of the question. they themselves may force the issue, for example by demanding our departure fromGan and renouncing the Protection Agreement. In this case they are likely to seek to make our position at Gan as uncomfortable as possible. They would almost certainly attempt to have their case taken up for them by other countries and they might succeed in having it raised in the United Nations. They mightoffer facilities in other atolls to hostile governments, e.g., the United Arab Republicor the Russians. While they would not attempt to interfere with our use of Gandirectly they might well attempt to take by force Huvadu and Fua Mulaku atolls.10. We should have to meet these situations as they came. It may however be said that, while they could seriously embarrass us, and this is a situation whichas indicated above we should do our utmost to try to avoid, it is very doubtful ifthe Maldivian Government could ever make our position at Gan untenable now that we are firmly ensconced there. The Maldivian Government have already tried to get support from India, Ceylon and the United Arab Republic.   All these
approaches have been unsuccessful. Mr. Nehru took a perfectly correct attitude.Mr. Bandaranaike has disclaimed any but a commercial interest. We do not know what reply the U.A.R. have given. They are hardly likely to think it practical politics to offer to replace us as Protecting Power, a task beyond the capacity of theEgyptian Navy. The Russians have never in the past shown any wish to occupyso remote a naval base as the Maldives would be for them. An appeal to world opinion or the United Nations is more likely; but we have a pretty good case-sohave the Suvadivans, which will be a help and the Maldivian Governments effortsso far have made little impression. At any rate it is better to risk this; rather thanabandon the airfield or sign an unsatisfactory agreement. It would clearly thereforebe a mistake to make any concessions in the negotiations;which would weaken ourposition at Gan; we might however have to pay more. And if the Maldivians haveto go away empty-handed this is likely to undermine their position at home.Problems Which Will Arise if Agreement is Signed11. If on the other hand the Maldivian Government sign an agreement with us we shall have to consider other problems arising out of our moral responsibilities to the Suvadivans. The Maldivian Government will undoubtedly in this case seekhelp from us in re-establishing their authority. They will have additionaljustification for this request because by signing the agreements we will havereaffirmed our recognition of their full authority over all the islands, and tocountenance a dissident group would be inconsistent with our obligation not tointerfere in Maldivian internal affairs.12. On the other hand, it would be impossible simply to throw Afif and theinhabitants of the three southern atolls to the wolves. Besides being discreditableit would undoubtedly make us unpopular in the very area where we rely on good relations. It must also be recognised that to restore Male authority will be extremely difficult even if we co-operate wholeheartedly; it is clear that the MaleGovernment is intensely unpopular, especially in Huvadu.13. It is impossible to say here and now what exactly we shall be able to do to restore the former relations between Male and the southern atolls. We shall haveto be guided very much by circumstances as they arise and it would be best to make this clear from the outset to the representatives of the Male Government. All that can be done at present is to establish certain principles by which we should be guided (i) There must be no victimisation, although certain of the leading dissidentsmight have to withdraw from active politics for a time. ...-(ii) Progress will have to be slow and gradual; this is a matter of restoringconfidence which has been seriously shaken. : Both sides will beintensely suspicious and both will need a lot of persuading.14. If we make these two principles plain to both sides in the dispute we mayin time get things back on the right lines.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,18th June, 1959.SECRET.
ANNEX CMALDIVIAN POLITICAL SCENEA. Political institutions in the absence of a United Kingdom representative at Male and given thetortuous and secretive nature of Maldivian politics, where Governments change forthe most part only as the result of coups, it is extremely difficult to gain any clearpicture of the Maldivian political scene.2. When the Maldives reverted to Sultanate Government in 1954 after one year as a republic a new modern-style constituticn was drawn up. This provides for aSultan who is elected nominally for life but can be removed for misconduct, a PrimeMinister appointed by the Sultan on the advice of the Majlis and a cabinet of Ministers, or Ministers&apos; Majlis, appointed by the Sultan on the recommendationof the Prime Minister. The legislative body is the Subjects&apos; Majlis consisting of fifty-four Members. Six are nominated by the Sultan, eight elected from Male,thirty-eight from the other atolls and two by &quot; the traders of the Maldives.&quot;3. In practice power rests to a great extent in the hands of the Prime Minister.The Sultan is a figure-head and the role of the Majlis is chiefly to endorse the actions of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet. A vote of &quot; especial powers &quot; to deal withthe rebellious atolls is understood to have been taken recently in the Maldives. ThePrime Minister, Mr. Ibrahim Nasir, is reported to have obtained an overwhelming majority. The mechanism by which this vote was taken is unknown, but it is likely that it bore little resemblance to Western democratic methods.4. All political power is monopolised by the island of Male, the capital. Theother atolls are regarded purely as places of exile for those who have drawn a losingticket in the political lottery on Male and as sources of income, to be squeezed bytaxation and oppressive monopolies, to provide the prizes for the winners. Certainleading family groups appear to monopolise the main political posts, the best known and until recently, the most powerful of which was the Didi family. Mr. IbrahimAli Didi, with whom as Prime Minister the Heads of Agreement for Gan wereinitialled in 1956, fell from power as the result of a coup in December 1957. his successor, Ibrahim Nasir, who was formerly deputy Prime Minister, belongs to adifferent family group. All the main families in Male are, however, closelyinterrelated and political allegiance does not always follow strict family lines. Forexample, while Mr. Ibrahim Ali Didi is himself confined as a political prisoner,the Didi family is still represented in the present Government by Mr. IbrahimHassan Didi, Minister of Trade and Commerce, and Mr. Ibrahim Fareed Didi,Minister of Public Works. The Sultan, H.H. Al Amir Mohammed Farid Didi, isalso a member of the family. It appears probable, therefore, that political feudsand alliances are determined neither by ancestry nor of course by principle butonly by considerations of the advantage of the individual or his immediate relations.(Mr. Afif Didi, the leader of the dissident movement in the southern atolls, is adistant member of the family, although there is no connection between the fall ofMr. Ibrahim Ali Didi in Male and the outbreak of the rebellion, all recent MaleGovernments having been unpopular among the southern islanders.)5. Apart from the powerful family ties which help to maintain MaldivianGovernments and Prime Ministers in office, an important role in maintaining themin power is played by the small but apparently well trained and effective Maldivianpolice force. This body is paid and equipped by the government of the day andtherefore beholden to it. Political opponents are often sent to distant islands wherethey are confined, the local population apparently being unwilling to help them for fear of reprisals. It is understood that&apos;a curfew is irrjposed in Male which isvigorously enforced by the police. Persons who meet with the Government^displeasure are, if convicted, commonly punished by brutal beatings. Male&apos;s powerover the outlying atolls is reinforced by the control which it exercises over thedistribution of imported food and the export of dried fish.6. There have so far been no indications of any falling out between themembers of the present Maldivian Government apart from some squabbling overthe more lucrative posts such as that of Maldivian representative in Colombo.Mr. Zaki, the former representative, has been removed apparently at the instance
of Mr. Farouk Ismail, the Minister of Justice, and now himself Trade representative in Colombo, and replaced by Mr. Hilmly Didi, who is also Minister of Health.Changes of Government in the Maldives can, however, take place overnight andthere can be no certainty about the likely length of tenure of office of the present government.7. The United Suvadivan Islands, claiming to be an independent republic,came into existence as a result of the revolt of the three southern atolls of Addu,&apos;.Fua Mulaku and Huvadu or Suvadiva. (See the Appendix.) The cause of therevolt was the bad treatment by Male of the outer atolls grinding taxation and noredress of grievances. Resentment was brought to the boil when the representativeof the Male Government announced simultaneously on 1st January a substantial increase in taxation coupled with a ban on Maldivians taking employment withthe R.A.F. The &quot;President of the Republic&quot; is Abdullah Afif Didi (see B (ii)below.) He heads an executive committee of six chosen from a &quot; People&apos;sCommittee &quot; of fifty-two members elected by the islanders apparently by a showof hands, the larger islands sending more members than the smaller. Afif&apos; washimself elected by a ballot of the entire male population. The &quot; People&apos;sCommittee &quot; meets once a month, or more often as necessary.B.
