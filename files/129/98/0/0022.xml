H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,14th July, 1959.
NOTE OF VISIT TO UNITED STATES AND CANADA[25th June-4th July, 1959)Note by the Economic Adviser to Her Majesty&apos;s GovernmentI visited Washington from 25th June to 1st July and then spent three days in ottawa for the meeting of the United Kingdom/Canada Continuing Committee.Sir Denis Rickett of the Treasury joined me in Washington on 28th June and heis making a separate Report on his conversations, in most of which I participated.I also saw a number of economists at the Council of Economic Advisers, the federal reserve Board, and on other official and unofficial occasions. This note gives mygeneral impressions.2. The United States Economy is now expanding rapidly: practically allobservers under-estimated the speed of the recovery. The index of productionin May was no less than 20 per cent, above the low-point of April 1958. and 4 percent, above the previous peak (in 1957). In recent months unemployment has fallen rapidly and it has almost ceased to be a political issue.3. The Outlook. It is generally expected that output will continue to increase at any rate into 1960. Government expenditure and house-building are ceasingto exert much expansionary force, but consumption is increasing and fixed investment has now begun to expand.4. But how far the recovery will proceed, and the time at which anotherdown-turn will occur, must be regarded as very uncertain. Some anxiety is expressed about the growth of stock exchange speculation and the dangers of a sharp break in prices (though another 1929 seems out of the question). The main problem, however, is to know how fiscal and monetary policy will affect thesituation.5. On the economic front, the Administration is preoccupied with the dangers of inflation, which now include apprehensions about the balance of payments andthe reserves. It is practically a new feature of the Washington scene to have theseworries about the reserves and the consequences for the rest of the world may be far-reaching.6. The retail price level has been fairly steady for some time and there is no immediate sign of it going up, though wholesale prices are rising. Productivityhas increased sharply since output has gone ahead so much faster than employment.Nevertheless, the Administration is very much afraid of the return of inflation and does not know what to do. Two Committees are now studying the problem, oneset up by Congress which will, I think, take much the same line as the government does in the United Kingdom, i.e., that high employment and stable prices can onlybe consistent if workers and employers show some restraint. The other, a CabinetCommittee under the United States Vice-President, Mr. Nixon, appears to be goingto take a rather extreme Right-wing economic view, that the important things areto limit the money supply, balance the Budget and check the monopolistic powersof big business and big labour unions. It seems quite likely that the administration will take steps to check the current expansion before very long interest rates arealready rising.7. The Balance of Payments. The United States had a balance of paymentsdeficit of $3 billions last year and has forecast a similar deficit for this year. Lastyear they actually lost $2-3 billions from the gold reserves. Although, contraryto what is widely believed, the United States has had a deficit in most years since1950, the present rate is much larger than has been normal. And though theUnited States still has the bulk of the gold reserves of the free world, it clearlycould not go on losing at last year&apos;s rate for very long.8.  This development has begun to cause anxiety and, indeed, alarm.  It isQought to be due partly to rising prices having made United States exportsuncompetitive and partly to the large sums being given to other countries formilitary and economic aid.   (It should be added that there is not much solidevidence that their exports are uncompetitive.)
9. Although it is dangerous to rely too much on the continuance of trends in economic affairs, the United States is clearly right to be worried about the present one. The situation and prospects have recently been studied by our Embassy in washington and the conclusion is reached that if there are no sharp changes intrends or policies, the deficit may well go on at an annual figure of the order oi$2 billions. . It is thus of the utmost importance for us (and for the rest of the frelworld) to know what the United States is likely to do. For deficits of the kind which existed last year and is likely this year make the whole trading and reserveposition of the rest of the world very much easier. American aid is also ofconsiderable political importance.10. It seems to me extremely unlikely that the Americans will devalue the dollar (raise the price of gold) except as a last resort. The Administration seemedto me to be very much concerned, however, lest the pressures on them to improve their balance of payments would make it difficult for them to resist protectionistpressures and to maintain overseas aid at the level which they think is politicallynecessary. The desire to balance the Budget, of course, strengthens the case forcuts in external aid.11. I formed the impression that the Americans were hoping to get somehelp from like-minded countries in dealing with these problems, and that it was quite possible that an approach would be made before very long. The difficultyhere is that the United States Administration seems to be rather short of people tothink about economic policy matters. I think it likely, however, that there will be pressure to remove the remaining discrimination against dollar goods, to dependless on the United States for military aid, and to do more for under-developed countries: the pressure will be strongest on Germany.12. The United Kingdom gets extremely little military assistance. We arealready making a fairly substantial contribution to under-developed countries but will be pressed to do more. We are removing discrimination rather slowly, and itis very much in our own interests that we should do so as fast as we think ispolitically possible, since we stand to lose much more from any hardening of american trading policy than we can possibly gain from our own restrictions.13. Development Questions. Sir Denis Rickett and I had some discussion on a number of points, especially on India, which he is reporting. I had some general and off-the-record discussions and formed the impression that the americans are in an uncertain mood about the whole question. There is someconflict between the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Anderson, who wants theInternational Development Association, and the State Department which is mainlyinterested in the Development Loan Fund. The basic questions involve decisions(a) whether to give some sort of underwriting commitment to under-developed countries so that they can plan their programmes for some years ahead; (b) how toexercise pressure on them to see that they make sensible plans and do not simplywaste what they get; (c) how to get some co-ordination amon,^ the countries whichwill have to find the money, without appearing to dictate to the countries whichwant it. There is, for example, a strong political objection to using the north atlantic Council for this purpose.14. I think that there is little doubt that the Americans will be givingincreasing attention to these problems and that we have a good chance to influencetheir thinking if we wish to do so and are prepared to make some commitment.R.
