DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)i...............&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;---------------C.(59) 137 COPY NO.24th July, 1959CABINETAGRICULTURAL POLICY:  WITHDEA WAL OF marginal production GRANTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland on 14th July the Cabinet invited me to prepare a revised statement,in consultation with the Minister of Agriculture (C. C. (59) 4lst Conclusions,Minute 5).     I have discussed the draft statement given in the annex to my previous memorandum (C. (59) 111) with the Minister and we have agreed the revised version attached which differs from the original by the inclusionof the words underlined.2.        I would propose to make this announcement during the second week of August in the form of a letter to the Scottish National Farmers&apos;Union.    There is a reasonable hope that this announcement would allay theserious concern which has been expressed in Scotland on this subject,although protest may still arise, particularly because of the uncertainty as to the provision after 1962.3.        I should like to make one comment on the Home Secretary&apos;smemorandum (C. (59) 133) about the position in Northern Ireland.    Para-graph 4 refers to the considerable benefit which the Small Farmer scheme will confer on some 20,000 to 25,000 Northern Ireland farmers, andmentions that the annual expenditure in Northern Ireland under the scheme will be of the order of  1. 5 millions compared with  600,000 which was spent in the last year on marginal assistance.    I understand that thecorresponding figures for England and Wales are  3.9 millions underthe Small Farmer Scheme as compared with the  97 0,000 spent onmarginal assistance last year.    The position is very different in Scotlandwhere only approximately 5,000 farmers, of whom 2,500 have been receiving marginal assistance, are eligible under the Small FarmerScheme, and where the annual expenditure under the Scheme will be ofthe order of 350jOOO compared with  1. 2 millions which was spent in thelast year on marginal assistance.J.S.M.Scottish Office, S. W. 1.24th July, 1959.
REVISED STATEMENTMARGINAL AGRICULTURAL, PRODUCTION scheme in scotland the Secretary of State announced in Parliament on 18th Marchthat the Scottish National Farmers1 Union wished to make further representa-tions about the future of the Marginal Agricultural Production Scheme inScotland.    Talks between the Department of Agriculture and the national farmers&apos; Union on the subject have now been completed, and the Govern-ment have reviewed the situation in the light of these talks and of the objectives of agricultural policy set out in recent White Papers on theannual review, including the decision that the Marginal agricultural production Scheme as such will be brought to an end.2. The Government now propose to make a scheme under Section 75of the Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, to cover the three cropping seasons1960, 1961 and 1962.    Assistance under this scheme will take the form of grants designed to encourage the production of feed for livestock.    Theneeds of the farms that have been receiving Marginal agricultural production assistance will be kept under review to see how far, in thelight of the other forms of assistance made available since the inception ofthe Marginal Agricultural Production Scheme, the number of farms thatcontinue to receive such assistance can be progressively reduced.-3. The Agricultural Executive Committees will continue to have discretion to adjudge the degree of marginality of a holding.    They willalso take into account the benefits derived from other forms of assistance(such as improvement grants under the Kill Farming and Livestock RearingActs) and the economics of the enterprise as a whole, including the suitability of the type of farming practised.4. Before the expiry of this scheme a special review will becarried out by the Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees of those farms still receiving assistance.    The position ofthese holdings will then be discussed with the National Farmers1 Union ofScotland in the light of the review and of other forms of assistance thenavailable.July, 1959.
