CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(59) 125 COPY NO.]y^17th July, 1959CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE finance memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Lord Privy SealDuring our present period of office we, as a Government, havereorganised the financial structure in two great fields of public expenditure - Defence and Pensions.   At the Prime Minister!s requesta small group of Ministers under my chairmanship have considered whether a similarly radical revision is called for in a third, theNational Health Service.2.      Over the last ten years the gross annual cost of the Service hasincreased from  450 millions to  750 millions, though in real terms the increase has been not more than about  90 millions.   We aresatisfied that this is not excessive and that for some years to come wemust expect, and accept, a further steady increase.   That is not to saythat, within the present scope of the Service, substantial economiescannot still be achieved over a period: the Health Ministers have been and are taking positive steps to that end.3.     The gross cost is at present met in the following proportions:-Exchequer 72. 7 per centWeekly contributions 13.1 per centCharges 4. 8 per cent the question to which we have chiefly addressed ourselves is whether any adjustment of these proportions is desirable and justifiable now.4.      The answer on which we are agreed is No.   To abolish thecharges, or at least the charge on prescriptions, has great and obviousattractions and could be justified on the ground that the charges comeat a time when the patient is least able to meet them.   But they serve to restrain unnecessary demands on the Service and in any event weare satisfied that, in the light of the forecasts of Government expenditurein the next two years, it would be irresponsible to abolish or evenreduce the charges without making a compensating increase in the weekly contributions.   And the present is not the time for that.5.      For the future we have considered a number of possibilities(a)    To abolish charges and raise contributions would be an extension,philosophically acceptable, of the principle of insurance.-1-
(b) Alternatively, if charges were retained as a restraining factor,there would be budgetary advantages in transferring to thecontributions as much of the Exchequer share of the cost asthe contributions would bear at any given time.(c) Or a system might be devised by which the changing costs ofdifferent parts of the Service were met by the Exchequer,contributions and charges in permanently fixed proportions.We suggest that in due course all these propositions should be further considered.   In addition we shall need to consider how to meet the accumulated and now urgent need for increased capital investment inthe hospital service, even if this has to be done by diversion of resources from other public services.6.     But meanwhile we have thought it expedient to be able to announcesome constructive policy on the sensitive question of charges.   This isnot easy but the opportunity is given by a recent recommendation of theHinchliffe Committee on the Cost of Prescribing, that an agreement shouldbe reached with the doctors by which, for a trial period of two years,they would voluntarily limit the quantity of drugs prescribed for anypatient at any one time.   The Committee recommend that, if the doctorsagree to this arrangement and it proves successful in controlling thecost of prescribing, consideration might be given at the end of the trial period to abolishing the charge.   With our agreement the Minister ofHealth has announced in a debate this week that the Committee&apos;s view on this point is accepted by the Government.7.     One further point: the private patients of general practitionershave always had to pay for their medicines themselves and successiveMinisters of Health have been pressed to allow them to be provided on national Health Service terms.   An arguable case can be made for this concession, although it would require legislation which would be very controversial.   But it would cost the Exchequer  2 millions a year and,moreover, to promise it now would, be to throw away a bargaining counter which might be useful in the coming negotiations on the doctors&apos;pay.   We therefore recommend that a stalling reply be given, to theeffect that the Government would certainly consider the concession in the context of available resources and competing claims if it were shownthat the present position was endangering the existence of private practiceor preventing any substantial number of people from availing themselves of it who would otherwise wish to do so.8.     To sum up, we invite the Cabinet to agree:-(a) That for the time being there should be no promise of radicalrevision in the financial structure of the Health Service.(b) That the various possibilities discussed in paragraph 5 shouldbe further considered in due course.(c) That for the time being we should not concede the provision ofmedicines for private patients on National Health Serviceterms.
We also wish to draw the attention of the Cabinet to an announcementmade this week with our agreement, that the Government are willingto try out a voluntary scheme to limit the cost of prescribing and thereafter to consider abolishing the prescription charge.R.A.B.Home Office, S.W.1.17th July, 1959
