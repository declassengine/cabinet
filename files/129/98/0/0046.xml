ANNEX ASUMMARY OF PRESS REACTIONS TO THE RADCLIFFE REPORTExposition and HistoryThere was general admiration for the effectiveness of the Report as a description of the working of the monetary system (The Times: &quot; A first-rate study &quot;, TheEconomist: &quot; The best existing text-book &quot;), but there was also a feeling that lackof clarity in some of its conclusions was the price of unanimity.2. The historical sections were largely accepted without comment, althoughthe Left-wing Press, particularly the Daily Herald, Reynolds News and Tribune,saw them as an indictment of the Government for handling the nation&apos;s financialaffairs in the wrong way, and proof of the Tightness of policies long advocated by labour.Monetary Policy in the Future3. A number of writers, especially in the more serious papers, felt that theReport leaves unanswered some major questions on the direction of monetary policy.Mr. J. C. R. Dow, Deputy Director of the National Institute of Economic and SocialResearch, writing in The Guardian on 26th August, urged a Government white paper on monetary policy as the first task for the proposed standing committee.Press comment on what the Report had to say on the various aspects of monetary policy is set out below.Monetary Policy only as One of Three Weapons4. This was generally accepted. Dr. Thomas Balogh, writing in the FinancialTimes (21st August) regarded this as a vital conclusion. Mr. Harold Wincott(Investors Chronicle, 21st August) thought the Committee did not rate monetary policy high enough. The New Statesman remarked that the Committee had putmonetary policy where it belongs in the ranks.Bank Rate5. Several papers found the discussion on the use of Bank Rate rather vagueand ambiguous. Sir Oscar Hobson (News Chronicle, 27th August), thought that inpresent circumstances the authorities might prefer to use &quot; that old-fashionedblunderbuss &quot; the Bank Rate rather than experiment with untested chain reactionexplosives. Mr. Robert Neild (Observer, 23rd August) hoped the Report would lead to less fuss around the totem of the Bank Rate.Interest Policy and Debt Management6. There was no quarrel with the importance ascribed to this subject by theCommittee, and it was agreed that there was scope for policy to develop in thedirection proposed. The Economist (22nd August) thought the Committee did not carry through the logic of their argument for more positive use of interest rates,and believed the reason for this was the fear that changes in rates of the necessaryproportions would be too disruptive.7. The Times (20th August) and Lord Robbins (Financial. Times, 21st August)thought the emphasis placed by the Committee on debt management as an instrument of monetary control was right and important.8.   There was little comment in the Left-wing Press.9. Towards the end of August the rise in the United States interest rates ledto comment (particularly in The Times and The Guardian) that the Radcliffe Reportmight profitably be read by those concerned in the American bond market.Liquidity Ratios10. Lombard (Financial Times) and The Times City Editor have expressed doubts about the enthusiasm of the Central Bank and the financial institutions
for the Committee&apos;s proposals. Mr. Harold Wincott sees the Committee&apos;s failurespecifically to recommend the &quot; special deposits &quot; scheme as a snub for the Bank ofEngland. The subject received little attention from the Left-wing Press, althoughReynolds News claimed that Labour had repeatedly urged that there should becompulsory power to alter banks&apos; reserve ratios.Control of Advances, Capital Issues and Hire Purchase11. There was very little critical comment on these topics. Lombard thought the bankers did not regard the Radcliffe Report as having materially altered theprospects of expanding their advances if the level of demand permits. There wasa feeling that hire purchase finance houses escaped lightly. Mr. J. C. R. Dow (TheGuardian, 26th August) thought the Committee greatly exaggerated the importanceof control by trade credit and other financial activities. The rejection of capitalissues committee control was generally welcomed.Bank of EnglandAnnouncement of Bank Rate12. There was a mixed reaction to the proposal that the announcement of bank Rate changes should be made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. the left-wing papers (Herald, Tribune) hailed it as a vindication of Labour ideas.Lord Robbins (Financial Times, 21st August) felt no enthusiasm for the change andthe Economist (22nd August) thought a more accurate form would be for theannouncement to be made by the Bank and in its name, but on the authority ofthe Chancellor. Mr. Frank Cassell (Time &amp; Tide, 29th August) was hostile on thegrounds that the change would invest every movement of Bank Rate with political significance. On the other hand The Times editorial (20th August) found it reasonable and an Evening Standard editorial (27th August) came down strongly infavour of the proposal.Standing Committee13. No very strong feelings have been expressed about this recommendation.The Times (20th August) had reservations. The Guardian and the Sunday Timesfeared that the proposal would lower the prestige of the Bank in the eyes of foreigners. But the idea was acclaimed by the Observer and Reynolds News andthe Left-wing Press generally. It was seen by the New Statesman as a further snubfor the Bank.Status of the Bank14. The Left-wing Press welcomed what they saw as a proposal to shift theresponsibility from the Bank to the Treasury, and Tribune suggested that the exclusion of part-time directors from major policy decisions justified Labour&apos;demand for a Bank Rate enquiry in 1957. The Guardian thought the proposals may impress opinion abroad unfavourably, but in fact leave things virtually as theyare. The Economist thought the proposals more acceptable than the Bankprobably feared. But Sir Oscar Hobson (News Chronicle, 20th August) felt theBank would lose face and the deliberate suppression of its independence was bothunnecessary and unwise.Particular PointsLocal Authority Borrowing15. There was a critical tone in all but the Left-wing Press of the proposal that local authorities should borrow from the Public Works Loan Board at gilt-edged rates. The Economist (22nd August) commented that here the Committeehas gone wildly astray. But Sir Oscar Hobson (News Chronicle, 20th August)found the recommendation sensible.)   Nationalised Industries16. The Committee&apos;s approval of existing arrangements for the nationalised industries to borrow from the Exchequer was generally accepted without comment,
although Sir Roy Harrod (Financial Times, 21st August) drew the moral that weshall not get monetary action functioning smoothly so long as large finance has tobe found for the nationalised industries on a gilt-edged basis.Industrial Guarantee Corporation17. This proposal aroused hardly any comment; indeed it was given littleprominence. Mr. Applebey (Daily Telegraph, 20th August) described it as apractical tailpiece to a workmanlike report.Giro18. This proposal attracted widespread interest, particularly in the popularpapers and the provincials. It is generally accepted as worth examining the daily Mail editorial comment (20th August) was &quot; an excellent proposal &quot;.Information19. The Press gave a unanimous welcome to the proposals for more and better information.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,7th September, 1959.

ANNEX Bj READING GUIDE TO THE RADCLIFFE REPORT(References are to paragraph numbers)This is not a synopsis of the Report but a Guide which may help those whohave an urgent need to understand the structure, arguments and conclusions of this long Report, and to know which passages need to be read in full if a properunderstanding of the main themes is to be gained. (References printed in heavytype are to the paragraphs which must be regarded in this sense as &quot; minimumreading &quot;.)It will be seen that Chapters VI, VII and VIII are the centre-piece of theReport. What precedes them is by way of preparation; and Chapters IX to XIare consequential to the general theme of the three central chapters. Chapter XIIsets out what the Committee believes to be the main ideas that emerge from a study of the Report.This Guide also notes the new statistical material in the Report, and providesas an Appendix a list of the Tables containing new material.Introduction (1-16)This consists of a short account of the Committee&apos;s arrangements for takingand publishing evidence (2-4), of the background of events against which theCommittee&apos;s inquiry has proceeded (5-7), and of the structure of the Report (8-14).Chapter I (17-51)2. This chapter reviews the background to monetary policy since the war,drawing attention to five main features of the post-war situation and contrastingthem with the state of affairs before the war:  (a) The high and relatively stable level of employment (18-21).(b) The increase in the national income (22).(c) The persistent rise of prices (23-26).(d) The pressure of overseas demand and the balance of payments (27-30).(e) The great shortage of capital, both in this country and overseas, due towartime arrears of investment, economic development plans, and theapplication of technological developments (31-40).It refers to the circumstances that made for reluctance to use monetary measuresimmediately after the war (41-46), and the way in which the growth of the public sector has increased the scope for introducing other types of measures (particularlyfiscal measures) of regulating demand and has modified the response of the economy to monetary measures (47-50). Finally (51) it draws attention to the change in the size of the National Debt, to the fact that the Government is now a habitual netborrower even in peacetime, and to the consequent importance of debt management in the conduct of monetary policy.Chapter II (62-72)3. This chapter discusses the objectives of economic policy, showing thatthey have become more complex since before the war, and that it can no longer be assumed that the agreed objectives of policy (summarised in paragraph 69) areat all times consistent with each other. Given the possibility of conflict between these objectives, the Committee argues that the balance between the objectives,and the choice of means of pursuing the objectives, is for Governments toQ determine, though the freedom of choice of Governments is limited &quot; by theimportance of each of these objectives to the continuous and orderly life of society &quot;.
Chapter III (73-123)4. Taking as its point of departure the reference in Chapter I to the growth of the public sector, Chapter III describes the purposes for which the public sectorrequires to raise money, and the methods by which the public corporations andlocal authorities have raised capital finance since 1951 (84-94); and in more detailhow the Exchequer works (77-83) and the methods by which the Exchequer raisesthe finance it requires to meet its cash deficit (including the loans it makes tothe public corporations and local authorities) (95-122). Most of the factual matter in this description is already known. There is little by way of comment; conclusionsof some significance are however noted in paragraphs 112, 115, 116 and 121.The Exchequer financing figures in Table 6 (page 41) are largely new, being basedon figures made available for the first time to the Committee. Table 7, financing of the public sector (facing page 360), also represents a statistical innovation,dependent largely on figures made available for the first time to the Committee.Chapter IV (124-320)5. This chapter describes the behaviour of the main institutions in the monetary system whose behaviour can be expected to have appreciable influence on the facility with which, and the terms upon which, people can obtain finance;and the main channels of credit. The introduction explains that this survey is allincluded in one chaper, because the Committee has found that, by and large, themarket for credit is a single market. The chapter is primarily a factual description,but contains a certain amount of incidental comment as it goes.6. The section on the London clearing banks (125-148) discusses inparticular the nature of the banks&apos; deposits and of their various types of assets, andthe proportions in which these assets are held. The liquidity of &quot;these banks, andits implications for monetary control, are discussed in paragraphs 143 to 146. Thediscussion of the Scottish banks (149-161) concentrates on points at which theydiffer from the English banks; in particular their note issues (not regarded asobjectionable), differences in proportions of time to total deposits and of various types of assets to deposits, their less close relationship with the Bank of England.The Committee considers that the Scottish banks should expose their cash andliquid assets ratios to public view as do the English banks (152). The figures ofliabilities and assets of Scottish banks (Table 9, page 53) are new.7. The section on the discount houses (162-180) considers the houses asdealers in bills and in short bonds. The arguments for the &quot; obligation to cover the Treasury Bill tender &quot; and &quot; the syndicated bid &quot; are discussed in paragraphs167-171; the Committee&apos;s conclusion on the importance of the discount houses inrelation to Treasury Bills is in paragraph 171. The Committee is not clear fromthe evidence that the discount market at all times provides an effective service asjobbers in short bonds, though their importance in the market for short bonds isnot questioned (172-175). The Committee&apos;s general conclusion on the place of thediscount houses in the system is in paragraph 180. The figures of funds borrowedand assets held by the discount houses (Table 10, page 58) are new.8. There follows a short discussion on bill finance (181-184), and the function of the bill of exchange; and then a discussion on the accepting houses (185-196)(particularly their importance both as acceptors of bills and as lenders of money)and on the overseas and foreign banks (197-201). These last two sections containtables of figures of sterling liabilities and assets of these institutions that are new(Table 11, page 67, and Table 12, page 71).9. The following section (202-218) discusses hire-purchase and the financehouses, noting in particular the scale of hire-purchase credit in relation to other forms of credit (203-206), recent developments in the connexions between financehouses and banks (208), and the finance houses&apos; sources of funds (209-213)(particularly their somewhat reluctant dependence on public deposits as opposedto bank advances in recent years, especially during the credit squeeze). It alsonotes (217) that some of the larger houses act as &quot;current account&quot; bankers forcustomers with whom they are in business relationships. The figures of liabilities of finance houses (Tables 13 and 14, pages 74 and 75) are new.
10. The new issue market and the issuing houses are dealt with next (219-234).The procedure of issue is described (222-226), and then the importance of the newissue market as a source of credit, particularly for larger industrial companies(227-229). The problems of small issues are also referred to (229-234).11. The following sections discuss the behaviour and importance of fourgroups of long-term investment institutions: the insurance companies (235-251),the superannuation and pension funds (252-261), the investment trusts (262-277)and the unit trusts (278-284). Points of particular interest commented on are: -(a) The large amounts of money which these institutions have to invest eachyear (238, 252-253).(b) The inclination towards equities as opposed to fixed investment securities(244, 245, 265-266).(c) The relatively small demand (even among the general funds of the insurance companies) for Treasury Bills or under ten year bonds (243, 244, 258,271).(d) The strong appetite of the investment trusts for dollar securities, and themeans by which they satisfy it (267-269).(e) The fact that the unit trust movement has not developed in this country asit has in the United States, and the signs that a considerable expansionmay now be under way (280, 283-284).(/) The effects of interest rate changes on the investment behaviour of these institutions (260, 275).The table of figures of the invested assets of insurance companies (Table 15, page 84)is not greatly different from figures already available, but certain other figures,which are new, are to be found in paragraphs 238, 241 and 248. The Committeeconducted an inquiry into the assets and net investment of superannuation and pension funds in 1957-58, a summary of which is give as Table 16 (page 89). Thesection on investment trusts contains a number of figures given to the Committeein evidence and not hitherto available (paragraphs 262, 264, 265, 268, 269, 271, 272).12. The section on budding societies (285-296) discusses their importanceboth as borrowers (286-288) and as lenders (289); and their liquidity (290); andtheir response to changes in interest rates (291-295).13. There follows a section on trade credit. (297-311): its importance in the economy, and its elasticity (which has in recent years helped to frustrate officialcredit controls) are discussed, and the available statistical information on its extentis drawn together (303-310). The relative paucity of information on this subject is noted (311), and the need for further study stressed.14. The conclusion to this chapter, paragraphs 312-320, draws together themain conclusions suggested by the Committee&apos;s review of the financial institutions of the private sector. The summary tables on the assets of financial institutions and on flows of credit (Tables 20 and 21, facing page 360) could not have been constructed without the statistical information made available for the first time tothe Committee.Chapter V (321-380)15. This chapter describes and discusses the work of the Bank of Englandasr&quot; the market operator between the public sector (to which it belongs) and theprivate sector &quot;. After three introductory paragraphs which indicate the purposewhich this chapter serves in the structure of the Report, there follows a factualdescription of the external (324-333) and domestic (334-367) business of the Bank.Comments arising out of this factual description are:  (a) The Bank&apos;s great skill in the complicated techniques of external operation and management means that it makes, and must make, an important contribution to the formation of external monetary and economic policy(333).(b) Both historically and practically the concept of the Bank as theGovernments banker is of great significance (335, 344).
(c) The Committee accepts the authorities&apos; description of their function inissuing notes as &quot; the passive one of ensuring that sufficient notes arcavailable for the convenience of the public &quot; (348).16. The section on the Bank&apos;s domestic business includes a description(350-352) of the way in which the Bank influences the clearing banks, in particular *Jas to their asset ratios; of its relationship with the clearing banks as the normalchannel of communication between them and the Government (353-354); and of its operations as lender of last resort to the discount market, and of the process bywhich Bank Rate is made effective (355-361). The meagreness of the Bank&apos;annual Report is commented upon (366). The weekly Bank Return is seen to have long outlived its original purpose, but in present circumstances to meet a differentpurpose which justifies its retention (366-367); the Committee recommends that theBank should also publish &quot; certain key figures exposing its operation in the monetary system &quot; (367).17. The last section of this chapter, paragraphs 368-380, on the operations bywhich the Bank of England brings monetary policy to bear through the market uponthe economy is an important part of the Committee&apos;s general theme.Chapter VI (381-529)18. This chapter deals with the influence of monetary measures. The firstsection (381-398) provides what may be described as the theoretical foundation,which the rest of the chapter builds upon, illustrates and develops. It is aninterpretation of how monetary measures work through the monetary system uponthe economy. The argument in this section is therefore of great importance in the structure of the Report. It is summarised in paragraph 397.19. There follows a historical account of the use of monetary measures since1951 (399-426), prefaced by an explanation why this period, and not the wholepost-war period, was chosen for detailed investigation. This account describes inchronological sequence the course of economic events and monetary measures inthe period, indicating where possible from published statements or from evidencetaken the considerations which prompted the action taken.20. Then comes a short section analysing the use of monetary measures,paragraphs 427-435, in the period not chronologically but by the different types of measures. This section serves as an introduction to the longer section (436-474)that follows it, which recapitulates the evidence as to the effects of the various types of measures: (a) Interest rate changes: external effects, paragraphs 436-441, and internaleffects (442-447), paragraphs 448-452, (453-454).(b) Credit squeeze (455^459), paragraph 460.(c) Capital issues control (461-462), paragraph 463.(d) Hire purchase controls (464-468), paragraph 469.(e) The &quot; package deal &quot;, paragraph 470.From this analysis the Committee derives certain general conclusions,paragraphs 472-474, on the effects of monetary measures, and concludes with a recommendation that the Bank of England should be explicitly charged with, and equipped to perform, the duty of making a comprehensive and continuous study ofsuch effects.21. The next section (475-486) discusses how far the environment in whichmonetary measures will have to operate in the 1960s is likely to differ from that ofthe 1950s. The conclusions of this section are summarised in paragraph 486. Inthe light of this discussion the Committee then considers the scope for the use of monetary action in the 1960s in circumstances which fall short of an &quot; emergency &quot;(487-519), and the monetary measures which should be held in reserve for use inan emergency (particularly that of headlong inflation) (520-529). The mainconclusions of these sections are summed up in paragraphs 514, 519 and 524-529,but the whole passage is important in that it contains the Committee&apos;s mainconclusions, paragraphs 487-529, and recommendations on the use of monetarymeasures to influence the economy.
Chapter VII (530-603)22. This chapter discusses the principles and practice of debt management in the role which the Committee sees for it in present circumstances, as &quot; anopportunity for the monetary authorities in their task of influencing the pressure&apos; of total demand&quot;. The introduction to this chapter, paragraphs 530-535,summarises the tasks of debt management and the motives which have governedits practice since the war. This is followed by a statistical analysis of the NationalDebt by types of borrowing, by maturity and by holder. The analysis in thissection (536-541 and Tables 24-28), which is supplemented and expanded inAppendix III, is based to a large extent upon information about the maturitystructure and distribution of the National Debt not hitherto available. In thefollowing section (542-548) there is some discussion of the demand for the debt,in which the following points are among those made:  (a) Though the size of the short-term debt is much greater, absolutely and relatively to the total debt, than before the war, there is also a largerequirement for short-term debt among holders who as a group canbe expected to be reasonably firm holders; it may be that the presentsupply is not so much greater than the ordinary requirements of suchholders than is sometimes thought.(b) The Committee can discern no evidence that there is at present a relativepaucity of demand for medium-term bonds such as would cause pricesof these bonds to be pronouncedly low in relation to prices of short and long-term bonds, though it is not impossible that the demand formedium-term bonds may diminish.23. A discussion of the practice of debt management in 1951-58 (549-556)is prefaced by a diagram illustrating the turnover in gilt-edged securities, based onfigures supplied by the Bank of England and not hitherto available; the mainconclusion of this section is that &quot; at least until 1957 &quot; the policy of the authoritieswas to press sales of long bonds whenever they could do so without forcinggilt-edged prices down (551), though in 1958 they exercised &quot;a more consciousretsraint&quot; on market movements in order to resist any sharp rise of prices (553).At the end of this section the Committee concludes that it is appropriate that parliament should have given the Treasury a wide discretion in debt operations(556).24. There follows a section (557-577) on the principles of debt management.&quot;The task of debt management is ... to push the rate of interest to a level thatis high enough to attract sufficient firm holders of the debt and is yet consistent with a balance between demand in the public sector, demand in the private sector,and the available resources of the economy &quot; (562). The Committee discusses thereasoning behind the authorities&apos; abstention hitherto from attempts to stimulate the demand for long bonds by dropping their prices (564-566); reviews with somescepticism theories that the traditional 3 per cent, on long-term debt is a &quot; normal &quot;rate, to which the market is likely to return in the absence of abnormalcircumstances (567-569); and concludes (570-575) that there are three majorfactors (the steady increase in the debt, the expectation of continuing inflation andthe shift independently of inflation fears toward equities) which are tending toto drag up &quot; the level of bond yields that would be consistent with satisfactoryabsorption of long-term bonds &quot;. The Committee considers &quot; index bonds &quot;, butrejects them (except as a possible expedient for a Treasury driven into a tightcorner in its debt management) because of their potentially harmful effects on confidence in the value of money and disruptive consequences for the economic system (573). The main conclusion of this section is that &quot; the demand for longbonds may be such that a continuance of moderately high rates is reasonable even at times of slackness in production &quot; (though not in a serious slump).25. The remainder of this chapter (578-603) includes several recommendations on the practice of debt management.26.  The Committee endorses (578-580) the present method of issue of w Government bonds, described in Chapter III, though it finds unacceptable thepresent customary announcements of full subscription to issues which are in facttaken up in large part by the Issue Department of the Bank of England, and
recommends that the authorities should announce the maximum amount of an issue in the prospectus, and the amount actually sold outside &quot; the Departments &quot;after the closing of the lists of applications (580). The Committee in generalapproves the method of operating through the Government broker (580-581), butrecommends quarterly publication of figures of net departmental transactions in gilt-edged securities (582) to assist the formation of an informed market andpublic opinion. As to the bill market (583-590), while noting the present&quot; cartelisation and orderliness &quot; of the short market, and regretting a tendency torigidity in the structure of the discount market, the Committee sees no case fordisrupting a system which works satisfactorily for the authorities without apparentlyproviding unreasonably high profits for market institutions (589). It considershowever that the discount houses should not indulge in practices designed apparentlyto discourage outside operators from tendering for Treasury Bills (590). (Figuressupplied to the Committee enable it to point (586) to an increase in non-bankingholdings of Treasury Bills, and to suggest a correlation between the size of theseholdings and movements of Treasury Bill rates in relation to bank deposit rates.)27. As to the financing of nationalised industries (591-595), the Committeedismisses the possibility of a large increase in self-financing by these industries,rejects proposals for some form of equity issue by the nationalised industries, andrecommends that they should continue to look to the Treasury to cover all their permanent requirements (595).28. As to the financing of local authorities (596-600) the Committee pointsout that restrictions on their borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board and difficulty of access to the stock market have forced the local authorities to borrowlarge sums at short term on much more expensive terms than have to be offered by the central Government, thus carrying out an &quot; unfunding operation &quot; cleancontrary to the funding policy of the monetary authorities. The justification forthis has been that, given the difficulty of selling gilt-edged stocks, the only alternative to short-term borrowing of this kind would have been Exchequer lending via thePublic Works Loan Board (P.W.L.B.), which would have had to be financed byan increase in Treasury Bills which would have increased the liquidity of the bankingsystem. The Committee admits some force in this argument when short periodsare in question, but not when the short-term borrowing is prolonged as it has been.It accepts that local borrowing attracts some local capital which would not otherwisefind its v/ay into the gilt-edged market, but considers that it is not worth payingtoo high a premium to achieve this, and therefore recommends that the exchequer should ensure that the premium is kept small by standing ready to provide long-term capital through the P.W.L.B. at current gilt-edged rates at the time of borrowingto any local authority that cannot or does not want to raise the money it requiresin the market on its own credit at a comparable rate.29. As to National Savings (600-602), the Committee recommends somewhatgreater flexibility of rates, and invites the authorities to apply their ingenuity todevising novel instruments to attract savings.Chapter VIII (604-750)30.   This chapter deals with the international aspects of the monetary system.31. It is pointed out (604-611) that the United Kingdom^ dependence on external trade and business activities, and the international obligations and commitments which she accepts from self-interest as much as from duty as amember of the international community, impose certain limitations on her pursuit of domestic economic policy and on the use of monetary measures. Changes inthe terms of trade may affect the level of activity at home, and thus affect the policies to be followed by the authorities; so, too, may the need to preserve a balance of receipts and payments on overseas account. The reserves of gold and foreign exchange provide a buffer between fluctuations in the balance of payments andthe domestic economy, but in recent times an inadequate buffer; &quot; the main turnsin policy have been largely forced on the authorities by movements in the reserves,whether or not the domestic situation needed corrective action at the time or through the measures selected &quot; (611).
32. There follows a discussion (612-633) of the nature and function of theUnited Kigdom&apos;s reserves and of her liabilities, in which it is suggested that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s balance sheet is presented in too unfavourable a light by thepresent practice of publishing on the assets side only the gold and convertiblecurrency reserves and on the liabilities side the gross figures of liabilities; proposals are made (614-615 and 628-629) for changes in presentation on both sides of thebalance sheet. But the Committee notes that, however the balance sheet is presented, it is desirable that it should be strengthened. It points out that theUnited Kingdom has in fact realised a surplus on its current balance of payments in all but two years since 1948, and that the surplus has averaged about  150 millions a year, but that the surplus has been used mainly to increase external investmentsrather than to increase the reserves.33. The Committee then discusses (634-643) the causes of pressure on the reserves in recent years:  (a) Swings in the current balance of payments (635-637);(b) Capital movements, including leads and lags and swings in sterling balances(638-643);and concludes that the two main prerequisites for confidence in sterling are afavourable balance of payments and a higher level of reserves (643).34. There follows a discussion (644-663) of sterling as an internationalcurrency and the sterling area system. A section on the future of the sterling areacontains the Committee&apos;s conclusion that the existing arrangements should bemaintained, and need not be fundamentally affected by the introduction ofconvertibility. It follows from this conclusion that no striking action to reducesterling liabilities should be contemplated; an increase in reserves should have priority over a reduction in sterling liabilities as a means of improving the balance sheet. &quot; What the United Kingdom can do to add to her reserves depends,however, on the state of international liquidity, and this also has a direct bearing on the reserves she requires &quot; (663).35. On the problems of international liquidity (664-680), the Committeeconcludes that it has only failed to become acute because of the willingness of thelargest creditor country, the United States, to take the necessary action to prevent it from becoming acute. But total international reserves are now &quot; much lowerin relation to the value of international transactions than twenty years ago, and arefailing to keep pace with the expansion in trade and payments &quot; (670). TheCommittee considers that this shortage of international liquidity should be remediednot by an increase in the price of gold (672-674) but by making better use of theInternational Monetary Fund, paragraphs 675-678.36. But international liquidity, like the convertibility of sterling, depends&quot; on the preservation of international balance and on a pattern Of settlements inwhich no one country is in an overwhelming creditor position on short-termaccount&quot;. In the section (681-690) on international balance, the Committeeconcludes that, though a reduction of United States military outlays and economic aid, a change in United States external economic policy (due to alarm aboutthe decline in the ratio of United States gold reserves to its dollar liabilities),or a violent swing in the United. States domestic position could revive the dollar problem, and the effect on the sterling area reserves would be liable tobe particularly severe, the dollar problem &quot; is likely to be more intermittent and less intractable than is sometimes supposed &quot;. The Committee therefore expectsthe trend away from discrimination to continue. The Committee thinks it right that convertibility should have been a main aim of United Kingdom policy sincethe war, but right also that the introduction of convertibility should have been delayed in conditions of international imbalance, and considers that any recurrence of circumstances in which there was a persistent and large-scale flow of gold andforeign exchange to one important creditor country &quot; would warrant the reinstatement of discriminatory measures, including if necessary limitations onconvertibility &quot; (see especially the last part of this section, paragraphs 687-690).37.  The Committee then discusses (691-747) the means by which theauthorities may counter pressure on the reserves:  (a) Changes of Bank Rate, paragraphs 695-702.
(b) Support of the forward exchange rate (703-707): &quot;pegging&quot; the ratepermanently and continuously is regarded as inadvisable, thoughdiscontinuous support of the rate in certain conditions is not ruled out.(c) Exchange rate adjustments (not to be regarded as a normal instrument of monetary policy but only as a measure capable, in default of acceptable    *alternatives, of bringing about some enduring adjustment in thecountry&apos;s economic structure or correcting some strong and persistentlack of balance in its overseas position) (710-718).(d) A fluctuating rate of exchange (the Committee recommends strongly infavour of a fixed parity) (719-722).(e) Administrative controls: exchange controls have limitations, but somecontrol over capital movements should be retained (725-728); import controls &quot; have been more successful in effecting structural adjustments in the pattern of trade than in restraining imports at a time of crisis &quot;;the Committee assumes however &quot; that they will continue to be animportant weapon available to the authorities under international agreement for the purpose of influencing the balance of payments&quot;(729-730).(/) Control of overseas investment (731-747). The Committee accepts theneed for continuing restriction of overseas investment, but draws attention to the United Kingdom&apos;s obligations and declared objectives in this matter, and argues the importance of such overseas investmentto the United Kingdom and to the countries in which the investment is made. The Committee considers it desirable that there should be asufficient margin in the balance of payments surplus not only to permitsome increase in the reserves but to ease the restrictions on overseasissues on the London market, to make possible a gradual increase inthe credit extended to overseas purchasers of British goods, and topermit an extension of various forms of direct investment abroad. Inthis connexion it welcomes the Treasury&apos;s assumption that the&quot; desirable &quot; balance of payments surplus should average  450 millions a year in the early 1960s, rather than the  300 millions to  350 millions a year of earlier statements. It notes and welcomes the recent increaseof borrowing in non-sterling markets by sterling area countries, as a means of facilitating more investment in sterling area countries withoutimmediate additional strain on the central reserves, though it does not look for any further dramatic increase in this type of borrowing(744-746). The Committee, paragraphs 734, 740-747, also envisagesthe possibility of United Kingdom Government stock issues in overseasstock markets as a means of strengthening the reserves (747).38.  Finally (748-750) there is a short description of the effects on domesticmonetary conditions of changes in reserves and liabilities.Chapter IX (751-787)39. This chapter discusses the organisation and status of the Bank of England,in the light of the complexity of and shifts in emphasis among the objectives ofeconomic policy.40. The Committee concludes (752-759) that, while the formal direction ofthe Bank is vested in the Court, it is in the Committee of Treasury that the Bank&apos;views are formulated on matters of central banking (758), and that the Committeeof Treasury is and must be in essence advisory to the Governor, upon whom fallsthe responsibility for formulating advice or proposals tendered to the government or recommendations to the Court (759).41. The next section, paragraphs 760-775, deals with the Bank&apos;s relationship with the central Government. The Committee concludes (767) that &quot;effectively to plan arid implement the monetary policy of the country as a whole requires a constant co-operation, strategic and tactical, between the central bank on the onehand and those responsible for alternative or supplementary monetary measures,essentially the Treasury and the Board of Trade, on the other &quot;; and that&quot; monetary
policy cannot be envisaged as a form of economic strategy which pursues its ownindependent objectives. It is a part of the country&apos;s economic policy as a whole and must be planned as such &quot;. Therefore &quot; the policies to he pursued by thecentral bank must he from first to last in harmony with those avowed and defendedby Ministers of the Crown responsible to Parliament&quot;. The Bank&apos;s position is not,however, to be regarded as that of a rather exceptional Government department.Its relationships with markets in which it operates and which it to some extentcontrols, and its peculiar status in its overseas connexions, make it necessarilysomething different.42. The Committee believes that this is in substance the present position:in order, however, to get rid of any obscurity about the reality of the division ofresponsibility in matters of central banking policy, the Committee recommends that announcements of changes in Bank Rate (which are central banking actions of particularly significant importance in the Governmenfs economic policy) shouldbe made in the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and on his authority.Under existing legislation such an exercise of the Chancellors authority would be conveyed by the issue, after consultation with the Governor, of a statutory directionunder Section 4 (1) of the Bank of England Act, 1946 (771-772).43. The Committee also recommends the constitution of a StandingCommittee, deliberative and advisory in character, &quot; to keep under review and advise the authorities on all matters relating to the co-ordination of monetary policy as a whole &quot;; this would facilitate forward planning in the monetary field. TheChairman would be the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with the Economic Secretaryto the Treasury as his deputy; its members would consist of four representativesof the Bank (including the Governor and Deputy Governor), four representativesof the Treasury, and two representatives of the Board of Trade (773-774).44. As to the organisation of the Bank, the Committee confines itself to theview that there should be in the Bank a strong and highly-qualified EconomicIntelligence Department, whose head should have the rank of executivedirector (777).45. On the basis of the working arrangements proposed in the Report,paragraphs 778-787, the Committee sees advantage in retaining the office of part-time director of the Bank of England (778-787).Chapter X (788-865)46. This chapter discusses the need for improvement of financial and monetary statistics.47. The introduction (788-800) points out that financial and monetarystatistics have not improved so fast or far as statistics of national income and output. The Committee makes it clear that it has not attempted to balance againstthe social importance of all the improvements it recommends the cost of theircollection and the damage (if any) to public or sectional interests involved in theirdisclosure, though it recognises that its recommendations are subject toconsiderations of this kind and will require thorough discussion with, the interests concerned. It has however singled out improvements in statistics which it thinksdesirable either for monetary management or for greater understanding byinformed opinion of monetary affairs. The considerations which it has had inmind are set out in paragraphs 798 and 865.48.  The recommendations and conclusions are:  (a) All the information which the Committee has assembled for its own purposes should continue to be collected either on a regular basis orby periodic inquiry (796).(b) Statistics of the labour market, particularly of emoloyment, are inadequate(799).(c) There should be better information as to changes in the. volume of physicalstocks held by manufacturers and in stocks of imported goods (802).(d) Existing surveys of investment intentions and industrial trends should be supplemented so as to cover the whole range of industrial and commercial investment, including consumers&apos; plans for the purchase ofdurable goods (802).
(e) There  should  be  centrally collected  and  published  comprehensiveinformation on rates of interest and security yields of all kinds;particular gaps at present are the cost of trade credit, and rates paid bylocal authorities, building societies, finance houses, and Trustee savings banks (Special Investment Departments) (804).(/) Figures should be available to show, say quarterly, the investment anddisinvestment in financial assets of each of the major groups of financial institutions (805-807).(g) There should be drawn up a single account of the assets of financial institutions and the current flow of funds from the financial sector tothe other major sectors of the economy (808-810).(/?) Other groups of commercial banks should publish regular statements of assets and liabilities on a comparable basis with those of the Londonclearing banks (814).(i) Aggregate figures should be published monthly of the funds borrowed andassets held by the discount houses, subdivided as in the information supplied to the Committee (815).(;&apos;) Figures of bank deposits and advances should correspond as closely aspossible to actual liabilities to and borrowing by the public (816).49. There are other recommendations as to banking statistics (817-821), andas to the statistics of insurance companies (824), pension funds (825), building societies (827-829), investment trusts and unit trusts (830), finance houses and hire purchase (831), the volume of business done on the Stock Exchange (832) and investment institutions (833).50. There are proposals for improving information on company liquidityand financing, and making use of information available to the Inland Revenueabout unquoted companies and private businesses to supplement that availableto the Board of Trade on public companies (834-836); for improving information on personal savings (by savings surveys) and consumer credit (via the credit-givinginstitutions) (837-839); for obtaining better information about the investmentoperations of trust funds (840); for further improvements in the figures of overseastransactions (841-848), especially in the flow of commercial credit and ininvestments by United Kingdom residents overseas.51. For the public sector the Committee proposes that there should be aquarterly capital account of the public sector (850-851), on the lines of Table 7of the Report but rather fuller; separate quarterly capital accounts of the centralGovernment (as recommended by the Crick Committee) .(850), the public corporations (854) and the local authorities (856); and annual statements on a rather fuller basis again of the financial assets and liabilities of the public sectoras a whole and of its different part (852).&apos; It also proposes improvements in the;statistics of the National Debt so as to display regularly the total debt held by themarket (i.e., outside the public sector) and its distribution by maturity and bycategory of holder (853).52. The public corporations should provide regular forecasts of capitalexpenditure (854). There should be an annual survey of local authorityborrowing, whose results should be made available as promptly as possible; thisshould show not only the outstanding debt but the sources, terms and periods of borrowing. This information might be obtained quarterly from the largerauthorities and a sample of smaller ones (855).53. The Committee hopes that most of the statistics it proposes will be furnished voluntarily by those concerned, but envisages that the authorities may need to seek statutory powers to require statistics of financial institutions, &quot; if onlyto reassure those who are already disposed to co-operate that their competitorswill be under the same obligation as themselves &quot; (857). The Committee proposes that there should be a Digest of Financial and Monetary Statistics (858). It alsolooks for more regular comment by the authorities on monetary and financialaffairs, in the Bank of England&apos;s Annual Report, and possibly in quarterly bulletinsor occasional monographs for more technical or controversial discussions, whichwould give opportunities for &quot; fuller and freer exposition by members of the staffof the Bank of issues which they are in a unique position to discuss &quot;. This, it isthought, would help to strengthen the economic intelligence side of the Bank&apos;s
activities. The Committee also envisages interchanges between the Treasury andthe Bank of staff engaged in this kind of work, and the possibility of temporaryrecruitment of academic economists and others to help in specific pieces of research (863).54. Two subjects in particular need to be studied: the flow of credit, includingcommercial credit both domestic and external; and investment (864).Chapter XI (866-977)55. In this chapter the Committee discusses certain institutional developments,arising out of its review of existing institutions and out of proposals put to it onevidence.56. On finance for exports (867-898), the Committee takes the view that themaximum period of Export Credits Guarantee Department cover should not beregarded as unalterable; but longer export credit guarantees should not be used asa device for development assistance or trade promotion, which should be done byloans and guarantees outside the Export Credits Guarantee Departmentscommercial credit insurance scheme. If longer commercial credits had to be financed, and existing institutions were not able or willing to finance them, it mightbe necessary to make guaranteed export credit paper rediscountable at the Bank ofEngland or to set up an Export Finance Corporation; but there is no present needfor either of these expedients and the aim of policy should be to encourage theinternational provision of untied capital (paragraphs 887-898).57. On agricultural credit (899-931), the Committee concludes that in generalexisting sources of credit appear to be adequate, but the banks should be ready tooffer term loans to cover medium-term credit requirements. There should not be a preferential rate of interest for agricultural borrowers (paragraph 931).58.   On the finance of small businesses (932-952) the Committee:  (a) Concludes that there is no case for a proliferation of new institutions (940).(b) Recommends the banks to be ready to offer term loans in suitable cases, ifborrowers want them (942).(c) Welcomes the new-found freedom of the Industrial and CommercialFinance Corporation to borrow from the market (945), and proposes anincrease in the upper limit on the size of transaction in which it mayengage (946).(d) Recommends the Government to consider the possibility of setting up an industrial Guarantee Corporation which would be able to guarantee a proportion of any loan made by a financial institution to a small business or private company for the purpose of financing the commercial development of a new invention or innovation of technique (948-952).59. On the transfer of payments (953-964) the Committee considers that, inthe absence of an early move on the part of existing institutions to provide a simpletransfer service, without the ancillary services which go with a bank account, therewould be a case for investigating the possibility of instituting in this country a &quot; giro &quot; system (on the lines of those already in operation in a number of continental countries) to be operated by the Post Office.60. Finally the Committee sets out its objections to the control of capital issues as it has been operated in this country in the 1950&apos;s (965-977). Its main conclusionscan be found in paragraphs 967-969 and 973-977.Chapter XII (978-986)61. This chapter, paragraphs 978-986, sets out what the Committee believesto be the main ideas that emerge from a study of the Report.19th August, 1959.
NEW FIGURES INCLUDED IN THE RADCLIFFE REPORTThe Committee obtained a considerable amount of statistical informationnot hitherto available, including in particular figures relating to the financing ofthe Exchequer and to the structure and distribution of the National Debt and figures of the assets and liabilities in recent years of many of the main groups of banking and other financial institutions.

ANNEX CTHE RADCLIFFE report note to Editors jThe Report of the Committee on the Working of the Monetary System&apos;,which is published to-day, does not include any summary of conclusions oflist of recommendations because, as the Committee explains, it felt that to do so would not do justice to its main themes. The Introduction (paragraphs 8-14)gives a brief account of the structure of the Report, and the Conclusion(paragraphs 978-985) picks out what the Committee believes to be the mainideas that emerge from a study of it.The following note has, however, been prepared to assist those who wish toget a general idea of the reports scope and structure. It must be emphasised that this note is not an official summary of the Report but merely a guide to its main themes.1. The Committee finds that the objectives of economic policy are variousand complex (the main objectives being a high and stable level of employment,stability of the currency, economic growth, a contribution to overseas development and the improvement of international reserves), and that no one of these objectiveshas such pre-eminence that it can be pursued in isolation from and without regardto the others. There is therefore no single objective of policy by which all monetary policy can be conditioned. The various objectives of policy may indeed conflict with each other, and a balance may have to be struck between them. Theresponsibility for striking that balance must lie, in the Committee&apos;s view, with theGovernment of the day.2. The Government of the day must also, for similar reasons, be responsiblefor the choice as to the measures by means of which the objectives of policy arepursued. These measures may be of three different kinds: direct controls, fiscalmeasures and monetary measures. The Committee has not regarded an examination of direct controls and fiscal measures as within its terms of reference,though there are passing references to them (paragraphs 515-518 and 723-730), butit makes clear its view that all three have their own advantages and disadvantages,which must be borne in mind in deciding what measures should be taken in any given circumstances.3. In the monetary field the Committee considers that the authorities must seek to work primarily through the structure of interest rates rather than by-quantitative limitations, whether of the &quot; supply of money &quot; or of particular formsof credit, because the market for credit is by and large a single market, andquantitative controls over one form of borrowing tend to be rendered ineffectivesooner or later because people can generally raise the money they require by other,uncontrolled, forms of borrowing. The main opportunity for the authorities to influence the level and structure of interest rates, particularly of long-term rates,lies in the management of the National Debt, which the Committee sees as thefundamental domestic task of the central bank to-day. Changes in the level and structure of interest rates do not, in the Committee&apos;s view, have much effect on the spending plans of borrowers in the short run, but in the long run the level of rates,and particularly of long-term rates, does have a gradual effect on spending, if those responsible for spending plans are persuaded that a particular level of rates (&quot; high &quot;,&quot; normal&quot; or &quot; low &quot;) has come to stay. But changes in the structure of interest rates do, in the Committee&apos;s view, have significant short-run effects on the liquidityof spenders and lenders, and particularly of financial institutions, and thus on their ability or willingness to spend or give credit. These effects on liquidity have beenmuted, in the 1950s, by the abnormally high degree of liquidity in the economy,inherited from the war and the immediate post-war period; there is, however, some reason for thinking that the economy has now returned to a more &quot;normal &quot; levelof liquidity, and that the general liquidity effect of interest rate changes may therefore be greater in the 1960s than it has been in the 1950s.
4. There may, however, again be, as in the 1950s, periods in which excessiveliquidity persistently embarrasses the authorities in their conduct of economic policy. In such circumstances the Committee envisages that the authorities might find it necessary to impose special restraints on the banking system (by requiring the Banks to maintain higher liquidity ratios), which might have to be accompaniedby comparable restraints on the credit-giving capacity of other groups of financial institutions. The Committee recommends that, if a situation were to arise in whichthere was imminent danger of headlong inflation, the authorities should temporarilyimpose quantitative controls on bank advances and capital issues, and restrictionson hire purchase terms; at the same time the level of Government expenditure should be critically reviewed.5. The Committee recognises that in the 1950s the course and severity of monetary restraint has generally been dictated by the compulsions of the externalsituation; this points to the need to maintain a sufficiently large surplus on thecurrent balance of payments to make possible not only a higher rate of overseas investment but an improvement of the reserve position, such as to give the UnitedKingdom some prospect of being able to ride out temporary adverse movements ofthe balance of payments or of short-term capital without the authorities beingobliged to impose needlessly severe restraints on domestic activity. It should alsobe an aim of United Kingdom policy to strengthen the capacity of the international monetary Fund to supplement international liquidity. The Committee believes it right that convertibility of the pound sterling should have been a main aim of post-war United Kingdom policy, though it considers that some measure of discrimination in trade and payments, including limitations on convertibility was,and would again be, justified in conditions where one country was a persistent and large-scale international creditor.6. In reviewing the position of the Bank of England in relation to the formulation of policy, and therefore its relationship to the Government, theCommittee considers that, while the choice as to the balance among the objectives of economic policy and as to the measures by which policy is made effective must rest with the Government of the day, the advice of the Bank of England, with all its technical skill in market operations and its sources of knowledge, is entitled tovery great weight in the formulation of policy in the monetary field. The Committeebelieves this to be in substance the present position, but thinks that it should bemade explicit. It therefore recommends that Bank Rate changes should on each occasion be announced in the name and on the authority of the Chancellor of theExchequer. Under the existing legislative scheme such an exercise of theChancellor^ authority would be conveyed by the issue by the Treasury, afterconsultation with the Governor of the Bank, of a statutory direction undersection 4 (1) of the Bank of England Act, 1946. The Committee also recommends that the Chancellor should look for advice on monetary questions to a StandingCommittee on Monetary Policy, on which the Treasury, the Bank of England andthe Board of Trade should be represented. On the basis of the working arrangements proposed in the Report the Committee sees advantage in retaining the office of part-time director of the Bank of England.7. The Committee also considers that an effective monetary policy depends inconsiderable measure upon an understanding public opinion, and makes a numberof recommendations with the object of improving both the supply of factual andstatistical information and the means by which information and official views onmonetary matters are presented to the public.8. The Committee includes in its review of the working of the system anumber of other specific conclusions and recommendations; among these are thefollowing: -(a) The discount market does a necessary job effectively, though practicesdesigned to discourage &quot; outside &quot; tenders for Treasury Bills are not inthe public interest (paragraph 590).(b) The method of Government issues of stock is satisfactory, though theauthorities should announce, after the application list for an issue hasbeen closed, how much of the issue has been taken up outside &quot; theDepartments&quot; (paragraph 580).(c) The nationalised industries should continue to draw their long-term capital requirements from the Exchequer (paragraph 595).
(d) The local authorities have been paying too high rates and borrowing tooshort since their access to the Public Works Loan Board was restricted;the Exchequer should stand ready to provide (via the P.W.L.B.) at thecurrent gilt-edged rate any capital which a local authority cannot ordoes not want to raise in the market at a comparable rate (paragraphs596-598).(e) It should be an object of policy to reopen the London issue market to subordinate authorities in the Commonwealth as well as to commonwealth Governments (paragraph 734).(/) Finance for exports. The maximum period of E.C.G.D. cover should notbe regarded as unalterable; but longer export credit guarantees shouldnot be used as a device for development assistance or trade promotion,which should be done by loans and guarantees outside the E.C.G.D.&apos;commercial credit insurance scheme. If longer commercial credits hadto be financed, and existing institutions were not able or willing to financethem, it might be necessary to make guaranteed export credit paperrediscountable at the Bank of England or to set up an Export finance corporation; but there is no present need for either of these expedientsand the aim of policy should be to encourage the international provisionof untied capital (paragraphs 887-898).(g) Finance for agriculture.  In general existing sources of credit appear tobe adequate, but the banks should be ready to offer term loans to covermedium-term credit requirements. There should not be a preferentialrate of interest for agricultural borrowers (paragraph 931).(h) Finance for small businesses and industrial innovation.   In general the sources of credit seem to be adequate. The banks should be ready tooffer term loans. The Government should consider setting up an industrial Guarantee Corporation, to guarantee loans for the commercial development of inventions and technical innovations (paragraphs 942,948-952).(/) Transfer of payments. If existing institutions do not take steps to providea simple system for transferring payments, the Government shouldinvestigate the demand for, and feasibility of, a postal &quot; giro &quot; system(paragraph 964).(j) There is no case for retaining a qualitative capital issues control of thekind operated in the 1950s (paragraphs 974-977).19 th August, 1959.
