//- 7- ftSECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government primed for the Cabinet.   July 1959C. (59) 11710th July, 1959CABINETPROBLEMS OF THE NATIONALISED industries memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Lord Privy seal the Committee on Nationalised Industries were asked (i) to study the reportof the Nationalised Industries (Official) Committee (the text of which is attached);(ii) to consider, in the light of that report, the proposals for the future status ofthe Post Office (C. (59) 67). This memorandum is confined to the first part-ofour remit: the second is dealt with in a separate memorandum (C. (59) 118).Scope of Officials&apos; report. The officials&apos; report is confined to the coal, transport, gas and electricity industries, and is a valuable distillation of the experience gathered over the past10 years by the Departments concerned. The guiding principles on which therecommendations in the report are founded are, first, that the nationalised boards should have more independence and responsibility; second, that their financial andeconomic obligations should be defined more sharply and applied more firmly;third, that in coal and transport there should be greater decentralisation; and,fourth, that contacts between the industries and the Departments should be improved.3. We endorse these principles and agree generally with the tenor of therecommendations which flow from their application. They should have the effectof charting a new and more businesslike course for the nationalised sector over thenext decade.Specific recommendations. These are summarised in paragraph 102 of the report, and I set out belowour comments under the heads given in that paragraph.Economic and Financial Obligations5. The background here is that nearly all the nationalised bodies are living on capital borrowed from the Exchequer, they are not earning enough to replace their assets: the rate of Exchequer lending to them increased from  240 millions in 1954to  515 millions in 1958. Without a sharp reorientation, improvement cannot beexpected. Indeed, things might well get worse, particularly in the coal and transport industries which present especially difficult problems.6. The report recommends a financial &quot; new deal&quot; for the four industries.This should have the effect of reducing the dependence of the Boards on theExchequer and of increasing their financial self-discipline. The obligationsproposed recognise that these industries are hybrids neither straight commercialconcerns nor social services but place more emphasis on commercial criteria than has been shown in recent years: they would be adjusted to meet the individualpeculiarities of each industry. Financial targets would be publicly announced sothat Parliament and the public could judge how successful the industries were intheir task. Any modification in them as a result of Ministerial intervention (e.g.,to restrain price increases) would also have to be made public.Copy No.o5 $55484
7. We are in general agreement with these recommendations, although in thecase of the railways we think it would be unwise to exclude the possibility of some form of specific Government subsidy to those services which are chronicallyuneconomic but socially desirable.8. Prices are obviously of crucial importance. It seems to us essential that ministers must, in some way or another, have ultimate control over price increases in the basic services provided by the nationalised Boards; but it is equally clearthat the boards are virtually certain to request, as a quid pro quo for the acceptanceof public financial targets, more freedom from the close informal control which ministers have hitherto exercised over prices. It seems inescapable therefore thatthe implementation of the financial proposals will be likely to involve some changein the method and degree of control at present exercised by the Government overthe price policies of the Boards. We do not consider, however, that it is possible,or indeed desirable, to decide what degree of change in Government control will beentailed in advance of discussions with the Chairmen of the Boards. But we feel bound to emphasise to our colleagues that, if such discussions are to be successful,some accommodation with them on this question will be necessary. Suchaccommodation might in the end go less far than that proposed in the officials&apos;report and might indeed vary as between individual Boards. But it might well bein the direction of less frequent but more overt Government intervention.9. We also feel that an effective method should be found of giving the influence of the consumer its proper weight in the price policies of these industries. Suchmechanisms as Consumer Consultative Councils do not in themselves constituteefficient checks against possible exploitation, or the appearance of exploitation, ofthe public by the quasi-monopoiies represented by the Boards.10. As regards Wages, we agree that Governmental intervention shouldcontinue to take the form of informal consultations. As in the past, this will need to be close and, in times of special difficulty, virtually continuous.11. While we agree that there is probably no alternative, at present, to thepolicy of meeting the capital requirements of the industries from the Exchequer,some of them at any rate should be encouraged to go to the market for their capitalneeds when their finances are on a sounder footing.Organisation12. We agree that no significant structural reorganisation is called for in thecase of the gas and electricity industries. There is likely to be some pressure from government supporters for further decentralisation in the field of electricitydistribution. But this should be examined on its merits. It might be necessary tostrengthen the powers of the Electricity Council if it is to prove an effectiveinstrument for shaping the general policy of the industry.13. There is a clear case for decentralisation in the coal industry, and weendorse the proposed establishment of statutory regional units.14. The British Transport Commission is heavily over-burdened. The reportrecommends that the first measure of decentralisation should be the hiving off ofthe London Transport Executive, the nationalised docks and the inland waterways;We consider however that the first step should be to establish autonomous and self-accounting regional bodies for the railways: the allocation of receipts amongstthe separate regions should not present insuperable difficulties. The hiving offoperation (which might also, we suggest, include road services) should in our view be regarded as a subsequent step, to be looked at in the light of the progress madewith the move towards regional autonomy in the railways.A ppointments15. We have no comments of substance on the terms of these recommendations, under which the only major change in existing practice wouldbe that the chairmen of subordinate Boards in the coal and transport industries would be appointed by Ministers instead of by the central Boards.16. We must point out, however, that the recommendations do not dealwith the grave problems of finding staff with the requisite high quality for the senior posts in the nationalised&apos;Boards. These posts have to be filled from withinthe industries themselves, owing to the virtual impossibility of attracting top-level
staff from private industry. Greater flexibility in remuneration, more assuredconditions of service, and better training schemes will be necessary if the nationalised Boards are to overcome these problems. We suggest that furtherconsideration should be given to this question of staffing, since it will obviouslyplay a crucial part in increasing the efficiency of the nationalised sectors: thepossibility of amending legislation to deal with it should not be excluded.    j...:Relations with Parliament17. We agree with the suggestion that the Select Committee procedure mightbe developed further with the aim of making it and Parliament more fullyacquainted with the general problems of the industries. We also agree that it wouldbe undesirable to give the Select Committee a Comptroller and Auditor-General.To do so would inevitably provoke undesirable Parliamentary interference with theday-to-day operation of the industries. The Select Committee is undoubtedly in need of technical help and should be encouraged to make greater use of the TreasuryLiaison Officer.Relations Between Ministers and the Boards18. We agree that there are very strong arguments against the frequent useof Ministers&apos; existing statutory powers of direction; but we recognise that there maybe occasions when they ought to be used in preference to informal arrangements.Procedure19. The recommendations as endorsed by the Ministerial Committee wouldinvolve new financial agreements with all four industries; and, in the case of thecoal and transport industries, extensive structural reorganisation. The financial proposals are common to all the Boards, and could not in practice be applied to onewithout the others. It would not be desirable to attempt to get new financialagreements with the coal and transport industries without at the same time gettingagreement to the reorganisation plans. It cannot be taken for granted that all ofthe Boards will be prepared readily to accept the proposals. It is obvious therefore that very delicate and difficult discussions with the Boards will be called for before any announcement can be made of the Governments plans for the nationalisedsector. To initiate these discussions before a General Election would be most undesirable, since it would almost certainly provoke major political controversy.This might be damaging electorally and might prejudice the chances of getting the nationalised sector on a sounder footing.20.  On procedure, therefore, we recommend the following course of action (a) Our colleagues should approve in principle the recommendations in thereport, as modified by our comments, in particular the comments on price policy, on the need to give the consumer^ interests greaterweight, on railway reorganisation, and on the question of staffing.(b) Officials should be instructed to examine further the specific points towhich we have drawn attention and to put in hand the preparation of adraft White Paper and other documentation on which subsequentapproaches to the Boards can be based (see (e) below). . i-.(c) We should, however, take no action to implement the report, by way either of public announcement or private consultation with the nationalisedBoards, until after an Election.(d) On this basis, it would be prudent to confine ourselves, in our Electionliterature, to a short and very general statement of our attitude, on thelines that the nationalised industries will be encouraged both to operate on more commercial lines and to move further in the direction ofdecentralisation. .......  ((e) After an Election, the Departmental Ministers should make separate andsimultaneous approaches to the Boards to ascertain their reactions to theGovernments proposals. So far as finance is concerned, these might beput in the form of a draft White Paper, common to all the Boards. there organisation proposals would probably have to be put forward dnthe basis of more tentative memoranda; - , ;(f) After, but not until, the discussions with the Boards have been conrpleted,the Governments proposals should be published, .say in the spring. of 1960. .. miaow iiM-i  vi \--
(g) Financial agreements should thereafter be negotiated, in 1960, with the gas and electricity industries.(h) Legislation for coal&apos; reorganisation and a financial agreement with theNational Coal Board should be scheduled for the second session of anew Parliament.(/) Legislation for transport reorganisation and a financial agreement with theBritish Transport Commission should be scheduled for the thirdsession of a new Parliament.21. We consider it important that neither the contents nor the existence ofthe officials&apos; report should be made known outside Government circles, in viewof the undesirable political controversy which might be aroused.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,10th July, 1959.
SECRETPROBLEMS OF THE NATIONALISED INDUSTRIESReport by a Group of OfficialsSection I.-INTRODUCTIONTerms of reference . By direction of the Prime Minister we were charged at the end ofJanuary 1959, with the task of considering and reporting &quot; what changes might with advantage be made, in the light of experience, in the organisation of the nationalised industries, or in their relations with the Government and withParliament.&quot;2. In the course of our discussions we came to the view that financial problemswere of the first importance in their bearing on the matters directly covered by these terms of reference; and that, unless a satisfactory settlement of these problemswas found, the related problems of organisation and relations would become greaterand more difficult. Indeed we fear that without such a settlement the relationsbetween the industries, Government, and Parliament may deteriorate. We thereforedeal at some length in our Report with financial and allied matters, as well as withthe problems of organisation and relations which are specifically mentioned in our terms of reference.Limitations on the Enquiry3. We have limited our enquiry in accordance with the wishes of Ministers to the Electricity Boards, Gas Boards, the National Coal Board and the british transport Commission.4. Our group consisted of senior representatives of the Treasury, scottish office, Ministry of Power, and Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation. Althoughour terms of reference contemplated that we might call on representatives of otherDepartments, we have not in fact found it necessary to do so. On the other hand,we have drawn fully on the accumulated knowledge and experience of theDepartments named above: and the views expressed in our Report thus derive from the experience of these Departments in relation to the nationalised bodiesfor which they are responsible.5. But the industries with which we are concerned are very large, exceedinglycomplex and varied: and it would clearly be necessary to consult the industries concerned (which we were explicitly instructed not to do) before coming to any definite conclusions. The views and suggestions put forward in our Report should,therefore, be regarded as provisional and tentative. This is especially true of what we say about the internal organisation of the industries.Section II.-GENERAL LINES OF APPROACHDepartmental or Business-style Organisation6. There are broadly two opposed lines along which the organisation of thesenationalised industries might be developed-on the one hand, towards a departmental type of organisation such as the Post Office now is (and would remaineven after implementation of the proposals for reorganisation now beingconsidered); or, on the other, towards a more commercial type of organisation suchas is common among big businesses in the private sector.7. The departmental type of organisation seems well suited to the Post Office:but the Post Office has a monopoly, is providing a fairly standardised service andhas been managed on a departmental basis from its very early stages severalgenerations ago.  (Admittedly this type of organisation is also adopted for other
industries, e.g., railways, in many foreign countries; but circumstances there are sodifferent that it cannot be inferred from this that the departmental organisation would be suitable in the United Kingdom for such industries.) We consider thatthe industries with which we are concerned are on the other hand materially different from the Post Office in a number of respects which make the departmental organisation unsuitable to them. Thus many, if not all, of them are subject tosevere competition: they have to meet a very wide variety of requirements including,in some cases, exports: and they have been built up on a long tradition ofcommercial organisation.8. The crucial difference between the present &quot; Board&quot; system and thedepartmental organisation is that in the latter a Minister, who is a member of theGovernment and responsible to Parliament, is the legal &quot; owner &quot; and manager ofthe business. To apply this system to the industries in question would have manyserious drawbacks. Given that public and Parliamentary interest in some of them is much more intense than it is in the Post Office, the intervention of parliament in questions of day-to-day management would be correspondingly greater. Thiswould inevitably lead to a greater degree of centralisation within the industries ofthe power of decision, the Minister being answerable to Parliament for everydecision, great and small, taken in them. The employees (e.g., the miners) would in substance, even if not in name, be civil servants a situation probably equallyunwelcome to them and to the Government. The latter would become directly responsible for their wages. It would also be directly responsible and answerablefor price policies throughout the industries. And problems of Parliamentary controlover the finances of the industries would arise, as they have arisen in the PostOffice and would be likely to be far more difficult to solve satisfactorily.9. Some of these drawbacks could be partially mitigated by the interpositionof a Board which legally &quot; owned &quot; and managed the industry but which was merely an agent or creature of the Minister and subject to his instructions over thewhole of its activities. But such a device would leave unaffected the most seriousof the drawbacks set out above.10. We have therefore decided not to pursue the &quot; Post Office &quot; line ofdevelopment, and have concentrated our attention on the second line ofdevelopment towards more commercial structure and operation, with more definite financial obligations than at present, greater decentralisation and a clearerdefinition of the relationship between the Government and the industries. Onsuch a basis we think that the aim should be to give the Boards an increased degreeof independence and responsibility. As regards financial obligations, we think it essential for the maintenance of self-respect inside the industries and satisfactoryrelations between the Boards, the Government and Parliament, that the boards should have clear and reasonable financial responsibilities, and that they should beseen to earn a reasonable return upon their capital.11. Greater independence and responsibility for the Boards must, however,be accompanied by more and not less knowledge in the Departments about whatis going on in the industries. It is essential that the contacts between departments and the industries with which they are concerned should be so developed that ministers can be fully and properly informed about all major developments and able to satisfy themselves in a general way that the Boards are working efficiently.Section III.-FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC FRAMEWORKThe Present Situation12. The financial and economic obligations of the nationalised industries inthe founding statutes were not very precise, and in course of time they have tended to be misinterpreted, while some of the provisions have almost dropped out ofsight. The financial performance of the industries has certainly fallen far beloworiginal expectations. In our view the general principles embodied in the originalstatutes should be re-established: they should be interpreted more precisely and applied more firmly.
Paying Their Way13. It is commonly but mistakenly believed that the nationalised industries are instructed, by their Acts, to make neither a profit nor a loss in the sense inwhich these terms are normally used. The statutory obligations are that theirrevenue should, on an average of good and bad years (or some similar phrase),not be less than sufficient to meet all items properly chargeable to revenue, includingdepreciation, redemption of capital and reserves. Thus the Acts prescribe aminimum performance, but they are commonly misinterpreted as laying down amaximum also. Moreover, in the case of nationalised bodies profits or losses(surpluses or deficits) have a special meaning, inasmuch as the statutes require the bodies to make provision out of revenue for general reserves also. Only after such provision has been made do &quot; surpluses &quot; arise. The bodies are thus requiredto make &quot; profits &quot; in the normal sense of that term in order to accumulate reservesfrom them.Average of Good and Bad Years14. The theory was that the bodies could have &quot; deficits &quot; in bad years whichwere to be covered by &quot; surpluses &quot; in good years. The phrase &quot; average of good and bad years &quot; has in practice proved too vague, and inadequate surpluses havebeen built up to cover the deficits of bad years. If this formula is to worksatisfactorily surpluses must be secured in good years and the averaging periodmust not be unduly prolonged: otherwise losses accumulate to the point whererecovery becomes doubtful and a request for an ex post facto subsidy looms ahead.Depreciation, Redemption and Reserves15. The industries have, in practice, not been expected to provide for bothdepreciation and redemption out of revenue: insistence on both would have meantthe creation of a debt-free undertaking, which hardly seems practicable or evendesirable.16. In general the nationalised industries calculate depreciation in theiraccounts on an historic cost basis, and this, with rising prices, falls far short of replacement cost. Most of the Boards recognise in their reports that it is desirableto make some additional provision out of revenue in order to cover the differencebetween depreciation at historic and at replacement cost, and some of them haveoccasionally succeeded in earning sufficient revenue to do this. In general, however,the undistributed income of the bodies before depreciation has not been sufficientto cover the consumption of assets during the year. There would be embarrasment in the Government^ laying down that &quot; proper depreciation&quot; should bedepreciation at replacement cost for the purpose of the obligations of the nationalised bodies, since depreciation allowances for taxation purposes are givenby reference to historic cost only. But as the Herbert Committee on Electricityrecommended there are strong grounds for seeking to ensure that in practice therevenue of the bodies covers depreciation at replacement cost, even if it is not solabelled.17. Under the Acts the amount of reserves is subject to Ministerial direction,but the Boards have not been told the amount of reserves at which they should aim. In fact none of them has built up genuine general reserves.Comparison between Nationalised Bodies and the Private Sector18. It would be unreasonable to expect that nationalised bodies should earnaverage yields as large as the yields on private investment. In the first place manyof the nationalised industries are in the nature of public utilities where traditionallymuch of the capital was raised on loan at modest rates of interest and returns were generally lower especially where the risk element was clearly small. Moreover,these bodies have obligations put upon them in the matter of national economicand social policies which take them beyond the limits of purely commercialcalculation. However, when full allowance has been made for these obligations,the discrepancy between performance in the nationalised and private sectorsremains very wide indeed. This is illustrated by Annex I which shows that private industry earns 15 per cent, or 16 per cent, net after depreciation (usually
at historic cost), while the nationalised bodies all earn less than 5 per cent, net-some of them much less. There is, therefore, much room for improvementespecially in regard to the return on new capital.Consequences of Poor Financial Returns19. Thus the financial results of the nationalised bodies have fallen below the expectations of the founding statutes, and far below that achieved in the private sector. The British Transport Commission has incurred losses which are unlikely to be recovered: the National Coal Board is dangerously near the same point.While the Area Gas Boards, the Area Electricity Boards and the Central electricity generating Board have done rather better, they have not earned enough to replace the assets used up, and the return on their capital is extremely low. Low prices and low yields on capital have to be compensated for, either by greater Exchequerborrowing for the development of these industries, or by higher taxes, both ofwhich react upon private industry and the economy generally. In the aggregatethe savings of the Boards have in the five years to 1958 been about  150 millions a year only: in the same period their investment has risen from  400 millions ayear to over  650 millions a year, and they are now drawing over  500 millions a year on the savings of the nation and on the taxpayer (Annex II). Moreover, anunduly low yield on capital reflected in unduly low prices may well artificiallystimulate demand for their products and thus for investment in them, so divertinginvestment to less economic development. The poor financial results of the bodies- -often ending in actual losses is damaging to their standing with public opinion,and accounts no doubt in part for the Parliamentary attacks upon the bodiesthemselves and on Ministerial functions in relation to them.A New Economic Framework20. We think that the first step towards rehabilitating these industries as effective commercial bodies should be to introduce a definite business framework.The Government should clarify its relationships with them in financial and alliedmatters, including an interpetation of what is required by the obligation of &quot; payingtheir way.&quot; This would involve discussion and negotiation with each of the bodies,whether central or regional, which have financial autonomy; the aim would be,if possible, to arrive at an agreed and published framework for each industry or Board.The Main Items for a New Framework21.   The main headings under which clarification or restatement is neededare as follows:  Revenue AccountCapital AccountPricesWagesOther mattersRevenue Account22.   The requirements might be generally on the following lines:  (i) Surpluses on revenue account should be at least sufficient to cover deficitson revenue account over a five-year period.(ii) In arriving at the surpluses and deficits of each year there should becharged against revenue the items normally so chargeable (includingdepreciation and interest, but not redemption of capital), and also-(a) an amount equal to the excess of depreciation at replacement cost over depreciation at historic cost, and(b) a regular allocation to reserves which would normally be 1 per cent.   -per annum on net assets but would be more in special cases,  fe.g., in businesses which are expanding rapidly and requirerelatively large amounts of capital.
(iii) The degree of governmental intervention would vary according to theextent of the success or failure of the body to achieve these targets.If the body was in deficit to such an extent, or so persistently, that itappeared unlikely to fulfil its obligations under (i) above, then the body would be regarded as in default. In the case of such default the body would have to submit to the Minister its detailed plans for rightingthe position, and in the meantime the Government would take a closerinterest in its financial affairs generally. In particular the body wouldhave to submit to the Government its annual revenue budget for scrutinyand its detailed investment proposals for approval. Failures less serious than those described above would not constitute default; theywould primarily concern the body itself, but it would have to inform theMinister in those circumstances of its general plans for preventing thesituation from deteriorating further, and for making up the leeway.23. These general requirements would need to be adapted to take accountof the peculiarities of each industry, and, perhaps, of each Board; and they wouldhave to be reviewed periodically in the light of events both inside and outside theindustry. Even modest obligations of the kind indicated above would, at thepresent, be too onerous for some of the bodies which are already in a weakposition e.g., on account of under-investment in the past, heavy social or national economic obligations, over-capitalisation, &amp;c. In some cases it might be necessaryto consider the possibility of reorganising the financial affairs of the bodies before they could be expected to be capable of fulfilling these new obligations.24. Interpreted in terms of yield on capital employed, the proposed obligationswould represent much less than a requirement of full commercial performance, since they would work out in total approximately as follows:  Required Net Yield [after Depreciation on an historic Cost Basis)Some additional tax would be payable on (h) and (c), raising the total net yieldrequired to, say, 7-8 per cent., that is, about one-half of the comparable yield in theprivate sector. Even if in some cases the industry were required to provide another1 per cent, by way of reserve, the total yield required in such a case would still be lessthan 10 per cent. or 5 per cent, below the yield in the private sector. Acceptanceof this lower yield means that, as compared with industries in the private sector, the nationalised bodies should have room for the various non-commercial obligations which are placed upon them. If the nationalised bodies earn 5 per cent, less thanthe private sector, this difference would amount to about  50 millions per annum inthe case of coal,  30 millions in the case of gas,  90 millions in the case of electricity(England and Wales),  5 millions in the case of electricity (South of Scotland) and 9 millions in the case of electricity (North of Scotland).Capital Account25. Except in cases of default, governmental supervision would be much thesame as now, and might be codified as follows:  (i) The Government would discuss with the body and approve the generalshape of its plans for development and capital expenditure and the majorelements in these plans.(ii) The Government would fix a short-term limit (covering normally a periodof two years ahead) on the investment expenditure of the body.(iii) The body would submit for the Governments approval an annual reasonedestimate of its proposed external borrowings.Per Cent.(a) Interest (average) say   ..(b) Additional depreciation(c) Additional reserves41-216-7
26. In general the degree of Government supervision proposed in paragraph 25need not, and should not, be such as to prejudice the ability of the body to complywith its prescribed financial obligations. The Government would aim at avoidinginterference with the detailed investment proposals of the body; but it would wishto be satisfied that there was an effective procedure within the organisation itself forscrutinising and approving new capital expenditure projects. It is important,moreover, that Ministers should have a general picture of the extent to which the body is proposing to invest new capital in projects which are from the outset expectedto yield a relatively low return; these projects, which are usually of a social and non-commercial kind, involve the diversion of capital from the private sector and in theaggregate may affect the ability of the body to achieve its financial targets in future.There are various methods whereby Ministers can be kept informed on this subject.For example, the bodies might be required to provide to the Minister information about any major projects costing more than a certain sum (the precise amountvarying from industry to industry) which the bodies propose to undertake and fromwhich the expected return on capital is less than say 10 per cent, net afterdepreciation.27. Capital expenditure in excess of the amounts aproved under paragraph 25(ii) and any borrowings in excess of the amounts approved under paragraph 25 (iii)would, as at present, be subject to investigation by the Departments. arrangements should be made for the Boards to keep the Departments informed about the financialoutcome of major investment projects, especially where these cost significantly moreor earn significantly less than originally anticipated.28. In general the investment ceilings mentioned in paragraph 25 (ii) aredisclosed to Parliament. The estimate of Exchequer borrowing, agreed annually asat present, would also be notified to Parliament separately for each industry (atpresent this figure is given globally for the industries apart from coal, and parliament is not aware of all the components). Where the ultimate figures for investment andborrowing varied markedly from the estimates, Parliament would be entitled to look to Ministers for an explanation.Prices29. The financial framework we propose would involve a change in theGovernments attitude towards charges in the nationalised industries. ministers have no formal power to interfere with the prices charged by the nationalised bodies;but over the years and under informal arrangements they have been able to do so.As a result the nationalised bodies have generally been restrained by the government from increasing their prices as much as they would have wished and as much asincreased costs would have warranted. They have in effect been used as pilots forthe policy of price stabilisation. More flexibility has been shown in prices foe comparable industries in the private sector including the steel industry, where theGovernment has power to control prices. There must be set off against theadvantages of price restraint in the nationalised industries the damage and distortioncaused to the nationalised industries themselves, and to the economy generally. Ifthe Government brings pressure on the Boards to prevent them from making price increases which they consider necessary, it will not be possible to clamp responsibilityfor financial results on the Boards; and in such a case the Boards would be entitledto ask for an overt adjustment of the financial requirements as defined inparagraphs 22 and 23.30. Increased prices would not be the only way in which the bodies could achieve the financial targets proposed in paragraphs 22 and 23. For a variety of reasons (fructification of investment, elimination of unprofitable activities, &amp;c.)some of the industries should show significant increases in productivity which shouldbe available, at least in part, to help to meet their increased financial obligations.Even if no aid could be drawn from this source, we do not think that large incr; .sesin the general level of their prices would be necessary to meet the new requirements probably no more than 5 per cent, in most cases. Even so there would beformidable difficulties to be overcome. Some of the industries which are subjectto very severe competition, such as coal, are likely to have difficulty in seeking toincrease their revenues through increased prices. Even if an average increase of5 per cent, would be sufficient it might have to be loaded on to particular items,causing a disproportionate increase in the price of these. Some of these difficulties could, and should, be taken care of in the adjustment of the general
targets, as indicated in paragraph 23. There is no doubt also that increased charges in the nationalised bodies would be generally unpopular, for people have becomehabituated to unduly low prices for many of the goods and services which these industries provide. In addition, there would be a problem of timing, so as to ensureas far as possible that the moves towards higher prices by the nationalised bodiescaused the least possible upset to the prospects for price stability generally. Inmany respects the difficulties which the proposed new policy in regard to nationalisedbodies would cause are similar in nature to those with which the Government had todeal in the case of the Rent Act. If, however, they can be overcome the resultshould be greater health and efficiency in the nationalised industries themselves andin the economy generally.Consumer Protection31. The Boards generally realise the unpopularity of price increases and would doubtless not be inclined to them if they were avoidable consistently with meetingtheir financial obligations. Even so a Government announcement that prices were for the Boards to determine would, not unreasonably, increase public pressure forsome safeguard against undue price increases exacted by near-monopolies andserving, perhaps, as a cover for inefficiency.Tribunals32. The minimum requirement appears to be a public forum in whichconsumers could air their views about increases and in which the Boards wouldhave publicly to justify them that is, a consultative procedure designed mainly to educate both the Boards and the public. Something of the sort already exists in the Gas and Electricity Consultative Councils. At the other end of the scaleis the type of tribunal which could range widely over the financial affairs of the body and ultimately fix charges, that is, a tribunal like the Transport Tribunal.33. The second kind of tribunal, having power to determine charges, wouldhave the advantages of reducing the pressure on Ministers to intervene in regardto prices, and of enhancing the independence of the Boards from political influence.It presents, however, serious difficulties. The tribunal procedure lays aconsiderable additional burden on the industry, and is apt to take a long time,during which it may have to make do with inadequate charges. Even if time were saved by giving the industry a general authorisation to increase its prices withina band of say 5 per cent., subject to the obligation to seek authorisation ex postfacto from the tribunal, there could be no assurance that such authorisation would ultimately be given. It would seem inconsistent with the concept of allowing the boards greater freedom on pricing policy to give the power to fix charges to a tribunal which bore no responsibility for the results of the undertaking. Thetribunal would, moreover, have to. be debarred, by appropriate terms of reference,from discussing the general economic framework within which each industry was expected to operate. In the coal industry, finally, there would be special difficulties:coal is in active competition with other fuels and must seek to develop itscompetitiveness; -for this it needs freedom to adjust its prices to meet the trends in the market for its highly varied product.34. In the face of these difficulties we doubt whether the idea of extending the machinery of price-fixing tribunals is worth pursuing. We think, however,that there would be advantage in providing an effective public forum in whichproposed price changes could be publicly examined and justification sought fromthe Board concerned: and that this might be achieved by extending and strengthening the system of Consultative Councils. In the gas and electricity-industries there is already one such Consultative Council for each Area Board; ifthe suggestion made in paragraph 60 below for a measure of decentralisation inthe coal industry were adopted, similar Councils might be formed for each of the divisional Coal Boards. In order that these Councils might carry greater weightwith public opinion it would be necessary to prescribe that their hearings shouldbe held in public (at present the Electricity and Gas Consultative Councils canopt to sit in private), and it is for consideration whether their Chairmen should cease to be ex-officio members of Area Boards. Moreover, if the Boards are tohave ultimate freedom to fix their own prices it might be necessary to considerwhether the Councils ought to retain their present rights (almost unused) to appealto the Minister against price changes proposed by the Boards.
Efficiency Tests35. The greater freedom in pricing which we suggest for the Boards would increase emphasis on the need for testing the efficiency of the industries. We see no simple answer to this difficult problem which has been much debated since theindustries were nationalised. We do not think that it would be practicable foroutside bodies such as tribunals to undertake so-called efficiency audits: and we see no alternative to leaving the responsibility for the efficiency of the industries to the Boards, subject to such tests as the Departments can apply. In this connexion it is desirable that the Departments should equip themselves with allpossible yardsticks for measuring the Boards&apos; efficiency. Some assistance in this may be obtained from the existence of autonomous Boards inside the same industry,and from decentralisation, which should make possible a comparison between the performance of different regions. The financial tests which we propose for the overall results of the industries and for new investment should also help. Inaddition, the ability of the Departments to form a view of the general efficiency of the industries should be improved by closer and continuing contacts with the nationalised bodies at the working level and with each of the financially autonomousunits.Wages36. We have little to add to the Note by Officials, circulated under cover of w.P. (59) 8, on wage problems in the nationalised industries, which was recentlyconsidered by Ministers. A copy of this Note is reproduced in Annex III. its conclusions are, briefly, that Ministers have no present power to intervene in the wage negotiations in the nationalised industries, and that it appears impracticable to take such powers: that any overt intervention would provoke strong resistancefrom the Boards and the unions: but that the Government should continue toexercise informal influence, mainly through contacts between the responsible ministers and the Chairmen, with a view to obtaining effective prior consultation in every case where a nationalised body proposed to offer or to agree to increases in wages and salaries.37. Under our proposals it would be for the Boards themselves as long asthey were not in default to consider the internal aspects of wage matters, thatis, how settlements would affect their costs, prices and financial results. The objectof the consultations described in paragraph 36 would be to ensure, as far as possible,that nationalised industries did not set an embarrassing level of wage increases and so affect the general pattern of wage rounds. In general the pressure exertedby Ministers would be towards restraining wage increases and costs in nationalised industries, and should be helpful rather than otherwise to the fulfilment of their financial obligations.Other Matters38. In the foregoing paragraphs we have dealt with the major issues whichare likely to arise between the Boards and the Government: but it is not possible tocompile an exhaustive list. Ministers must be free to bring their influence to bear on nationalised bodies just as they do on private industry. Moreover, most of the bodies have social obligations, e.g., rural electrification: and some of their decisions,e.g., on pit closures, can give rise to serious social problems. Ministers are boundto be closely concerned about these and must be kept fully informed. As far associal obligations are concerned, the appropriate extent of them should be takeninto account in fixing the financial targets of the various Boards. If, however, theGovernment wish to intervene significantly beyond this with the Boards and, inparticular, to limit their autonomy on prices, then the Boards would be entitled(as we have already stated in paragraph 29) to ask that this should be done overtlyand a corresponding adjustment made in their financial requirements as defined in paragraphs 22 and 23.Market Finance39. We have considered how far discipline and a commercial attitude on thepart of the Boards might be improved if they were required to raise their capital in the market wherever possible on their own credit.   The nationalised coal
industry has always been financed from the Exchequer. The current Finance Billcontinues financing of the other bodies also (which up to 1956 were financed by government guaranteed market issues) from the Exchequer for a further year from august 1959. The size of the requirements of these bodies for outside finance( 500 millions in 1959-60) is very great in relation to the market and the arguments for centralising their requirements in the Exchequer for reasons of credit and marketmanagement have remained decisive. We would not expect any noticeable changein this situation in the foreseeable future. Even if our proposals for increasingsaving by the industries were accepted, it would not reduce their requirements bymuch more than  100 millions.40. It may be argued that, even if all the industries cannot go to the market,and even though some of them, e.g., the British Transport Commission, would havepoor prospects if they went on their own credit, there may still be room for others,e.g., electricity, to raise at least some of their own requirements on their own creditin the market. There are, however, arguments against even this. All the industries are so essential and so closely linked to the Government, which has already investedabout  5,000 millions in them directly or under guarantee, that there would be littlereality in non-guaranteed borrowing. The Government could hardly allow a board to default, for this would do harm to its own credit: nor could it see them deprived of the funds for essential development, since this would damage the development ofthe economy. If any of the bodies borrowed on its own credit the realities of thesituation would not be altered, although an issue without a formal guarantee could probably be made only at a rate of interest perhaps \ per cent, above theGovernment borrowing rate. Moreover, a position under which some industrieswent to the market and others came to the Exchequer would seem anomalous. Itis possible to exaggerate the disciplinary advantages of market borrowing by bodies which are required to carry uncommercial obligations and which would have to be financed by the Exchequer to do so if the market failed to provide the necessary funds. Nonetheless, the principle of applying financial tests to investment isimportant and we have tried to reflect it in our proposals for general financialtargets (paragraphs 22 and 23) and for evaluating particular projects (paragraph 26).Section IV.-ORGANISATION STRUCTURE AND RELATED PROBLEMS41. The industries with which we are concerned are so dissimilar in nature and at such varying stages of organisational growth that it is not possible to suggest a standard form of organisation for them. We therefore consider each of theindustries individually in the following paragraphs.Gas42. The gas industry, which for a variety of reasons has from the beginningbeen organised on a decentralised (regional) basis, illustrates well the advantages ofsuch an organisation.The Area Boards43. The most important feature is the high degree of autonomy enjoyed bythe twelve separate statutory Area Gas Boards. With few exceptions all the assets of the industry are vested in them: and they have managerial and financial independence subject to certain (limited) powers and functions which are reserved to the Gas Council and the Minister. They have freedom in regard to tariffs but have agreed not to raise the general level of tariffs without consulting the Minister.The Gas Council44. The Gas Council consists of the Chairmen of the twelve Area Boardssitting under an independent Chairman and a Deputy. It is thus in a sense anextension of the Area Boards in which they act in their collective capacity. Themain functions of the Gas Council are (a) To arrange Exchequer or market finance for the industry.    (Theresponsibility for service of their borrowing resides ultimately with
each of the Area Boards, although the Council has to maintain a CentralGuarantee Fund consisting of contributions obtained from the area boards against any failure to service debt.)(b) To advise the Minister on matters affecting the capital programmes of theArea Boards. (The Council has itself no power to enforce any amendment in these programmes.)(c) To act (by agreement with the Area Boards) in matters of common interest or national extent e.g., national wages settlements.(d) To assist the efficient performance of the Area Boards e.g., through the pooling of experience; and in particular to co-ordinate research andtraining programmes of the Area Boards and to conduct centralresearch-the general programmes being subject to consultation withthe Minister.Advantages and Disadvantages of the Gas Structure45. The advantages of the gas structure appear to outweigh the disadvantages:  (a) Although the Area Boards vary greatly in size none of them is so big asto be unmanageable or to overburden the top men in it. It is,moreover, easier to find suitable directors for moderate-sizedcorporations of this kind than for a mammoth organisation such asthe National Coal Board: and, indeed, this type of organisation witha strong degree of regional independence helps to produce suitabledirectors locally.(b) Limited size combined with managerial and financial responsibility breedsa strong sense of responsibility among the Area Board Chairmen andtheir senior staff. They and their workers are less prone to thosefeelings of frustration and of being subject to remote control which are inevitable in very large centralised organisations. The existence of twelve financially and commercially independent Boards gives rise tokeen rivalry and is of assistance in measuring comparative efficiency.(c) The limited number of issues dealt with at the centre do not require alarge bureaucracy.(d) With freedom of access by the Area Board Chairmen to the Minister,and freedom of access for the Department to each Area Board, theDepartment can obtain a better understanding of the problems and plans of the industry, particularly on the financial side: and theMinister can be kept better informed about current developments andis able, if necessary, to exercise influence at an early stage. The need to deal with twelve Boards directly, instead of through a centralauthority, places, of course, some additional burden on the Ministry.(e) The Gas Council works by consent and meets only once a month.  It istherefore sometimes slow in arriving at national policy decisions andin expressing a collective view. On the other hand, once decisions aremade or views expressed they are generally well considered andcommand support down the lines.(/) A more powerful national organisation might get ahead faster with the developments of new techniques for gas production on a massive scaleat a few key points and bulk distribution through a national grid.The existing structure is, however, flexible and there is nothing whichwould prevent the Area Boards from setting up a co-operative body toundertake large-scale manufacture and bulk distribution on their behalf. And there is no reason to doubt their willingness to actcollectively as soon as the case is sufficiently proved.Conclusion46. We think that the existing gas structure is well adapted to fit the natureof the industry and to promote efficiency, and that it is sufficiently flexible to matchnew developments such as a national gas grid.  The industry has.always been
essentially a regional industry and regional organisation is therefore natural. Theproblems which have had to be dealt with at national level have been relatively few and capable of isolation. Moreover, each of the regions has been of a kind which could reasonably be expected to balance its own financial accounts. Thesecharacteristics are not present in all the industries with which we are concerned.Electricity47. The structure set up under the Electricity Act, 1947, was of a highlycentralised kind. Under it the Central Authority had a dual function, first, to own and operate generating stations and main transmission lines and to provide suppliesof electricity to the Area Boards; and second, to exercise general co-ordination andcontrol over the policy of the Area Boards, which distributed electricity. (TheNorth of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was, however, separate and special.) TheCentral Authority had virtually complete control over the operations of theindustry, with responsibility for seeing that the industry as a whole paid its way and with powers of direction to the Area Boards over such important matters astariffs and capital development. With the implementation of the Electricity Act,1957, the electricity structure in England and Wales (we refer later to the positionin Scotland) will approximate in many ways to *he gas model.Area Boards48. While the Act of 1957 preserved the pre-existing twelve Area DistributionBoards, and while the functions of the Area Boards remained substantially unchanged, each Area Board is now required separately to pay its way, taking oneyear with another. The individual Boards have also been made expresslyresponsible for the level of their tariffs, and for their capital programmes, subjectto consultation with the Electricity Council and to Ministerial approval of their capital programmes.Central Electricity Generating Board49. The 1957 Act dissolved the Central Authority and, as had been recommended by the Herbert Committee, set up a separate Central electricity generating Board with the functions of generating electricity and supplying it in bulk. This new body has broadly the operational but not the supervisory functionsthat belonged to the old Central Authority. Like the Area Boards it must pay its way, taking one year with another, and it has the.same powers as Area Boards inrelation to its bulk tariffs and capital expenditure.Electricity Council50. The Electricity Act, 1957, established an Electricity Council as the central body in the industry. Its main duties are to advise the Minister on questions affecting the electricity supply industry, and to promote the maintenance by theElectricity Boards in England and Wales of an efficient, co-ordinated and economic system of electricity supply. The Council has none of the directing powers thatformerly belonged to the Central Authority, and its status as a central forum forthe industry and not as a controller is reflected in its constitution. Its membershipconsists of the twelve Chairmen of Area Boards, three members of the GeneratingBoard, and up to six independent members (at present four) all appointed by theMinister. While the Council is not able to issue directions to Electricity Boardson their tariffs and capital programmes it must be consulted about them, andthe Electricity Council is thus in a position to take a view of these matters on anational basis and to give advice to the Minister.51. As in the case of gas, the Central Council performs certain essentialfunctions on behalf of the industry as a whole, including the raising of new capital,the allocation to the Electricity Boards of these borrowings, for the service of whichthey are responsible, and central wage negotiations. In addition the Council hasto maintain a Central Guarantee Fund consisting of contributions obtained fromthe Electricity Boards against any failure to service debt.Scotland52. There are two Electricity Boards in Scotland the North of ScotlandHydro-Electric Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board.   Between them
they cover the whole of Scotland: each is autonomous and responsible for bothgeneration and supply of electricity in its own District: each is subject to the controlof the Secretary of State, his powers of direction taking the usual form. Thepresent organisation in Scotland appears to have secured some of the advantages of decentralisation. The responsibility rests with manageable units, and thearrangements for co-operation between the two Scottish Boards and with the \English Boards appear to be reasonably good. At the Departmental level thecontacts between the Scottish Home Department, the Ministry of Power and theTreasury seem adequate to ensure that a common policy is applied as far aspracticable to electricity in England and Wales, and in Scotland. We have not considered the question whether the two Scottish Boards should eventually be amalgamated in whole or in part. Preliminary examination is being given to thisby the Scottish Home Department and the Treasury.Conclusion53. Although it is too early to form a final view, we think that the structureenvisaged in the Electricity Act, 1957, is about right, at any rate for the present.Time is needed for the Electricity Boards to adjust themselves to the newresponsibility which they have been given for running their concerns independently,while at the same time co-operating within the Electricity Council in determiningand carrying out general policy. It will take time also for the independent membersof the Electricity Council to establish the CounciPs status as the centralco-ordinating body for the industry. We see no reason to question the wisdom of the decision recommended by the Herbert Committee that responsibility formain generation transmission should reside in a separate electricity generatingBoard. This is too large and complex a business to be handled through an ad hocorganisation which was merely an extension of the Area Boards that is, the kindof management which has been suggested for a national gas grid. In order to preserve a reasonable balance between the Generating Board, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the industry&apos;s capital expenditure, and the Area Boards,it is desirable that the Electricity Council should have a high prestige in the industry,and in this the standing of the Chairman and of the independent members wouldbe important.National Coal Board (N.C.B.)54. In contrast with gas and electricity, the coal structure is unitary and its organisation highly centralised. The Board owns all the assets of the industry, isthe employer of all the labour and is responsible for the financial viability of thewhole industry. Its statutory duties are to secure the efficient development of theindustry and to make supplies of coal available of such qualities and sizes, in suchquantities and at such prices as may seem to the Board best calculated to further the public interest. The Board has, however, under a &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement&quot;with the Minister accepted restrictions on its freedom on pricing.Existing Organisation of the Industry55. Under the Act the N.C.B. was left with sole responsibility for organising the industry on the lines that seemed best to it. The Fleck Report in 1955substantially endorsed the then existing organisation; and the present set-up, whichincorporates some minor adjustments proposed by the Fleck Committee, is on thefollowing lines. The N.C.B. itself is functional: in addition to the Chairman and deputy Chairman there are specialist members for production and reconstruction,marketing and stores, finance, industrial relations, staff problems, and scientificmatters including carbonisation and the medical service. These functional members are supported at headquarters by large staffs: the total staff at the centre numbersabout 4,000 or about 6\ per cent, of the total administrative, technical and clerical staff of the industry. In general this functional set-up at headquarters is reproducedat the Divisional and the Area level.56.  The organisation outside headquarters explicitly recognises the need for  ^a high degree of devolution of responsibility for management: this is inevitable in  fview of the size of the industry, with a labour force of over three-quarters of amillion, income about  1,000 millions and assets about  900 millions. Accordingly
the collieries have been formed into groups, each under a group manager controllingbetween two and thirteen pits. The group manager is accountable to the AreaGeneral Manager for the operation of those pits. There are fifty-one Areas, eachunder the control of an Area General Manager who is responsible for themanagement and for carrying out the reorganisation and development of the collieries in his Area. The Areas fall into eight Divisions, which correspondbroadly with the natural groupings of the coal fields and with the wartime regional organisation of the Ministry of Fuel and Power. In charge of each Division thereis a Board appointed by and collectively responsible to the N.C.B.57. We find no grounds for dissenting from the view of the Fleck Committeethat the existence of Divisional Coal Boards is desirable. These units are large enough to sustain the necessary technical staff and to obtain the technical and other advantages of size: they correspond with natural coal field groupings: and theyare not so large as in themselves to raise the problems of over-centralisedmanagement.Criticism of Existing Structure58. We are however impressed with the strength of some of the criticismswhich have been made of the present state of the N.C.B. organisation as a whole:  (a) The existence of specialist directors and large specialist staffs at centralheadquarters cannot fail to centralise more decisions than is desirable.This puts an excessive burden upon the full-time members of the N.C.B.and, in particular, the Chairman and Deputy Chairman.(b) The two lines of command from headquarters, that is, from the N.C.B. tothe Divisional Coal Boards, and from the specialist directors to theircounterparts at Divisional Coal Boards, can lead to confusion of authority.(c) The settling of issues and the making of decisions at a remote level tends tocreate discord and frustration among staff and workers.Special Features of the Coal Industry59. Despite the defects of the existing structure, there are certain aspects ofthe coal industry which make its immediate reorganisation on the gas modelundesirable. Chief among these is the fact that some of the N.C.B&apos;s Divisions arenot financially viable and not likely to become so for many years. Moreover, thereare many important decisions in the coal industry which for some time to comewill be best taken centrally. These include decisions about the size and shape ofthe industry as a whole, the general level and allocation of capital investment, basic price policy and the closure of uneconomic pits. These considerations limit the speed at which it is practicable to move towards the long-term objective of a fullydecentralised organisation.A Possible Line of Development60. None the less the advantages which might be gained from altering the over-centralised structure of the N.C.B. are such that it would be worthwhileconsidering whether a start could not be made towards reshaping the organisation on the model of a &quot; holding company,&quot; on the following lines:  (i) Several Divisional Boards (probably eight in number) would be set up:they would be given a separate statutory existence but would be operating subsidiaries of the N.C.B. They would be responsible for producing and marketing coal, and for carrying on the development ofthe industry in their areas and for the health, safety and welfare of their employees. They would trade under their own names and not merely as branches of the N.C.B. and they would be the employers of their labour. The pits and other capital assets would be transferred to themto hold and manage as trustees for the N.C.B. Each Division would maintain separate trading accounts (which would be published bothin separate and consolidated form by the N.C.B.). Their over-ridingresponsibility would be to their sole proprietor, the N.C.B., which woulddirect them in financial and other matters of high policy ((ii), (hi) and(iv) below). The declared objective would be ultimately to make theindividual Divisions financially viable and independent.
(ii) The N.C.B. would be statutorily responsible for the conduct of the industryin the public interest, for its financial viability as a whole and for its long-term development national coal requirements, competition withother fuels, basic price policy, nation-wide wage agreements, the capitalexpenditure plan, and so on. It would direct its wholly-owned operatingsubsidiaries, the Divisional Boards, accordingly. The N.C.B. would not itself be a trading body: its profit and loss account (as distinct from the consolidated accounts of the whole industry) would consist mainly ofits dividend receipts from the Divisional Boards and its service of debt.(iii) The N.C.B. would have to carry out the following functions in relation to each Divisional Board: -(a) Approval of each year&apos;s production and revenue budget, involving the fixing of production and financial targets, including theallocation of non-economic production required in the publicinterest, and determination of target profits or losses to betransferred to the N.C.B. i.e., in effect an internal levy-subsidyarrangement.(b) Provision of capital and approval of capital expenditure, involvingapproval of each Division^ general development plan whichwould have to be designed to make the Division viable within adefinite period, allocation, of investment resources among the divisions and examination of individual projects to ensureadequate return on investment.(c) Settlement of basic price and marketing policy.(iv) It would probably be desirable for the N.C.B. to have special nationalagencies for foreign trade, open-cast coal production and carbonisation.There may also be certain services which might conveniently becentralised in the N.C.B. such as scientific research and purchase of stores.(v) The N.C.B. would include a Chairman and one or two Deputy chairmen and the Chairmen of the Divisional Boards all appointed by theMinister: a substantial central staff would still be needed, but much smaller than the present headquarters staff.Some Difficulties61. Developments on the lines suggested above would give rise to many problems. One of the most difficult of these is marketing and the extent to whichDivisions should be allowed to compete with each other. Widespread and sharpcompetition among Divisions could have repercussions on their ability to maintain their target production and reach their financial targets. On the other hand itwould seem anomalous to decentralise and then to set up a central organisation to &quot; plan &quot; the marketing. It might be reasonable, however, to give the Divisionsresponsibility for marketing while for the time being retaining at the centre ameasure of control, e.g., over maximum and minimum prices. Within these limits the Divisions would be free to modify their prices in detail as they thought fit,and there would be competition in service, delivery, &amp;c. The aim would be tointroduce increasing competition gradually over a period as the weaker Divisionsbecame stronger.62. There would also be problems about the extent to which members ofDivisional Boards (other than the Chairmen) should be Ministerial appointees (we discuss this question generally in Section V) and about the relations between theMinistry and the Divisional Boards. In the case of gas the Ministry have founddirect access to the Area Boards helpful to understanding and control and it isdesirable, as far as possible, to secure similar arrangements in the case of the coalindustry. There may well be some subjects within the statutory powers of the divisional Boards on which it would seem reasonable for the Ministry to be indirect contact with them. On certain other matters, such as investment, finance, &amp;c,the overall responsibility would rest with the N.C.B. and the Board might thereforereasonably expect all approaches by the Ministry to be made to it or through it.The development of channels of communication between the Ministry and theindustry would no doubt be effected on an ad hoc basis, but the aim should be to foster contacts between the Ministry and the Divisions, even though it wouldprobably be wise generally that N.C.B. headquarters should be represented atdiscussions between them.
Conclusion63. If the present centralised and unitary structure could be converted into a&quot; holding company &quot; structure as suggested above, this would be a major step in decentralisation. While leaving the ultimate responsibility for the industryunequivocally with the N.C.B., it would open up possibilities of further developmenttowards Divisional autonomy or in such directions as circumstances may require.British Transport Commission (B.T.C.)Brief History64. The B.T.C. was set up by the Transport Act of 1947 with the general duty&quot; to provide or secure or promote the provision of an efficient, adequate, economicaland properly integrated system of public inland transport and port facilities withinGreat Britain, for passengers and goods with due regard to safety of operation.&quot;65. The situation was substantially changed by the Transport Act of 1953,which substituted for the general duty to secure an integrated system of transport,a general duty simply to provide railway services and to provide such canal, port and other transport facilities as the Commission consider expedient, having regardto public need. It is only for London passenger transport that the Commission isstill required to provide &quot; an adequate and properly co-ordinated system.&quot; TheAct, and the Railway Reorganisation scheme of 1954 which followed, alsosubstantially modified the structure and scope of the Commission^ undertaking.In consequence of that Act, the Commission disposed to private enterprise of morethan half of its long-distance vehicles formerly operated by its Road haulage executive: and all the Executives, which previously acted (under the policy-forming Commission) as operational bodies were dissolved except the london transport Executive (L.T.E.). Under the Railway Reorganisation Scheme of 1954,responsibility for the management of the railways was devolved from the centre to six regions under Area Boards. The co-ordinating and supervisory functions ofthe old Railway Executive in relation to railways passed substantially into the handsof the Commission itself.Existing Structure and Functions66. The existing structure is unitary, with the statutory responsibility forpaying its way applicable to the totality of the undertakings comprised in theCommission. The organisation is as follows British Transport Commission(All Members, including those who are Chairmen ofthe Area Boards, appointed by the Minister)Board ofManagementforBritishRoadServices(Membersappointedby theB.T.C.)Board ofManagementforDocks(Membersappointedby theB.T.C.)Board ofManagementforInlandWaterways(Membersappointedby theB.T.C.)Board ofManagementforHotels(Membersappointedby theB.T.C.)Company Boards,controllingProvincial Buses, Thos. Cook, &amp;c.(Directors appointed by the B.T.C.)LondonTransportExecutive(Membersappointedby theMinister)--v--SixRailwayArea Boards(Membersappointedby theB.T.C.)
The Commission in Relation to its Subsidiary Undertakings67. For undertakings other than the railways the Commission is substantiallya policy-forming body, as envisaged in the Reorganisation Scheme of July 1954.The general management and operation of the various non-railway undertakingsare in the hands of the L.T.E. and of Managing Boards. The Commission retainscontrol over such matters as investment programmes and projects, budgets and finance, senior appointments, wages and other general policy matters, as well as any management issues which are common to all the undertakings. In relation tothe railways, however, the Commission acts not only as the overall policy bodybut also as the focal point for a considerable volume of railway executive business,including equipment policy, standardisation over the whole field of railwayengineering, fares, charges and the traffic problems of major customers. TheChairman of the Commission is in effect also the chief executive of the british railways.Criticism of the Present Structure and Organisation68. Apart from objections of sheer size and consequent unmanageability thefollowing criticisms may reasonably be directed against the present system (i) The B.T.C. is a lop-sided and dual authority, acting as the central management for one undertaking, i.e., the railways, which representsabout three-quarters of the totality of the undertakings; and as thepolicy-forming body for all the undertakings.(ii) Experience suggests that the degree of co-ordination which is requiredbetween the railways, the road services remaining in public ownership,docks, hotels and canals, may hardly need for its adequate performancean &quot; overall &quot; Commission in which all these undertakings are merged.(iii) The present organisation is not conducive to further decentralisation ofrailway business to the regions and stands in the way of the Ministry&apos;sobtaining an adequate picture of the problems both of the railways asa whole and of particular regions. This problem is not made any easierby the fact that all business coming to the Commission, includingrailway business, is channelled through the Secretary-General, who isassisted by seven or eight sections dealing with the various aspects ofthe Commission^ business, labour, technical, &amp;c, and also by the rumpof the old Railway Executive staff.69. The questions which these criticisms throw up are: first, whether it is right for the Commission to continue in its present form and to remain responsiblefor all its present activities; and second, what should be the form of railwaystructure, including provision for central management.Hiving-off70. We think that the first step in decentralisation should be to hive offundertakings unless there is a manifest case for retaining them within a comprehensive organisation. On this basis a prima facie case can be made out for removing certain undertakings entirely from the responsibilities of theCommission, as follows (i) The London Transport Executive. This is a large enough undertaking(receipts over  80 millions) to stand on its own feet and to pay its own way. It gives rise to special problems connected with London trafficas a whole which lead us to think that it would be better run as anindependent organisation, as it was before the war under the london passenger Transport Board. The inclusion of the L.T.E. within thecharge of the B.T.C. appears to add unnecessarily to the load on the&quot;members of the Commission. If the L.T.E. were accordingly made aseparate and independent authority there would no doubt be difficulty about arrangements for pooling receipts between the suburban railwaysand the services operated by the L.T.E. In pre-war times very complicated and cumbersome arrangements for such pooling existed
between the London Passenger Transport Board and the railways: itmight be hoped, however, that some more simple yet adequatearrangements could be devised between two publicly-owned authorities,the L.T.E. and the nationalised railways.(ii) Docks. The case for leaving with the B.T.C. the nationalised docks (which account for about one-third of the total dock capacity in the UnitedKingdom) does not now appear strong. These docks are capable of paying their own way and are efficiently run by the present Board of management, which might be converted into an independent authority.We doubt if it is necessary to retain docks within the responsibility ofthe B.T.C. on account of their operational connexion with the railwaysthough we would except from this view the small packet ports, whichmay be regarded as a proper part of the railway enterprise, and perhapsalso the Southampton docks. If the rest of the docks were nowseparated from the B.T.C. and set up on their own account this would open up the possibility of future and probably desirable developmentsunder which the central dock authority could be abolished and regionaldock authorities set up for the various areas on the lines of the Port ofLondon Authority and the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.(iii) Inland Waterways. These constitute only a small part of the totalorganisation. They are operated independently of the Commission^other undertakings; and their inclusion among the Commission^responsibilities again imposes some unnecessary additional load at thecentre; for although they are a small undertaking they excitedisproportionate public interest and pressures. The canals could not,however, under present arrangements pay their own way, for they areconsistently in deficit to the extent of  \ million a year, apartfrom capital charges. It is not helpful to the future solvency of theB.T.C. to have to carry this loss, and it might make for a better solutionof canal problems if they were separated from the B.T.C., even if someannual subsidy had to be voted by Parliament at any rate over several years.71. We have considered also the possibility of hiving-off other undertakingssuch as road haulage, road passenger transport, and hotels and catering, but thinkthat the arguments are prim a facie against this (i) Road Haulage. The B.T.C. is now responsible for only a minor part(perhaps about one-fifth) of long-distance road haulage. It now has,in the British Road Services, 15,000 lorries organised in five road haulage companies; these are separate from the railways&apos; own collection and delivery fleet of about another 15,000 vehicles. The B.T.C. is developing the use of these companies for integrating road transportwith the railways by collecting and delivering freight in containersspecially adapted for carriage by rail for the major part of the journey.This joint working exploits to the best advantage the essentialcharacteristics of both road and rail transport, and it would be unfortunate to interfere with its development. We think it desirable,therefore, that the publicly-owned part of road haulage should remainin the same general organisation as the railways.(ii) Road   Passenger   Undertakings. The   B.T.C.   interest   consists   ofshareholdings in bus companies. Control by the Commission is light,and the working arrangements with the bus companies are satisfactory.These bus companies have, without any ill effect, been substantiallyunder railway ownership for many years and there seems little ground for disturbing the existing arrangements.(iii) Hotels. The B.T.C. take the view that management of hotels is essentiallypart of the railway operations and necessarily linked to the provisionof restaurant services on trains and station buffets. This is a minorancillary activity to the railways and, organised as it is under a separateBoard of Management, it does not cause so much additional work atthe centre as to justify suggesting that it should nevertheless be hived off.
Possible Developments After Hiving-Off72. If hiving-off on the lines suggested in paragraph 70 proved after detailed examination to be desirable, the structural problem, though still difficult, wouldbe much simplified. The raison d&apos;etre of the &quot; overall&quot; B.T.C. would have gone,but some central body would still be needed to discharge policy and centralfunctions in relation to the railways and their ancillary road and hotel undertakings.It would doubtless be necessary to change the name of the Commission to reflectmore closely its different and somewhat reduced scope. In regard to further developments, we have directed our attention mainly to the possibilities of furtherdecentralisation of railway business.Some Uncertainties73. The nature of the central organisation that would be required dependsto some extent upon whether the existing regional arrangements for railways are changed or not. There are some uncertainties and difficulties here. Theexisting six railway regions already have virtual operating independence, though their expenditure is governed by budgets approved by the Commission. There is,however, no apparatus for apportionment of receipts among the various regionsaccording to the services which each performs. Receipts are treated as&quot; belonging &quot; to the region in which the traffic originates, so that none of the regionshas, under the present system, any clear idea of its profitability. It is difficult tosee how concepts of greater regional responsibility in financial matters can beestablished unless satisfactory arrangements can be made for a proper allocation of receipts. We cannot say how far this is likely to be practicable: but beforenationalisation the railway companies had arrangements (cumbersome and costly)for pooling and allocation among themselves. Present improvements in electronicdevices and computers might enable this to be done now more scientifically and economically.74. If this difficulty could be overcome, there would still remain the important question whether the present railway regions could reasonably be expected tobecome viable in the foreseeable future. This problem is, to some extent,dominated by the whole question of the size and shape of the railway system andof the future of the railways as a whole. As far as individual regions are concerned,the present six areas appear to be broadly satisfactory for operational purposes and generally satisfactory as viable units. There is, however, likely to bea special problem in regard to the Scottish region, which on any rationalbasis of sharing of receipts is likely to show a substantial loss. It is conceivable that this special problem might be met by excluding from the Scottish regionthe northern part (broadly speaking the lines north and west of Perth andAberdeen) which does not form an essential and integral part of the system andwhich is believed to be responsible for a substantial part of the unprofitability ofthe Scottish region. This would enable the losses necessarily incurred in thenorthern area to be met as a separate item, either from public funds or fromsurpluses which might come to be earned by the other regions. We put thisforward merely as an idea which merits further examination in the general context of greater regional decentralisation.75. Whatever possibilities may exist in regard to the creation of financiallyindependent railway regions in the future, we think that many issues will continueto call for central settlement. These include the usual central problems common to all the industries the raising of funds, investment, national wages settlements,&amp;c. There are however, in addition, some other very important items which thenature of railway business makes it necessary to handle centrally. Among theseare the shape and size of the railway system, standardisation and development,the co-ordination of the nationally-owned road and rail undertakings and, mostimportant of all, the general level of fares and charges upon which the viabilityof the system as a whole, as well as of the regions, substantially depends. Forthese reasons we do not think that the gas model of organisation would be appropriate. The coal model suggested in paragraph 60 might be broadlyappropriate if, by solution of the difficulties mentioned in paragraph 73, the regionscould be constituted as real financial entities, although there would remain rather more essentially central issues in the railways than in the case of coal.
A Possible Model76. If a solution to the problem of creating regional railway units asmeaningful financial entities cannot be found, it might still be possible to move in the direction of the coal model in the following way:  (i) The six Area Railway Boards would continue as now to enjoy fulloperational and management control for their undertakings subject todirection on financial and related matters from the new centralauthority. The assets of the regional railway undertakings would betransferred to them as trustees for the central authority and they wouldbecome the direct employers of their labour force. The arrangements in regard to the Managing Boards for road services and hotels wouldbe simiiar.(ii) The central authority would be statutorily responsible for the conduct ofthe industry in the public interest and for its financial viability as a whole.It would discharge this responsibility by general control of the area boards for railways and of the Managing Boards for the other retainedundertakings.(iii) The central authority would be primarily concerned with the shape and size of the railway system as a whole, investment, standardisation, &amp;c,freights and charges, central finance, national wage agreements, general co-ordination of its railway and road undertakings and the strategy of competition with the private road services.(iv) The central authority might include a Chairman and two Deputy Chairmen,together with the Chairmen of the Area Boards and of the ManagingBoards. It might make for greater coherence if the regional general managers were to become ex officio the Chairmen of the Area RailwayBoards and hence members of the central authority.(v) The central authority&apos;s powers to direct the Area and Managing Boardscould not properly be limited in view of its overall responsibility, but with its reduced functions (as compared with those of the B.T.C.) andwith growing independence in the regions, the existing central staff couldbe reduced in size.(vi) The central authority would set financial targets (including loss targets) foreach of the subsidiary Boards in such a way as, to ensure that the undertakings as a whole paid their way. The central authority would becharged with the task of improving the techniques of financial budgetsso as to bring more realism into them, imposing clear-cut financial obligations on each of the Boards.(vii) The central authority would have to control the investment programmes of the Boards, with special emphasis on investment that would help toimprove the finances and efficiency of the investing body and of theundertaking as a whole.Conclusion77. There is a prima facie case for biving-off from the B.T.C., london transport, the docks and the canals, under authorities which would have to pay theirown way, subject in the case of the canals to whatever subsidy may be thought necessary. The problem of organisation for the remainder of the undertakings nowin the B.T.C. (railways, road services and hotels) is dominated by the. financial difficulties of finding an accounting basis for establishing independence and responsibility for financially viable regions. We think, however, that it would be worth while investigating the possibility of setting up a central authority on the lines indicated in paragraph 76, leaving it with a mandate to pursue furtherdecentralisation as fully as practicable having regard to its own responsibilities.Section V. APPOINTMENTS, SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF BOARDS78. We have considered some of the problems of appointments as they arise under the existing organisation and as they might be affected by the kind of developments for coal and transport which are discussed in Section IV.
Who Should Make Appointments?79. At present Ministers appoint all the members of central Boards (B.T.C.,N.C.B., Gas Council, Electricity Council): they also appoint the members of regional boards in gas and electricity and of the L.T.E. But appointments to other regional boards, i.e., in coal and the railways, are made by the central authority in each case.The question has been raised whether Ministers ought not to appoint the membersof these regional Boards also, or at least the Chairmen.\ 80. Apart from the special case of the L.T.E., Ministerial appointment nowobtains only in the case of separate statutory bodies which have to pay their own way. We incline to the view that the present differences in the methods of appointment set out above are in general justified. Central authorities which carryresponsibility for the financial viability of the entire industry have a case for claiming that members of their subordinate Boards should be appointed by them and shouldowe undivided allegiance to them. These arguments would, in our view, be valideven if the organisation of the coal and railway industries were developed along&quot; holding company &quot; lines as indicated in Section IV. In addition the centralauthority is probably best placed to make promotions from the industry itself to subordinate Boards.81. While this applies to the generality of members of subordinate regional boards in the coal and railway industries, we think that if these industries were tobe reorganised on the lines which we suggest, there would be a strong case for ministerial appointment of the Chairmen. These Chairmen would be the heads of statutory bodies; they would also automatically become members of the central body, for the composition of which the Minister would continue to be responsible;and for these two reasons Ministerial appointment would be appropriate.Moreover Ministerial appointment of the Chairmen would increase theindependence of these regional Boards, and perhaps also communication and understanding between the controlling Departments and the regions. It would be important to convince the central authorities that this limited power of Ministerialappointment to subordinate Boards would not conflict with their overallresponsibility for the industry. In any event there would have to be the closestconsultation between the Minister and the central authority about theseappointments: often the Minister would act on the nominations of the centralauthority, especially in regard to the Regional General Managers who, we havesuggested in paragraph 76 (iv), should be Chairmen of the Area Railway Boards.Period of Appointments and Powers of Termination82. The formal powers to terminate current appointments to the Boards vary from industry to industry. Even in those cases where there has been no formalpower to terminate unsatisfactory appointments, it has generally been found possibleto achieve this in practice by payment of appropriate compensation for prematuretermination.83. There are two main interests to be reconciled. First, the Minister needsfreedom to adjust the membership of the Boards and to make fresh choices; forthis reason he must have adequate powers of dismissal. The consequence is thatBoard members can enjoy no formal security of tenure. On the other hand it isdesirable that the majority of full-time members should be selected from those with long experience within the industry, and also that recruitment of persons of the right&apos; calibre from outside should be facilitated. It is natural that people in both categories should require some security of their tenure of office; thoserecruited from within the industry should not have to fear that their career in theindustry might be curtailed if their period of office in a post to which the minister made the appointment were not extended on expiry before retiring age, or if itwere prematurely ended; and suitable candidates will not be forthcoming from outside unless they are offered a sufficiently long term of office.84. We think that the feeling of diminished security on the part of thoserecruited to the Board from within the industry might be reduced by arrangements on the following lines. There might be more frequent use of the practice (already adopted in some of the industries) under which the holding of an executive postin the industry is combined with membership of the Board and continues unaffectedafter cessation of membership.  Alternatively, appointment as a Board member
might be made on a provisional basis for a trial period during which an existingcontract of service in the industry would be maintained, so that the member couldon retirement from the Board in this period revert to his former terms ofemployment. If membership continued after this trial period but terminated before his normal retiring age, he would be offered suitable alternative employment withinthe industry: if, exceptionally, no such administrative solution was feasible, hewould be eligible for appropriate compensation in view of the loss of his remainingcareer.85. As regards other full-time members, we think that the present methodof appointment for a fixed period of five years only tends to act as a disincentive.It might be preferable (though in some cases it might need legislation, at any rateby Statutory Instrument) if appointments could be offered for an indefinite period,with a provision for termination on notice being given at any time after the expiry of five years. If appointees proved unsatisfactory, termination of their appointmentafter less than five years would of course involve the payment of compensation.Composition of Boards Numbers and Proportion of Part-Time and Full-TimeMembers86. Annex IV shows the statutory requirements, the present position and recent trends in composition of the Boards.87. The position varies from industry to industry and reflects the varyingfunctions of the Boards. Experience shows that there is a legitimate place for both full-time and part-time members. We consider, however, that the balance between part-time and full-time members should not be the subject of rigidstatutory definition, but should be settled from time to time by the appointingMinister in relation to the duties of each particular Board. Care is needed in this connexion to avoid creating more full-time posts than is warranted by the volumeof work to be done. We have no proposals to make in regard to the presentcomposition of the Boards, for the existing arrangements appear to us to be broadly on the right lines, except that it might be desirable to have increasedflexibility as regards the numbers of part-time members. Consideration wouldhave to be given ad hoc, however, to this matter in this light of the changingrequirements as the structure and organisation of the industries developed along the lines indicated in Section IV.Section VI -RELATIONS WITH PARLIAMENTContacts Between Parliament and the Boards88. The governing statutes all vest the management of the affairs of theindustries in Boards appointed by the responsible Ministers, who have limitedpower and responsibilities. Parliament has few direct contacts with the Boards:contacts are mainly through Ministers, although the Boards give evidence directly to the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, which provides a continuingParliamentary forum for the systematic examination of each of the industries asa whole. Parliament can bring pressure to bear upon Boards directly and indirectlythrough criticism in the course of debate, reinforced on occasions by the exerciseof Parliamentary power to withhold or limit the supplies of money. A procedure for the various Parliamentary activities concerning the industries parliamentary questions, debates, financial control (the sanction of borrowing and the scrutiny of accounts) and the operations of the Select Committee has been built up with difficulty over the past ten years or so: this procedure may not always be entirely satisfactory to Parliament but it has at least become clearer in the course of time.Parliamentary Questions89. Since the report by the first Select Committee on Nationalised industries in 1953 it has been established and generally accepted that Ministers should answer questions relating to those matters for which they have statutory responsibilities in relation to the industries [e.g., accounts, capital investment, borrowing,
repayments, &amp;c.) or on matters where they have or might have issued directions,e,g., matters of national interest. In the very nature of things a precise and tidydefinition of the proper scope of questions, especially those in the last category,is not possible, but by and large the procedure seems to have settled down ina fairly satisfactory way.Debates90. Discussion of the affairs of the bodies can arise in a variety of ways-on Bills or Statutory Instruments (particularly those providing for borrowing powers), on accounts and reports (including reports of the Select Committee) andto some extent on debates about general policy affecting the Boards, e.g., fuel ortransport policy. In addition to the time which is automatically available on Bills,time for debates may be found out of Government time (normally three daysprovided for the purpose), in Opposition time or on the Adjournment. Thereappear to be ample opportunities for debate; and, indeed, in some cases majordebates may be held so often that they become merely harassing to the Governmentand the Boards. It is, however, natural and inevitable that there should be majorParliamentary debates on the periodical extension of the borrowing powers of the bodies. It might be better if Parliament could be induced to debate the affairs of nationalised bodies less frequently and at times when a solid factual basis fordiscussion is available, e.g., on borrowing proposals and forward plans of theindustry, or on reports by the Select Committee.The Select Committee91. There has been continuous difficulty about the role of Parliament andof Select Committees in relation to the nationalised bodies; and this is reflected inthe various attempts made between 1951 and 1956 to devise terms of reference fora Select Committee that would be acceptable to all concerned. The first Committee(appointed in 1951) reported in 1953 in favour of a Select Committee which wouldbe served by an officer analogous to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, assisted by professional accountants, and would be able to examine accounts and obtain information on the general practice and policy of the bodies without controllingtheir work. These proposals were rejected by the Government in 1954, whichproposed a further Select Committee to examine and report on the accounts and current policies and practices of the industries, except matters of ministerial responsibility or day-to-day administration or other matters which fell to beconsidered under other machinery. This second Select Committee reported at theend of 1955 that its terms of reference left insufficient scope for it to obtain information which would be of any real use to the House. After a debate on thisreport at the end of 1956 the present Select Committee was set up with thefollowing terms of reference &quot;That a Select Committee be appointed to examine the Reports and accounts of the Nationalised Industries established by Statute whosecontrolling Boards are appointed by Ministers of the Crown and whose annualreceipts are not wholly or mainly derived from moneys provided by parliament or advanced from the Exchequer.&quot;In short, the Government came to the conclusion that it was wiser not to debarthe Committee from discussion of certain questions by specific prohibitions, but rather to trust to the good sense of the Committee itself. The Committee is,however, still expected to avoid impinging on day-to-day administration, which isthe responsibility of the Boards, and on policy issues which are the responsibilityof Ministers.92. The Select Committee is equipped with a staff (House of Commons) and can obtain assistance also from its Treasury Liaison Officer. We venture to thinkthat so far the Committee has operated in a manner which has on the wholeproved satisfactory. It has already reported twice on the Coal industry and thetwo Scottish Electricity Boards, and it is currently considering the two airways corporations. The Committee may well report at a later stage on how it thinksits work can be made more effective still.
A Comptroller and Auditor-General93. A suggestion frequently made and rejected in the past and recentlyrepeated both in Parliamentary debates and by the Select Committee itself, is thatthe Committee should be assisted by an officer who would perform for it functionsanalogous to those which the Comptroller and Auditor-General performs for thePublic Accounts Committee. We think that the arguments which governments have previously accepted as conclusive against this suggestion are still valid.It would encourage the Select Committee to seek to exercise direct supervision over the affairs of the Boards, thus duplicating and interfering with the functionsof Ministers and Departments. Moreover, the auditing staff might well direct theattention of the Committee to relatively unimportant topical matters rather than to major issues of legitimate Parliamentary concern. Investigation of this kind could not fail to affect the morale of the Boards and to introduce into their businessactivities harmful inhibitions and excessive caution. We think on the other handthat it might be well that the Select Committee should be encouraged to makefuller use of the Treasury Liaison Officer to advise them about the shape and content of their enquiries. Although this might place that officer sometimes in adelicate position, the provision of more advice to the Committee in this way, byan officer of the Government itself, seems to us likely to be less harmful to theoperations of the Boards and to the relations between Parliament, the Ministerand the Boards than the creation of a post of &quot; Comptroller and Auditor-General &quot;under the Committee. Otherwise we think that the Select Committee procedure should be developed along its present lines.Conclusion94. We think that the present arrangements in regard to Parliamentary controland procedure are in general about as good as any that can be devised. we recognise, however, that they are not regarded by Parliament as entirely satisfactory,and we make the following points and suggestions (i) The changes we have suggested in the framework of relations betweenthe Government and the Boards (Section III) are designed to increase and emphasise the responsibilities of the Boards and to limit and clarifythe responsibilities of Ministers: they should also give Parliament ayardstick against which to measure the actual performance of the boards. The decentralisation of the industries suggested in Section IVshould also have a similar effect. It seems reasonable to hope thatthe general effect of our suggestions might be gradually to encourageParliament to seek to intervene less in the affairs of the industries asthey became increasingly autonomous and decentralised. It must berecognised, however, that any intervention in the affairs of the industries by Ministers themselves, beyond the limits which we have suggested(whether such intervention is covert or overt), increases not only theresponsibility of Ministers, but the extent to which Parliament is entitledto ask questions: and would thus be doubly incompatible with that greater degree of independence which we visualise for the industries.(ii) Even with the changes we suggest there would still be a large area of ministerial control; and the more clearly it is defined and explained to Parliament the better. But even inside this area it seems to us thata too intensive Parliamentary supervision would be harmful.Multiplication of supervisory agencies, whether Parliament itself or a select Committee, can only lead to confusion and dividedresponsibilities. On the other hand the Minister remains answerable toParliament for those things for which he is responsible; and he mustbe in a position to convince Parliament that he is himself effectivelysupervising and controlling the industries in accordance with hisresponsibilties. We have already stressed in this connexion the needfor the Departments to develop continuous contaots with the bodiesat all levels, and to be kept fully informed about developments-more fully than some of them are at present. But information need not,and should not, involve intervention. This process of understandingmay be assisted by the creation of independent: regional boards and bythe measures of devolution indicated in Section IV.
(iii) We think that much of the criticism in Parliament of the nationalisedbodies and the Ministers who are responsible for them arises from thefact that, whereas at the outset all these bodies were expected to beviable commercial undertakings, several of them have for one reason or another failed to pay their way. We believe that the proposals whichwe have made in Section III for the clarification of financialresponsibilities and the improvement of the financial performance ofthe bodies would go some way to ameliorate relations. On the otherhand, it must be recognised that relations are likely to become moredifficult and Parliamentary interference to become greater if the bodies are allowed or required to run at a loss and have to apply to parliament for funds to meet the losses.(iv) Some of the criticism of the nationalised bodies is based on the view thatthey are inefficient or at least that nobody knows whether they areefficient or not. This had led from time to time to suggestions for aso-called efficiency audit. We do not see any practical method oftesting the continued efficiency of the industries other than supervisionby Ministers and their Departments. We have already emphasised thatthe Department should develop yardsticks for comparing the efficiency of the nationalised bodies both among themselves and with private industry: in this connexion we propose that the preparation and study of comparative statistics of the kind given in Annexes I and II shouldbe included and improved. It would probably also help if departments were able to explain to the Select Committee the methods which theyuse to test efficiency; and it may prove eventually desirable to supply theSelect Committee with statistics of comparative profitability of the nationalised industries and private industries on the lines of Annex I.Section VII.-RELATIONS BETWEEN MINISTERS AND THE BOARDS95. In Sections III-VI we have dealt with the powers and problems of ministerial control of nationalised bodies in relation to the specific topics dealtwith in those Sections. We should, however, comment generally also on the powersof direction which Ministers have under the Acts and on the use of those powers.96. The functions of the various Boards (including the statutory duty toprovide supplies) are wide and impinge on large sections of the community in a vital way. The appropriate Minister has under the Acts power to issue to the boards &quot; directions of a general character as to the exercise and performance bythe Boards of their functions in relation to matters appearing to the Minister to affect the national interest.&quot; These general powers of direction are supplemented by powers of specific direction on a variety of matters, including the establishmentof reserves, the application of excess or surplus revenues and the remedying of suchdefects in the Boards&apos; general arrangements for production and supply as are brought to the attention of the Minister by Consumers&apos; Councils. The general powers of direction are inevitably vague and neither these general powers nor the specific powers have, in practice, been used to any significant extent. ministers have usually preferred to secure by informal arrangements such alterations asthey require in the Boards&apos; activities.97. There is clearly much to be said in favour of avoiding frequent use of formal powers of direction. In the first place, this would undermine theindependence and initiative of the Boards: and it might also create an impression that the Minister lacked confidence in them. Moreover, formal directions wouldoften tend to be too rigid and too precise for the subject matter which has to bedealt with. Many of the matters which have to be taken up with the Boards areof a minor character and can be settled amicably without much difficulty. Formaldirections for these would hardly be appropriate even if they were intra vires.Most major issues also can be, and are in practice, settled by arrangement betweenthe Minister and the Board without resort to formal direction.98. There are, however, some disadvantages in the use of informalunderstandings (which are generally not published) as compared with formal
directions (which, under the Acts, have to be published in the Board&apos;s report unlessthe Minister has notified to the Board his opinion that it is against the national interest so to do). Informal and unpublished understandings may lead touncertainty about where the responsibility for a particular course of action lies : and parliament may think that through such arrangements Ministers are seeking toavoid answering to Parliament for their actions. These considerations applyparticularly to major matters of policy and to Ministerial pressure upon the Boardsto undertake or maintain substantial uneconomic activities. We do not think thatit is possible to lay down any firm line on this: but there may well be occasions on which it would be preferable that Ministers should act by issuing directions (inconsultation with the Boards as is provided under the Acts) rather than by reachinginformal understandings. We have in paragraph 38 already emphasised that, if thesystem of targets proposed in Section III were adopted, Boards would be entitled toask for publication of any Ministerial intervention that significantly impaired their ability to comply with their prescribed financial obligations: this would be truewhether such intervention was made effective through informal arrangements orformal directions.Section VIII.-QUALIFICATIONS AND SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONSTentative Nature of Suggestions99. We wish to stress again the tentative nature of our suggestions in thisReport and especially those which relate to structure and organisation. This is inevitable in view of the limitation of the knowledge of Departments, and the size and complexity of the industries. If Ministers were inclined towards the suggestionswe have made, it would be necessary to have a thorough investigation in order tosee how far the suggested alterations are feasible: it would be necessary to consult the bodies involved and to convince them of the desirability of changes, for changes which had to be imposed would be unlikely to be beneficial. In some cases changesmight have to be preceded by an independent enquiry. There is, of course, a risk that such an enquiry might produce an answer unacceptable to the Government;but this might be minimised by drawing up terms of reference which laid emphasis on the general line of development towards which the Government were disposed.Some General Considerations100. There are some other considerations which Ministers will wish to bearin mind. Most of the industries concerned have already been subjected to publicenquiries into their structure and to reorganisation in the past 10 years. Therehave been two reports on the Coal Industry (Burrows and Fleck): there has beena report on the Electricity Industry (Herbert). As a result changes have beenmade in the organisations. The structure of the B.T.C. has been radically altered by the 1953 Act and the 1954 Railway Reorganisation Scheme. We need notstress the dislocation and loss of morale which come from too frequent changes.In this connexion regard must be paid also to the fact that controversial changes,which provoke reversal later on, could do serious damage to these large andbasic industries. For all these reasons radical changes would require a powerful and well-established case: and there would be advantage in moving slowly andquietly if this were at all possible.Procedure and Legislation101. The suggestions which we make in Section III about the financialfraniework, the industries&apos; paying their way, prices, &amp;c, could be adopted without legislation; and we believe the suggestions have merits whether or not any changes are made in structure and organisation. Major structural changes in the CoalIndustry and in Transport, such as the statutory establishment of Divisional Boards,the transfer of assets to the regions, and the hiving-off of sections of the B.T.C.,would require legislation; but some progress might be made in the direction of greater autonomy for the regions without legislation, if the B.T.C. and N.C.B. were convinced of the desirability of this.SECRET55281 e
Summary of Conclusions102. Subject to the important qualifications in paragraphs 99 and 100, our conclusions may be summarised as follows:  General(1) We think that the functioning of the industries (coal, electricity, gas andtransport) and relations with the Government and with parliament could be improved by developments along the following general lines-(a) The Boards should be given an increased degree of independence and greater responsibility (paragraph 10).(b) In particular their financial and economic obligations should bemade more precise and applied more firmly (paragraph 12).(c) In the cases of coal and transport there should be greaterdecentralisation and a move towards a type of organisation more closely analogous to the normal organisation of large enterprisesin the private sector (paragraphs 10, 63 and 77).(d) Contacts between the industries and the Departments should be improved in order that Ministers may be better informed aboutthe industries (paragraph 11).Economic and Financial Obligations(2) In pursuance of Conclusions (1) (a) and (1) (b) it would be necessary thatthe industries should improve on their past financial results and so&apos; should reduce the heavy and increasing demands which they make uponthe economy and the taxpayer.  To this end we make the following proposals:  (a) The Government should settle with each financially autonomousBoard a definite business framework and standard of expectedfinancial performance which would take account of the specialcircumstances of each and which would be published. (As a preliminary it might be necessary to reform the financial situation of some of the bodies by, e.g., capital reorganisation) (paragraphs20-23.)(b) The arrangement in (a) would involve defining for each Board the precise significance of the obligation to &quot; pay their way on anaverage of good and bad years.&quot; The period of this averageshould not exceed five years. Moreover &quot; paying their way &quot;would generally mean that the Boards&apos; revenues should be notless than enough to cover depreciation at replacement cost anda regular allocation to general reserve which might normally be1 per cent, per annum on net assets, but could be more forrapidly expanding businesses (paragraph 22).(c) There would be little change in regard to Government supervision of the Boards&apos; transactions on capital account. Governmentapproval would continue to be required for their development plans, their short-term investment programmes and their externalborrowings (paragraph 25).(d) The capital requirements of the industries should continue to bemet from the Exchequer; they should not be obliged to go tothe market, with or without Government guarantees(paragraphs 39-40).(e) To correspond with their increased financial responsibilities the boards should be allowed greater freedom to determine the levelof their own charges (paragraphs 29-30).(/) The operations of consumers&apos; Consultative Councils should be made more effective and better publicised in order to help allay fearsthat excessive prices were being charged (paragraphs 31-34).(g) Government intervention in regard to wages should continue to be restricted to informal consultations (paragraphs 36-37).
(/?) Serious failure on the part of the Boards to achieve the agreedtargets in (2) (a) would be regarded as a default justifying greaterintervention than normal by the Government in their financialaffairs. If, on the other hand, Ministers intervened after the targets had been set, in such a way as significantly to impair the boards&apos; ability to reach their targets, then the targets themselvesshould be adjusted accordingly (paragraphs 22 (hi) and 38).Organisation(3) No standard pattern would suit the varying needs of these diverse industries and we have accordingly considered them separately.Gas(a) The present structure (fully autonomous Area Boards together witha central Gas Council, composed mainly of the Chairmen of area Boards and serving as a channel for the collective views ofthe industry) is well adapted to the nature of the industry andflexible enough to match prospective developments(paragraph 46).Electricity(b) A substantial measure of decentralisation, with increased autonomyfor the regions, has been set in train by the Electricity Act, 1957.Time is needed for the industry to adjust itself to this and a finalview cannot yet be formed (paragraph 53).Coal(c) The present organisation appears to be over-centralised and theexisting non-statutory regional Boards are accordingly weakened.There are special circumstances which limit the pace of movestowards decentralisation. But a start might be made byreshaping the industry on the model of a holding company withsubsidiaries.  The main features of this would be:  (i) Statutory Divisional Boards would be set up as individualoperating units, trading on their own account butremaining with the general status of wholly-ownedsubsidiaries of the N.C.B. (paragraph 60 (i)).(ii) The Chairmen of these Divisional Boards would be membersof the N.C.B. (paragraph 60 (v)).(iii) The N.C.B. would remain responsible for securing thefinancial viability of the industry as a whole and its long-term development; it would direct the DivisionalBoards accordingly, e.g., through control of their investment and by setting production and financial targets for them (paragraphs 60 (ii) and 60 (iii)).Transport 1(d) The B.T.C. is over-burdened.   It has to act as a policy-making body for all its diverse undertakings, and has to deal also with aconsiderable volume of railway management problems. A move towards decentralisation might be made by hiving-off:  (i) the London Transport Executive;(ii) the nationalised docks;(iii) the inland waterways (paragraph 70).(e) The undertakings thereafter remaining with the B.T.C. would berailways, road services and hotels. There would still be reasonand room for decentralisation to regional railway Boards and toManaging Boards for road services and hotels on substantially the lines we have suggested for the coal industry. Butmeaningful accounts for separate railway regions could beprepared only if a reasonable solution could be found to theproblem of allocating receipts among them (paragraphs 73-77).SECRET55281 e 2
(4) Appointments(a) All appointments to those separate statutory bodies which arerequired to pay their own way should continue to be made by ministers (paragraph 80).(b) The N.C.B. and the B.T.C. should continue to appoint the ordinarymembers of their subordinate Boards (paragraph 80).(c) The Chairmen of such subordinate Boards, who would under our proposals also be members of the central Board, should beappointed by Ministers (paragraph 81).(d) We see no need for major changes in the existing arrangements formanning the Boards; but some minor adjustments might be madeto reduce the inevitable insecurity of tenure. The size andpattern of individual Boards need to be settled by reference to the varying circumstances of each case (paragraphs 82-87).(5) Relations with Parliament(a) The present arrangements in regard to Parliamentary control and procedure seem about the best that can be devised in thecircumstances. The Select Committee procedure might be developed further along its present lines, with the aim of making it, and hence Parliament, more fully acquainted with the general problems of the industries (paragraph 94).(b) The arguments against giving the Select Committee on nationalised industries an officer with functions similar to those performed bythe Comptroller and Auditor-General for the Public accounts committee remain valid (paragraph 93).(c) Occasions for Parliamentary intervention and complaints might bereduced if, as we propose, the respective responsibilities ofMinisters and the Boards were more clearly defined and if thefinancial results of the industries were improved (paragraph 94).(6) Relations between Ministers and the BoardsApart from the main problems of Ministerial powers and control of nationalised industries (which we have considered under the various heads) thereis also the question of the existing statutory powers of direction, which have inpractice been seldom used. There are strong arguments against frequent useof these formal powers; but there may be occasions when they ought to be usedin preference to informal arrangements which are not published and mayobscure responsibilities (paragraphs 95-98).

ANNEX iii the INFLUENCE OF MINISTERS OVER WAGES IN the nationalised INDUSTRIESNote by officials in the course of Ministers&apos; discussion on Wages Policy on 17th November,it was suggested that the present arrangements whereby the Government couldinfluence the actions of the nationalised Boards in the field of wages wereunsatisfactory and needed reviewing. The Minister of Power was invited, inconsultation with the Minister of Transport and the Secretary of State for Scotland,to discuss with the Minister of Labour the relations between Ministers and the nationalised industries in the wages field, and to submit proposals to the Committee.(Committee on Wages Policy, 7th Meeting Minutes, Item 3 (3).)2. Ministers&apos; disquiet with the existing arrangements for the settlement ofwages in these nationalised bodies is understood to be based on three main grounds.First, governmental influence in wage offers made by the nationalised bodieshas not in all cases proved effective. This can be embarrassing to the Government,especially where it can be alleged that a nationalised body is setting the pace in wage increases. If increased wages are not offset by increased prices or reductions in costs, then the Government have to foot the bill directly in the case ofindustries which, like the railways, are already running at a loss, and indirectly inother cases, through a reduction in profits and hence a bigger exchequer contribution towards the costs of development in the industry. To some extent,therefore, it can be argued that the Government have to pay the piper, and shouldhave an effective say in calling the tune.Secondly, the negotiating procedure in some of the industries is thought to becumbersome and not well designed to promote a reasonable attitude on theUnions&apos; side.Thirdly, even where the Boards in making offers fully respect governmentalviews, the actual settlement emerging from the negotiating processes (which, failing agreement, normally culminate in arbitration) may be embarrassing.3. Officials of the Departments concerned have discussed this question inrelation to the coal, gas, electricity and transport industries.Governmental Influence on Wage Offers4. The Founding Statutes of the nationalised industries make no provisionfor intervention by Ministers in the wage negotiations. Moreover, our legal adviceis to the effect that Ministerial powers under the Statutes to give &quot; directions of ageneral character in relation to matters appearing to the Minister to affect thenational interest&quot; could not extend to directions about specific wages to be paid.We assume that Ministers would not consider it practicable politics to alter theseStatutes so as to give Ministers formal and effective powers of intervention.There is danger even in informal intervention. Some of the Boards are lessreceptive to advice than others, and there is always a danger that Unions willdenounce Government influence as an interference with free collective bargaining,which governmental statements continue to uphold, for the nationalised industries,as elsewhere. Even so we do not see any alternative but to seek to continue and extend governmental influence in this way. The ideal would be that there shouldbe effective prior consultation in every case between the Minister and the Chairmanas, indeed, already occurs in many of the cases, and that such consultation shouldbe resumed if there is any critical change in the course of the negotiations. We thinkthat no Board could reasonably refuse to hear the advice of the Government onissues of national interest, and to take account of it in their negotiations. Theremay even so be cases where the Boards, having heard the Government^ advice,do not find it possible to follow it throughout the negotiations. If compulsion mustbe written off as a possibility, the only course is to go on habituating the chairmen of the Boards to governmental advice on wage matters, in the expectation that
they will, in the end, be conditioned into fully accepting it. More effective pressurecan, of course, be brought to bear upon those Boards which are dependent uponthe Government for meeting current losses.Wage Negotiating Machinery in Nationalised Bodies5. There are in each of the nationalised industries systems of wage negotiationsdeveloped as an obligation imposed under the Founding Statutes and usually basedon the machinery for wage settlements which existed in the particular industrybefore nationalisation. These systems are outlined in the Annex to this note. Insome cases for instance, the gas industry the machinery is fairly satisfactory andthe attitude of the Unions is on the whole reasonable. In others the position is less satisfactory: in electricity the internal rules of the negotiating body by which thechairmanship alternates between the two sides occasionally have the effect that amilitant Communist is put in the chair. But any attempt by the Government to induce from outside a major change in the existing machinery such as abolishing the alternation of chairmanship in the National Joint Industrial Council for theElectricity Industry would be almost certain to provoke a very strong reaction from the Unions, and could in any case only be applied with their consent. It isdifficult to foresee advantages from such interference to match the troubles thatwould be caused.Wage Settlements and Arbitration6. Wage settlements in the nationalised industries may eventually emerge from arbitration. To this extent wages in the nationalised industries are beyondthe control of the Boards or the Government. In this matter, however, the nationalised bodies are not significantly different from other industries which are directly controlled by Ministers (e.g., the Post Office) or from the private sector. Itis true that in the coal and electricity industries arbitration is compulsory and binding: but these features of it are of little practical significance in view of the factthat it is the Governments policy generally to encourage both to resort to voluntaryarbitration as a final method of settling disputes and respect for arbitrationalfindings.7.   Our conclusions are these:  (a) No powers are given to Ministers under the Founding Statutes to intervene in wage negotiations in the nationalised industries. It does not appearpracticable politics to alter the formal position.(b) Any attempted overt intervention might be strongly resisted by Boards asultra vires, and would provoke strong opposition from the Unions.(c) If the Government attempted to force through any major and controversialchange in the arrangements for wage negotiation established understatute, there would be strong reactions from the employees&apos; side, whoseagreement is in any case necessary.(d) But the Government can quietly exercise informal influence, mainly throughcontacts between the responsible Ministers and Board Chairmen. Theremay be some scope for extending this sort of influence, withoutprovoking the reactions mentioned above. The aim might be to obtaineffective prior consultation in every case where a nationalised bodyproposes to offer or agree to increases in wages and salaries, and toarrange for such consultation to be resumed if there is any critical changein the course of the negotiations.
Appendix to Annex IIIWAGE NEGOTIATING AND ARBITRATION MACHINERY IN the nationalised INDUSTRIESGeneralUnder their basic statutes most of the Boards have a duty (expressed in slightlydifferent terms in different Acts) of seeking joint consultations with the Trade unions concerned, with a view to the conclusion of joint agreements for the establishmentof negotiating and consultative machinery. As a result detailed arrangements havebeen established. The pattern (with variations) is a national negotiating bodyorganised separately for manual and several other grades of employees, withcounterparts at regional and local level. There is usually provision for arbitration in case of failure to agree, and the arbitration award is generally binding.In none of these schemes does the Ministry or Parliament have any place. Thedetail of this negotiating machinery in the various nationalised industries can besummarised as follows:  Coal IndustryIn the coal industry a National Conciliation Board, composed of a JointNational Negotiating Committee and a National Reference Tribunal, considersquestions which may concern the whole industry. The Joint National negotiating committee is composed of up to 16 members nominated by the National Coal Board(of whom six must be Board members), and up to 16 by the National Union of mineworkers: there are two chairmen and two secretaries, one from each side.If the Joint National Negotiating Committee fails to agree, cases can be taken tothe National Reference Tribunal, whose awards are binding on both sides. TheTribunal contains three &quot;permanent members &quot; appointed for three years by the master of the Rolls, after consultation with the Board and the Union. None maybe engaged in the coal-mining industry nor be a member of either House ofParliament, unless a member of the House of Lords who holds or has held highjudicial office. The present permanent members are Sir John Morris, Sir JohnErskine and Mr. John Fulton.Beneath the National Board, there is a Conciliation Board for each coal-miningDistrict, with an independent District Referee to whom questions are referred for decision when the Conciliation Board cannot agree; his decision is binding. Finally,there is a Joint Disputes Committee at each colliery (some 950 in number) with provision for arbitration by an independent Umpire (chosen from a panel established under the scheme) whose award is binding.There are similar schemes for negotiations concerning managerial, junioradministrative and clerical staff, workers in N.C.B. coke ovens, and those inbriquetting.ElectricityThere is a National Joint Industrial Council for negotiation between the boards and representatives of the manual workers in the industry^ who are organised byfive main Unions. It comprises 20 members from the employers (Electricity Council,Central Electricity Generating Board, Area Boards and Scottish Boards) and 12 fromthe Unions principally concerned. Voting is by majority on each side, and thechairmanship alternates each year. Wage negotiation is sometimes delegated to asmall committee of the Council: for instance, the &quot; productivity allowance &quot; ofJune 1958 was agreed between a Committee of three members from each side ofthe Council. Representation tends to be at Board member or chief official levelon the employer side; Union chairmen are included on the workers&apos; side.If the Council are unable to settle a dispute, a majority of either side may havethe case referred to the Industrial Court (or other agreed tribunal), whose awardis binding on both sides of the industry.There are three other national agreements providing for similar arrangements to negotiate cases concerning other groups of electricity employees technicians,administrative and clerical grades, and managers.
Beneath the national level, there are negotiating arrangements at regional andlocal level (where there are about 500 committees), with a hierarchical system bywhich all minutes of the subordinate organisations are automatically referred up tothe next level.GasWages and conditions of employment for the manual workers in the gas industry are negotiated by the National Joint Industrial Council for the gas industry, consisting of 15 members representing the three main unions, and 15from the Gas Council and Area Boards (at Board member level). There aresubordinate negotiating bodies at the regional level. In default of agreement thescheme provided that a majority of either side could have the issue referred to theNational Arbitration Tribunal, or to any other agreed tribunal, and any resultingaward was binding on the Boards and their employees. But with the terminationof the National Arbitration Tribunal, and of its successor, the Industrial DisputesTribunal, this machinery is not fully operative at present.Similar arrangements exist at the national and regional level to cover three other groups of gas industry employees than the manual workers:  (1) clerical, administrative, professional and technical staffs,(2) senior and managerial staffs, and (3) intermediate grades between the manual workers and (1).Atomic Energy AuthorityFor negotiating wages and conditions of industrial employees, there is aNational Joint Industrial Council composed of 14 representatives of the A.E.A.,and 24 representatives from the 10 main unions concerned. Failing agreement,a majority of either side may have any case referred to arbitration, from whichawards are binding.There is Whitley Council machinery for staff grades, with provision for arbitration.British RailwaysThere are detailed arrangements for local, regional and national negotiating machinery on which the British Transport Commission and the three principalunions are represented. If agreement cannot be reached at national level, casesmay be referred to the Railway Staff National Tribunal, which consists of three members, one appointed by each side, and a Chairman agreed jointly, or failing agreement, appointed by the Minister of Labour. The awards of this tribunal arenot binding; in practice the B.T.C. accept them, but not always the Unions. Thereare separate schemes for railway workshop staff, and for workshops supervisors.London transport for underground railway staff there is a Negotiating Committee with sixrepresentatives of the London Transport Executive and six of the three unions concerned; issues which cannot be agreed may be referred to a Wages Board, but its decisions are not binding.For the road transport staffs there is no formal machinery of negotiation, butcomprehensive agreements covering terms and conditions have been made betweenthe L.T.E. and the Unions concerned.British Road ServicesThere is a National Staff Council, with three National Joint NegotiatingCommittees, for (1) operating and ancillary grades, (2) maintenance and repairgrades, and (3) administrative, professional, technical, supervisory and clericalgrades. If agreement cannot be reached at the Negotiating Committees and theNational Staff Council, a majority of either side may have the case referred to the IIndustrial Court, or other agreed tribunal for arbitration, and the decision isbinding.
Inland WaterwaysThere is a National Joint Council with representatives of the employers, theBritish Transport Commission and the Canal Carriers, on the one side, and of theTransport and General Workers Union on the other, with subordinate DistrictJoint Councils similarly constituted. Failing agreement at District and national council level, cases may be referred to the Industrial Court or other agreed tribunal,whose award is binding.Civil Air TransportThere is a National Joint Council composed of representatives of the airways corporations and the unions concerned, and beneath it 12 Joint Panels for negotiations covering the widely differing grades employed. If the negotiatingPanels and the National Joint Council are unable to agree, the case may be referredto arbitration, ultimately by the Industrial Court, whose decision is binding.June 1959.SECRET55281 F 2
ANNEX IVCOMPOSITION OF THE BOARDS OF NATIONALISED industries I. Electricity1. Electricity Council(a) Statutory Requirements. The Minister is required to appoint a Chairman(whole-time) and two Deputy Chairmen and he may also appoint notmore than three other members. In addition, there are fifteen furthermembers ex officio comprising the Chairman of the Central electricity generating Board, two other members designated by that Board andthe Chairmen of the twelve Area Electricity Boards. (Sections 3 and4-Electricity Act, 1957.)(b) Present Position. Three full-time, two part-time members, and the fifteenex-officio members referred to in 1 (a) above.2. Central Electricity Generating Board(a) Statutory Requirements. The Board must consist of a Chairman (whole-time) and not less than seven nor more than nine other members from whom the Minister is required to appoint one or more as a deputy chairman. (Sections 2 and 4 Electricity Act, 1957.)(b) Present Position. Six full-time and four part-time members.3. Area Electricity Boards(a) Statutory Requirements. Every Board must consist of a Chairman and notless than five nor more than seven other members of whom one must beappointed Deputy Chairman and in addition the Chairman of therespective Electricity Consultative Council. (Section 3 Electricity Act,1947.)(b) Present Position. Thirty full-time and seventy-four part-time members(excluding the Scottish Electricity Boards). The figure for full-time members includes five &quot; executive &quot; members referred to in 3 (c) below.(c) Recent Trends. The Minister of Power attaches great importance toincluding in these Boards an element composed of full-time officials inthe industry who combine their Board membership with their executiveduties, the advantages being that promising officers are given theexperience of sharing responsibility for Board decisions and the Boardsthemselves are strengthened by the admixture of such officers. Inconsequence of this policy the trend is towards a reduction of theproportion of part-time members.Note. All the appointments referred to above are required to be made by theMinister of Power. Apart from the whole-time Chairmen of the Electricity Counciland the Central Electricity Generating Board, the Minister is required to secure thatas many of the members appointed to the Electricity Council, Generating Boardand Area Boards as he considers requisite for the efficient performance of thefunctions of the Council, Generating Board or Area Boards shall be appointed aswhole-time members.  (Section 4 Electricity Act, 1957.)4. Scottish Electricity Boards(a) Statutory Requirements. Both Boards must consist of a Chairman and notless than four nor more than eight other members, of whom one or moremay be appointed Deputy Chairman or Chairmen. All appointmentsare made by the Secretary of State and may be either full-time or part-time. (First Schedule to the Hydro-Electric Development(Scotland) Act, 1943.)
(b) Present Position(i) South of Scotland Electricity Board. The Chairman and deputy chairman are both full-time and there are seven part-time members (i.e., the maximum).(ii) North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. There is a part-timeChairman and a part-time Deputy Chairman, and seven part-time members (i.e., the maximum).Note. Unlike the position in England and Wales there is no statutorystipulation about full-time appointments there need be none. Also, in Scotland,the Chairman of the Associated Consultative Council is not ex officio a member ofthe Board: but in practice the Chairman is a member of the Board being eitherappointed to the Board or selected from the members of the Board.II- Gas1. Gas Council(a) Statutory Requirements. The Council must consist of a Chairman and deputy Chairman, while the remaining members are the Chairmen ofthe twelve Area Gas Boards. (Section 5 Gas Act, 1948.)(b) Present Position. Two full-time members, and ex-officio the twelveChairmen of the Area Gas Boards.2. Area Gas Boards(a) Statutory Requirements. Every Board must consist of not less than six normore than eight members of whom two shall be appointed Chairman and deputy Chairman respectively; and one other member is the Chairmanof the respective Gas Consultative Council. (Section 5 Gas Act, 1948.)(b) Present  Position. Thirty-four  full-time   and   seventy-one   part-time members. The figure for full-time members includes six &quot; executive &quot;members who are full-time officials in the industry.(c) Recent Trends. As for Area Electricity Boards above.Note. All the appointments referred to above are required to be made bythe Minister of Power.III. Coal1. National Coal Board(a) Statutory Requirements. The Minister of Power is required to appoint a National Coal Board consisting of a whole-time Chairman, and notless than eight nor more than eleven other members, of whom not morethan eight may be whole-time. One of the members must be appointedby the Minister to act as Deputy Chairman; and a second may be soappointed. (Section 2 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946,as amended by Section 1 of the Coal Industry Act, 1949.)(b) Present Position. Eight full-time and four part-time members.(c) Recent Trends. In 1953 the Board (which then consisted of the Chairman,two Deputy Chairmen, four whole-time members who had nofunctional responsibilities and five part-time members) appointed aCommittee under the Chairmanship of Sir Alexander Fleck (Chairmanof LCI.) to report on the organisation of the industry. As a resultof the Committee&apos;s recommendations, the Board was reconstituted in1955 and the principle of functional responsibility for full-time members, which had been abandoned following the Burrows Reportof 1948 was restored. The Board then took its present form of a chairman and Deputy Chairman, six other full-time members eachhaving responsibility for one or more departments, and four part-time members.Note. All the appointments referred to above are required to be made bythe Minister of Power.
IV- transport. British Transport Commission(a) Statutory   Requirements: The   Chairman,   Deputy   Chairman,   and members of the Commission are appointed by the Minister. Thestatutory requirements are contained in Section 1 (2) of Part I of theTransport Act, 1947, which reads, &quot;The Commission shall consist ofa Chairman and not less than four nor more than eight other members,all of whom shall be appointed by the Minister from among personsappearing to him to be persons who have had wide experience and shown capacity in transport, industrial, commercial or financial matters,in administration, or in the organisation of workers, and of whom theChairman and not less than four other members shall be required torender whole-time service to the Commission,&quot; as amended bySection 25 (2) (a) of the Transport Act, 1953, which reads &quot;Themaximum number of members of the Commission other than theChairman shall, instead of being eight, be fourteen. . . .&quot;(b) Present Position. Chairman, one Deputy Chairman, five full-time and eight part-time members. (Two of the full-time and four of the part-time members are Chairmen of Railway Area Boards. One of thefull-time members is Chairman of the L.T.E.)(c) Recent Trends. These are illustrated in the following table showing how the composition of the Commission has changed over the years.Full-time Part-timeDeputy TotalChairman    Chairman      Members       member as at December 19511952As at November 1953195419551956195719584 3 84 3 85 4 106 5 121               4 8 1415 7 141 5 7 1415 8 152. London Transport Executive(a) Statutory Requirements. The Chairman, Deputy Chairman and members are appointed by the Minister. The Statutory requirements are contained in paragraph 1 of the Second Schedule to the transport act, 1947, which reads &quot; Each, Executive shall consist of a chairman and not less than four nor more than eight other members.&quot;(b) Present Position. Chairman, Deputy Chairman, three full-time and threepart-time members.(c) Recent Trends. These are illustrated in the following table showing how the composition of the L.T.E. has changed over the years.ChairmanAs at December 19511952As at November 195319541955195619571958Full-timeDeputyChairmanMembers4444333 .part-timeMembers333Total66666
3. Area Boards(a) Statutory Requirements. The Chairmen and members are appointed bythe B.T.C. By the terms of the British Transport Commission(Organisation) Scheme Order, 1954, which gave effect to the B.T.C.&apos;scheme for the reorganisation of the railways, each Area Board consists of a Chairman and not less than 2 nor more than 6 other members.At least one member of each Area Board must be a member of theB.T.C. Each member of the Board who is not a member of the B.T.C.should be a person who has, in the opinion of the B.T.C. had wide experience and is likely to be conversant with the circumstances and special requirements, in relation to transport, of the area of the Board.In some cases full-time members of the B.T.C. have been appointedChairmen of Area Boards, but this has been simply a matter of convenience and not of policy. These are six Area Boards, Eastern,London Midland, North Eastern, Scottish, Southern and Western,corresponding with the Regions of British Railways.(b) Present Position. At present, of the six Area Board Chairmen, 2 arefull-time members of the Commission, and 4 are part-time membersof the Commission. Of the 36 Area Board members, one is a full andone a part-time member of the Commission. The background of 21 ofthese members may be described as &quot; industry and commerce,&quot; of as &quot; trade union &quot; and of 5 or 6 as &quot; local authority or public life.&quot;(c) Recent Trends. The Area Boards were first appointed from January 1955.The changes since have had these effects:  Scottish1 part-time &quot; trade union&quot; member in place of 1 part-time&quot; industry and commerce &quot; member.North Eastern1 full-time Commission member left Area Board.1 part-time &quot; trade union &quot; member replaced by another.1 extra part-time &quot;industry and commerce&quot; member appointed.London Midland1 part-time &quot; trade union &quot; member replaced by another.WesternChairman with &quot; industry and commerce &quot; background (part-timemember of Commission) replaced by another similar. Threechanges in part-time &quot; industry and commerce &quot; backgroundmembers (in effect in one vacancy).One part-time &quot; trade union &quot; background member added.
