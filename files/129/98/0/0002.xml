DOCUMENT ISPROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 10?.COPY NO.13th June, 1959CABINETFOREIGN MINISTERS&apos; CONFERENCEMsmorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs will try to set out on paper for my colleagues my impressionsof the present situation in the Geneva Conference.Z.      We spent the first fourteen days solemnly expounding our positions on German reunification.   It could not be called a debate;  it was a seriesof prepared speeches delivered in a large chamber containing about120 people.   800 copies of each statement were delivered promptly to theattendant journalists.   There were two or three dinner parties duringthis period at which there was some private discussion, but without muchprofit.3.      Then came the intermission caused by Mr. Dulles&apos; death.4.      Since then, we have spent fourteen days meeting privately at one another&apos;s villas about a dozen people in all being present, without anyGermans.   There has been an occasional formal session at Sovietrequest to remind us that the East Germans are in Geneva.   The privatemeetings have been conducted in a friendly atmosphere.   There have beenreal discussions and remarkable secrecy about their substance.5.     These private discussions were concerned with Berlin, and were concentrated on four points:-(a) the juridical psotion, or Western rights as it has come to becalled;(b) the number and status of Western troops in Berlin;(c) espionage and propaganda activities in Berlin;  and(d) the problem of access.6.      My purpose has been to get agreement upon these matters along the following lines:-(a)    As to the juridical position, there could be a statement that theWestern Powers maintain their rights both basic and contractual, whichcannot be extinguished by unilateral action by the Soviet Union:    howeverthis might be, both sides agree upon certain improved arrangements forWest Berlin and access thereto, which by agreement should continue, untilthe reunifjcation of Germany.   At the beginning of our talks the other delegations were very far from accepting such a formulation.   Myimpression now is that they have come some way towards it.&quot;1-
(b) A? to the position of Western troops in Berlin, I have soughtagreement on the basis of our troops remaining there with a ceilingfixed as to their numbers and perhaps some limitations on their equip-ment (for example nuclear weapons).   As to the numbers of troops, Ithink that the Western Ministers would accept an overall ceiling of ,500, provided that agreement to this reduction would be part of anagreement which would strengthen rather than weaken West Berlinmorale.   Although the idea of a reduction has been vaguely mentioned,no figures have been put to Mr. Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister.Mr. Gromyko still presses for the admission of Soviet troops into west berlin.   I feel, however, that provided the question of status can be satisfactorily presented from the Soviet point of view, the Soviet will agree to a limited number of Western troops remaining, without a soviet contingent.(c) &apos; With regard to espionage, and propaganda activities, my purposehas been to get some reciprocal declaration on this matter, togetherperhaps with the acceptance of some quadripartite body possibly with&quot;advisers&quot; from East and West Berlin to hear complaints.   We mustinsist on a measure of reciprocity; we have to be careful about theextent to which we permit interference by the Soviet Government in the affairs of West Berlin.   There is really already agreement in principleabout this:  the difficulties will arise if and when the attempt is madeto work the details out in practice.   The United States delegation havenot made as much objection to all this as I had expected, but they regard the retention of R.I.A.S. ( the United States radas?&quot; station) in west Berlin as vital for the morale of the West Berliners.(d) With regard to access, I have been seeking an agreementreaffirming the rights of free access for military and civilian trafficof all sorts, expressed in clear terms including a provision that theywill continue until reunification.   For such an agreement, I would beprepared to accept East German operation of the control system provided the  Union    of Soviet Socialist Republics guarantee the rights andaccept the ultimate responsibility.   I have not been at all moved byquestions as to who stamps what documents, and I have told my UnitedStates and French colleagues that no-one is going to fight or even riska war on that sort of question.7.      The United States and French thinking in Geneva has developedconsiderably towards our position.   Provided the West does not haveto make these agreements with the Deutsche Demokratische Republik(D.D.R.) as a co-signatory, and provided complaints are not to be dealtwith directly with theD,D.R. Government, 1 do not expect difficulty with the United States or France.   The West Germans have kept fairlyquiet, but I infer that they also have come some way towards our view. Withregard to the Soviet position, I believe that if they are satisfied on other points, they will guarantee the freedom of access:  they will accept the association of the D.D.R. by some separate declaration andwill help to save the Western face over the way in which the inevitabledirect dealings with the East Germans are presented.8.      The crux is whether the Soviet Government can present any agreement made as a change in the status of West Berlin, and the Westcan present it as a maintenance of their rights.   I have tried to persuadeMr. Gromyko that it is what actually happens that matters, and that what we have been talking about would in fact amount to a change.   Therefore,he need not make all this fuss about status.-2-
9,      Up to the end of a private conversation with Mr. Gromyko on tuesday, 9th June I was not without hope of achieving a compositeagreement On the above lines.10.      Then at the private meeting of the four Ministers on Tuesdayafternoon, Mr. Gromyko produced his latest plan.   It pocketed all theWestern concessions about Berlin, but said that the modified arrange-ments could only last for twelve months.   During that twelve months theFederal German Republic and the D0D.R. must negotiate, in the mannerprescribed by the Soviet, the reunification of Germany.   If they fail,the Soviet Government will sign a separate peace treaty with the D.D.R.That will lead to mounting pressure on the Allies to leave West ?3erlinand no doubt greater difficulties for the West Berliners.11.      This plan was repeated at a formal session on 10th June and rejected by the four Western Powers.12.     Mr. Kerter, the United States Secretary of State, went with ourapproval to see Mr. Gromyko on Thursday to say that we could not continue to negotiate under the threat of a time limit.   Mr. Gromykospeedily climbed down in private and rather less graciously in public.He made a tough speech about ending the occupation status.13.     All this has brought corresponding rigidity from the French andto a considerable extent the United States.   It will now be much moredifficult to get them to make any concessions over form or substance.Their view is that if Mr. Gromyko does not show willingness to makereal  progress on Monday or Tuesday, these talks should be proclaimeda failure and be adjourned for at least one month.   M. Couve de Murvillethe French Minister for Foreign Affairs, says it should be two months.14.      The following questions therefore present themselves:-What further effort should we make to salve something fromthese present talks and for how long?ts there any new approach to be made ?Is there any point in trying to get the Conference back to broaderissues than Berlin, e.g. disarmament, security zones, non-aggression pact, etc. ?If these talks cannot be salved in what form should they end?Should the West play for a break-down on the ground that theSoviet proposals of 9th June have spoilt the prospect of agreement?Should we seek an adjournment on the ground that the dust mustbe allowed to settle after the Soviet threat?If so, for how long should the adjournment be?What about the summit?
What do we expect to happen there in the light of what has takenplace at Geneva ?When do we want it to take place?S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.13th June, 1959
