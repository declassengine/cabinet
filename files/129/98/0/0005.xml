mm -6p**DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 105 COPY NO.  yO,19th June, 1959CABINETNUCLEAR POWER programme memorandum by the Minister of FlowerOn 28th February, 1957, the Cabinet approved a programme toprovide 5,000 to 6,000 MW of electricity by 1965, subsequentlyamended, at the time of the credit restrictions in the autumn 1957,to 1966 (C.C.(57) 14th Conclusions, Minute 5).   The following stationshave been ordered:-MWBerkeley 275Bradwell 300Hunterston (Scotland) 350Kinkley Point 500Trawsfynydd 5001,9252.   An application from the Central Electricity Generating board to put down a power station at Dungeness in Kent has been the subjectof a public enquiry by Inspectors from the Ministry of Housing andLocal Government and the Ministry of Power and a report was madeto me on 9th March, 1959, recommending that I should give my consent to the building of a power station at Dungeness of 500 MW capacity.3.    From the technical point of view it is a good site, capable offurther expansion;  but there are both considerations of amenity and problems of nature conservation involved.   I have considered thematter jointly with the Minister of Housing and Local Government andwith the Lord President of the Council who is responsible for theNature Conservancy.   On balance, they are prepared to support my intention to give consent to the building of this station but they havesuggested that I should bring the matter to the notice of my colleaguesbefore giving consent because of the objections which are likely to beraised in Parliament and elsewhere when the report and my letter ofconsent are published.4.   These objections will come from those who wish to preserveemployment in the mines at any cost and would prefer to see the nuclear power programme reduced or abandoned.   It is stated in the inspectors&apos; report, which will be published, that part of the case madeby the Generating Board was that, on the assumption that the demandfor electricity will double itself every ten to twelve years, home-produced coal would not be able to keep pace with the demand forpower.   In view of the present large surplus of coal this will probablybe questioned.   Objections will also come from those concerned withamenity and with the scientific aspects of nature conservation.-1-
5.   The other nuclear stations were approved before the consumptionof coal began to fall off in a serious way and considerable stocks began to accumulate.   We can, therefore, expect political attacks on the partof the Opposition and criticism by the miners&apos; leaders.   But in my viewwe should stand up to these in the same way as we must stand up tomoves to get us to abandon the free use of oil in industry.6.   I believe that the precise size of the programme is irrelevantto the question of a station at Dungeness.   The capacity of the stationsapproved to date at 1,925 MW is not much more than one-third of thelower end of our target.   It is only by proceeding with the constructionof new stations that we can keep in being the scientific and technicalstaffs which have been built up at great cost and effort, and which are able to develop the plans of the Atomic Energy Authority and. of theIndustrial Consortia to assure us a reducing cost of electricity and ahoped for valuable export trade.7.   It is still expected that in the long run nuclear power will be needed to meet our requirements of electricity in addition to all thecoal fired stations which can be brought into commission.8.   As regards the criticism from those concerned with amenities and with nature conservation, their case was fully argued and considered at the public enquiry and the Inspectors decided on balance against the representations put forward by them.9.   I propose, subject to the Cabinet, to issue my consent and I trust that after considering the probable reactions the Cabinet will endorsemy proposal.M.Ministry of Power, S.W.I.19th June, 1959
