SECRET ^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1959Copy No, 2 ?CABINETTHE UNITED NATIONS AND A FREE WORLD organisation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the Foreign Secretary invited comment on his paper C. (59) 86 about theUnited Nations and a Free World Organisation.2. From the Commonwealth angle I entirely agree with the conclusion reached in the first part of the paper that it would not be in the interests of theUnited Kingdom or the West to abandon the United Nations or to try to set upa rival Free World Organisation. With the sole exception of South Africa, wecan be sure that all the other members of the Commonwealth would be strongly opposed to any such moves.3. My main criticisms are on the remaining sections of the paper, whichconsider ways of strengthening the Free World. I feel that in these sectionsinsufficient weight is given to the importance of the Commonwealth as a whole and to its actual and potential usefulness. The paper emphasises the desirabilityof eliciting the views of our friends on current problems, developing exchanges of information with them and of trying to harmonise national policies. This is,of course, already our constant practice and endeavour within the Commonwealth.This is not brought out in the paper, nor is there adequate recognition of thedifference between the United Kingdom&apos;s relations with other members of theCommonwealth and its relations with foreign countries (other than the UnitedStates). I would prefer to see a separate section in the paper dealing with theCommonwealth and bringing out the fact that, with its wide membershipembracing both close supporters of the West and leading nations in Asia and africa, the Commonwealth provides an instrument of unique value for furtheringUnited Kingdom policies for strengthening the Free World.4. I also feel that Commonwealth considerations are overlooked in the suggestions made in the paper for closer co-operation with the Americans, Frenchand Germans and about action within the North Atlantic Alliance. I fully recognise the value and importance of consultation with our Allies within the Alliance andthe benefit to be derived by using it as a forum in which individual countries canexplain their policies. But, bearing in mind the world-wide context of the paper,I am inclined to doubt whether the weight given in it to action within the Allianceas compared with action in other fields (in particular through the Commonwealth)is entirely justified. Moreover, there are obvious limitations on the developmentof &quot; agreed policies &quot; within that Organisation. It would be quite wrong for us toagree to discuss the affairs of other Commonwealth countries in the North atlantic council, and we must surely insist on maintaining full freedom in formulating ourown policies vis-a-vis these countries, particularly in relation to matters of vitalinterest to them. Otherwise we may risk considerable embarrassment in ourrelations with other Commonwealth Governments who are liable to resent anyappearance of &quot; ganging-up &quot; by the Atlantic Powers about problems in other areas,especially in areas of direct concern to themselves. We have already had more thanone example of this, and the reaction is by no means confined to the &quot; new &quot;Commonwealth countries.  In these circumstances it seems to me that a strictlyC. (59) 11410th July, 195955482
pragmatic approach is called for when considering the question of further consultation within the Alliance, if we are to avoid compromising the freedom ofaction which our Commonwealth interests demand. Each suggestion for extendedco-operation in the economic or political sphere between the United Kingdom and aforeign Government or group of Governments needs, I feel, to be examined carefullyfrom the Commonwealth angle before we commit ourselves to it.C \5. These are my main comments. There are other points of detail which myofficials will discuss with the Foreign Office.&apos;    &apos;   H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,9th July, 1959.
