secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1959C. (59) 131 Copy No.    ^221st July, 1959CABINETPUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT 1958-1963Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerDecisions are required about public investment in the years 1960-61 and1961-62. Details of the individual programmes are set out in the report appended to this memorandum. Some of the major programmes are still under discussion between officials, and in two of them (British Transport Commission and theNational Coal Board) major reappraisals are in progress. Despite this it isimportant that I should have from my colleagues endorsement of my conclusions on two particular points, viz.:  (a) The aggregate total and the limits for individual programmes in the year1960-61.(b) The provisional aggregate total for 1961-62 within which final discussionscan take place.2. It is tremendously important that we should keep the prospective total ofpublic investment within our prospective capital resources. We can alter the relatively fast-moving programmes housing, educational minor works, &amp;c. fromtime to time according to the needs of relatively short-term economic policy. Butover most of the field we have to take pretty firm decisions as far ahead as possible and stick to them, without chopping and changing to meet transient changes inthe direction of the economic wind.Out-turn for 1958-593. The preliminary figures of public investment expenditures in 1958-59aggregate  1,445 millions which is actually  20 millions less than 1957-58. Wehad expected and the Departmental returns to the Treasury as recently as Aprilhad indicated-a small increase in 1958-59 as a result of the reflationary action taken from July onwards. But this is an extremely difficult area to forecast andcontrol, for the bulk of it is the expenditure of hundreds of local authorities and anumber of nationalised undertakings. I shall be submitting to my colleagues in theautumn a report on the experience of the refiationary action on public investment(see paragraph 6 of the Annex to this memorandum).Investment in 1959-604. Present decisions cannot affeot public investment to any large extent in1959-60, but there have been so many changes that it will be convenient if Isummarise the situation briefly. The total authorised last December (C.C. (58) 87thConclusions, Minute 5), together with subsequent agreed additions, now amountsito about  1,660 millions gross. (A gross figure of  1,660 millions corresponds tothe  1,607 millions net set out in Table 32 of the Economic Survey, the differencebeing explained by the inclusion of purchases of land and existing buildings whichwere then excluded. The gross figure is, in my view, more useful as it is more easily
recognisable by Departments, which are concerned with the gross total for their individual programmes.) Discussions are now going on about certain minorreflationary works, but these do not materially affect the total.5. The increase in public investment this year will be very large indeed-the programmes are over  200 millions (or 15 per cent.) above the preliminarytotals for 1958-59. The total was rising strongly at the end of the financial year.This results, of course, from deliberate decisions. My judgment is that we should leave this undisturbed.Investment in 1960-616. The total for programmes submitted now is  1,695 millions in 1960-61,or  35 millions above the current year. In our discussions throughout the past year I have continuously taken the view (which I announced in Parliament on 3rd November, 1958) that the level for 1960-61 should not exceed that of 1959-60.These programmes are going beyond this, and the aggregate is about  70 millionshigher than we considered reasonable for 1960-61 when we discussed it at this timelast year.7. I find this disturbing. I can see no justification for a further increase in1960-61 above the deliberately expanded &quot; reflationary &apos;&quot; level for 1959-60. I ammuch concerned with the growth of Government expenditure in 1960-61, and withthe claims on public money in all directions. If, at the same time, private investmentgoes strongly forward, as it may well do after the Election, we might find ourselves in great difficulties.8. I must have sufficient leeway within this programme so that I can take appropriate action if the situation requires it. Such action, as I said in paragraph above, must inevitably be concentrated on the&apos;&quot; faster-moving &quot; programmes.9. I have therefore warned the Minister of Housing and Local Government,the Minister of Education, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, that in thenext two or three months I shall probably have to ask them to reduce housingstarts (say from 115,000 to 105,000 per annum in England and Wales), to reducethe 1960-61 programmes of educational minor works (to, say,  15 millions inEngland and Wales, c.f.  11 millions in 1958-59 and  17+ millions in 1959-60),and to begin to take a more restrictive attitude on miscellaneous local authorityinvestment.10. I must also ask my colleagues to make certain that no &quot;reflation&quot;continues in their Departmental capital expenditures for 1960-61. In theaccompanying report, the &quot; miscellaneous &quot; item is shown as increasing slightly-this seems unreasonable in a situation that does not need &quot; reflation.&quot;11. For power and transport: I have asked the Minister of Power to considera reduction in the Gas Councils programme; and I have asked the Minister ofTransport and Civil Aviation to consider a lower figure for the British transport commission.12. I would be content for the rest of the programme to go ahead for 1960-61on the proposed basis.Investment in 1961-6213. We are now asked to give preliminary authority for individual programmes and an aggregate for 1961-62, so that Departments may go ahead with their forward planning. The total of  1,690 millions at present shows little change from the figures for 1960-61: but the railway and coal programmes arestill being reappraised. Subject to this, I think we can take these figures as the broad framework within which the discussion of individual programmes will becarried on between the Treasury and the Departments concerned, to giveprovisional guidance for 1961-62.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, d18th July, 1959.
ANNEXLONG-TERM INVESTMENT review the total the figures below show total public investment for the past two years and departmental forecasts for the current and future years, rounded to the nearest 5 millions. (These figures are on a gross basis, i.e., they include expenditure by departments on land and existing buildings, and therefore conform to theDepartmental programmes.  It is proposed to use this basis in future.)Final figures of actual expenditure in 1958-59 are not yet available. The currentestimate of  1,445 millions is about  40 millions less than the Departmental andother programmes for 1958-59: expenditure on a number of programmes notably the Atomic Energy Authority, the Gas Council and the Air Corporations was rather less than expected.2. The individual programmes submitted by Departments are set out inthe Table attached as an appendix to this paper. In some cases the figures areestimates of expenditure derived from agreed commitments or conform to existing policies. In others the figures are only provisional, as the programmes concerned are still under discussion and, in two cases (National Coal Board and british transport Commission) are subject to current reappraisals in the light of recenteconomic developments affecting the level and profitability of their activities.3. The pattern of aggregate public investment shown by Departments&apos;programmes is rather different from the past: after two years in which therewas little change in total, there is a very steep rise now in train for 1959-60, witha comparative flattening out of the rate of increase in succeeding years. Thelatter is due in the main to two causes:  (a) The big rise for 1959-60 deliberately included some investment calledforward from later years. This was one of the objects of the reflationmeasures carried out in 1958-59.(b) Reappraisals of the railway and coal programmes springing from changedideas about either their future levels of activity or the structure of their investment programmes. These give rise to large problems which havenot yet been fully investigated. This affects programmes totalling some 300 millions a year and there is accordingly a margin of uncertainty about the appropriate level of investment under these heads.4. Apart from these uncertainties, it is relevant when considering the demands which public investment will make on central or local funds, to note importantcommitments or possible claims for other projects to be financed wholly or in part from public funds; examples are the re-equipment of the cotton industry, the steelstrip mills, the Cunarders, and the Humber Bridge.5. The uncertainties about some of the programmes and the claims referredto in paragraph 4 mean that the calls on public funds for financing investment may therefore be much larger than the public sector programmes would indicate takenby themselves.6. There is one allied point which should be mentioned. As a result of theefforts to check investment in 1957-58 and to stimulate it again in 1958-59,1957-581958-591959-601960-611961-621962-631963-64  millions1,4651,445 (estimate)1,6601,6951,690&apos;1,7101,750
a considerable body of knowledge has been built up about the extent and speed withwhich changes can be brought about in public investment. It is accordingly proposed to submit in the autumn a report and appraisal of the experience ofthe reflationary action in 1958-59.Individual ProgrammesAtomic Energy7. The programme (which is stated to be only tentative) involves a fairlyconstant level of expenditure. This is agreed as a working figure for the time being.General Post Office8. About three-quarters of the expenditure will be on the telephone service.The remaining expenditure will be mainly on the postal and telegraph services andthe purchase of new vehicles. The present figure of  99-1 millions for 1960-61 is 6 millions,^bove that provisionally agreed last December (C.C. (58) 87th Conclusions,Minute 5). The Post Office has, however, indicated that in their view the start ofa forward programme would involve further additions of  5 millions in 1960-61and  10 millions in 1961-62. In addition it has been agreed that certain Post Officeexpenditure hitherto wrongly classed as capital should be omitted: the necessarycorrections to the figures on this account are still to be made.Hospitals9.   An increasing share of the steadily rising expenditure will be on major projects. This has been agreed with the Treasury.University Grants Committee10. New building commitments to be undertaken in the period to 1963 havebeen agreed with the Treasury. The figures reflect these and also provide for theexpansion of Imperial College.Roads11. Expenditure under the present programme on motorways, trunk roads and classified roads will total  84-1 millions in 1960-61 and  83-3 millions in1961-62. The agreed Exchequer contribution towards the cost of this programme in England and Wales will be  65 millions in 1960-61 and  61 millions in 1961-62.In the case of Scotland the Exchequer contribution for these two years is about 10 millions a year. The remainder of the expenditure is met by local authorities.Water and Sewerage12.   The Departmental programmes allow for some expansion by the various local bodies concerned. This is acceptable to the Treasury.Education13. The figures reflect the policies announced in the White Papers onsecondary and technical education. In England and Wales they include a flexibleelement for minor school building works and there is also provision for additional facilities for training teachers.Electricity Council, South of Scotland Electricity Board, North of ScotlandHydro-Electric Board and the Gas Council14.   Discussion of these programmes is continuing.(a) Electricity  Council. This  programme  shows  a  reduction  of  over 15 millions in 1960-61, over  30 millions in 1961-62 and over 40 millions in 1962-63, compared with the figures submitted last summer. This is mainly due to a revision of the generation programme,which will now provide for a slower increase of nuclear power and a  slower diminution of conventional power.(b) South of Scotland Electricity Board
(c) North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. These programmes show onlymarginal differences from those proposed last year and call for no specialcomment.Gas Council. Compared with the programmes agreed upon last winter,some under-spending is now expected in 1959-60, but on the other hand,some over-spending ( 4-5 millions) in 1960-61. The Gas Councilsestimates appear to be subject to an unusual degree of fluctuation owingto its very decentralised organisation.British Transport Commission and National Coal Board15. These programmes are provisional because major reappraisals of then-future policies are being carried out in the light of revised ideas of future demand and profitability: these may affect their investment programmes, particularly for1961-62 onwards. The provisional British Transport Commission ceiling for1960-61 is  220 millions and that figure has been continued for 1961-62 to 1963-64in the Table. The British Transport Commission^ estimate, however, which willbe discussed in the reappraisal context is  30 millions to  40 millions higher than this.Airways Corporations16. About four-fifths of the investment will be on the purchase of aircraft and spares. The changing levels of the programmes reflect the expected payments on orders already placed by the two Corporations. There may be minor changesin the pattern of these payments.Miscellaneous17. This includes numerous small programmes which it has been assumedwill increase slightly faster than in recent years.Housing (including New Towns)18. The programmes are provisional. They continue the present level, whichwas reached after two successive increases made during the reflation discussions in1958-59; they involve starting about 115,000 houses a year in England and wales and 20,000-22,000 a year in Scotland. The actual number to be started in 1960-61and 1961-62 will be settled nearer the time with the Departments concerned in thelight of the prevailing economic and other conditions.July 1959.
