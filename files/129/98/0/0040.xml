CONFIDENTIAL ^   /THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1959C. (59) 140 Copy No.27th July, 1959CABINETIMPERIAL AND NATIONAL SERVICES GRANT TO THEMETROPOLITAN POLICE FUNDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in his memorandum (C. (59) 119) the Home Secretary gives his reasons for seeking an increase in the Imperial and National Services Grant to theMetropolitan Police Fund from the  100,000 at which it has stood for 50 years to 475,000, in order to bring it into line with current costs. The police services towhich this proposal relates, in so far as they are not paid for by the long-standinggrant of  100,000, are 50 per cent, grant-aided by the normal police grant; theHome Secretary&apos;s proposal is that these particular services should receive a 100 percent, grant. This would transfer the other 50 per cent., or  187,000, from therates to the Exchequer.2. I do not consider that these services should be wholly paid for by theExchequer for these reasons:  (a) When the grant was introduced in 1909 (for reasons which would not be relevant to-day) Exchequer assistance towards police services was inits early stages. But since 1918 Exchequer support for the police hasbeen put on the uniform basis of a fixed grant of 50 per cent, of allapproved expenditure, with no distinction between the various services provided or between different police forces.(b) London enjoys great economic advantages by being the Metropolis. Thepresence of the Court, Parliament, and Government must increaseLondon rateable values by much more than the farthing rate which thesum at issue represents.3. I regard the reason in paragraph 2 (b) as conclusive in itself. If we were now considering this grant de novo we should not introduce it. It would be inconsistent with the development of our general policy in financial relations with local authorities (which is moving away from specific grants for particular services)to reactivate the Imperial and National Services Grant.4. Moreover, if the grant were to be brought to life again, I do not think thatit could be confined to the services, and the amount, which the Home Secretaryproposes. Which police services, if any, are &quot; imperial&quot; or &quot; national &quot; to the exclusion of local responsibility will always be highly debatable. Other services which were recently considered by the Joint Official Committee but are not now put forward include policing political demonstrations and Command Performances,guarding Westminster Abbey, and part of the cost of the Police Gazette. Thefact that such services have been seriously considered shows the danger that, once the principle of 100 per cent, grant for &quot; imperial&quot; or &quot; national&quot; services were established, there would be attempts to extend it to other services. Nor couldgrants be confined to the Metropolitan Police; police duties elsewhere could bebrought under the same heading, for example those in connexion with H-Bombdemonstrations, or tours of foreign dignitaries.55562
5. It follows from the arguments above that, strictly, this grant should havebeen withdrawn. My predecessors and I have not sought to take this step, inorder to avoid embarrassing relations between the Home Office and the MetropolitanBoroughs. If the Boroughs now ask for the grant to be increased I recommendthat they should be told that the Government would not feel justified in increasing ait, for the reasons in paragraph-2 above; and that the only alternative to leaving ^-sthings as they are is its withdrawal.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,24th July, 1959.
