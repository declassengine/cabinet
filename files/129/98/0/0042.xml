5DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;s GOVERNMENT)C(59) 14227th July, 1959CABINETREPLACEMENT OF THE &quot;QUES &quot;S&quot;Memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil aviation on 7th July the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Power and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty, to give further consideration to the scope of anindependent enquiry into the project for the replacement of the Cunard liners,&quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; a.id to report back (C. C.(59) 39thConclusions, Minute 3).2.      I have discussed the matter with the Ministers mentioned above andthere is general agreement that I should now proceed to arrange for anindependent enquiry and that the terms of reference for the enquiry should beon the lines of the draft annexed.3,     As regards the composition of the body that is to undertake this enquiry I would suggest, with the agreement of my colleagues, that we mightinvite Lord Heyworth to act as Chairman;  that Sir John Hobhouse, who is are tired ship owner of great experience and with a high reputation in theshipping industry, should be the member who would provide the necessary shipping experience;  and that the third member should be a distinguishedChartered Accountant, either Sir Thomas Robson of Price, Waterhouseand Company or Mr. W. L, Barrows.4.     The suggestion has also been made that we should have a naval architectas the fourth member of the proposed body.    I see difficulties in thissuggestion partly because I think it desirable to keep the body small, partly because the body will be able to take any evidence they want from technical experts and lastly because it will be far from easy to find a naval architectwho would command general acceptance throughout the shipping industry.5.     If my colleagues agree generally with these proposals I will discuss them urgently with the Chairman of the Cunard Company and the Presidentof the British Council of Shipping.    Subject to any comments they may have on the draft terms of reference I would propose to proceed with the settingup of this enquiry as soon as possible.    It will probably be necessary to makea brief public announcement to the effect that this enquiry has been set up during the recess.h.W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1.27th July, 1959.
