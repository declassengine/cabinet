DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 135 copy I TO. I ^24th July, 1959CABINETPENSIONS OF THE HIGHER judiciary memorandum by the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for scotland on 23rd April we were invited by the Cabinet to prepare detailed proposals for legislation to increase the future pensions of the higher judiciary and the present pensions of those who have already retired(C. C. (59) 25th Conclusions, Minute 4).    The Governments intention to revise the pension entitlement of the higher judiciary, and to increase thepensions of those who have already retired, has already been announced.In making the announcement, in the House of Lords on 2nd July, the LordChancellor pointed out that the increases in salary of the lower judiciary,following on the recommendations of the Standing Advisory committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Coleraine, have resulted in their pensions,which are related to salary, being increased to a point where they comeclose to, and in a few cases exceed, the pensions of the higher judiciary.We have considered the future pension arrangements against this backgroundas well as that of the related question of a compulsory retiring age for members of the higher judiciary.2.     As explained in the previous paper by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (59) 68), the pensions of the higher judiciary in England arestatutory amounts unrelated to salary and have remained substantially unchanged since the early 19th century, notwithstanding the increases insalaries which were made in 1954.    The pensions of the higher judiciaryin Scotland and Northern Ireland were fixed by statute at certain proportions of their salaries, but these pensions also remained unaltered in 1954 whenthe salaries were increased.    In 1950 provision was made in all three countries for a quarter of the Judge&apos;s pension to be exchanged for a lump sum and widowrs and children&apos;s benefits.    The current rates of pensionare shown at Column 4 of Annex A to this memorandum.    In all casesexcept that of the Lord Chancellor pensions are earned after 15 years1 service,or earlier retirement on account of permanent infirmity.3.     Our review has led us to the general conclusion that, for the future,the pensions of the higher judiciary should be related to the salary for thetime being; that, in the case of future appointments, we should introduce a graduated scale of pensions, thus getting away from the present arrange-ments whereby members of the higher judiciary must normally servetheir full term of office before being able to retire with pension;  and thatthere should be a compulsory retiring age, which we think can be most appropriately fixed at 75.    A retiring age for English Judges has been recommended by two Royal Commissions (the Commission under theChairmanship of Lord St. Alclwyn in 1913 and the Commission under theChairmanship of Lord Peel in 1936), though they differed as to the agewhich should be chosen.-1-
4.     In detail we propose:-(a) that the maximum pensions of the higher judiciary, to beearned after 15 years&apos; service, should be one half of their salaries, together with (as at present) a lump sum equal toone year&apos;s pension (or two years  in the case of a bachelor)and a widow&apos;s pension equal to one-third of her husbandfspension entitlement on retirement;(b) that pensions should be on a graduated scale, starting withwith one-quarter of salary at date of retirement for fiveyears&apos; service or less, and ascending by equal annualincrements to the maximum after 15 years&apos; service, and thata Judge should be entitled to a proportionate pension on retirement at any time because of permanent mental orphysical infirmity, or on voluntary retirement on reaching the age of 70;(c) that there should be compulsory retirement at 75 withentitlement to the pension then earned;(d) that the pension entitlement of serving Judges should beincreased to the amounts mentioned at (a) above, and thatthey should be entitled to opt into the new scheme as awhole if they wish to secure the benefit of retirement at70 otherwise than on grounds of permanent infirmity.The effect of our proposals on the maximum pensions of the different classesof the higher judiciary is shown in Column 5 of Annex A.5. The effect of our proposal for graduated pensions is shown at annex B.    The pensions we propose will be less favourable than at presentin the case of a Judge who retires on permanent infirmity after a short time on the Bench and who is now entitled to his full pension.    our proposals are, however, more generous than the provision made for thelower judiciary in such circumstances:  as against the one-quarter of salary we propose for the High Court Judge who retires after less than five years&apos; service, the lower judiciary in general receive no pension inthese circumstances;   exceptionally, a County Court Judge is entitled to six-fortieths of his salary.6. We propose that the pensions of Judges who have retired beforethe new scheme comes into force should be increased by 12 per cent, theamount of the increase awarded by the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1959, to public servants who retired before 1st April, 1952.    The recent Actprovides for a graduated scale down to 2 per cent in the case of public servants who retired between then and 31st March, 1957, but these increases were related to salaries which increased generally over the period, andwe think the fact that the Judges&apos; pensions have been fixed at their presentfigures for so long justifies the course we propose.    It will be in line with what may be done by Regulations under the 1959 Act for others whosepensions are at flat rates fixed many years ago.7. We have given careful consideration to the pension rights of future Lord Chancellors and we think that the pension should be increased from  3,750 to  5,000, with corresponding lump sum and widows&apos; and
children^ benefits.    This increase, which will make the pension of a futuref       Lord Chancellor the same as that of the Lord Chief Justice, is proportionatelyless than the increase proposed for the Judges, but the pension cannot be related to length of service, nor is a retiring age appropriate.    The LordChancellor&apos;s pension must have regard to his position as head of the judiciary and to the great importance of maintaining the succession to theWoolsack of men whose services must be available for judicial work in theHouse of Lords and the Privy Council after their retirement as well as during their tenure of office.8. In C. (59) 68 it was said that special consideration would need tobe given to the position of Lord Simonds, whose pension of  3,750 as are tired Lord Chancellor is in suspension during his service as a Lord ofAppeal.    Lord Simonds has already served as a Judge (apart from his threeyears tenure of the Woolsack) for more than 19 years, and if his pensionwere not increased at all, he would receive a smaller pension than that towhich a High Court Judge becomes entitled under our proposals.    If his pension were increased by the 12 per cent mentioned in paragraph 6, hewould receive less than the pension of  4,500 which we propose for a Lordof Appeal.    We think that the Bill should make provision which would be appropriate for any person who, like Lord Simonds, holds high judicialoffice after serving as Lord Chancellor, and that the effect of such provision should be to enable a person in this position to draw the higher of the twopensions for which he has qualified.    This would allow Lord Simonds todraw the new pension of a Lord of Appeal ( 4,500) instead of the pensionnow authorised for a Lord Chancellor ( 3,750).    In future cases, such aperson would naturally elect to draw a Lord Chancellor^ pension atthe higher rate of  5,000.    We should wish at the same time to take theopportunity of clarifying the existing law so as to make it plain that wherea person has held office as Lord Chancellor and as a Lord of Appeal orJudge of the Supreme Court neither he nor his widow may claim more thanone pension and lump sum payment.9. We invite our colleagues to agree to the preparation of a Billto make provision for the pension rights and retiring age of the higher judiciary on the lines we have described.    We shall have to consider carefully the effective dates for the new pension arrangements and for pensions increase for those who have already retired.    It will be easier to clo this when we are more certain about the date of introduction of theBill.    If any points of difficulty arise they can be brought before theLegislation Committee with the draft Bill.K.D.H.A.J.M.23rd July, 1959.
