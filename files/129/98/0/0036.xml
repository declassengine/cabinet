DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)!C.(59) 136 COPY NO. ^j/&quot;24th July, 1959CABINETSPEAKER &apos;5 PENSIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerMr. Speaker Morrison has decide:! to retire at the end     the present parliament, and I have considered his traditional pension of  4,000 againstthe improvements which are now recommended (C. (59) 135) in the pensions of the higher judiciary.2.      Hitherto the pension arrangements for retired Speakers have not included provision for lump sum or widow&apos;s pension.    The question is whether one or both of these benefits should be provided in addition to the traditional pension of  4,000.    I should be glad of my colleagues&apos; views as to whether Mr. Speaker Morrison should have a pension of  4,000 and,in addition, entitlement to a pension for his widow of one-third of his ownpension, viz.  1,333; and whether or not he should also receive a lump sumof  1,000.3. It is perhaps relevant that, as regards salary, I understand that the speaker has always been regarded as more analogous to a Senior Ministerthan to the judiciary. There is no lump sum or widow&apos;s pension attaching to ex-Prime Ministers&apos; pensions.4. Mr. Speaker Morrison has asked only tha-t part of his pension shouldbe commuted to provide a widow&apos;s pension.5.      I seek approval for the preparation of a Bill to confer whateverpension and additional benefits are thought fitting on the retiring Speaker.In accordance with precedent the Bill must be introduced at the beginningof the new session.D.H.A.H   Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.24th July, 1959.
