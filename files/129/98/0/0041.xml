SECRET ^   this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1959C. (59) 141 ...... Copy No.&quot;27/A Jw/y, 7959&apos;CABINETLAW OF THE SEANote by the Lord chancellor at their meeting on 3rd February, the Cabinet agreed that, in collaboration with the United States, we should conduct preparatory negotiations to mobilisethe maximum international support for the formula we wished to see emerge fromthe conference to be held at Geneva in 1960 on the breadth of the territorial sea and fishing limits (C.C. (59) 4th Conclusions, Minute 6). This formula was for a six-mile territorial sea plus a further six miles of exclusive fishery jurisdiction bythe coastal State subject to the exercise by fishing States of their historic rightswithin recent levels (&quot;six plus six subject to limited historic rights &quot;).2. Since that time, the main negotiations have been with the Canadianswho had previously seemed likely, at best, to be prepared to agree to a six-mile territory sea plus a further six miles exclusive fishery subject to the phasing outof historic rights over a period (&quot; six plus phased-out six &quot;) which in fisheryterms would soon become as bad as a general twelve-mile limit. The PrimeMinister, and later the Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries, saw the Canadian High Commissioner, Mr. Drew, and soonafterwards the Canadians produced a new formula. While this clearly envisaged the extinction of traditional fishing rights in the outer six miles after five years,it did represent an advance in providing for negotiations or, if necessary arbitrationwith a view to preventing, or compensating for, fishery losses.3. This Canadian formula was still unsatisfactory to us as it stood, inparticular because it would extinguish, after a period, the rights possessed by fishingStates and because the questions for arbitration and the nature of the compensationwere unspecified. The Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Agriculturehave therefore handed to Mr. Drew amendments to that formula, prepared by the attorney-General, which would result in the revised version shown in the annex to this note. Although this does not preserve fishing States&apos; &quot; rights &quot; in terms itdoes permit a State to continue to fish to the same extent if it can claim to havemade a practice of fishing in the recent past. This claim to continue is made subjectto arbitration, as are also any differences of view on the extent and areas of thefuture fishing. In handing this version to Mr. Drew, the Ministers said in replyto a question from him that, while we naturally desired to reach agreement withthe Canadians, we did not see how we could go much further than this version.Mr. Drew, for his part, undertook to forward it to his Government for their consideration but said that he thought they might find difficulty in accepting it.He may be able to report their decision next week.4. It seems certain that neither the Canadian &quot; six plus plain six &quot; nor anyformula more favourable to us than the Attorney-GeneraFs will command thenecessary majority at next year&apos;s conference. Even the latter will probably onlydo so if it is produced in the guise of a last-minute compromise between &quot; six plussix subject to limited historic rights &quot; backed by ourselves and the United States,and &quot; six plus plain six.&quot; With Canadian agreement, therefore, the proponents ofeach of these opposed solutions are continuing to enlist supporters for theirrespective views and as part of this process a round of visits to various Western55563
European capitals by United Kingdom officials is beginning on 27th July. A visithas been paid to India, but her attitude at the conference is likely to be decidednearer the time on purely political considerations. Approaches to otheruncommitted countries may be made later. Meanwhile, the understanding withthe Canadians and Americans about a final compromise is, of course, being kept secret and will probably be revealed only to Australia and perhaps New Zealand(by ourselves) and to Norway (by Canada).&apos;5. The Committee on Territorial Waters has been exercising a general supervision over these developments but I thought that the Cabinet would wishto be informed before the recess of the present state of affairs.K.House of Lords, S.W. I,27 th July, 1959.ANNEXCOMPROMISE FORMULA1.  The maximum breadth of the territorial sea of any State shall be six miles.2. The coastal State shall in a zone having a maximum breadth of 12 miles,measured from the applicable baseline, determined as provided in these rules,have the same rights in respect of fishing and the exploitation of the living resourcesof the sea as it has in its territorial sea.3. Any State whose vessels have made a practice of fishing in the outer sixmiles during the period of five years immediately preceding the 29th April, 1958,may after giving notice to the coastal State continue to fish in the outer six miles to the same extent as during the said period of five years. Such notice shall begiven within six months of the date of signature of the present Convention.4. If the coastal State wishes to dispute a claim to have made a practice of fishing in such waters during the said period of five years, the matter shallimmediately be submitted to arbitration. In such an arbitration the onus shallrest on the claimant State of establishing its claim and should the claim be rejected,that State&apos;s vessels shall not be entitled to fish within the outer six miles.5. Within five years of notice of a claim or where a claim is disputed, within five years of the claim being held to be established, at the request of either Statenegotiations shall be entered into (a) for the purpose of determining the extent to which fishing may be carriedon by the vessels of the State which has preferred the claim and/or-(b) for the purpose of prescribing the areas within the outer six miles where such vessels may fish which areas are to be those within which therewas a practice of fishing within the said period of five years, or other areas in substitution therefor in which it is to be expected that fishingto the same extent as in the said period of five years will yieldapproximately the same catch.6. In the event of disagreement on any or all of these matters, the disputeshall at the instance of either party be referred to arbitration for settlement.7. For the purpose of this Convention the term &quot; mile &quot; means a nauticalmile (which is 1,852 metres), reckoned at 60 to l0 of latitude.8. As respects to the parties thereto, the provisions of paragraph 2 of thisArticle shall be subject to such bilateral or multilateral arrangements, if any, asmay exist or be entered into.
