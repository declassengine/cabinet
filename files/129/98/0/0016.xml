secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1959C. (59) 116 Copy No.    &amp; *17th July, 1959CABINETASSURANCES TO FARMINGMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the withdrawal of the bacon tariff as part of the proposed Agreement at stockholm has caused a great deal of alarm among pig producers, in spite of the assurances which we have already given. I am afraid that there are signs that this may spread to other sections of the farming industry. I think, therefore, we oughtto do something to restore confidence.2. I suggest the following action (a) That I announce now that we do not want any further decline in pigbreeding and that the guaranteed price of pigs will not be reduced at the1960 Annual Review.(b) That we give an assurance that the tariffs on commodities not coveredby guaranteed prices will not be removed unless a broadly equivalentsupport is given in other ways.(c) That we consider how best we can reinforce our present assurances tofarming in statements made in the autumn.Pig Price3. I am quite clear that we shall not want to reduce the pig price at the nextReview. The main item of costs is feedingstuffs; and the price is automaticallyadjusted for changes in feed costs. The pig breeding herd has fallen by 16 per cent,in the past year, and we certainly do not want to see it go any lower. Indeed, afurther fall now, when the Danes are expanding their numbers, will be embarrassing.There is a real risk that the talk of ruin to British pig producers will lead to a quiteunnecessary loss of confidence and drop in pig breeding. Therefore I would like togive an assurance now that the pig price will not be reduced, except of course fo^any adjustment following automatically from changes in feed costs. There areprecedents for an announcement of this kind (e.g., in 1956 about the fat cattle price for 1957-58). The National Farmers&apos; Union (N.F.U.) have asked for assurances that at the next Review action will be taken to encourage the restoration of theNational Pig Herd.Tariffs4. The removal of the bacon and other agricultural tariffs in the agreementwith Denmark is leading to fears that we shall be prepared to remove other tariffsin order to secure, for example, a Western European Free Trade Area. LordNetherthorpe the President of the N.F.U. has already asked for some assurances onthis. I think it would help a great deal if we did give an assurance that where the tariffs are the primary method of support for agricultural or horticultural products,we will not remove them unless either circumstances change so that the tariff is nolonger necessary, or unless a broadly equivalent alternative is provided. (I am afraid though that it may be very difficult to provide equivalent support in otherways.)55524
5. I annex a copy of a letter from Lord Netherthorpe seeking assurances on both these points. I think it essential to say what I propose on them in the debate on the pig industry in the House of Commons on 21st July.6.  I think these steps together would greatly raise confidence in our policies.J. H.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, London, S.W. 1,17 th July, 1959.annex copy OF A LETTER FROM LORD NETHERTHORPE TO THE MINISTEROF AGRICULTURE16th July, 1959.My Council at its meeting this morning discussed at considerable length the implications of the recent Agricultural Agreement concluded between the Britishand Danish Governments in connexion with the proposed Outer Seven economic association. I am enclosing a copy of the Councils resolution which confirms the text which I dictated to your office immediately the meeting ended.There is very little that I need add to the terms of the resolution except tounderline the strong feeling of anxiety amongst producers at both the implicationsand the timing of the tariff concessions granted to Denmark. Unless theGovernment acts immediately to give producers a firm assurance that at the nextReview action will be taken to reverse the Governments pig production policyof recent years and to provide the necessary financial incentives, we will enter the Outer Seven Free Trade Association with the prospect of a substantial reductionin home-produced pigs and a further decline in our already diminishing shareof the home bacon market. My Council insists that in the same way as ministers have undertaken not to deny &quot; Danish producers the opportunity to maintain theirmailcet in the United Kingdom .... or to share in any increase in the UnitedKingdom market . . . .&quot; home producers are entitled to the same opportunities.They do not consider that a reversal of the present production policy could beconstrued by Denmark as being in conflict with paragraph 6 of the communiqueof 8th July.I have also to convey to you the concern of my Milk Committee that theabolilion of the duties on canned cream and blue vein cheese might have seriousimplications on milk production policy. Although the competition to be expected from these particular products may be limited, producers are nevertheless concerned that the opportunities afforded to Denmark and the other countries in the OuterSeven could well affect the average realisation price for milk used for manufacture and hence influence production policy at the review.Finally, I have been required to obtain your positive assurance that the specific tariff concessions made by Her Majesty&apos;s Government will not be regardedas a precedent and that their earlier declarations on the exclusion of agricultural and horticultural products from tariff concessions in a European Free Trade area or Economic Association still represent their policy. I am appreciative of yourobservations in the second half of paragraph 4 in your letter to me of 13th Julybut, at the same time, my Council consider that there should be a specificundertaking from Her Majesty&apos;s Government in this regard.I shall be happy to develop orally the factors which prompted my Councilunanimously to pass the enclosed resolution, and I shall look forward to hearingfrom you at your convenience.
Appendix^       Enclosure to the letter from Lord Netherthorpe, 16th July, 1959ANGLO-DANISH AGRICULTURAL agreement at a meeting of the N.F.U. Council in London to-day (Thursday) the followingresolution was passed unanimously:, &quot; This Council expresses grave apprehension at the implications of theGovernments recent Agreement with Denmark for the British pigmeatindustry.While realising that the chief means of Government support for pig and milk producers lies in guaranteed prices, the Council considers that the removalof the import duty on bacon and canned pork luncheon meat will give anopportunity for expansion to Danish exports to this country and that it istherefore essential that the British pig industry should be given an equalopportunity for expansion in order that it may continue to compete in itsown market.It is estimated that even in the year 1959-60 there will be \\ to \\ millionfewer pigs slaughtered in the United Kingdom. Not only will this resultin a loss of market by the home producer, but a switch from pig production to other commodities through lack of a proper incentive must increase the pressure on the markets for eggs and milk.In these circumstances it is evident that the Governments restrictiveproduction and price policies at the last two Annual Reviews for the pig sectionof the industry must now be materially revised. Accordingly, the Presidentis requested to seek forthwith firm assurances from the Government that action will be taken at the next Review to encourage the restoration of thenational pig herd and provide the opportunity for home pig producers to compete in the United Kingdom bacon market.&quot;
