THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation the Prime Minister has invited me to submit to the Cabinet a memorandumstating the up-to-date position on the Channel Tunnel project.Outside studies of the project are nearing completion2. Since this matter was last considered by the Cabinet in July 1957(C.C. (57) 57th Conclusions, Minute 8), the joint British-French-American study group has made considerable progress, and the Chairman of the British ChannelTunnel Company confirmed publicly last month that the Group will probablypublish a report by the end of the year which will put forward a scheme and maywell give an encouraging account of the prospects.3. The note annexed sets out the position reached on the main aspects ofthe study.Her Majesty&apos;s Government may soon have to indicate its attitude4. It is likely therefore that Her Majesty&apos;s Government may be faced by theend of the year with the need to indicate its attitude to a Channel Tunnel projectwhich seems feasible from the geophysical and engineering point of view, andshows a reasonable prospect of paying its way.Several questions arise5, The main questions involved are these (a) What are the economic benefits to the United Kingdom? There is nothing so far to alter our earlier view that there is no very clear case for building a tunnel in order to help our trade with the Continent. sea and air services offer adequate lines of communication particularly the&quot; Drive on, Drive off ships.&quot; A tunnel might provide competition whichshould tend to improve existing services, and this could generate moretraffic in due course. Improved services for passengers and private cars will have a tourist value though this will probably not be to thenet gain of the United Kingdom, and will to a large extent be at theexpense of existing sea and air services. A railway tunnel would beof considerable benefit to British Railways.(b) Would a sympathetic British attitude towards a tunnel have advantages in our relations with other European countries? The organisation for European Economic Co-operation and the European Conferenceof Ministers of Transport have taken an interest in the project. TheForeign Office see two advantages in publicly supporting a feasibleChannel Tunnel project Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1959C. (59) 12317th July, 1959Copy No. 9 OeJ idCABINETCHANNEL TUNNEL(i) It would make a particularly good impression in France;General de Gaulle, now President of the French Republic,mentioned the scheme enthusiastically to the Prime Minister inJune 1958.55518
(ii) Though it could have no direct bearing on the Stockholm talks itwould bear out Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ argument that weare not trying to divide Europe but to find a way to keep ittogether.(c) Are there defence objections to the Tunnel? The Cabinet saw none in1957 when the Tunnel was last considered. The situation has not changed since then.(d) If the Tunnel is to be allowed to go ahead, should Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment be prepared to subscribe towards the capital?-\i theTunnel seems to be a sound commercial proposition, it may not benecessary to do so unless, as a matter of policy, it is felt the Governmentshould have a share. The attitude of the French Government, who are said to wish to participate, will be important and if they decide to doso, it would be invidious for Her Majesty&apos;s Government not to do sotoo. This question will be affected also by the nature of the organisation for building and operating the Tunnel.(e) If the Tunnel is to go ahead, how should the building and operating be organised? There are a number of possibilities, including an Anglo-French-American company, or a company with wider Europeanparticipation to build and own the Tunnel, leasing it or its railway facilities or contracting its management, to an operating authority which could be mainly or entirely representative of the British andFrench railways.(/) What are the views of Trade and Industry? We should take steps to getthe views of the Federation of British Industries, the Association ofBritish Chambers of Commerce, the National Union of Manufacturers,&amp;c:, on the project.We should set up a committee of officials to report on the question in time for adecision by Ministers in September.6. As we are likely to be faced with what may appear to be a feasiblecommercial proposal for a tunnel by the end of the year, I would propose that weshould now give further study to our policy towards a Channel Tunnel. perhaps the first step would be to ask officials from the Departments concerned to reporton the answers to the questions set out earlier in this memorandum in order that ministers could take a decision in September.7. The Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and the BoardofTrade have been consulted in the preparation of this paper.H. W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1,16th July, 1959.
annex note ON THE PRESENT POSITION OF THE CHANNELTUNNEL STUDY(a) GeophysicalEcho sounding, diving and seismic examination at sea and drilling on landhave disclosed no faults which would prevent the construction of a tunnel.Bore-holes are now being sunk in the bed of the Channel as a further check.(b) EngineeringThe consultants (who include three of the most eminent British firms) are working on these results; their studies are not complete, but they regard the projectas feasible. It would take the form of twin tunnels, and for reasons of ventilationand through-put, they will need to be equipped with electric railways, carryingroad vehicles on special wagons. The period of construction would probably befive years or a little more.(c) finance the cost of such a tunnel, including terminals, is now tentatively estimated tobe not much above  100 million; previously, figures above  200 million had beentalked of. So far there has been no discussion of any British Government finance,either direct or through the British Transport Commission. It has been assumed that private capital from the Suez Canal Company and from American investorswould produce most of what is required. The French Government may wish toparticipate, and possibly Swiss, Belgian and German investors as well.(d) organisation the present study is in the hands of the Channel Tunnel Study Group, whichconsists of the British and French Channel Tunnel Companies, the InternationalRoad Federation of Paris, the Suez Canal Company and an American body,Technical Studies Incorporated. The Minister of Transport said in the house that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that this country is adequately.represented by the British Channel Tunnel Company in any projects that may beput forward. What would be the appropriate type of organisational structure for building, owning, controlling and operating such a tunnel has not been considered at Government level.(e) ProfitabilityThe Study Group has commissioned three economic studies of the prospects of a tunnel (British, French and American), and their reports are now being examined critically. It is understood that their general tenor is that a tunnel shouldbe able to attract enough traffic, including new traffic, to meet its costs and servicecapital of the order of  100 million. At least two-thirds - of the traffic would bepassengers, including railway passengers and private cars. Profitability over and above costs and service of capital would depend on the volume of freight. freight traffic would consist in the main of the same types as now move by the train ferry,with some attracted from general cargo shipping services, but no bulk traffic.July 1959.
