DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(59) 127 C--PY NO. ^20th July, 1959CABINETASSURANCES TO FARMINGMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am concerned at the extent of the assurances to farming which theMinister of Agriculture is recommending in C.(59) 116.     I think it isimportant that we should not be stampeded or appear to be stampeded in thepresent situation.2.      Pig PricesI recognise that the pig breeding herd has fallen considerably in thepast year to a level which, in present circumstances, is somewhat lower than we should be prepared to support.    But, provided there is no loss ofconfidence, we should expect the trend to be reversed during the next fewmonths.    The extent of the recovery is quite unpredictable.     Pig production is volatile, and a statement such as the Minister proposes, carrying with itan assured price for 20 months ahead, might be to spark off a rapid increasein production which could be very costly for the Exchequer.    The cost ofthe subsidy in the last three years has been c30. 3 millions,  3  .7 millions and  21. I millions, respectively.    I recognise that this present attack ofnerves may make such a development unlikely but it could happen.    Further-more, any interim price decisions between Price Reviews are undesirableand create embarrassing precedents.    One review a year is quite enough.3.     We must also consider the effect of such an announcement on the danes.    They could claim that by tying our hands in this way for so longahead we were increasing the effectiveness of our support, if not the guaranteed price, and that effects of the removal of the tariff on baconcould thus be frustrated, at any rate, in part.    Whether or not the Danescould justify such a claim, the announcement is liable to make an unfortunateimpression on them and on the other countries of the Stockholm Group with whom we shall be conferring when the statement is made.4.     While I therefore agree that something more is needed to reassure the farmers than we have said so far, the prudent course would seem tome:-(i) to reiterate our undertaking that no account will betaken, in fixing the guaranteed price, of theeffect on the Exchequer of removing the tariff;and(i)SECRET
(ii)  to say that the breeding herd is at present lower thanthat considered desirable at the 1959 Review andthat the Government would hope to see somerecovery in the near future.    (This leaves open the possibility that we might in fact want toconsider raising the guaranteed price, but without tying our hands if events should justify a cut.)If, however, my colleagues feel that nothing less than an advance assurance about the next Price Review will suffice I would reluctantly be preparedto accept the Ministers recommendation that he should be authorised tosay that the guaranteed price (after allowing for any adjustments due tothe feeding price formula) would not be reduced at the next Price Review.5.     In any case we must communicate and explain our decision to the danes at the earliest possible moment in Stockholm and preferably beforethe announcement is made.6.     TariffsThe proposed assurance on tariffs is more serious.    No alternative means of giving equivalent support to horticulture in lieu of the tariffhas yet been found or, I think, is likely to be found.    It would be a veryserious step to take to accept such a rigid commitment for the future atthis stage;  we have no idea yet how any future negotiations between the stockholm group and the European Economic Community may develop.7.     Lord Netherthorpe, the President of the National Farmers&apos; Union,has asked for an assurance of this kind and we must give him some reply.It is true that we have already said in the context of the Free Trade Areanegotiations that we could not in the foreseeable future admit the free entry of foodstuffs.    Nevertheless I am sure we should not re-commit ourselves in such specific terms for the longer term future at this juncture.I suggest to my colleagues that the question how we answer Lord Netherthorshould be further considered after our return from Stockholm.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.18th July, 1959.
