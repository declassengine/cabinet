IS DOCUMENT IE THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)0C.(59) 10113th June, 1959C O jP Y 1^1 C* * &quot;&quot;&quot;v^CABINETAPPLICATION BY ANDREW Mwenya FORWRIT OF HABEAS CORPUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesAn application for a writ of habeas corpus is pending before theHigh Court on behalf of Andrew Mwenya, a British protected person whois subject to a restriction order confining him to part of the MporokosoDistrict of Northern Rhodesia.   The application will be heard on17th June and I understand that if it is not rejected then, judgment willbe delivered on 2 3rd June.   I am advised that the application is likelyto be rejected, but if it is granted (and that possibility cannot be whollyexcluded) or even in certain circumstances if it is not granted, it willbe necessary to make an Order in Council immediately after judgmentis delivered and it might also prove necessary to ask Parliament forvalidating legislation during the present session.2.      The need for legislation will arise because the restriction order was originally made by virtue of the Emergency Powers Order inCouncil, 1939, which in so far as it applies to Northern Rhodesia wasmade in pursuance of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890.   The restrict-inn was continued under local legislation and its validity is beingchallenged on the ground that that Order of 1939 is void because noticeof the intention to make it was not given in the London Gazette inaccordance with the provisions of Section 1 of the Rules PublicationAct, 1893.   If the application succeeds all regulations made by virtueof the Emergency Powers Order will be void at any rate in thosecountries to which the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890 applies and theauthorities in those countries would almost certainly be faced with alarge number of actions for damages for false imprisonment and wouldcertainly be obliged to release many people at present detained by virtue of regulations made under the Order.3.      I propose to deal with the situation that would arise if theapplication succeeded by submitting to the Privy Council the draft of anOrder in Council to replace the Emergency Powers Orders in Council,1939 and 1956, which would contain similar provisions to those of the1939 Order, as amended from time to time and would validate allregulations made under the 1939 Order, bar all actions in the courts of the territories to which the Order applies in respect of any allegedinvalidity, and keep all subsisting regulations in force.   I have authorised the preparation of a draft Order on these lines and provisional arrange-ments have been made for a meeting of the privy Council on 23rd June.Notwithstanding the making of such an Order, I would propose that therestriction order against Mwenya should be revoked if his applicationsucceeds.
4.      I am advised that an Order in Council will be required whatever the terms of the Courfs judgment if Mwenya&apos;s application is granted,and, further that an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament also will berequired if the Courfs judgment raises the implication that Orders inCouncil made between the commencement of the Rules Publication Act,1893, and its repeal by the Statutory Instruments Act, 1946, are voidif they did not comply with Section 1 of the 1893 Act.   There are manysuch Orders, the most important of them being those made to set upthe constitutions of a number of Colonial territories.   Notice of theintention to make them was not given in the London Gazette because myDepartment was advised by the Law Officers as long ago as 1895 thatthe Rules Publication Act did not apply to them.5.      If the decision of the Court on Mwenya&apos;s application casts doubt on the validity of these Orders, the position could be put right by an act of the United Kingdom Parliament providing that the validity ofinstruments to which the Rules Publication Act, 1893, applied shouldnot be affected by failure to comply with the requirements of Section Iof the Act.6.      I have also considered what will happen if the Court dismissesMwenya&apos;s application without deciding whether or not the 1939 Order isinvalid.   In that case there might well be other applications in respectof persons subject to restriction or detention orders, particularly if theCourt expressed its decision in terms that implied that the 1939 order was void.   It is possible that the Court might dismiss Mwenya&apos;s applica-tion on the ground that he is not under a sufficient restraint upon hisliberty to justify the issue of a writ of habeas corpus and in that case anapplication in respect of a person subject to a detention order might beexpected to follow.   We cannot run the risk of having to release anysubstantial number of people subject to restriction and detention orders,and in particular, it is quite out of the question to release some of themore prominent ones under detention.   A possible way of dealing withthis situation would be for an Order in Council on the lines indicatedin paragraph 3 above to be made as soon as judgment is delivered, evenif that judgment is unfavourable to iviwenya, in order to forestall anyother application, unless the judgment is in such terms to make it clearthat the Court does not regard the 1939 Order as void.   The alternative would be to wait and see whether some other application for a writ of habeascorpus was in fact made, and, if that application succeeded, then tosubmit an Order in Council on the lines indicated in paragraph 3 above as soon as judgment was delivered in the later case, so that the successfulapplicant would not need to be released.   My advisers prefer the formercourse, as they think it would arouse very serious criticism if judgment of the Court in favour of the applicant were in effect set aside by an Orderin Council in this way.   The Attorney-General, however, is strongly ofthe opinion that a new Order should be made only if the Court expresslyholds that the 1939 Order is void.   The new Order is necessarily drawn in such terms that its effect will be to make it impossible to call inquestion in any court in the Commonwealth anything done in pursuance of regulations made under the 1939 Order at any time in any territory,   inthe Attorney-GeneraPs opinion, such a drastic provision should be made only if there is a clear need for it and he does not consider that any suchneed will arise if the Court does not hold the 1939 Order to be invalid.-2-
If a later application for habeas corpus is successful, a new Order inthe terms proposed could be made immediately.   If the applicant were a person whom it was essential to detain, a fresh order for hisdetention could be made by virtue of the new Order.   The Attorney-General considers that it would be easier to justify the continued detention of such a person than the making of an Order in Councilbarring large numbers of persons from their right of access to theCourts - even on grounds not in issue in these proceedings.   (Myadvisers consider that, if an Order in Council is made to replace the1939 Order in these circumstances, legislation on the lines indicated inparagraph 4 above would probably be necessary - this question canhowever be given further consideration when the judgment of the Courtis available and need not be resolved now.)7.      The Commonwealth Relations Office also see some difficulty aboutthe making of an Order in Council to replace the 1939 Order unless the judgment of the Court is in such terms as to make it clear that the 1939Order is void.   For some time the extent to which the 1939 Orderpermits the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland to makeemergency regulations with respect to matters within the competence of the Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland has beenin dispute between the Federal Government and Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom.   For the moment the matter has been left in abeyance until the I960 Conference, but if the 1939 Order was replaced by Her Majesty&apos;s Government without prior consultation with the federal government in circumstances that might give rise to the suspicion thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government were trying to resolve the dispute about thescope of the 1939 Order in their favour, the political consequences mightwell be embarrassing.   If the judgment, although in favour of the Crown,clearly shows that the 1939 Order is of questionable validity, then thereshould be no great difficulty in explaining matters to the federal government.   If on the other hand nothing is said by the Court to showpositively that the 1939 Order is invalid, it will in the view of theCommonwealth Relations Office be difficult to convince the federal government of the necessity to replace it.8.      I invite my colleagues to agree:-(a) that, if the application for a writ of habeas corpus made onbehalf of Andrew Mwenya is granted or if the Court, whiledismissing the application casts doubt upon the validity ofthe Emergency Powers Order in Council, 1939, an Orderin Council should be made at once replacing the Order inCouncil of 1939, and validating the regulations made there-under;    anal(b) that the making of the Order in Council should be followed bythe introduction of a Bill making it clear that non-compliance with Section 1 of the Rules Publication Act, 1893, does not affect the validity of any instrument although that instrumentis a statutory rule within the meaning of that Act.
9.      I also invite the views of my colleagues on the action to betaken if the Court dismisses Mwenya&apos;s application without expressingany view on the validity of the Emergency Powers Order in Council,193 9, that is to say, whether:-(a) an Order in Council replacing the Order in Council of 1939should be made without delay so as to forestall anyapplications by other persons for writs of habeas corpus;   or(b) the Order in Council of 1939 should be replaced only if suchan application is made and is successful, it being understoodthat this should be done with the minimum of delay afterjudgment is given in the later case, and that the successfulapplicant would not be released.A.L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.13th June, 1959-4
