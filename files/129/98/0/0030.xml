(59) 130 Copy No.2nd September, 1959,CABINETTHE COMMONWEALTH SEAT ON THE SECURITY council memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the Commonwealth seat on the Security Council falls vacant at the end ofthis year. For many months, I have been involved in tangled negotiations to decidewho should be the &quot; agreed candidate &quot; at the coming Assembly elections, i.e., for1960-61. This has now been settled, but not without hurt feelings and a store of trouble for the future. I owe my colleagues a report.2. By generally recognised convention, one of the non-permanent seats onthe Council goes to a Commonwealth country. This touches the interests of other commonwealth countries far more directly than it does ours. We value the seathighly, but they especially the smaller countries stand to lose far more if the conventional arrangement were destroyed. Yet they tend to leave to us almost all the initiative over choice of a candidate. This is a burden they must be persuaded to share in future.3.  Since 1946, the Commonwealth seat has been held by:  1946-47	Australia1948-49	Canada1950-51	India1952-53	Pakistan1954-55	New Zealand1956-57	Australia1958-59	CanadaSo, without any reflection on New Zealand, the seat has been occupied almostcontinuously by countries of size and influence in the world. This is as it shouldbe. If we hope to preserve the Commonwealth seat, the holders of it shouldcommand respect and general approval.4. But, with the expansion of the Commonwealth, we have run into trouble.This year, it began from a rather unexpected quarter. South Africa announced tothe &quot; old &quot; Commonwealth her intention to stand, arguing that it was time herclaim to the seat was recognised. Whatever the logic of this, the proposal was highly unrealistic in view of South Africa&apos;s unpopularity. Also, after six years inwhich the seat was held successively by New Zealand, Australia and Canada, itwas clearly the turn of a &quot; new &quot; Commonwealth country and in our opinionan Asian. If, as is probable, the seat at present held by Japan reverts to South-Eastern Europe, if not to a Russian satellite, the only Asian representative nextyear would otherwise be Formosa. The award of the Commonwealth seat to anAsian would remedy this unbalance.55772
5. The South African proposal was therefore most untimely. It was also likely to provoke political passions and a dangerous public contest for the seat,in which South Africa would almost certainly be defeated by a &quot; new&quot;Commonwealth candidate or some third party would slip in. In the process,Commonwealth relations and prestige could only be damaged, and the conventiongoverning the seat jeopardised, if not destroyed.i* f$6. So we urged South Africa to withdraw her candidature. After muchargument we succeeded, but at the cost of promises (i) to do our best to persuade the rest of the Commonwealth to admit her claim to the seat in 1961, and (ii) asconsolation, to support her for an honorific vice-Presidency of the United Nationsthis year.7. But, before we could settle the selection of an Asian member of theCommonwealth as the agreed candidate, Ghana announced her candidature, notonly to Commonwealth countries, but broadcast in New York (This may havebeen in part misunderstanding and inexperience, but the motive undoubtedly wasto spike South Africa&apos;s guns.) Meanwhile it had become clear that as India was known not to be interested, the Asian country which would command supportwas Ceylon. She was flattered by the idea and agreed to stand. other commonwealth countries promised support.8. It remained to persuade Ghana to stand down. This she has now agreedto do; but she professes to be very hurt at being outmanoeuvred, and has made clear that she will ask to stand in 1961 and it is certain that she will be in oppositionto South Africa at any time.9. So, while we have settled this year&apos;s candidature by choice of a comparativenonentity, we shall have to tackle far more difficult problems before 1961. I willnot bother my colleagues now with the possible ways of maintaining the&quot; convention &quot; without friction, but we shall have to give close thought to this with our senior Commonwealth colleagues in the near future.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,1st September, 1959.
