secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF. HER BRITANNIC MAJEST .Y&apos;S. GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1959nojibi   Copy Nov 32CABINET&apos; ;FORECAST OF EXPENDITURE, 1960-61 :Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will wish to be informed of the present prospects forGovernment expenditure next year.Civil Expenditure2. The Departments have now revised the forecasts they supphed earlier thisyear. These total  3,126 millions, as compared with  2,943 millions for the current year&apos;s Estimates, an increase of  183 millions or 6-2 per cent.* This is the largestincrease ever shown in the summer revised Forecasts for civil expenditure, both in amount and in percentage. Judging from past experience, the actual Estimates as submitted to the Treasury in December will come to an even larger figure though hope that stability in wages and prices will this year make the further increasesmaller than usual. Reductions are of course normally secured by Treasuryscrutiny and Ministerial decisions at Estimate time, but these reductions have neveryet succeeded in squeezing the total back to the summer figure. We therefore face a disquieting situation.3. The largest increases are shown by grants to local authorities ( 69 millions,mainly Education), National Assistance ( 33 millions, including our new measures),the Health Service ( 27 million) and Roads ( 12 millions); but the upward trend is apparent almost everywhere.4. For National Insurance it is assumed that the Exchequer&apos;payments to theFund will, as in this year, be limited to  170 millions, any remaining excess ofexpenditure over income being met through the borrowing programme by running down the Fund&apos;s investments.5. The figures do not include any allowances for any general rise in wagesand prices during the rest of this year, nor for such specific increases as we may haveto face as a result, for instance, of the Pilkington. Commission on the pay of doctors and dentists. Nor do they cover any policy changes not yet agreed. A numberof proposals for increased expenditure, particularly overseas, are still underconsideration.6. Moreover they do not at this stage include a number of increases to whichwe are already committed; such as Teachers&apos; Pay and the Cotton Bill. These aloneare likely to add more than  20 millions.7. Since this year&apos;s Estimates include a good deal of expenditure deliberatelyadded for purposes of reflation an exercise which we all hope will not have tobe repeated next year-an exceptionally large increase next year over this year&apos;s figures is particularly disappointing.     - -   ;Defence-Expenditure i . .... :8. In some previous years large increases in civil expenditure have been offset by reductions in Defence expenditure. Next year shows a very different prospect:The figures of expenditure in 1960 61 submitted by the Defence Departments forthe current &quot; costings &quot;; exercise total  1,683 millions (net,:-taking account of the* The figures throughout are on a like-with-like basis, i.e., original Budget Estimates.... they also reflect a change in classification as between civil and defence expendifufe&quot;which L have agreed with the Minister of Defence for introduction in next year&apos;s Defence Budget.  ,vC.

German contribution), an increase of  131 millions or 8^ per cent, over the 1959-60Estimates. These figures have not yet been agreed with the Treasury and I hopethat they can be reduced by detailed scrutiny before Ministers are invited toconsider whether further reductions must be insisted on. But they are, at themoment, the only figures available to me, comparable with those on the civil side,as representing what the Departments concerned think they will require next year.Total Supply expenditure. There is thus the disturbing prospect of a total in next year&apos;s estimates of  4,810 millions, an increase of  315 millions or 7 per cent, over the currentEstimates: and most of this is an increase in real terms i.e., it is not due toinflation. It would be much the largest real increase experienced since the war.It seems likely that yet further substantial increases will appear on the civil sidebefore the year is out; it remains to be seen how much of the increase now shown on the defence side can he eliminated.10. A comparison on a similar basis between the current Estimates andlast year&apos;s Estimates shows an increase in total Supply expenditure Of  237 millionsor 5-4 per cent., made up of  153 millions (5-3 per cent.) Civil and  84 millions(5-9 per cent.) Defence. Of the increase of  84 millions for Defence,  35 millions was due to the fact that the 1958-59 Estimates assumed the German contributionas  47 millions instead of  12 millions. Thus only  49 millions was an estimated increase in expenditure. Next year&apos;s prospective increase of  131 millions onDelete does not include any such special feature: it all represents an estimated increase in expenditure.Consolidated Fund Services11. To complete the picture I should mention the Consolidated FundServices, which in&apos; this year&apos;s Budget I put at  728 millions, including  600 millions for interest on the national debt. It is quite impossible at this stage to forecastwhat the debt charge for next year may he: the biggest single cause of fluctuationsis changes in the short-terlm rate of interest, and we have at the moment no reasonto suppose that this is more likely to go down than up. The other items in the consolidated Fund Services are unlikely to show any significant change.Conclusion12. lam most anxious not to present an unnecessarily alarmist picture,but I am sure my colleagues will agree that these are very serious figures (and I mayadd that the tentative figures for 1961-62, with which I am not troubling mycolleagues at this stage, forecast a further substantial increase in that year). I amin no position yet to form an accurate estimate of next years revenue, but wecannot at present assume with any confidence that increased expenditure of this order will be matched by an increase in revenue at present rates of taxation.13. The long-term objective of Conservative Government policy is that thetotal of Government supply expenditure should absorb a steadily decliningpercentage of the Gross National Product (G.N.P.), so as to facilitate tax reductionsand provide the maximum room for manoeuvre in policy on all fronts. We nowseem to be failing in this: for while I cannot yet be positive about next year&apos;revenue, I can say with some assurance that the G.N.P. is most unlikely to risenext year by as much as 7 per cent., let alone by more.14. Within the total of Government expenditure we have to allow for thecost of some services to rise relatively to the G.N.P., and also to make room fromtime- to time for completely new services. It follows that, if we are to attain purpolicy objective, most services must, if they cannot be positively reduced, be allowedto rise only by amounts less than the rise in G.N.P.15. It appears from the figures we now have that unless we can securesubstantial reductions we cannot very well present ourselves any longer as aGovernment pledged to achieve progressive reductions in taxation... And it isto be remembered that these figures do not allow for the cost of any new plans,or acceleration of existing plans, which some of us may wish, for one reason or another, to see incorporated in our programme between now and the next Budget.D.
