THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.    NUCLEAR PROPULSION FOR MERCHANT shipd memorandum by First Lord of the AdmiraltyWork on this problem has reached a stage at which I should make a report and seek the agreement of the Cabinet to proposals for the next step.History of the problem. In 1957 I set up a committee under the Civil Lord, with official, industrial and United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority membership, to examine and make proposals on the application of nuclear propulsion to marine engineering. Thehistory of these last two years is related in Annex A. It is one of hope deferred,not once but several times.3. In the meantime other countries have made the progress summarised in annex B.4. While no wholly British system is yet available for ship propulsion, several of the British nuclear engineering consortia have commercial agreements with american firms whose resources have enabled them to put more effort intothe solution of the problem than has been available here. A presentation of theirideas was held last May. This led to an evaluation by a technical sub-committee ofthe Civil Lord&apos;s Committee of the relative merits of several nuclear reactor systemsfor early installation in a tanker of appropriate size. These are of British designbut based on American development.5. The conclusions and recommendations of the technical sub-committee are shown in Annex C.Alternative Reactor Systems6. If we discard, as the technical sub-committee did, the pressurised waterreactor (P.W.R.) which is being built into the United States ship Savannah, tworeactor systems the boiling water reactor (B.W.R.) and the organic liquidmoderated reactor (O.M.R.) are the only ones to show promise for application in the near future.7. The B.W.R. reactor is the more certain of the two, though it has one featurewhich needs further proving for marine use. Its potential for development may prove to be small, though this is not current United States opinion.8. O.M.R. is rather less advanced, but in view of its likely lower capital costand greater potential for technical development is believed to show greater promise.A number of other technical factors require further evaluation.9. A first ship built with either of these systems and having to bear thedevelopment and construction costs of the reactor, the propulsive machinery andthe sophisticated hull could not approach economic parity with an oil burner.Printed for the Cabinet.

10. For this ship what has been considered in the Civil Lord&apos;s Committee is,briefly, an offer to the Council of British Shipping that if they can find an owner,or consortium of owners, willing to provide a hull Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould provide the reactor and the propulsive machinery on free loan and withcertain safeguards.11. In the present state of knowledge, it is thought that a ship, built on these terms with a B.W.R. reactor, could earn a return of some 1\ per cent, on theOwner&apos;s capital. He would expect 9 per cent, from conventionally-propelled tankers.Recommendations of the Civil Lord&apos;s Committee12.  For these reasons the Civil Lord&apos;s Committee recommended two steps: -(a) The Admiralty should invite tenders from selected British firms for aB.W.R. and an O.M.R. to produce 20,000 s.h.p. in a 65,000-tondeadweight ship, but specifically without commitment to build.(b) The Atomic Energy Authority should continue study of the organic-liquidsystem and should report in about a year.The Case for Greater Urgency13. I consider that this is the least we can do. My own view is that we should do more. I believe that we should show now what the Government is preparedto do when a satisfactory tender has been obtained.14.  This is the crux of the matter:  (a) On the one hand there is even now no proof that our goal, the economicship, can ever be reached. It is, therefore, easy to argue a case forcaution, principally on the grounds that, if we wait a little longer, weshall find the reactor system which will guarantee, or virtually so, a sustained programme of development, and that we shall be wastingour resources to build a ship before then.(b) On the other hand it has to be recognised that nobody can say, at suchan early stage of development, which nuclear system will prove to bethe ultimate system; and this will also be true in a year&apos;s time.15. Nuclear power must one day be an important development in manyfields including the propulsion of ships. In particular, it offers economical use in ships requiring high power, longer endurance at high speed and a measure of insurance against a shortage, or the high cost, of oil. Our hopes of getting thebest must not frustrate progress towards what may be good and valuable: andthere are good arguments for rapid progress:&apos; (a) Putting a ship to sea is an integral part of essential research anddevelopment in the marine nuclear sphere.(b) At least eight countries are at some stage in their planning of marinenuclear propulsion. The United States and the Soviet Union eachhave a ship in the water. Should there be a sudden and radicalimprovement in the prospects of securing an economic ship, our industry would be in a bad position to quote for orders if othershipbuilding countries had already proved that they had the ability to build a ship and we had not.16. If we order a ship now, it could be at sea by 1964. But it would haveto be a B.W.R. and not an O.M.R. ship.Courses Open to Us17.   As I see it there are three alternative courses:  i, Course A&apos; To decide now, as Civil Lord&apos;s Committee recommend, to do no morethan to invite firms to tender for a reactor and machinery on the hypothesis that we may (but only may) give an order for B.W.R. or O.M.R. in a years?j /: timer. &apos; ^uoimpq zip. brfi ^oup^noxr) hu t&apos;n v.:^:/u)i,&apos;:C) wj -Hay R-8000-uFirms tendering would be required to provide evidence of their ability to resolve uncertainties in the systems, of the development potentialin the systems, and of the reasonableness of the prices quoted.
Course BAs Course A but with the intention (to be announced now) that the tenderswill result in an order for a ship incorporating the reactor system (B.W.R. orO.M.R.) which best meets all the requirements. Such an announcement would lead in due course to negotiation with the shipping industry on the broad lines]indicated in paragraph 10.Firms tendering would be required therefore to provide the same evidence as under Course A.Course CTo decide now on the B.W.R. system for the first ship; to announce thisnow; and to proceed to negotiate with the shipping industry on the broad lines indicated in paragraph 10.Firms would be invited to tender for a reactor and machinery; and acceptance of a tender would depend on the resolution ofuncertainties in the B.W.R. system and on the reasonableness of theprice quoted.18. The advantage of Course A is that we do not have to make a decision now.A decision might, though it might not, be easier in a year&apos;s time; and, if we made it then, we might lose only six months of building and operating experience.Meanwhile, however, there is delay while specifications for both reactors areprepared and the greater difficulties associated with the O.M.R. are evaluated. Ina year&apos;s time it may well be that the O.M.R. (or some other reactor) is still justbeyond our technical reach. If in the end we then choose the B.W.R. we shall have lost, at the very least, six months&apos; experience from actual operation at sea.Course B could commit us to a ship, but reserves choice of reactor system.This may engender the same six months&apos; delay.I have already explained the advantages of Course C. The essential point isthat, of the three courses, this course alone will ensure that we obtain building and operating experience as early as possible. Its disadvantage is that B.W.R. mayturn out to have little development potential for a line of ships.Action Recommended19. I recommend that we should adopt Course C. It will involveGovernment expenditure of about  5 millions to  6 millions over the next four yearsif shipowners take part as suggested. Whichever course is adopted, expenditure ofthis order will arise to get the first ship to sea.20.   I invite my colleagues to agree to:  (a) The Admiralty proceeding on the basis of Course C, i.e., to arrange forthe building of a B.W.R. ship as soon as possible.(b) An announcement in the terms of Annex D.(c) The immediate drawing up of specifications for a B.W.R. tanker underthe aegis of the Civil Lord&apos;s Committee.(d) Negotiation with shipowners broadly on the lines of paragraphs 10 and 11,recognising that the owner would require some cover against anunexpected high cost of operation.(e) Tenders being invited by Admiralty from selected British firms for&apos; aB.W.R. propulsion set for a 65,000-ton deadweight tanker.(/) An invitation to the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority to continueresearch and studies at the highest possible priority, and to reportin 12 months. .(g) Civil Lord&apos;s Committee to be invited to study how best to progress thedevelopment of other systems.21. In view of the time factor, it has not been possible to discuss theseproposals with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and his position, therefore, isreserved.Admiralty, S.W. 1,    -23rd July, 1959.CONFIDENTIAL55558 B 2
ANNEX a nuclear PROPULSION FOR SHIPSSURVEY OF THE COMMITTEES work with the agreement of my colleagues I set up in April 1957 a committee under the chairmanship of the Civil Lord to further the problem of getting nuclear propulsion to sea in a merchant surface ship. The Committee was fullyrepresentative. In addition to Government Departments and the Atomic energy authority it contained representatives of the shipping, shipbuilding and marine engineering industries&apos; and Lloyds Register.2. When the Committee started work the principal repository in this country of knowledge of the nuclear art was the Atomic Energy Authority, and their experience was confined to work on shore. There had been no examination byanyone of the problems associated with the use of nuclear reactors on movingplatforms such as ships other than the Admiralty&apos;s work in association with theUnited States Navy on the building of Dreadnought.3. In the early months of the Committee&apos;s work the Atomic Energy Authority,with the success of wind scale and Calder Hall behind them estimated that it mightbe possible to scale down Calder Hall for incorporation in a ship. It would,however, need to be a very big ship, e.g., 100,000 tons. If this concept provedfeasible a shore-based prototype would be unnecessary and it would be possibleto get nuclear propulsion to sea by 1962.4. In the event the proposal to scale down Calder Hall proved to be abortiveon account of the very heavy weight and high capital cost involved. It had to be abandoned. The Authority then stated its readiness to proceed with the design ofa power plant for a smaller ship, say, 50,000 to 60,000 tons, using a graphitemoderated gas-cooled plant employing a low degree of enrichment of uranium.The results were disappointing partly because the higher fuel ratings could notsafely be assured and because the plant itself proved still to be both bulky anduneconomic.5. In July 1957 the Atomic Energy Authority stated that their hopes ofmaking further progress at this stage lay in their intention to build an experimentalplant for the purpose of studying the problem of redesigning a gas-cooled graphitemoderated reactor using fuel elements of a novel type in which much higher ratingsmight prove possible. This project became known as the advanced gas-cooledreactor (A.G.R.). The project, although essentially for land-based powergeneration, was expected, if it succeeded, to point the way to a suitable reactor for ships. It would be at least 12 months before results of the design study were known and longer still to gain practical experience of its working. By taking a calculatedrisk however it was thought that a ship using this reactor system could be at seaby 1964.6. The Admiralty thereupon undertook a feasibility study of nuclear propulsion (using the A.G.R.) in the context of a fast fleet replenishment tankera vessel having more characteristics common to a merchant vessel than most navalships. While this was going on the extent of knowledge of the nuclear art in thiscountry was being extensively widened by information which was flowing in from america to private consortia in this country and during the course of theAdmiralty&apos;s study it became possible to obtain and co-ordinate work commencedby these consortia on no fewer than seven other reactor systems all done in the context of a common ship and thus (allowing for the approximations which featurein all new work) providing a comparative picture of the various systems, the first of its kind in this country. The several promoters, including the Atomic energy authority in respect of the A.G.R., demonstrated their systems, with models inLondon in May to the Civil Lord&apos;s Committee. The result has shown that notruly economic reactor system is yet in sight but that several systems offered verymuch better prospects than the A.G.R. which had not fulfilled expectations.
7. The most developed and therefore the earliest available suitable systemsare British in design but based on American development and technology. Thereare some systems not yet fully examined which are British in origin. These systems,however, are in early development stages.^ 8. Ignoring the pressurised water reactor system used by the Americans intheir submarines and Savannah and in Dreadnought, a system which does not offersufficient development potential to promise eventual economy, the suitable systemsavailable now or shortly for a British merchant ship are the indirect cycle boilingwater reactor system and the organic liquid moderated system. Opinions havebeen divided in the Civil Lord&apos;s Committee which is the better of these two systemsto support for the first ship. The boiling water system (B.W.R.) is the more advanced. (Two small power-producing plants have already been in service on land in the United States and a large one is to follow next year.) By using it a ship could be got to sea by the end of 1963 or beginning of 1964. There are someproblems associated with this system, however, for which solutions are not yet available, the main one being that of reactor stability in sea-going conditions. Theorganic liquid moderated reactor (O.M.R.) is less advanced than B.W.R., and its performance cannot be judged as fully as we would prefer until a reactor of this type on shore in America goes critical in 1961. Both systems possess problems ofreactor containment not yet solved but not considered incapable of solution.9. The Civil Lord&apos;s Committee reached the decision that the Atomic energy authority should continue their research studies on O.M.R. and that firms andconsortia be asked to tender on the basis that they would produce designs whichanswered the problems posed at a reasonable cost and had the potential for gettingan economic ship to sea in a reasonable period.10. The Committee called for a statement by the Technical Sub-Committeesetting out the advantages of getting a ship to sea quickly even if the reactor systemdid not show high promise of becoming economic.(Subsequently the Chairman has reported on this matter as in Appendix II to this annex.)

Appendix II to Annex A0 THE CASE FOR EARLY BUILDINGNote by Chairman of Technical Sub-CommitteeThe Technical Sub-Committee ; of SUBNUMARCON has given detailed consideration to the value to be obtained from proceeding immediately with theconstruction of a nuclear-powered merchant ship, even if the reactor system itselfdoes not show high promise of becoming economic.2. Time did not allow an agreed paper to be produced but the following isbelieved to be a fair summary of the Sub-Committee&apos;s opinions.3. There is a strong feeling by many members that the early building and operation of a nuclear-powered merchant ship is an essential step in the developmenteffort required. Those members believe that although a sufficient reduction in capital and fuel costs in any system cannot be seen at present a ship at sea is anessential step to achieve such reductions.4. They believe, further, that such a ship would give ship-builders and marineengineers (including reactor designs) practical knowledge of the design and buildingproblems entailed and would give ship owners, port authorities, &amp;c, practicalknowledge of the operating characteristics (including economic) and maintenanceentailed. Paper studies can never be an adequate substitute for such practical experience.5. There was also a strong feeling by the above and other members of theCommittee that there is a vital need to pursue research both in the Atomic energy authority and in industry towards the best reactor for maritime application.Those members who do not subscribe fully to the views in paragraphs 3 and 4generally do so because of the effect they might have on the research effortadvocated in this paragraph.6. The Sub-Committee almost unanimously confirmed its belief that the nuclear propulsion of our high-powered large merchant ships will becomeeconomic in time. There are strong reasons, therefore, why we should both build a ship very soon and appreciably step up the research into a better marine reactor.7. The following view is mine. It is that the picture is unlikely to becomemuch clearer until 1963. We really need the results of the experiments in the UnitedStates power plant at Piqua to have full confidence in the O.M.R. and then we shallbe tempted to wait until the steam-cooled heavy-water reactor under development by the A.E.A. and, separately, by Vickers Nuclear Engineering shows some results.If we wait until then, we may well be a long way behind in the race.July, 1959.

The current United Statesphilosophy towards going forward in this field is exemplified in a recent remark by United States Commerce Under-Secretary, Mr. J. Allen, when discussing the prospective building of a B.W.R.-powered Tanker, &quot; It is only through the construction and operation of nuclear ships that we can prove research conclusions andactually demonstrate the value of nuclear power in ship propulsion systems.&quot;o
ANNEX CEXTRACT FROM THE CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSOF THE TECHNICAL SUB-COMMITTEEThe relative merits of the pressurised water system, the boiling water indirectsystem and the organic liquid moderated reactor system have been examined forinstallation in a tanker related to a power of about 20,000 s.h.p.2. We find that none of these reactors shows promise of becomingeconomically attractive in the near future for any tanker with this power. TheP.W.R. is most unattractive in this respect; the B.W.R. rather less unattractive;the O.M.R. the least unattractive.3. To get a ship to sea at the earliest possible date the P.W.R. would have tobe adopted; such a ship could be at sea in 1963. Unless unforeseen difficulties arise, the B.W.R. could be adopted within a few months and provided the problems on stability are resolved a ship so equipped might be at sea in 1964. The O.M.R.requires rather more development work, but it might be possible to get a ship at sea by 1965. These dates are based on the assumption &quot;that full use is made of american commercial information through the consortia. If wholly Britishtechnology were to be used the dates would be 2 or 3 years later.4. The installation of a pressurised water reactor in a British merchant ship is not recommended.5. Both B.W.R. and O.M.R. have problems for marine application which arein process of being resolved: this applies more strongly to the O.M.R. than tothe B.W.R. There is less shore-based experience of organic liquid moderatedreactors.6. The O.M.R. shows to considerable advantage on submitted figures asregards capital cost, but more detailed costing may reduce this advantage.7. We believe that the first British nuclear merchant ship would be on a sound basis only if it were the first of a continuing development series of ship projects.Without such a succession of ships impetus is lost, hard won know-how is dissipatedby the disbandment of design teams and disillusionment sets in.8. It is further our belief that unless this ship series is based from the startupon a reactor system which may show eventual positive economic promise in asubstantial field of shipping, there will not be sufficient industrial enthusiasm tomaintain the necessary continuity.9. It must not be thought however that we envisage the first sea-going reactoras necessarily representative of an ultimate system. Our premise is merely thatthe first reactor should be one which, because of its potential, is likely to sustain a continued programme. Any change from this first system would be on the basisof improvement and would, ipso facto, enhance the enthusiasm and impetus ofdevelopment.10. We have narrowed the choice of reactor systems to the B.W.R. and theO.M.R. but the evidence before us is inadequate to enable us to recommend to theCommittee which of these systems should engine Britain&apos;s first nuclear merchant ship.11. In order to establish more reliable costs and technological data on which to base the best decision, we recommend that tenders should be called for fromselected British firms in the nuclear power field for both a B.W.R. and an O.M.R.to produce 20,000 s.h.p. in a 65,000 ton deadweight ship.12. During the tendering period the firms would be asked to provide theevidence of their programme for the resolution of the uncertainties which are raised in this Report. We would point out that this procedure should result in no delay idgetting the first ship to sea since contract documents would have to be prepared and tenders invited whatever system is adopted.
13. The above recommendation ensures that the most vigorous use will bemade immediately of British industrial resources with their American associates(where appropriate) in order to meet an essential first phase of our programme.In addition we strongly recommend that much greater effort should be put intoM research and development towards economic reactors for marine use. This should be in the form of a parallel effort by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy authority and British industry to achieve an all-British economic marine reactor at the earliestpossible date.1959.ANNEX DDRAFT PARLIAMENTARY ANNOUNCEMENTQuestionTo ask whether he is in a position to make a further statement about nuclear propulsion for merchant ships.answer in May a number of reactor systems claimed to be suitable for marinepurposes were demonstrated in London to the Government committee (under my chairmanship which is) concerned with the use of nuclear power in merchant ships.Since then the systems have been under assessment by a technical sub-committeewhich has now concluded its examination of those systems which could be availablesoon. Two of these systems are thought to be both feasible and to have somepotential for future development.2. One, the organic liquid moderated reactor, lies further ahead in time scale than the other. Her Majesty&apos;s Government accept that the goal of economicoperation is unlikely to be realised in a first ship, and have decided to seek the collaboration of the shipping industry in getting to sea at the earliest possible dated ship propelled by the more developed of the two systems referred to. This is theBoiling Water Reactor.3. Accordingly, specifications will now be prepared with a view to obtainingtenders.4.  Work will continue towards the goal of an economic ship.
