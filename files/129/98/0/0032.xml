DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 132 COPY NO.20th July, 1959CABINETCOMMERCIAL POLICY:   HORTICULTUREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s memorandum (C.(59) 9l) on theoperation of the tariff as support for the horticulture industry has recentlybeen discussed by the Economic Policy Committee and I am reporting theirinterim views for the information of the Cabinet.2.     The Ministers main conclusions are in effect:-(i) that the tariff should remain the main instrument for support-ing the horticulture industry;(ii) that the Tariff Advisory Committee (T.A.C.) could give Ministersmore effective help in reaching decisions on tariff problems ifthe principles on which they have been instructed to base their recommendations were extended by an instruction to take account of the Governmenfs obligations under the agriculture act, 1947;(iii)  that in relation to a limited number of horticulturalcommodities, notably apples and pears, a more appropriateinstrument of support might be minimum price schemes under which, if the price of the commodities fell below a given level, imports would be restricted.3.     Groups of officials have been studying possible alternatives to thetariff as a means of supporting the horticulture industry, the work of theT A.C. in the field of horticulture and the general doctrine of minimum price schemes.    The Economic Policy Committee concluded, lam surerightly, that we could not reach any decisions on major questions ofpolicy in this field until the results of these studies had been co-ordinatedand reported on by the Economic Steering Committee.    They are being pressed forward with urgency but it means deferring further considerationof the Ministers proposals until probably some time in September.4.     Meanwhile, however, the Minister has been authorised to initiatewithout commitment confidential discussions with the National Farmers&apos;Union and selected trade interests on the technical practicability of minimum price schemes for apples and pears.    These discussions wouldbe parallel with the officials&apos; study of the desirability of such schemes.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.18th July, 1959.
