REPORT OF THE NYASALAND COMMISSIONOF INQUIRYINTRODUCTION : GENERAL INFORMATION : EVENTS before july 1958 AND SITUATION THENPART section 1. introductory. By the warrant given by you on 6th April, 1959 under the powers conferred upon you on the same day by the Nyasaland (Commissions of inquiry) Order in Council, 1959*, you appointed us to be a Commissionof Inquiry for the purpose of enquiring into the recent disturbances in nyasaland and the events leading up to them and to report thereon. Inpursuance of our Commission we began our inquiry in Nyasaland on11th April. We spent about five weeks in Nyasaland, travelling extensivelythere and receiving evidence in various places in each of the three provinces.We sat also for a week in Bulawayo, in Southern Rhodesia, and for four days in London, concluding our hearings there on 26th June. We receivedoral evidence from witnesses who appeared individually; and also in nyasaland from groups, each numbering from about half a dozen to over a hundred, who gave evidence through one or more spokesmen. In this way we heard the evidence of 455 individual witnesses and about 1,300 witnessesin groups. We received also 585 memoranda. We studied a large quantity of documents which were produced to us, chiefly by the Government of Nyasa-land. Your warrant gave us no power to summon witnesses and we are most grateful to those who voluntarily came to assist us by their oral evidence,often at some inconvenience to themselves. We are grateful also to those whoput themselves to the trouble of preparing memoranda. All this materialhas been of value to us in the preparation of this Report.2. All our hearings took place in private. This was required of us bythe terms of your warrant of appointment; but at the end of our task wethink it right to record our conclusion that an inquiry of this sort couldnot have been conducted in any other way. At the beginning the Governmentof Nyasaland disclosed to us every document which they considered tohave any bearing on our inquiry; thereafter they gave us, either by oraltestimony or by documentary evidence, every piece of information for whichwe asked. Much of this was secret information which no governmentcould be expected to disclose in public. The protection of privacy, essentialto the Government, was needed just as much by many of the individuals who gave evidence before us. Nyasaland is-no doubt only temporarily-a police state, where it is not safe for anyone to express approval of the policies of the Congress party, to which before 3rd March, 1959 the vast majority of politically-minded Africans helonged, and where it is unwise toexpress any but the most restrained criticism of government policy. Underthese conditions many Africans, whose evidence assisted us, would rightly* Statutory Instrument No. 624 of 1959.
have declined to testify in public. We were able to assure all our witnessesas the result of a statement made to us by the Attorney-General of Nyasalandthat nothing stated in this Report would be used by him as the basis of a prosecution, or used for the purposes of a prosecution of any person or bodyof persons. We were able to give them the further assurance, as the result ofa statement made to us by the Governor, that nothing stated in this report would be used by him as the basis for the making by him of a detentionorder against any person or in any proceedings arising out of any such order.3. Your warrant required that any witness who desired that his legalrepresentative should be present during the hearing of his evidence shouldbe entitled to have him. In accordance with this provision Mn DenysRoberts, the acting Solicitor-General of Nyasaland, was present when evidence was given by many witnesses who were in the employment of the Government.Mr. Dingle Foot, Q.C., M.P., Mr. T. O. Kellock and Mr. G. Mills Odoi,instructed by Mr. D. S. Downs, advised Dr. Banda and the members of theexecutive committee of Congress. As the result of enquiries made bythese advisers other witnesses were produced to testify to relevant matters ;we were grateful for this as it lightened the burden of investigation put upon us. One or more of these advisers was present when their clientsand the witnesses they produced were giving evidence. With one exceptionno other witness desired a legal adviser to be present. Thus it came about that in most of the matters in which there was a dispute of fact, theGovernment through the acting Solicitor-General put forward one set of witnesses and Congress through their counsel put forward another set. Atthe conclusion of the evidence counsel on both sides expressed a wish to address us in order that they might sum up the effect of the evidence whichthey had heard. We willingly agreed to this and thus had the great advantage of hearing submissions on both sides. That advantage was ofcourse not nearly as great as it would have been if it had been possiblefor counsel to cross-examine the witnesses on the other side. Our proceduredid not permit that; and we have already expressed our appreciation and approval of the terms of your warrant which made it impossible. Theabsence of opposing counsel was not only an unavoidable disadvantage butit put upon us, in accordance with what we conceived to be our duty, a difficult and sometimes disagreeable task. It was clearly our duty tomake as thorough and searching an inquiry into the facts as time permitted(We say &quot; as time permitted &quot; because we were conscious that you might wish to take decisions of policy or administration based on the facts we found and therefore a report that was too long delayed would be of little value to you ; we could not therefore check every detail as meticulouslyas we should have liked to have done.) A searching inquiry into disputedfacts cannot be conducted without some form of cross-examination, such as isordinarily forthcoming from opposing counsel. Under the conditions inwhich we were conducting this inquiry that task fell upon us. A witness,whose knowledge of what we were doing could only be derived from ourreception of his own evidence, may have felt at the time that he was beingsingled out for criticism. We regret this, and can only say that in this respectwe endeavoured to treat all witnesses alike.
4. Sitting in private we heard a great deal of criticism of government measures as well as criticism by government officers, given no doubt morefreely than would have been desirable in public, of those whose oppositionto government policies was said to be responsible for the emergency.Inevitably the evidence dealt not only with measures of administration inrecent times but also with the larger questions of policy in which those measures were set. Evidence on these matters was helpful to us but we donot regard it as any part of our task to express views on questions ofpolicy or, except where we think that on the facts there can only be oneconclusion, to judge of the wisdom or otherwise of the measures adopted bythe Government. We found the discussion of these questions helpful simply because it directed our minds to the relevant facts which we ought to ascer-tain and about which we ought to report to you. But the task with which you entrusted us was to report and not to make recommendations.We have aimed at setting out all the relevant facts as objectively as we canin order that those whose responsibility it is to approve or disapprove maybe provided with a firm basis of fact for their deliberations.5. The nature of our inquiry and the powers granted to us under yourwarrant were, we think, well adapted for the purpose of finding facts to beused as a basis for administrative and political decisions, which in the natureof things often have to be made upon evidence that would not be admissiblein a court of law. At the risk of stating the obvious we wish to emphasizethat we were not sitting as a court of law. We were holding an inquiry andnot conducting a series of trials. There wt - confrontation of witnesses.No individual had the right of cross-examinatioii if any witness who gave evidence hostile to him. So far as was practicabl and so far as we thoughtit consistent with what we regarded as our obligation not to make anyunnecessary disclosure of matters that were given to us in confidence, wesupplied those whose conduct had been called in question with a summary ofthe points that were made against them. But no one had the right to hear the whole of the evidence against him Indeed, the conditions of our work required us to travel from place to place and to receive in each place evidence from anyone who was there which might be relevant to any part of our inquiry In these circumstances it would, we think, be a grave injustice ifanyone, whether European or African, were to stand condemned as a resultof any finding in this Report. We have not written this Report in the formof findings for or against any individual; we have written it in narrativeform as a statement of the facts for your use based on what we believe to bethe balance of probabilities and not upon proof beyond reasonable doubt.6. You directed us to enquire into &quot; the recent disturbances in Nyasaland and the events leading up to them&quot;. We have construed the recent disturbances to cover chiefly those occasions upon which firearms were used by the security forces (we use this term to describe the police and the militaryacting either separately or together) with consequent loss of life or inflictionof grave injury. The first of these occasions was on the 20th February, 1959and the last on the 19th March. In the course of them 44 men and fourwomen were killed by gunfire, and three were killed by the use of a batonor bayonet.   79 were wounded by bullets.   All these persons killed or
wounded were Africans. Thus the total number of deaths was 51, and thetotal number of wounded 79. We must state at once that almost half ofthis total, that is 20 killed and 28 wounded, occurred as the result of oneincident with which we deal in detail in its place in the narrative. Thefigure we have given for those wounded by bullets is a minimum. Weare satisfied that the officers whose duty it was to report in writing im-mediately after any casualties had been inflicted and all of whose reports wehave of course seen, did not deliberately conceal any casualty. But wethink that quite often men were wounded not sufficiently seriously to prevent them from escaping. So that it might serve as a rough guide, we havemade a comparison between the number of people reported as wounded bybullets on the first day of the emergency and the number attended to inthe Queen Elizabeth hospital in Blantyre and reported as suffering frombullet wounds. The former figure was eight and the latter twelve. Thosewho suffered from baton wounds were rarely identified at the time; the reported figure in Blantyre on the same day is one, and the number treated atthe hospital is 14. Probably there was a number suffering from minor bulletwounds and a much larger number suffering from baton injuries who didnot go to hospital at all, fearing that if they did so they would be arrested and prosecuted.7. As the result of force employed by rioters and other criminals, all of them Africans, during this period there were no deaths but about half a dozen Europeans and Africans were injured some of them quite seriously.\ Firearms were used unsuccessfully by Africans upon two occasions.   In1 the light of these figures we think that you will wish a close scrutiny to bei made of all the occasions on which firearms were used by the security! forces.&quot;  We shall therefore describe them in detail so that you mayjudge for yourself whether any other course of action was open to theauthorities.   We shall also set out the legal powers of the police and the armed forces in the case of internal disorders and the instructions which theyare given for the dispersal of crowds.8. The events &quot; leading up to &quot; the disturbances are less easy to circum-scribe. We are treating the serious disturbances as beginning on 20thFebruary when firearms were first used, but there had been occasionsbefore that on which force had been used to disperse African crowds andon which Africans had molested Europeans ; the first of these was 21stOctober. One can only choose an arbitrary date for the beginning of an account of events leading up to these disturbances. We have taken7th July, 1958 because it is the day on which Dr. Banda returned to Nyasaland and the increased activity of the Congress party began. We must howeverdescribe in some detail the situation which existed in Nyasaland at the timeof his return, and for that purpose we must give a broad outline of earlierevents. Accordingly in this Part of our Report, when we have finished ourintroductory observations, we shall go on to set out such data about Nyasaland and its method of government as it is necessary to know in order to follow the narrative in this Report. In this Part we shall also describe the situation at the time of Dr. Banda&apos;s return and preface it by a brief history of politicalevents from the date of the formation of the Congress party in 1944. InPart II we begin the detailed review of the disturbances and the events
leading up to them. We shall not separate the earlier disturbances from thepreceding events. We think that it would be difficult to do so and that it ismore convenient to take, as breaking points, the end of the year 1958 and3rd March, 1959, the date when the emergency was declared. Parts II and iii will therefore deal with this period, which is substantially that covered by the governors despatch to you dated 18th March in which he reviewed the events leading up to his decision to declare a state of emergency; you havepublished this as a White Paper and we shall refer to it as the white paper. In the disturbances preceding 3rd March four persons were killed and six wounded by gunfire. The declaration of the state of emergency wasitself an event indeed, the most important single event leading up to the major disturbances which took place after 3rd March. We have thereforeregarded the justification for it as set out in the White Paper, as being oneof the matters into which we have to enquire. Accordingly, in Part IV weshall consider the Governors reasons for declaring a state of emergency and his appreciation of the events leading up to it.9. After the emergency was declared the security forces under thedirection of a committee called the Nyasaland Operations Committee setup by the Governor and over which he presided, conducted a series of threeoperations. The first of them, known as operation Sunrise, was the arrestin the early hours of the morning of 3rd March of the &quot; hard-core&quot;leaders of Congress and their subsequent detention. The reaction to thiswas. a series of disturbances all over the country in which 41 lives were lost and there were 68 wounded by gunfire. Thereafter there was littleorganised resistance. Most of these incidents took place on 3rd, 4th, 5thand 6th March and will be recounted in Part V of this Report. The objectof the second operation which began on 9th March was to restore Jawand order in those parts of the country, mainly in the Northern and central provinces, where groups of disaffected people were still operating under the leadership of members of Congress who had not been detained. In thecourse of this operation six lives were lost and five other Africans knownto be wounded by gunfire. Most of these casualties occurred as the result of actions initiated by the troops and not in the course of any large scaledisturbance. We think however that you would wish our Report to cover the events that took place in this period ; they arise directly out of the disturbances and are partly contemporaneous with them and we havesupposed that in any event you would wish to have an account of everyincident in which security forces used lethal weapons. Part VI covers this.The object of the third operation which began on 13th April was to &quot; stampout Congress &quot; and to return to normal administration. No lethal force was used in the course of this operation and we do not consider that its execution falls within our terms of reference. But steps had earlier beentaken to suppress Congress and, where appropriate, we shall deal withthose.10. All the main incidents which we describe in this Report have alreadybeen the subject of investigation. Whenever there was a death, there was of course an inquest. In all the inquests except two the verdict was oneof accidental death or justifiable homicide ; in two cases, which we shall
note specially when we come to them, the verdict returned was one ofmanslaughter. In many cases criminal proceedings have been taken against persons who were present at the disturbances for the offences of riot or ofunlawful assembly. The prosecutions were generally successful andsentences (subject to the confirmation of the High Court) of up to five yearsimprisonment for rioting have been imposed. We have not attempted tomake a complete and fresh investigation of each incident. We have been supplied with the depositions taken at each inquest and we have been ableto obtain a note of the evidence taken at some of the trials. We have usedthis material as the basis for our narrative and have ourselves usuallyexamined only the key witnesses in each incident. We have in almost every case heard the man who took the decision to open fire in order thatwe might form our own impression of him. In one case, that of the shootingat Nkata Bay, which seemed to us to call for a special investigation, we heard 20 witnesses, including a number of people who had not givenevidence before and we carefully inspected the scene of the shooting. Butwe did not regard it as any part of our duty to review the decisions of courts of law. They were investigating questions of liability involving individuals.Our task has been not to apportion personal blame but to try to give a story ofwhat happened as a whole. We have not ignored the relevant principles oflaw where it seemed to us important that they should be emphasized, butwe are not concerned with the question of whether any one individual usedmore than what in the eyes of the law would amount to reasonable force.We have sought to give a general picture of events which will enable you to determine whether or not the situation was handled with the minimum ofbloodshed.11. Our construction of your warrant is, as we have said, that we areto find the facts. Opinions may differ as to what is or is not significantin a matter of this sort and we have thought it better to go into too muchdetail rather than too little. We have considered whether we could provideyou with a summary covering the outstanding points in the Report and havereluctantly come to the conclusion that the risk of distortion inherent incompression would, in this type of report, he too great.Section 2. General information12. Since 1953 Nyasaland has been one of the three constituent terri-tories of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and, despite thefact that it is part of the Federation, remains a Protectorate under the direct protection of the Crown through the Secretary of State for theColonies. It lies in and to either side of the Great Rift Valley whichtraverses it from north to south and contains also Lake Nyasa, the country&apos;sdominant feature. Nyasaland is a country of about the size of Scotlandand, with the exception of the Lake, is similar to it in generalfeatures, especially in the higher lands to the east and west of the Rift.A map of the country is attached at the end of this Report and on it you will see marked most of the places to which we refer in the course of this Report.Nyasaland is divided for administrative purposes into Northern, central and Southern Provinces and into a total of 18 districts, the names
of all of which are shown on the map at the end of the Report. TheNorthern Province, which has its headquarters at Mzuzu, contains fourdistricts, whilst the Central and Southern Provinces, with headquarters atLilongwe and Blantyre respectively, each contain seven districts. The seat of central government is at Zomba in the Southern Province.13. The only three sizeable towns in the Protectorate are Blantyre,Lilongwe and Zomba; in 1956 Blantyre had a population estimated at about 30,000, while Lilongwe and Zomba had an estimated populationof about 5,000 each. Blantyre is the main commercial centre of Nyasaland and comprises the twin townships of Blantyre and Limbe. The two town-ships lie a few miles apart and are connected by a stretch of main road;the whole forms a pattern rather like a dumbbell. Certain of the suburbsof the municipality of Blantyre/Limbe (which we shall refer to hereafterfor the sake of brevity simply as Blantyre) are of some importance inrelation to the matters in the Report. First, there is the suburb of Ndirandewhich lies between Blantyre and Limbe and in which there is a WelfareHall where Congress frequently met. Secondly, there is Soche, a highdensity residential area lying to the south of the road connecting the twintownships ; it was in one of the houses in this area that Congress had its headquarters office. At the end of 1958 it is estimated that the Africanpopulation of Nyasaland was about 2,720,000; at the same date theEuropean population totalled some 8,700 and there was also some 11,400Asians and other races; the total population was thus around 2,740,000.The population of all the races has increased appreciably over the past fewyears; the corresponding figures for 1953 were about 2,500,000, 4,400 and,200. The most heavily populated parts of the country lie in the southern province which contains just about half of the total population. The mostthinly populated part is the Northern Province where under 400,000 live. in both the north and the south of the country the very high ground is virtually uninhabited and in the Northern Province in particular thepopulation tends to be concentrated in the fertile lake-shore area.14. Nyasaland is a predominantly agricultural country and life for theaverage Nyasaland African is the relatively primitive one of his villageengaged solely on subsistence farming. His opportunities within the countryfor making any extra earnings are very limited. Mining, which plays sucha big part in Northern Rhodesia, is non-existent and there is practically no industry. Even the production of cash crops (principally tea, tobacco,maize, groundnuts, cotton and tung oil) whether on estates where the africans are employed as labour or by the small African farmer on hisown account does not offer employment for more than about 200,000 people.Nyasaland is by far the smallest of the three constituent territories of theFederation but its total population is larger than that of either of the Others.This, coupled with the lack of opportunities for employment within Nyasalanditself, make readily understandable the Very considerable temporary migra-tion of labour which takes place principally to Southern Rhodesia but alsoto other countries in Africa. In the mid-1930&apos;s it was estimated that one-third of the total male population was absent from the country at anyone time. In 1958 it was estimated that 170,000 men were abroad asmigrant workers. Recruiting organisations function throughout Nyasaland
and men are engaged for short periods, usually of around two years, after which they return to their homes. One result of this migration is that therecan be very few villages in Nyasaland which do not have in them at least a few men who have worked in Southern Rhodesia or the Union of SouthAfrica and who are familiar at first hand with conditions there. NyasalandAfrican society is still a relatively primitive one and the country is as yetlittle developed. Village life is the norm. There are very few Africanbusinessmen. Likewise, there are very few in the professions or in seniorposts in the civil service.15. The modern history of Nyasaland begins with David Livingstone&apos;sdiscovery of Lake Nyasa in 1859. This was rapidly followed by missionarypenetration of the country. The Church of Scotland and the Free church of Scotland established missions in 1874/1875 and the Universities mission to Central Africa, after an abortive attempt in the early 1860&apos;s, returnedin 1881. At this time the country was ravaged by tribal wars and slaveraiding. The missionaries were soon followed by a trading company andby European traders and planters and in 1883 by a representative of theBritish Government who was accredited to &quot; the Kings and Chiefs of central africa&quot;. Eventually in 1891 a Protectorate was proclaimed over thecountries adjoining Lake Nyasa. By 1896 the slave trade had beenextinguished and by 1907 when the Nyasaland Order n Council 1907 wasmade, the whole country had been pacified. It is very largely to the credit of the early missionaries that peace was so rapidly brought to the countryand slave raiding ended and this early work, which culminated in the bringing of the territory under the protection of the Crown, with, as thefirst proclamation put it, &quot; the consent and desire of the chiefs and people &quot;,indicates the very large part played in the Protectorate by the missionariesand serves to explain the very considerable influence which the missionshave always had and indeed still have in Nyasaland. The only one of thepresent day missions to which we need specifically refer, since it is the onlyone which plays any part in the political life of the country, is the church of Central Africa Presbyterian. This Church was formed in 1924 as aresult of a union between the United Free Church of Scotland mission whichhad established itself at Livingstonia in the far north of Nyasaland, theChurch of Scotland mission which had established itself in Blantyre and a mission of the Dutch Reformed Church which had had a mission in theCentral Province since 1889. The organisation of the Church of central africa Presbyterian as it is to-day follows the same pattern as the church of Scotland with congregations, presbyteries and synods; there are threesynods corresponding to the three separate missions which united to formthe Church.16. The only event which we need specifically mention as occurringbefore 1944 is the Chilembwe rising. John Chilembwe was the self-constituted head of a quasi-religious movement which had been active in nyasaland for some years before the rising occurred in February 1915. Theoutbreak of the war had coincided with predictions of the fall of the whiteman which were then current in the Protectorate. Chilembwe under thecloak of Christianity decided to take action to hasten the white man&apos;s falland when the rising came, Europeans were the first targets. It was clearthat some fairly careful planning had gone into the preparations for the rising and before it was put down a number of Europeans were killed and
vigorous military action was necessary. Chilembwe himself was killedresisting capture. This short rebellion was soon dealt with but it is perhapsworth remembering that during the course of our tour of Nyasaland wesometimes heard the name of John Chilembwe mentioned as a kind of herofigure not without influence on the imaginations of the present-day populationof Nyasaland.17. The Nyasaland Government has always been administered by theGovernor, supported by the Executive Council and the territory&apos;s laws aremade by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council.This is still the position although it has in some ways been affected in recentyears by constitutional developments and by the coming of the Federation.Before the 1955 constitutional changes (to which we shall refer later in thisReport) the position was that the Executive Council consisted of the chief secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary as ex bfficiomembers, together with some other persons sitting as nominated members,whilst the Legislative Council consisted of the same three ex officio members,together with seven official members (who were persons employed bythe Crown in the Protectorate) and ten other unofficial members appointedby the Governor. In at any rate the latter years of the period before the advent of Federation, some of the nominated members of the LegislativeCouncil were Africans.18. Below the level of central government the three provinces are each incharge of a Provincial Commissioner responsible to the Governor for theadministration of his province. Beneath the Provincial Commissioners areDistrict Commissioners (D.C.&apos;s), each responsible to the Provincial Com-missioner for the administration of his district. In some districts there isalso an Assistant District Commissioner (A.D.C.). D.C.&apos;s and A.D.C.&apos;s havejudicial as well as executive powers and sit as magistrates in their districts.The headquarters of each District Commissioner is known throughoutNyasaland as the Boma. Both Provincial and District Commissioners areresponsible for the proper conduct of native administration within their areas and each district has one or more native authorities con-stituted under the Native Authorities Ordinance of 1933. Thoseappointed as native authorities under this Ordinance were in many casesthe existing chiefs who were thus, by virtue of their appointment asnative authorities, given statutory executive, legislative, judicial and finan-cial responsibilities. In addition to the native authorities, there exists in eachof the three provinces African Provincial Councils which sit under the chair -manship of the Provincial Commissioners. These councils contain bothchiefs and non-chiefs as members and until 1955 were purely advisory and non-statutory bodies. Under the constitutional changes in that year theywere given the right to elect the five African members of the LegislativeCouncil.Section 3. History of events, 1944-195819. The Nyasaland African Congress was formed in 1944 as a convention of a number of African associations concerned with African welfare andadvancement. It now has branches not only in Nyasaland but also in the rhodesias where, as we have said, many Nyasas go to work.   It is also
affiliated with Congress parties in the Rhodesias. At the time of the forma-tion of Congress there was no political question which aroused any strong feelings. In 1939 the Bledisloe Commission had examined the question offederating the Rhodesias and Nyasaland and had recommended that the time was not yet ripe for it. In 1949 the question began to be discussed again in rhodesia and in London and African Rhodesians and Nyasas who wereliving in London met and declared their opposition to it. Dr. Banda wasone of the people who was chiefly concerned in organising and expressingthis opposition.20. Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda is now a man of nearly 50. On firstimpression what strikes one about him is his charm rather than hisforce of personality. He is the most distinguished of Nyasas and has hada remarkable career. He comes from the Kasungu district, his origins arehumble and he owes his success entirely to his own capabilities. He startedhis education at a missionary school in Nyasaland, then got to school inSouth Africa and after that in the United States. At the University ofChicago he obtained a degree in history and political science. Then he took up medicine, obtained a medical degree in the United States and went to Edinburgh to finish his training. In Edinburgh he became an elder ofthe Church of Scotland. At the end of 1937 he went to Liverpool andpractised medicine first there and then in Tynemouth and then in london from 1945 to 1953. Thus he had spent almost the whole of his life away from Nyasaland and in the United States or the United Kingdom andhad absorbed the political ideas on which these democracies are based.But he never lost interest in Nyasaland affairs and among his countrymenin London he was a recognised leader in political discussions. In May 1949on behalf of the Nyasaland Africans in the United Kingdom he produced amemorandum (jointly with Mr. Nkumbula who wrote on behalf of theNorthern Rhodesian Africans in the United Kingdom) expressing their opposition to Federation. The fundamental postulate of all opposition thenand now to Federation is that the African in Southern Rhodesia is much worse off than he is in either of the Protectorates because, it is maintained,in the Protectorates he is treated as a human being and in Southern Rhodesiahe is not. This postulate is developed at length in the memorandum and itwould be quite outside the scope of our inquiry to examine its validity.21. On 8th November, 1950, your predecessor, Mr. Griffiths, announcedthat there would be a fresh examination of Federation. In February 1951Dr. Banda issued his memorandum in booklet form with an introduction inwhich he reaffirmed both his opposition to Federation and also his loyalty to the Government of the United Kingdom. We reject Federation, he said,because we do not want to be cut off from the direct political and culturalguidance of the United Kingdom and to become slaves of European settlers.He said that the two Congresses of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia mustlead the fight against Federation.22. Thereafter a careful examination of the question was made in twoconferences, the first of highly placed officials in the various Governmentsconcerned and the second of delegations at ministerial level at victoria falls; and the decision of both conferences was to recommend Federation.
On 21st November, 1951, your predecessor, Mr. Lyttelton, now LordChandos, stated in Parliament that the Government of the United kingdom was convinced that Federation was needed, though it recognised thatAfrican opinion in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland was opposed to it.The new constitution was brought into force by Order in Council dated 1st August, 1953. Defence, including the control of the armed forces be-came a Federal matter ; the responsibility for maintaining law and order in nyasaland, including control over the police, remained with the territorialgovernment.23. Inside Nyasaland the opposition to Federation was being led by congress. In April 1953 Congress publicly resolved to carry on non-violentresistance against Federation. It set up a supreme council of actionincluding a number of chiefs, to direct the campaign which was to includestrikes, non-payment of taxes and boycotts. The head of this council was Chief Gomani in the Ncheu district. In May, 1953, the government decided to remove the chief, an action which led to some disturbances inNcheu. In August 1953 there were disturbances in Cholo. These were probably due to a general feeling of unrest rather than to anti-Federationviews. The Africans in those parts had grievances relating to the tenure of land and the disturbances had apparently a non-political source ; theimmediate cause of the trouble was a rumour that two Africans had beenmurdered by Europeans. Disturbances spread over a wide area in theSouthern Province and the spread of them outside the areas in which theoriginal grievance had flared up, was probably due to feeling againstFederation. Police reinforcements had to be sent in from Northern and southern Rhodesia and from Tanganyika to assist in maintaining order.Baton charges and tear smoke were used to disperse crowds and in somecases firearms also. In all the disturbances eleven Africans were killed and 72 injured. In January, 1954 Congress acknowledged defeat. at its annual conference it passed a resolution abandoning the campaignthough it expressed itself as still opposed to Federation. Support forCongress dwindled and its fortunes were at a low ebb.24. After the new Federal constitution had been inaugurated you began to give consideration to the reform of the Nyasaland constitution so asto allow a greater measure of representation for Africans. On 15th June,1955 you announced your intentions. You decided that the composition of the Executive Council should remain as it was and that an Africanshould not be included on it. You decided that in the Legislative Councilthere should be twelve official members including the Governor, sixnon-African unofncials to be elected on a non-African electoral role byconstituencies and five African unofficials to be elected by the AfricanProvincial Councils. You decided further that the Legislative council should have a life of four years. You expressed the hope that during thatperiod those concerned would join together to work out further measuresof constitutional reform which could be introduced at the end of the fouryears. Accordingly in March 1956 elections were held for a new LegislativeCouncil. The Congress party secured all five African seats ; the nominatedAfrican members of the old Council who stood for election were all heavilydefeated ; Mr. Matinga, the leader of a small party whose programme
permitted it to work within the framework of the Federation, obtainedonly a single vote. In the Northern Province Mr. M. W. K. Chiume received16 votes out of the 22 cast. In the Central Province Mr. Chinyama andMr. Chijozi were elected, the former receiving 16 votes out of 49 and thelatter 8. In the Southern Province Mr. H. B. Chipembere was elected with21 votes out of 48 and Mr. N. B. Kwenje with 10 votes. You will observe that the two candidates with the largest majorities were Mr. Chiume andMr. Chipembere. These two were new to politics and both are young and able men. Mr. Chipembere is now 28 ; before the election he was inthe service of the Government as the District Assistant at Dedza.Mr. Chiume is now 29. He spent four years from 1949 to 1953 at MakerereUniversity College where he read science and medicine, obtained a diplomain education and was president of the political society. These two youngmen were extremist in their views and belonged to the left wing of congress; the other members of the Legislative Council were more moderate.25. The Congress party was immensely heartened by its great success in the elections. In Nyasaland people began to think that it might mean the end of Federation and you thought it desirable to make a statement inthe House of Commons, which was given special publicity in Nyasaland, thatFederation had come to stay and that statements to the effect thatNyasaland&apos;s participation in it was not on a permanent basis wereirresponsible and uninformed. This produced a violent denunciation from congress leaders and in May 1956 the President-General and the Secretary-General, Mr. T. D. T. Banda (who is not related to Dr. Banda), wereconvicted on charges of sedition and fined.26. In August 1953 Dr. Banda had left London to settle in Ghana. he told us that his reason for doing this was that, although his views aboutFederation were unaltered, he did not want to continue in active oppositionto it, which if he remained in London would inevitably be the case. he wanted, he said, to give it a chance. He therefore decided to go to ghana and, he says, if the Nyasa people had accepted Federation, he wouldhave remained there. By 1956 he was satisfied that Federation had gainedno substantial support from African opinion in Nyasaland and he began to receive and pay attention to letters from various quarters urging himto return and take up the struggle. By far the most urgent of thesecame from Mr. Chipembere who was in close correspondence with him from November 1956 onwards. We have seen a number of these letters inwhich Mr. Chipembere made his attitude very clear. He was dissatisfied withthe leadership of Congress. There was no outstanding personality. Mr.T. D. T. Banda, who was elected President-General in November 1957, had,Mr. Chipembere thought, &quot; great qualities&quot; which he admired but waslacking in intellectual equipment. What was needed was a kind ofsaviour : although it is wrong to be led by a single man placed in a powerful position, still &quot;human nature is such that it needs a kind ofhero to be hero-worshipped if a political struggle is to succeed &quot;. Mr. Chiumeand he were too young, he thought, to fill the vacuum. What was neededwas a man of about fifty or sixty, an intellectual, with a character com-bining nationalism with honesty, self-denial and a spirit of cooperativeness.
Mr. Chipembere said quite frankly that Dr. Banda&apos;s reputation wouldhave to be built up. He told him that he was known as a name, as an african highly educated doctor in London of Nyasa birth, that educatedpeople might know a bit about his political feelings and ability, butthat little was known about him among the masses. He must not befrightened if he was heralded as the political messiah. Publicity ofthis sort could be used with advantage ; it would cause great excitementand should precipitate almost a revolution in political thought.27. The question which more than any other was at this time dividing the left from the right wing of Congress related to the position of thetwo African members of the Federal Parliament. A special provision wasmade in the Federal constitution for African representation and two seatshad been allotted to representatives from Nyasaland. In December 1953two members of Congress were elected to these seats, one of whom was mr. Wellington Manoah Chirwa. The resolution of Congress in January1954 which had withdrawn the non-violence campaign, had also approvedof this representation in the Federal Parliament. Mr. Chipembere wasbitterly opposed to it and determined to get it reversed ; he had what &quot; hasbeen aggressively called an obsession &quot; against it, as he wrote to Dr. Banda.Mr. Chipembere demanded that the Federal members should resign ; theyresisted the demand and were supported by the moderate elements ofthe party; Mr. T. D. T. Banda was hesitant.&quot; Mr. Chipembere in hisletters to Dr. Banda pressed his point of view. Dr. Banda was at firstcautious. He was not in favour of bringing pressure to bear on theFederal members to resign and advised that they should be allowed toremain in until the end of the Parliaments life. Mr. Chipembere quitefirmly rejected this advice in a letter dated 29th March, 1957, theletter in which he expressed most strongly the need of Congress fora leader and the qualifications that such a leader must have. Dr. Bandachanged his mind. What caused him to change his mind, he said, was the visit of Sir Roy Welensky, the Federal Prime Minister, to London inApril 1957 and the announcement that followed it. The Order in council which created the Federation in 1953 had provided that it should be reviewed within seven to nine years. The announcement stated that theconference for reviewing it should be convened in 1960 (that is at the earliest date at which it could be summoned) and that the conference would considera programme for the attainment of such a status as would enable theFederation to become eligible for full membership of the Commonwealth.Dr. Banda considered that at this meeting Sir Roy had succeeded in getting the agreement of the British Government to matters such as Africanaffairs and the civil service coming under Federal control; and that this meant amalgamation by the back door. Notwithstanding that the announce-ment specifically stated that the British Government and the federal government were as opposed to amalgamation as they were to secession,Dr. Banda construed unfavourably the reference to possible Dominion statusin 1960; and, he says, since he opposed amalgamation, he supported thosewho demanded the withdrawal of the Federal members. In June 1957Mr. T. D. T. Banda was converted to the same view, and invited Dr. Bandato prepare a memorandum setting out his views which was to be presented
to the annual conference of the party meeting on 3rd August, 1957.On 6th July, 1957 Mr. Chipembere wrote to Dr. Banda that he was goingto put forward a motion at the conference that the conference should askfor his return and is recognition &quot; as Cabinet Member in absentia&quot; and congress official representative in Ghana. He said that the motion hadreceived enthusiastic support already from Mr. Chiume and from Mr.Chisiza. Dr. Banda had not heard before the name of Mr. D. K. Chisiza,and Mr. Chipembere wrote that he was a man that he should like the doctor to meet as a man of &quot; extreme &quot; views and a &quot; self-made intellectualof no university attainments but one who surprises us all with his mentalpowers &quot;. Mr. Chisiza was about the same age as Mr. Chipembere. He hadbeen employed in the Tanganyika police and then in a job in SouthernRhodesia, from which he had been expelled because of his political activities. Mr. Chipembere and Mr. Chiume started him off in his career with congress. They put him forward as an organising seoretary, having resolved to pay his salary themselves for the first year and then ask Congress to takeover the responsibility. At the annual conference Dr. Banda&apos;s paper had a decisive effect. Mr. Chirwa and his fellow member refused to resign andwere expelled from Congress. The conference also resolved that Dr. Bandabe invited to return to Nyasaland at the earlist possible date for the purposeof helping in the national leadership in the struggle for liberation. Noposition in Nyasaland was offered to him ; at that time Mr. T. D. T. Banda&apos;sleadership of Congress was still unchallenged.28. The announcement that the Federal constitution would be reviewed in 1960 stimulated a demand by Congress for a new instalment of con-stitutional reform. The life of the Legislative Council in Nyasaland did notexpire until May 1960. Elections for a new Legislative Council would then have to be held and it was contemplated by everyone that before then the Nyasaland constitution would be altered so as to give to Africans alarger measure of representation. Notwithstanding that the LegislativeCouncil had not yet run half its term, in September 1957 Congress placed before the Governor a statement of their views about what these reformsshould be; the essence of them was that there should be an African majority in the Legislative Council. The urgency, from the point of view of Congress,of having this established was that they wanted it to be settled before the composition of the Nyasa delegation to the 1960 review conference was determined ; they felt that otherwise the Nyasaland case against Federationwould go by default. The delegation to the Governor was led by Mr.T. D. T. Banda but Mr. D. K. Chisiza was the principal spokesman. Mr.Chipembere and Mr. Chiume were among its members. The discussions at government House took place on 19th September and 21st November,1957. The delegation began by putting forward a proposal for a Legis-lative Council of 40 members elected by universal suffrage and for an executive Council elected by the Legislative Council; in the course of thediscussions they said they were prepared to compromise by conceding eightnon-African seats in the Legislative Council and two seats for officials in theExecutive Council. The Governor was not prepared officially at this stage to accept or to reject the Congress proposals but he indicated a personal view that they were far too advanced and impracticable; it was clear that
what Congress wanted was an all-African government before 1960 andthat was out of the question. The immediate way ahead lay in sharedcontrol. In particular, the Governor said, he regarded universal suffrageas unrealistic. Members of the delegation supported their claim for it by reference to developments in Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda and the Sudan; onthe other side it was contended that all these countries had been much further advanced than Nyasaland and were politically much more mature.The delegation pressed the Government to put forward proposals of theirown ; the Governor said that could not be done until after he had fullyascertained the views of the other communities; meanwhile he suggestedthat Congress might itself approach the European community to see whether some measure of agreement could not be reached.29. On 6th March, 1958 you stated in the House of Commons that theGovernment of Nyasaland was not likely to formulate its proposals beforethe late summer. This led to a Congress delegation seeking an interview with the Governor on 2nd April, 1958 to express their disappointment. TheGovernor said it was difficult to be precise about the timetable but he wasthinking of early 1959. Congress thereupon decided to send a delegation tothe Secretary of State in London and Dr. Banda was invited to lead it.Dr. Banda says that he was continuing to receive many letters from all quartersurging him to return. In January 1957 he had a letter from Mr. Chisiza tellinghim that Mr. T. D. T. Banda and Mr. Chirwa were getting together. In March1958 Mr. Banda was suspended from office ; according to his account thiswas engineered by Mr. Chipembere and Mr. Chiume on trumped up charges of maladministration. At any rate the way was clear for Dr. Banda toreturn and assume the office ; and in the course of this month he agreed todo so.30. On 13th June, 1958 you received in London the delegation headed by Dr. Banda, who was accompanied by Mr. Chipembere, Mr. Chisizaand Chief Kuntaja. They repeated to you the proposals which hadbeen put before the Governor and stressed their anxiety that the Legis-lative Council should be fully representative of African opinion before the1960 review. You assured them that these anxieties were understood and said that you were expecting to receive recommendations from the Governorafter his return to the territory from leave in August. Mr. Chipembere thenreturned to Nyasaland arid it was arranged that Dr. Banda should follow in due course.Section 4.  Situation in July 195831. We have now come to the tiriie when we plan to begin a detailedaccount of events. Before we do so we shall describe the political situation as it existed in July 1958. We shall at the same time deal with a numberof factors that were causes of friction between the Government and congress, both in July 1958 and later when Dr. Banda took control. Wedo not take the date of Dr. Banda&apos;s arrival as the starting point of ournarrative of events because it is one which brought about any fundamental change. It speeded the tempo but it did not decisively alter the characterof events thereafter. Already a clash between the Government and Congresswas highly probable. Already the differences between them had gotalmost bey Olid discussion.  It was not simply that the two sides were far
apart; each had an attitude of mind which the other was beginning to findexasperating.32. The election of Africans to the Legislative Council had not altered the fact that the Government was a benevolent despotism; about itsbenevolence there should be no mistake and the &quot; despotism &quot; was that of akindly father and not of a tyrant. Every member of the Government believes that at bottom in Nyasaland there is government by consent and wouldnot be happy if he thought otherwise; his view is based on the assumptionthat, apart from a small minority of self-seeking troublemakers, the Africanwants what is best for him and that the Government knows what thatis. The majority of Nyasas may be incapable of making a reasonedand prudent decision on any question of policy, but there is a small but increasing minority which is just as well equipped to do so asthe average European and which considers itself as well fitted to direct the Government of Nyasaland as any European. It would admit thatat present it has not got the numbers with sufficient technical qualifica-tion to fill all government posts (it believes that this problem could be solved by the employment of Europeans as civil servants) but it does not admit that it has anything to learn about the art of government. It hasbeen immensely encouraged by recent developments in Ghana, the Sudan,Nigeria and Uganda. We do not pause to enquire what differences theremay be between conditions in these countries and in Nyasaland ; the fact is that the success of African nationalism there has stimulated Africanselsewhere to believe that self-government is within their grasp and tobehave accordingly. No doubt it was hoped that the five Africans in theLegislative Council would treat the four years of the legislature^ life asa sort of probationary period during which they would put the Africanviewpoint with moderation and make a thoughtful contribution to the formulation of policy which remained the exclusive responsibility of theGovernment; this was their chance to learn how to run the estate whichwould some day be theirs. Instead of that they have behaved as if theywere the opposition in a fully fledged democracy whose duty it was toharass and criticise the Government. Their speeches are largely designed aspropaganda to be printed in Hansard at government expense; Hansardhas become a best seller among educated Africans. But the forms ofgovernment and the attitude of the Government towards its subjects arestill essentially paternal. The leaders of Congress have been pouring newwine into old skins.33. We can most pertinently illustrate this divergence of outlook byexamining its effect upon issues which were a matter of lively controversyboth before and after Dr. Banda&apos;s coming. We shall take first the positionof the chiefs with which is tied up respect for authority. In a democracypoliticians are frequently scoffed at. If one were referred to as &quot; a littleboy of 25 years old direct from Oxford &quot;, no one would worry. But whenDr. Banda referred to District Commissioners in these terms (not an individual but the genus) it was thought by the administration to be dangerous. A District Commissioner cannot afford to be jeered at orinsulted in public; if that is tolerated, it would lead to a loss of authority which would be fatal. Many unofficial Europeans consider that the same
thing applies to them. This must be remembered when the reaction ofthe Government is considered to some of the demonstrations which tookplace in October; the stoning of European cars was resented as a sign of disrespect as well as because of the damage that was done and theunpleasantness that was caused. Government in Nyasaland is based onrespect for authority and this applies to the chiefs as much as to Europeans.&quot; Contempt&quot; of a chief is an offence which he can punish. Partydemonstrations against a chief hostile to Congress might well amount tocontempt. The administration relies greatly on the powers of the chief,who is in effect a salaried government servant allowed, to a limited extent, togo his own way. The respect which by native tradition and custom is paidto chiefs is something which the Government is most anxious to preserve;one of the things about Congress which most disturbed the Governmentwas their practice of stirring up disrespectful demonstrations against loyalchiefs. The Governments attitude is that the chief should be abovepolitics. This means in practice that he should not be a supporter of congress ; we have not encountered any case in which a chief incurredGovernment displeasure by taking action against Congress.34. Freedom of speech is considered to be one of the essential con-ditions of democracy and therefore the right of assembly is jealouslypreserved: public meetings are not held by permission of the Government.This right has never been recognised among Africans, perhaps becauseassemblies in Africa can lead so much more easily to a breach of the peace.By native custom a chief may prohibit assemblies and under British rulehis right, except that it no longer applies to townships, has been preserved.It remains in almost all districts in Nyasaland and is regulated by rulesmade under the Native Authority Ordinance. These require that a chief must be given seven days&apos; notice of intention to convene, organiseor hold a public meeting and he may forbid it if he has reason tobelieve that it may occasion a breach of the peace or undermine his authority or that of the Government. A similar power is given by law to thepolice. It extends to processions as well as to assemblies; but a policeofficer is required to issue a permit if he &quot; is satisfied that suchassembly or procession is unlikely to cause a breach of the peace, ordisaffection&quot;. It is recognised that the necessity for obtaining doublepermission in most districts &quot; will inevitably result in delays which may beirksome &quot;. We quote from a government directive dated 29th September,1958 which enjoined the police to act as expeditiously as possible and to urgeupon chiefs the desirability of doing likewise. We had many complaints aboutthe exercise of these powers and the statement in paragraph 22 of the white paper that up to the end of December 1958 hardly any requests to holdmeetings were refused, was hotly disputed. The Government has supplied us with figures which show that from August 1958 to the end of December 1958the police gave permits for 436 meetings and refused them for 31, i.e.there were refusals of approximately 6-6 per cent of applications. We donot know how many of the 436 were Congress meetings since the law
applies to public meetings of every sort and not only political meetings. Inthe following six weeks up to the middle of February the police gave permitsfor a further 89 meetings and refused them for 19.35. In considering the weight of these restrictions, there is a numberof points to be borne in mind besides the percentage of refusals. First,the law effectively prohibited all meetings that could not in their naturebe arranged well in advance and all assemblies as well. If, for example,a visit by Dr. Banda was arranged at short notice and people were asked to turn out and welcome him in the streets, those responsible wouldbe committing an offence. The law is plainly one that has to be admini-tered with good sense and elasticity; and this was generally, but notinvariably, forthcoming from the police. Secondly, the police were entitledto impose conditions and frequently did. They could specify subjects whichmust not be mentioned ; they could make it a requirement that the police should themselves be allowed to be present and to record the speech ; theycould limit the times within which the assembly might be held, so that if acrowd leaving the hall did not disperse at once they would commit the offence of unlawful assembly. Thirdly, and most important of all, the policepowers about which alone we have statistics were in addition to those ofthe chiefs. The chiefs were not required to give any reason for a refusaland the &quot; undermining of authority &quot; is a very wide term. We think thatDistrict Commissioners frequently found it more convenient to deal with applications for Congress meetings through the chiefs rather than throughthe police. One District Commissioner, speaking of the chiefs&apos; cooperationin this respect, told us :-&quot; They had powers of course to prohibit public meetings in their areas, and with one exception they helped me in that a lot. . . .The others were very genuine in keeping Congress right out of this area. A number had previously experienced trouble in 1953. they accepted my advice very early on, once the Congress machine reallystarted up, to try and keep the influence out of the district, and thebest way, on my advice, was to stop anyone having meetings36. Finally, the terms of the law are so wide as necessarily to invest theauthorities with a discretion which can be exercised arbitrarily. As wehave said, the law does not forbid only political meetings. If a chief orheadman called a village meeting, it might depend on what was saidwhether he was prosecuted or not. If he was a f&apos; loyal&quot; chief and took theoccasion to express some anti-Congress views, he would certainly not be prosecuted. If he was a Congress chief, the matter might be looked atdifferently. In a prosecution in respect of a meeting held on 22ndFebruary, 1959 called on behalf of a chief who supported Congress, thecourt received evidence to show that only persons who were opposed togovernment policy were summoned and that a man was left out because he agreed with the District Commissioner. The court considered that &quot; in such circumstances the court is entitled to conclude that the subject of the meeting was against the Government&quot;. The court held that while it could not havebeen the Government^ intention to forbid ordinary administrative meetingsof chiefs and headmen, it could likewise not have been its intention to
exempt meetings called with subversive intention, and so found the caseproved.37. The provisions of these laws are defended on the ground that itwould be impossible to remove from the chiefs a power which traditionallyis theirs ; and that if the chiefs have this power, the Government must have it as well. They are defended also on the broad ground that the ordinaryAfrican does not yet understand freedom to criticise established authority.This may not be very consistent with democratic notions, but it is a view thatis strongly held by those experienced in the government of Africans.Putting it tersely, there is no room for a Hyde Park in Nyasaland. It is saidalso particularly that the fact that the Government has given permission for a meeting to be held is understood to mean that it approves everything thatis advocated at the meeting. This last point of course would rot arise ifthe necessity for permission were abolished altogether. But in the wider pointthere is some substance which we shall consider later.38. About ten years ago the Government enacted legislation under whichrules were made to prevent soil erosion. One of these rules is that slopingland should not be cultivated unless ridges or bunds have been erected along the contour ; this means a good deal of labour just before the rains come andwhen the ground is dry and hard. Another rule is that gardens must behoed by a specified date, e.g., 15th November, before the rains are expected.Another is that the banks of streams must be left uncultivated. There arealso veterinary rules to prevent the spread of disease ; in some districts theserequire cattle to be dipped once a week. Breaches of these rules lead tofines and in extreme cases to imprisonment. They are very unpopular.Their object is little understood because it lies in the long term and the african does not look very far ahead. It is indeed,&apos; the Government claim,because of the difficulty of making the African see for himself the advantages of soil conservation that it is necessary to enforce these rules by penaltiesand not simply to rely upon the education of the African up to higheragricultural standards.39. The enforcement of these rules led to disputes and to a great dealof bitter feeling during the period we have under review. The Governmentcontend that opposition to them was being deliberately fomented by congress leaders, who knew or ought to have known how necessary they are, simplyin order to stir up anti-government feeling. Nor all the rules are universallyconsidered to be beneficial, even by well informed opinion ; and we have quiteindependent evidence that the Government was sometimes too rigid about theirenforcement. Dr. Banda in his speeches did not disapprove of agriculturallegislation as such but he strongly disapproved of its enforcement by punish-ment and not by persuasion. We have no doubt that in many districts congress leaders made as much capital as they could out of any government actionwhich was unpopular; and in this respect the agricultural rules were a veryhappy hunting ground. One shrewd observer, a member of Congress but notbelonging to the leadership, agreed that there was a policy of &quot; nagging&quot;the Government; it was due, in his view, to the lack of other channelsthrough which Congress as an opposition party could make itself felt.

One shrewd observer, a member of Congress but notbelonging to the leadership, agreed that there was a policy of &quot; nagging &quot;the Government; it was due, in his view, to the lack of other channelsthrough which Congress as an opposition party could make itself felt.
40. Another charge that the Government brought against Congress wasthat they resorted to intimidation. We do not think that this was a policydeliberately adopted by Congress at the highest level, certainly not by Dr.Banda ; but we think that in this respect, as well as in some others, Dr.Banda elected to disregard the political immaturity of many of his followers.The ordinary African considers threats and intimidation and the occasionaluse of physical force as acceptable alternatives to persuasion. The Govern-ment contended that support for Congress had been built up very largely by intimidation including threats to kill, beat or burn. The African houseor hut is not usually of permanent construction and the destruction of adwelling is not nearly as serious a matter as it would be in Britain. Butarson is greatly feared; it is easily effected and difficult to detect; it leavesa man and his family homeless, at least for the time being, and may meantoo the loss of all their possessions. We have no evidence at all of any threat of this sort being executed before 3rd March. We have verylittle direct evidence of threats being made ; and it was put forward as additional evidence of intimidation that those threatened were unwilling to speak about it. We are satisfied that intimidation was one of the weaponsused by Congress, particularly in the case of anyone who had joined congress and then wanted to leave it. It was also used against Africans serving theGovernment, for example the agricultural capitao or foreman whose dutyit was to see to the observance of the agricultural rules, or a postmaster, ora schoolmaster whose teaching was not to the liking of Congress. InFebruary 1959 one such man was visited in his house by what he took tobe a delegation of local Congressmen. When he refused to do what they wanted, they said that they had armed people outside and that they wouldkill him that day ; failing which, they said, he would hang himself and awasp would sting him and he would die. They discussed these prospectsfrom 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. As they were then still talking, the proposed victimwent out and banged the door of his office with his head. This terrified themand they ran away in a panic. This incident may appear rather ludicrous inprint; but the testimony we have received convinces us that vague andmenacing language of this sort is surprisingly effective in creating fear.Nevertheless we think the Government exaggerated the extent and effect ofintimidation. Some of the evidence we heard suggested that, apart from aruthless minority, the whole membership of Congress was secured by intimidation-dation ; we are on the contrary satisfied that it depended chiefly on popularsupport.41. We think that intimidation was practised mostly at lower levels.It is one of the things which show that the African is still politically immatureand accordingly one of the things which Congress leaders in their demands for universal adult suffrage and all the other concomitants of full democracychoose to overlook. Dr. Banda in particular, who has after all spent mostof his life outside Africa, tended to treat the African as if he had just thesame mentality as the average European. The point already made that the african does not understand criticism of established authority illustrates thssame thing. If, for example, Dr. Banda attacked the enforcement of theagricultural rules, then must it not be that he did not want them observed?
If so, then was not the African confronted with a choice between obedienceto Dr. Banda and obedience to the Government? The African did not think of Dr. Banda as a party leader whose policies happened to be opposed tothose of the Government; he thought of him as a national leader setting up his authority against that of the Boma. The real case against Dr. Banda isnot that he ever advocated disobedience we shall examine his speechesduring the period under review and we do not think that he ever did butthat he refused to realise that disobedience was the inevitable consequence ofwhat he was saying and doing. If he never deliberately stirred up a crowd,he behaved as if the ordinary African crowd was as controlled andunexcitable as the ordinary British crowd. You will find him, for example,several times saying that there would be no problem if the Nyasaland police would only handle a crowd in the same way as the British police did. Heignored the fact that the problems of crowd control are not at all the same.Thus between the Government and Congress there was a profound difference of attitude. Congress behaved as if Nyasaland was capable of functioningas a democracy in the fullest sense and that the Government was holdingthings back. The Government on the other hand became increasinglyintolerant of any opposition on western and democratic lines because itconsidered it tantamount to the setting up of a rival authority.42. This conflict of thought and feeling between a Government that isstill paternal in outlook and an opposition that is not yet as mature as itbelieves itself to be is no doubt a common feature in the emergence of democracy all over the world. What is peculiar to Nyasaland is that the feelings of anger and bitterness and frustration which this sort of conflictcommonly engenders were largely concentrated on one point, namely the controversy over Federation. We must now consider the nature of this con-troversy, not its merits with whioh we are not concerned, but its extent and its depth so that the part which it played in the disturbances of 1959and the events that led up to them may be rightly understood. To do this we must state shortly the arguments for and against Federation so as toshow the nature of the appeal which they made to their supporters. Theadvantages of Federation were thoroughly, and we believe disinterestedly,examined in the two conferences in 1951 to which we have referred andthey are fully set out in the reports of those bodies. Briefly, the conclusionwhich was arrived at was that the economies of the three territories had become so inter-dependent that closer association between them in thefield of economic planning was essential. This closer association would inevitably lead, it was felt, not only to greater prosperity but to the provisionof better facilities for education, health services and social services generally.The immediate result of Federation to Nyasaland in the economic field hasbeen markedly beneficial. We need not go into financial detail but, puttingit shortly, Nyasaland enjoys what is in effect a cash subsidy from thetwo Rhodesias of  3 millions per annum, which is over a third of its annual expenditure. Without the resources of Federation, the Nyasaland Govern-ment would not be able to provide the services in health and in educationwhich it believes to be essential to the advancement of the African. thus it is held that the end of Federation would inevitably mean a great slowingup in the pace of his advance.
43. Little if any of this is disputed by those who oppose Federation.Their answer is that nothing matters except political freedom. They wantabove all else self-government for the black people in Nyasaland such asthey have seen happening in other parts of Africa. They think that underthe British Government they may eventually get it and that under Federationthey never will. They do not seriously address their minds to the economic problems which will arise if Nyasaland leaves the Federation; they havenot thought out financial plans for making ends meet without the  3 millionsthat comes from Federation. All that will provide for itself when the time comes; and anyway poverty is better than slavery. We do not think itwould be possible to adjudicate between the rival merits of these argumentseven if it were our function to do so. There is nowhere where they canmeet since they do not move on the same plane. We have however hadto consider to what extent the political argument as opposed to the economicis sincerely held. The Governments view is that these nationalist aspirationsare the thoughts of only a small minority of political Africans, mainly of self-seekers who think that their prospects of office will be worse underFederation; and that the great majority of the people are indifferent to theissue. We have not found this to be so. In the first place, we do notthink that all the Congress leaders have more than the usual share of personal ambition ; they are first and foremost fervent African nationalists.Secondly, the issue touches, or appears to touch, the African, whether he iseducated or uneducated, on a point where he is particularly sensitive. Forthe educated African, that point is the feeling that he is looked on as aninferior being and treated at best as a second-class citizen. The partlyeducated, who have been to Southern Rhodesia and to the Union of SouthAfrica as labourers in the way we have described, dislike the ways andattitudes which they have seen there. For the completely uneducated, it is fearfor his land. The land for him is his means of subsistence and his constantsuspicion is that in some way or another the settler Would like to take it away from him. Federation means the domination of Southern Rhodesia ;the domination of Southern Rhodesia means the domination of the settler ; the domination of the settler means the perpetuation of racial inferiority andof the threat to the Africans&apos; land : that is the argument. We have heardintelligent criticisms of Southern Rhodesian policies towards the African.We have not attempted to investigate how far there is any substance in them or how far it is unreasoning prejudice. We have simply endeavoured to ascertain from those of our witnesses whom we felt best knew the african mind what the nature of the difficulty was. Naturally on this pointwe have heard different opinions but it was generally acknowledged that theopposition to Federation was there, that it was deeply rooted and almostuniversally held. We found it to be so. Even amongst the chiefs, manyof whom are loyal to the Government and dislike Congress methods, wehave not heard of a single one who is in favour of Federation. Witnessafter witness appeared before us for the sole purpose of stating that thecause of all the troubles we were investigating was Federation. We heardof course criticism of government action during the disturbances basedon the belief that the Government had shot people without cause; but
instead of this creating a feeling against the British connection, it was allput down to Federation ; very little was said against imperialism. Onecritic of the Government was so little anti-imperialist in his sentiments thathe wound up a denunciation by saying that the Governor was a disgracetp the British Empire. Always Federation was the cause of all the trouble.44. On this issue there is a deep and bitter division of opinion separatingthe Government from the people. It has unfortunately contributed verylargely to a cleavage between the Government and the Church of Scotlandmissions. The Church of Central Africa Presbyterian preaches and practicescomplete equality between the races and many Africans are therefore highin its councils. It does not eschew politics and many of its ministers arealso active members of Congress. On this issue it feels that it is with thepeople and against the Government. The Church believes that it raises amatter of principle touching the dignity of man and therefore refuses to regard the economic argument as conclusive ; it is not as sympathetic as itmight be with the difficulties which its outspokenness can cause to theGovernment. The Government on the other hand feels that it is the dutyof all right thinking men to do their best to remove the African fears of Federation. We have written of intimidation by Congress ; there isno intimidation by the Government but there is a softer pressure thatmakes it very difficult for any European to go against the Government inthis matter. When the question of Federation was first propounded in nyasaland, the District Commissioners were instructed to present it to thechiefs on the footing that the people of Nyasaland must make up their ownminds freely and without influence. This was a sudden departure from thepaternal attitude to all native problems and difficulties which the Governmentordinarily adopted. It left a vacuum which Congress leaders were quick to fill with their own ideas. It is now generally held that in approaching thequestion in this way the Government made a serious mistake. Certainlythere was lost to the Government an advantage which it is now striving by every means to regain. The Government not only believes profoundly thatNyasaland herself needs Federation but it sees beyond Nyasaland to largerissues. It sees the Federation as a great practical experiment in partnership between black and white and believes that its failure might well be disastrousfor the whole of the free world. It is not blind to the gulf that has openedbetween itself and the Nyasas ; and it feels bitterly about those whom itthinks might help to bridge the gulf before time runs out and will not do so.45. The Government says that it cannot and will not go back uponFederation ; it treats the question as one that is no longer open. congress on the other hand believes that in its opposition to Federation it is sup-ported by the whole of African opinion. The frustration which Congressfelt is due to the fact that on this issue chiefly, but on all other issues as well,there is no way in which constitutionally it can make its views effective.In the Legislative Council it is of course constantly outvoted. At the endof a debate on 4th July, 1958 on a motion for restoring the Gomani chieftain-ship, Mr. Chipembere said the result of that debate &quot;justified an extremestand in Nyasaland politics.  Anything like moderation will never get us
anywhere, whether we demand things in strong terms or whether wedemand them in mild language we get nothing ... the only languagewhich British imperialism can understand is the language of extreme conflictand I am glad that that has been proved this morning &quot;. They could make themselves felt only by some form of resistance, and the question wasshaping itself, should resistance be active or passive? The Governmenton the other hand was beginning to find that Congress tactics were alreadycalling its authority in question ; and the issue for it was whether its.authority could be restored within the framework of the existing lawor whether emergency action would be needed. The immediate result of dr. Banda&apos;s arrival was a great acceleration of Congress activities and a consequent increase of alarm on the part of the Government. But even before he arrived the prospect of collision sooner or later was almost certain.
PART IIJULY 1958 TO JANUARY 1959Section 1.  July to November 195846. After you had received in London on 13th June, 1958 the Congressdelegation, Mr. Chipembere returned to Nyasaland, leaving Dr. Banda tofollow in due course. When Mr. Chipembere got back he found great anxietyon the part of Congress to see Dr. Banda and hear what he had to say aboutthe constitutional position, so he telegraphed Dr. Banda asking him to come on29th June. Dr. Banda never answered this telegram and in fact on 29th Junehe was addressing a meeting in London. Nevertheless on that day a crowdof more than 2,500 Africans, including all the Congress notabilities,assembled at Chileka airport to welcome him. Placards were distributeddescribing Dr. Banda as the leader of self-government and the President-General designate of Congress. When the aeroplane arrived without Dr.Banda, the crowd got out of control and many of them rushed on to thetarmac. It was said that there was a plot to kill Dr. Banda ; and it wasrumoured that the Government had withheld a telegram announcing the post-ponement of his return. At the insistence of the crowd Mr. Chipemberewas allowed to search the aeroplane and there were threats to burn it.Congress leaders calmed the crowd and it eventually dispersed on theirpromise to telephone to London. This incident illustrates the sort of difficulties that were in store for the police. On this occasion they did not attempt to restrain the crowd by force ; and Congress leaders thereafterused it to point out the advantages of being allowed to handle the crowdthemselves.47. When Dr. Banda eventually arrived on 6th July, there was asimilar crowd but the proceedings were orderly. Dr. Banda gave an interview to the press and later in the day he made a speech at Soche.He said that his mission was to work towards self-government by negotia-tion. He emphasized that the weapon to be used was not the spear butnegotiation and stressed the necessity for maintaining the tie between theBritish and the African peoples. In the course of the next few days he paid a series of courtesy calls on government officials. The attitude ofthe Government was not at all hostile to Dr. Banda and indeed his presencewas at first welcomed; the Government was, and showed itself to be,genuinely anxious to work with him if that proved to be possible. TheGovernor in particular felt that with someone like Dr. Banda with hismaturity and his intellect there might be a chance of arriving at a corn-promise on the constitutional proposals ; he never quite lost hope that Dr.Banda might be persuaded to compromise. The Governor himself made an excellent impression on Dr. Banda when he met him and one whichhas not been effaced. Dr. Banda declines to believe that the Governorwas himself the author of the White Paper and wished us to assure theGovernor that even now he has nothing against him.48. On 1st August, 1958 Congress held its annual general meeting atNkata Bay.  Dr. Banda was of course elected President-General and on his25
own terms. His terms were that there should be a new constitution whichamong other things gave him the sole power to appoint the other officersof Congress and the members of the executive committee. His choicesrepresented a victory for the left wing which had been responsible forsecuring his return. Mr. Chipembere became treasurer and Mr. Chiumepublicity secretary ; Mr. Chisiza was brought back from England, where hehad gone to begin a university course, in order to fill the office of Secretary-General. Dr. Banda accepts the comment in paragraph 14 of the white paper that &quot; in choosing his colleagues, he ignored the older, moreexperienced and more moderate leaders and took on the younger morevolatile and extreme people.&quot; Dr. Banda&apos;s attitude was that, while he found it necessary from time to time to curb the excesses of youth he was in generalagreement with the attitude and feelings of the young and preferred them as colleagues to the older men whom he thought of as failures. As thefour other members of the executive committee, Dr. Banda appointed Mrs.Chibambo to represent the women whom Dr. Banda was very keen ongetting organized; Mr. Chaluluka, an accountant and nominee of Mr.Chipembere and Mr. Chiume whom they afterwards regretted ; and twoelderly business men, Mr. Makata and Mr. Lubani, whom Dr. Banda- appointed, he said, so as to have a balanced committee. We have no doubtthat the real power on the executive committee was concentrated in thehands of Mr. Chipembere, Mr. Chiume and Mr. Chisiza.49. These proceedings certainly gave strength and encouragement to the extremist elements in Congress. Dr. Banda&apos;s inclination towards thembecame particularly noticeable in one respect. The extremists had always. avoided any form of social contact with Europeans. We do not thinkthat this necessarily means that they had any personal dislike of or hatredfor Europeans, though it ds quite possible that Mr. Chipembere had ; inany party the left wing is apt to suspect, or believe that its supporters would suspect, social favours; at the meeting with the Governor on23 st November, 1957 Mr. Chipembere had made a point that he did not want social equality before political equality was granted. Dr. Bandawould not have thought for a minute that any European was capableof influencing him by social favours, but he may well have thought itdesirable that in this respect he should conform with the others ; at anyrate after this time he was careful to see that he had nothing more thanformal contact with Europeans.50. Dr. Banda was the undisputed leader of Congress. Naturally hewas looked up to as the greatest of Nyasaland&apos;s sons and as one whosegifts made him the equal of the European. But over and above that therehad already been created for him a mystique which raised him far abovethe level of the ordinary leader in the minds of Africans. You have seenhow plans had been made to present him to Nyasaland as a messiah. Wedo not doubt that these had been effectively carried out and the themewas constantly repeated ; even in the Legislative Council on 4th December1958 Mr. Chipembere referred to him as &quot; our Mahatma &quot;, &quot; our Messiah &quot;,&quot; our Saviour &quot;. Dr Banda had come to be regarded as one who woulddeliver Nyasaland from bondage. At all his meetings there were enourmouscrowds and immense enthusiasm. He spoke in English he could not speak
in Chinyanja and everything he said had to be interpreted. That did notdiminish the impact of his oratory ; his speeches were moderate in content buthighly emotional in the way in which they were delivered. We have listenedto the recordings of some of them and they are the speeches of a demagogue.As he wrote in a letter to a friend, he found himself with an unexpectedgift of mob oratory ; he obviously enjoyed the sensation of power over the crowd. In addition to inspiration he gave to Congress after a period ofsquabbling a united leadership. He brought with him some new ideaswhich enlarged the appeal of Congress a women&apos;s league and a youthleague. But he never concerned himself with detailed administration andas time went on he gave less and less time to the party. He had chosenas his lieutenants young vigorous men, whom he considered to be capableadministrators, and he gave them a free hand. There was a great increase in congress membership. In the Northern Province alone the special branchof the police reckoned that, in the six months ending January 1959, thenumber of Congress branches had increased from 37 to 63 and that the active membership, apart from sympathisers, was then about 5,000.51. On 15th August the Governor, who had just returned from leave,issued a statement in which he said (contrary to the forecast which you had made on 13th June) that he had no announcement to make on con-stitutional changes at the present time; he proposed to complete his talks with representatives of political bodies and then to put forward proposals.During the next few months Dr. Banda addressed meetings all over thecountry. We shall consider hereafter the general tenor and effect of his speeches. The first of them to have any particular consequences attributed to it was a speech which he made on 14th September at Fort Johnstonwhere he dealt with the agricultural rules. It is quite clear that he did notincite his audience to break them ; indeed, he said specifically that for thetime being they must be kept. Nevertheless, whether post hoc or propter hoc,there was in the following month a great intensification of the oppositionto the rules in the Fort Johnston district; there was alleged to be intimidate-tion of capitaos and people were reported to be saying that Dr. Bandahad said that the rules no longer applied. Between 4 and 5 aim. on21st October a party of police went to the village of Mputa near FortJohnston in order to arrest a man suspected of intimidation. The villageheadman refused to disclose where the man was, a crowd assembledaround him and he was arrested for obstructing the police. The crowdshouted threats and abuse ; a platoon of the police mobile force (P.M.F.) was called and the crowd was dispersed by means of tear smoke and a batoncharge in which a number of people were struck. Arising out of this thepolice charged 14 persons with taking part in a riot. The hearing of the casebegan at Fort Johnston on 10th November and lasted for nearly a week. Theproceedings attracted a large crowd and at one time on the first day therewere nearly 3,000 people at or around the court. At the end of the hearing the magistrate found charges of riot and proposing violence not proved. He convicted 12 of the 14 of the lesser offence of unlawful assembly ;imposed one sentence of four months&apos; imprisonment, fined three and therest were bound over.27
52. On 24th October a meeting took place at Zomba between Dr. Bandaand Mr. Ingham, the Secretary for African Affairs. Mr. Ingham had been pressing for this for some time ; the statement in paragraph 13 of the white paper that &quot; it was made abundantly clear to him (Dr. Banda) that theGovernment was anxious to discuss all matters he wished in an endeavour to reach satisfactory conclusions &quot; is well justified. When after his arrival in Nyasaland Dr. Banda called on Mr. Ingham, Mr. Inghamasked him if he wanted to discuss anything and Dr. Banda said that he must go about the country first. In October Mr. Ingham took the initiativeagain and asked Dr. Banda to come and have a talk on common problems.Dr. Banda replied that he would rather have a round table conference withall senior officials because as the result of his tour he had some complaint to make against every department. Mr. Ingham said that he would askMr. Youens (then acting Chief Secretary) to arrange this but that he would first like to see Dr. Banda alone. It was in this way that the meeting of24th October was arranged.53. Dr. Banda had not responded to an invitation to lunch and, whenpressed, he declined it. But the discussion was extremely amicable and he put forward his various complaints without any trace of bitterness. Thefirst of them was of the &quot; political injustice &quot; of the representation of the african people by only five members in the legislature and none in theExecutive Council. Dr. Banda said that his study of British colonial policy showed that notwithstanding the declared ultimate aim of self-government for the people of a colonial territory, the bogey of immaturityor the desire to uphold the vested interest of the European always prevaileduntil some great pressure was put on the British Government. He con-ceived his task as being that of organising the people of Nyasaland behindhim to bring about the degree of pressure required to right the basic wrongregarding political rights. He said that bloodshed did not form part ofhis programme. Mr. Ingham pointed out that, notwithstanding the desire of a leader like himself to avoid bloodshed, a mass movement such as hewas endeavouring to organise was liable to get out of hand. Dr. Bandasaid that the Nyasaland people were basically peace-loving and that thatwas most unlikely. Mr. Ingham did not deny the possibility of giving the african a further measure of political power but said that the Governmentwas not prepared to give the measure demanded by Dr. Banda and Congress.Dr. Banda said that of course he had to demand complete political power ;he could not get a following by putting forward a carefully phased plan.He then went on to make a specific complaint about the enforcement ofthe agricultural rules and the Governments attitude towards chiefs. Onthe latter point he said that it was iniquitous of the Government to requireof the chiefs that they should not participate in Congress activities because this was to insulate the natural leaders of the people from national feeling.54. There comes next an incident which, because it was the first ofits kind, has been given an importance which in retrospect appears to be rather exaggerated. In the afternoon of 26th October Dr. Banda addressed a meeting in the Blantyre market square. There was a crowd of nearly3,000. Police were there in force, two parties of 20 men each as well astwo platoons of P.M.F. standing by. The meeting was peaceful and orderly
and Dr. Banda left about 4.30 p.m. The crowd began to disperse and a largenumber, about a thousand, waited for buses at a point known as the ClockTower. They stayed there for some considerable time because it wasSunday and no special transport arrangements had been made. A numberof motorists collected to see what was happening. The crowd was onthe whole good-natured, but there was some jeering at Europeans andAsians, and during a period of about ten minutes just before 5.0 p.m.stones were thrown at cars. There were about a dozen of these incidentsand two women were slightly injured. Unfortunately none of the stonethrowers was identified ; they all disappeared in the crowd and no arrestscould be made. We are satisfied that the offences were committed byhooligans there is a considerable young hooligan element in Blantyre, due partly to unemployment and that they had no political character, exceptthat they were probably committed by youths who had attended the meeting and may have been excited in consequence.55. This affair created a great stir and the police were severely criticised for inaction. The Nyasaland Times reported the incident in luridlanguage. It referred to &quot; mob law&quot;, to &quot; two hours of threateningviolence when no European or Asian was safe to walk the streets or drivepast in a car &quot;, and to Africans &quot; stretching across the road like a blacktidal wave &quot;. An editorial described the incident as &quot; a raw display of racial hatred without parallel in this country&quot; and demanded to knowwhy the Riot Act had not been read and why the P.M.F. was not allowedto break up the ugly mob ; it demanded also that the Government shouldtell the public whether it would continue to permit violence to be used asa political weapon. Dr. Banda in a press interview said that he wassorry about the incident but denied that it had been organised by Congress.The Government, which considered the press comment to be irresponsible,issued a statement of the facts which again was severely criticised in anothereditorial. The paper demanded to know why no arrests had been made and said that the public was entitled to know exactly what security measures were being taken to prevent &quot; this dreadful afternoon&quot; happening again.&quot;If women, of any race, cannot travel around Nyasaland without harm,then we will descend to savagery. The despicable act of injuring thosewomen deserved swift retaliation, without second thought.&quot; We thinkthat the police, and the Government as well, took these criticisms too muchto heart. The task of the police was not at all an easy one. The Africanconstable is not used to handling large crowds in towns. The police officer,who has to take the decision when to intervene, rarely has a sufficientforce present to control a large crowd if it really gets excited. He hasto make up his mind exactly when he should try to nip trouble in thebud. We think that on the next few occasions at Zomba the police, out jof jumpiness, were too quick off the mark.56. On 30th October Dr. Banda went to Zomba to have his first meeting with the Governor. There was a very cordial discussion on constitutional reform. Dr. Banda said that he stood by the Congress proposals, exceptthat he was prepared to modify them by conceding three officials as exofficlo members of the legislature and of the Executive Council. he gave the Governor the impression that he might be prepared to agree on
some modification of universal suffrage. He was willing to have discussions with European politicians and said that he had been waiting to be approached. He told the Governor, as he had previously told Mr. Ingham,that he was not anti-European, that when self-government came Europeanscould continue as they were and that indeed he would try to recruit moreEuropeans for the civil service. The Governor said that he would suggest to European politicians that they should meet him.57. Dr. Banda left Government House in his landrover and on his way back the car was surrounded by a crowd of about three or fourhundred people who had turned out to see him. They blocked the road and the car moved forward slowly with people hanging on to it and others&quot; dancing and cavorting about&quot;, to use the words in the police report,in front of it. The police pulled people away from the landrover, cleared the road in front and told the driver to move on faster. They arrested two men who refused to get away from the vehicle and to leave the scene whentold to do so.58. On 6th November Dr. Banda came to Zomba again for the con-ference which Mr. Youens had arranged with the heads of departments atthe Secretariat. He brought with him Mr. Chipembere and Mr. Chiume.Dr. Banda put forward very forcibly complaints about the enforcement of theagricultural rules and about various incidents that had taken place in schools. One of these latter referred to a case in which the principal ofa school had closed it down because the pupils at a concert had sungan anti-European song; and another to incidents that had occurred becausethe pupils contended that a new master was a member of the special branchof the police who had been sent to spy on them. All these matters were discussed at length with the officials concerned. As the result of what was described as the &quot; disorders &quot; of 30th October, the police had received special instructions for dealing with crowds. Groups of people, about 40 or 50 in number, assembled to see Dr. Banda arrive and depart and as theyassembled were continuously dispersed by the police, who at one stagebrought out their long batons. A number of African civil servants, who,after leaving their offices, had stopped to see the sight were also made todisperse. There were complaints of rough handling, some of which wethink were probably justified ; and there was one assault on a policeman.59. On 10th November the Government issued a public announcementstating that recent incidents, particularly in the Blantyre and Zomba areas,had given rise to considerable public concern. Perpetrators of these incidentswere warned that the Government would stamp out lawlessness and that,in addition to its own police force it had, as the Federal Prime minister had recently observed, the resources of the Federation behind it, of whichit would make the fullest use if the need arose.60. On 21st November there was a meeting in Zomba betweenDr. Banda and Mr. Youens in which they had a very amiable discussionover a cup of tea. Dr. Banda spoke of his admiration for the governor and of his desire to establish friendly relations with him and his advisers,and Mr. Youens said they all shared that desire. The usual questions were discussed, the first of them being the position of the chiefs. Some ofthem had been asked to sign letters in which they acknowledged that it was
their duty to assist the Government and not to take part in opposition togovernment policies. After some discussion Dr. Banda said that he was prepared to accept the desirability of keeping chiefs out of politics butthat the Government must be consistent; District Commissioners should nottell chiefs that they should refuse permission for one particular party to holdmeetings in their area. Mr. Youens said that he did not think that hadbeen done (in this we think he was wrong) but that he would investigate the point. The talk about meetings led Mr. Youens to refer to the stoningincidents after Dr. Banda&apos;s meetings; he was not suggesting, he said,that Dr. Banda instigated them but &quot;they did appear to follow himaround &quot;. In point of fact there had been only two stoning incidents, one atthe Clock Tower and another on 12th October in the Lilongwe district whencrowds dispersing after a meeting had thrown stones at cars belongingto Asians without causing injury. Dr. Banda vigorously denied that theseincidents were any part of his plan ; he said the police were to some extentto blame because they insisted on aggressive demonstrations of their powerwhenever they appeared on the scene ; they should behave more like the&apos; London Bobbie&apos;. Mr. Youens said the police had acted with considerablerestraint and were under heavy pressure from those sections of thecommunity who had suffered from the incidents to adopt a considerablytougher approach. Dr. Banda repeated that he did not like the incidentsand said that if he wanted to promote active opposition it would be of anon-violent character. Mr. Youens suggested that he should make his viewson acts of violent lawlessness generally known amongst his followers. Othertopics were discussed and Dr. Banda said he was anxiously awaiting theproduction of proposals for constitutional reform.61. In December the Legislative Council met and on 2nd DecemberMr. Youens introduced a bill to increase the powers of the police indealing with crowds. He said that it was necessary because of &quot; certaindeplorable and shameful incidents over the past few weeks&quot;. The billconferred the power of regulation and dispersal on junior officers, extendedit to all meetings and assemblies, whether convened or not, and prohibitedthe carrying of weapons at assemblies, meetings and processions which, asthe African minority pointed out, would extend to sticks. Mr. Chipembereopposed the bill, saying that some of the recent events had been grosslyexaggerated and some had been deliberately provoked by the policedispersing innocent people who had only come to see the &quot; leader whom they love so much &quot;. On 4th December an unofficial European membermoved a resolution, which the Government accepted, &quot; that Governmenttake all possible measures to ensure that all persons can at all times movealong the streets and roads of the Protectorate in safety, and not to besubject to threats, intimidation, insulting behaviour and/or violence&quot;. Wehave had evidence from European sources that, beginning about this period,there was a feeling of tension which went on increasing until the emergencywas declared. We have no doubt that Dr. Banda&apos;s arrival, his speeches and the position which had been accorded to him, had stirred up immenseenthusiasm among Africans and also great expectations.   We think
that they were beginning to believe that self-government was imminentand to act accordingly. Putting it one way, they were beginning to show much more independence and less respect; putting it another way, they were behaving insolently. Europeans were beginning to bealarmed and to feel that the situation was getting out of hand. large and demonstrative meetings and concerted acts of hooliganism were newphenomena. The African members of the Legislative Council did not takethe opportunity of the motion on 4th December to denounce hooliganismand lawlessness. Dr. Banda may have condemned it privately, but he didnot accept Mr. Youens&apos; suggestion to make it plain to all his followerswhat he thought about it. It was felt on both sides that something musthappen soon.Section 2. Dr. Banda&apos;s speeches62. On 1st December Dr. Banda left Nyasaland to attend the All-AfricanPeoples&apos; Conference at Accra. By this time he had covered the whole country and spoken at many meetings to large crowds. He had been greetedwith great demonstrations. We shall take as an example of these one which followed a meeting at Mzimba at the end of August and give what is substantially Dr. Banda&apos;s own account of it. After the meeting his carwas pushed a mile and a half or two miles mostly by women who weresinging all the time. Traffic was at a standstill on the main road. Thepeople pushing the car deliberately chose a route which went past theEuropean club, the golf course and the police station, &quot; to show the Europeansthat at least on that Sunday, they were in control of Mzimba. ... I feltsorry for a veterinary surgeon and his wife who met my car coming fromthe other direction. The women ordered him to stop and the poor fellowmeekly obeyed &quot;. At the golf course there was a group of five Europeanswatching the procession in amazement and two African women went up tothem and made grossly insulting gestures before Dr. Banda could intervene.As they passed the police station men and women were threatening to pulldown the Union Jack and Dr. Banda gave orders forbidding it. Dr. Bandadid not permit violence in his presence but there is no doubt at all that,apart from that, he relished this sort of thing very much. He liked it toowhen District Commissioners and police inspectors were made to appear at a disadvantage beside himself not, we think, out of nastiness to them but because it would make them realise what in him they had to reckon with.It showed the Government the popular forces which he had behind him.63. Dr. Banda&apos;s speeches up to the end of November were all verymuch the same in content. The main theme was always anti-Federation.We have indicated some of the other subjects which he covered. Therewas not much reasoning or argument in the speeches; they consistedchiefly of rhetorical and emotional assertions. We have no full report ofwhat he said as we have for most of the speeches he made after his return from Accra. Before then, although the special branch of the police werepresent at all his meetings and made notes of what he said, only summariesnow exist. Dr. Banda has complained with much justification of the way in which his speeches during this period are summarised in the White paper and of the references in paragraphs 12, 14, 15 and 16 of the White Paper tohis attitude towards violence and lawlessness.
Dr. Banda&apos;s speeches64. Paragraph 12 of the White Paper is as follows:  &quot; 12. He then proceeded to make himself known to Africans through-out the country at large public meetings. At these meetings Dr. Bandamade plain his intention of forcing upon the British Government im-mediately and uncompromisingly the Congress aims of African self-government (based on universal suffrage) and secession from theFederation. Indeed, he gave the impression to his audiences in his speeches that it was within his power to obtain self-government now.He promised, at the same time, that the removal of government servants and others loyal to the Government would follow the attain-ment of self-government. This feature of his speeches alone was enoughto encourage lawbreaking and disregard of authority.&quot;Dr. Banda certainly said that he was going to press for self-government andsecession. He said nothing about &quot; forcing&quot; ; on the contrary he saidthat he expected to obtain it by negotiation and by peaceful means. Thereis no evidence that justifies the use of the words &quot; immediately and un-compromisingly&quot;. Nothing that he said was calculated to give the im-pression that it was within his power to obtain self-government now; he did more than once say that he had not brought self-government with him in his bag and that it would have to be striven for. The statement in theWhite Paper that Dr. Banda promised the removal of government servantswhen self-government was attained is based upon a misrepresentation ormisunderstanding of what he said. What he said was that he would removegovernment servants from their positions in the Legislative Council. he wanted the civil service, not of course including the Governor, who would remain as the Queen&apos;s representative, to occupy the same position in nyasaland as they do in all ordinary democracies. He often expressed theview that under self-government they would need civil servants, bothEuropean and African, hut they must not be politicians; there must be no government by civil servants. Finally, we see little justification for thelast sentence in paragraph 12. There was nothing in Dr. Banda&apos;s speechesdesigned to encourage lawbreaking and disregard for authority. We may addtoo that he never spoke at a meeting for which permission had not beengranted ; and that he was scrupulous in his observance of the conditions inthe permit.65. In paragraph 15 of the White Paper it is stated that &quot; Dr. Banda waspublicly threatening members of the police who attended his meetings withvictimisation when self-government was achieved &quot;. We have no doubt that dr. Banda disliked the presence of the police at his meetings. On several occasions he referred to them as &quot; snoopers&quot; and derided their presenceas unnecessary saying that he had told the Government already everything that he was going to say. The audience responded to this by looking at thepolice, jeering at them and making derogatory remarks. There is the evidenceof two special branch reports that on one occasion Dr. Banda threatened to publish the names of the policemen who were present (they were Africans)and that on another occasion he said that they would be deported if self-government came. But special branch reports are not always reliable,particularly when they are summarizing; paragraph 69 contains an example of this. In the later speeches of which we have the full text Dr.Banda always followed any reference he made to the police by telling his
that they were beginning to believe that self-government was imminentand to act accordingly. Putting it one way, they were beginning to show much more independence and less respect; putting it another way, they were behaving insolently. Europeans were beginning to bealarmed and to feel that the situation was getting out of hand. large and demonstrative meetings and concerted acts of hooliganism were newphenomena.

In paragraph 15 of the White Paper it is stated that &quot; Dr. Banda waspublicly threatening members of the police who attended his meetings withvictimisation when self-government was achieved &quot;. We have no doubt that dr. Banda disliked the presence of the police at his meetings. On several occasions he referred to them as &quot; snoopers&quot; and derided their presenceas unnecessary saying that he had told the Government already everything that he was going to say. The audience responded to this by looking at thepolice, jeering at them and making derogatory remarks. There is the evidenceof two special branch reports that on one occasion Dr. Banda threatened to publish the names of the policemen who were present (they were Africans)and that on another occasion he said that they would be deported if self-government came. But special branch reports are not always reliable,particularly when they are summarizing; paragraph 69 contains an example of this. In the later speeches of which we have the full text Dr.Banda always followed any reference he made to the police by telling his
audience that they must not hate the police ; he said that the police were only doing their job and that police would be necessary when self-governmentcame. On any view it is not a fair representation of Dr. Banda&apos;s references to the police as a whole to say simply that he threatened them withvictimisation.66. Paragraph 15 of the White Paper deals also with Dr. Banda&apos;sreferences to the agricultural rules and says that &quot; Dr. Banda said thatwith self-government such irksome legislation would be abolished &quot;. In his evidence before us Dr. Banda insisted that he approved of soil conservationand that he never said that all agricultural legislation should be abolished. Wehave no reason to doubt him. But he did indicate that when self-governmentcame they would make their own laws on this and other matters ; and thereis room for argument whether he said that the laws themselves wereoppressive or merely that their enforcement was oppressive. This sort ofpoint could not be determined without seeing the full text of the speeches and this does not exist.67. In paragraph 16 of the White Paper it is said that Dr. Bandainitiated a policy of inculcating among school children a hatred of Federa-tion. Dr. Banda objected to this statement. Here again we think that it maybe a matter of the very words used. There is no doubt that the policyof Congress as a body is correctly stated in the White Paper. In a debate on this subject in the Legislative Council on 4th December, 1958 Mr.Chipembere said:  &quot; We do not teach children to hate established authority,but we do certainly teach them to hate Federation and we are not ashamed.&quot;Dr. Banda agrees that when he addressed schoolchildren he attacked Federa-tion. Both he and Mr. Chipembere made the same point about this, whichwas that they were only taking counter measures. They said that govern-ment teachers were ordered to praise Federation in the schools and theydrew attention to a letter dated 28th September, 1957 which the Director ofEducation sent to provincial education officers and to the principals of severalschools. This letter stated that the Government was concerned to learn that on occasion government officers had failed to do their utmost to stimu-late confidence in Federation. The letter said that it was the duty of everyofficer to promote great confidence in the Federation and in particular to takethe greatest care that any personal fears or doubts were never publiclyexpressed. We must make it clear that education officers were not singledout for this exhortation. Letters to this effect were addressed to all government servants.68. In paragraph 13 of the White Paper it is said (correctly, as we havealready found) that the Government made it clear to Dr. Banda that theywere anxious to discuss all matters in an endeavour to reach satisfactoryconclusions. The White Paper goes on to say in paragraph 14 that Dr.Banda made it equally clear in his talks with Government officials thathe was not prepared to compromise. This last statement is not^truej Wehave already given instances which show &quot;tMFTJr7^anda&quot;was willing to compromise on details of constitutional reform; and there are others which come later in the narrative. We do not think that this statement inparagraph 14 can have been well considered, since the Governor made itclear to us that to the very end he continued to hope that talks on constitutional reform would be fruitful.
69. Paragraph 16 of the White Paper sets out a passage from a letterwritten by Dr. Banda to a Congress leader. The passage is not correctlyquoted. We set out below the passage as quoted in the White Paperfollowed by the correct text.   The passage as quoted is:  &quot; You have heard about the riots. I have set Blantyre and Zombaon fire, I hope soon to set the whole of Nyasaland on fire.&quot;The correct text is:  &quot; You have heard of the so-called riots. Well things are hot here.I have the whole of Blantyre and Zomba on fire. Very soon, I hope to have the whole of Nyasaland on fire.&quot;The most important of these differences is the omission in the white paper version of the word &quot; so-called &quot;. Without that word the text gives the impression that Dr. Banda approved of rioting; the inclusion of theword shows that he was refusing to treat the disturbances as riots at all.70. The Government first knew of the letter through a report from aninformer who had seen it; and this report contained the version of the relevant paragraph which is set out in the White Paper. Later, beforethe White Paper was written, the Government obtained the original ofthe letter. The two things, the letter and the report, were compared andthe difference between them was not observed. When the White paper was prepared the original letter could not be found-it had been temporarily-arily mislaid -and so the text was taken from the report. The white paper does not give the date of the letter. It is 1st November, 1958. what had happened by that time in Blantyre and Zomba were the stoning of cars in the Clock Tower incident and the &quot; dancing and cavorting &quot; whenon 30th October Dr. Banda left Government House ; neither of theseincidents could be described as riots in any sense of the word. Theexpression &quot; on fire &quot; is one which is repeatedly used by Dr. Banda in his speeches and letters and clearly means no more than that he has kindledgreat enthusiasm.   We attach no significance at all to this letter.71. We have exposed some deficiencies in the White Paper and it is i therefore right that we should remind you that it was prepared in verydifficult circumstances. All those concerned in the administration of nyasaland had during the previous fortnight been through a time of greatstrain and emergency operations were still continuing. The despatch was urgently called for and much that we have dealt with fully had of necessity to be abbreviated.Section 3.  Police and military72. In December 1958 discussions took place between the four Govern-ments within the Federation about the use of their combined resources inthe event of internal disorders. If the scale of the disorders should be beyond the strength of a territorial police force together with such policereinforcements as could toe obtained from other territories, Federaltroops would have to be called in. It was therefore obviously wise todiscuss the pooling of resources generally since it was quite possible thatinternal disorders might be provoked in all three territories at once.When in February 1959 the Nyasaland Government began to makeemergency arrangements, they asked for and received police reinforcements
from Tanganyika as well as from Northern and Southern rhodesia and also considerable aid from Federal troops. This therefore seemsto be a convenient place in our Report Dr. Banda&apos;s quite lengthyabsence in Accra makes a natural break in the narrative at which to describe the composition and organisation of all these forces and to con-sider how far they were satisfactorily equipped and trained to deal withinternal disorders. In the course of our inquiry we heard some criticismson these matters and we shall note below some of the more important onesso that you may have them in mind and consider as you read our reportof what happened how far any criticism is justified.73. The strength of the police force when the emergency was declaredwas 107 Europeans and 1,769 Africans. Virtually all officers of the rank of inspector and over were Europeans ; all sub-inspectors, sergeants andconstables were Africans. The strength of the force represented a ratio ofone policeman to about 1,300 of population ; this is to be contrasted with aratio of one to 700 in Southern Rhodesia and one to 600 in the UnitedKingdom. The Nyasaland police force has been more than doubled since1952 but it is still criticised as being numerically too weak; plans for anincrease in strength were being put into force at the time of the emergency.It is organised in three territorial divisions corresponding to the threeprovinces; and it is divided into three branches the uniformed branchwhose duty it is to police the country and to deal with all ordinary crime,including criminal investigation ; special units, known as the P.M.F. (policemobile force), designed to deal with riots ; and a special branch whosebusiness it is to detect subversion and seditious activities. The composition of the force has been criticised on the ground that the last two branches are too large by comparison with the ordinary police. The fact that theordinary police are too weak to deal with anything but the slightestdisturbance, makes it necessary to rely on the special branch to anticipatetrouble so that a unit of the P.M.F. can be moved to the spot to crush it,whereas prevention at an earlier stage might be better. The uniformedpolice are distributed among the 25 police stations and 21 sub-stationsor police posts throughout the Protectorate. They normally carry shortbatons. Rifles are held at police stations for two-thirds of the strength.The police are trained in their use and may also be issued with longbatons. There is also an issue of metal or wicker shields ; further, somedistrict stations hold stocks of tear smoke. The ordinary police aretherefore trained and equipped to some extent to cope with a crowd butthey are not nearly so highly trained as the P.M.F. This force, which isrecruited from ex-askaris, was instituted because of the disturbances in1953 and held in reserve at police headquarters in Zomba. The P.M.F.is equipped and specially trained to disperse riotous crowds ; it operatesin motorised platoons (sometimes referred to as &quot; riot squads &quot;), 34 strong and including two European officers. A platoon comprises two batonparties each eleven strong, a section of six riflemen, two gunners to fire tearsmoke shells, a first-aid section, and a bugler. All ranks are equipped withgas-masks and steel helmets. Baton parties, in addition to their batonsand shields, carry tear smoke grenades. Platoon commanders are issuedwith Sten sub-machine guns.   By mid-February six P.M.F. platoons were
trained and equipped and a further three, short of officers, were under training. The arrival on loan at the end of the month of 12 inspectorsfrom the Northern Rhodesia police enabled these three platoons to becomeoperational. When the emergency was declared, there were therefore nineNyasaland P.M.F. platoons in the Protectorate.74. The special branch is under an assistant commissioner who hasdirect access to the Governor and provides security intelligence throughoutthe Protectorate. Its total strength in March was 98 of whom eight areEuropeans. In the Northern Province, for example, - the branch was repre-sented by a European inspector, an African sub-inspector and 18 Africanplain-clothes men ; in the Central Province by one European and 22 Africans.Special branch men are stationed about each province in twos and threes ;they are all well-known to the local population. They collect their infor-mation from casual and overt sources, by their own observation, and frompaid informers. These informers appear to be paid regularly rather thanmerely by results. There are not many of them (in one province, for example,fourteen) but much reliance appears to be placed upon their reports.75. In addition to the regular Nyasaland police a force of volunteerspecial constables has been established since 1952. Its European strength in January, 1959 was 629. There was also a small African contingent inthe Southern Province, railway security men given special constable status and some training as special constables. European special constables weresupposed to attend two parades a week and three or four week-end coursesannually at Zomba. They are expected to know their &quot; riot drill&quot;. Magistratesare also empowered to appoint residents in the neighbourhood to act asspecial constables. Many volunteers came forward during the week or sobefore the declaration of the emergency; in Blantyre alone the figuremounted rapidly from 150 to 350. There was very little time to train them;and by the time the emergency was declared the revised handbook forspecial constables had not been delivered from the government printers.76. Since there has been criticism of the composition of the Nyasalandpolice force, you may wish to have some comparison of it in this respectwith police forces in Northern and Southern Rhodesia. We are led tobelieve that although the establishment is bigger and the proportion ofEuropean to African police (1 : 58) is far higher, the organisation of thepolice force in Northern Rhodesia is, in essence, not dissimilar. Its strength is reported to be 4,180 all ranks, including a P.M.F. of 13 platoonswith a total strength of 668, and a special branch totalling 232. in southern Rhodesia, on the other hand, there is neither a P.M.F. nor aspecial branch. There, it is the belief of the British South Africa Police,with a strength of 4,250 (one European to 2-23 Africans) and a record ofnever having killed anyone since their formation in the &apos;90&apos;s, that a P.M.F.is liable to be cut off not only from the rest of the population but also from the rest of the police force itself and that the &quot; riot squad &quot; techniqueis no training for ordinary police duties ; secondly, that a special branch,as &quot; a force within a force &quot; tends to deprive the ordinary police of their normal intelligence&apos; duties as well as, by reporting direct to the Governor,risking sidestepping the overall responsibility of the Commissioner of
Police. Cos &apos;ons, of course, are different. There is a far higher pro-portion of European police and a far larger European population in SouthernRhodesia. Moreover, the special police arrangements in Nyasaland havebeen justified, not only by the particular need in a force deemed inadequate and especially short of European officers, for concentration of effort but also because the loyalty of the ordinary rank and file (especially those youngermen more recently recruited to the police on the strength of passingstandard VI) might not be absolutely guaranteed in a crisis. Perhaps thefundamental difference however may lie not so much in organisation oreven composition as in acceptability. We have not received enough evidence to suggest that the Nyasaland police force, despite the devotion of many ofits officers, has succeeded in making itself a thoroughly acceptable partof the population of the Protectorate with, so to speak, &apos; its feet well underthe table&apos;. The additional police reinforcements which Nyasaland obtained for the emergency were two platoons from Northern Rhodesia, a detachment of B.S.A. police from Southern Rhodesia consisting of a total strengthof about 190 of which one-third was European and two-thirds African,and from Tanganyika a motorised company of two platoons to operate inthe Northern Province.77. There are three regiments in the Federal regular army, the King&apos;sAfrican Rifles, called for short the K.A.R., the Rhodesian African Rifles,called the R.A.R. and the Northern Rhodesia Regiment. These are african troops with European officers. There is also a territorial unit, the RoyalRhodesia Regiment, known as the R.R.R., in which all officers and men areEuropeans. The 2nd battalion K.A.R. is ordinarily stationed in Nyasaland ;it is rather under strength and therefore has only three rifle companies. Inaddition the following Federal troops were brought into Nyasaland for theemergency:  1st Battalion, King&apos;s African Rifles.1st Battalion, Rhodesian African Rifles (the Southern Rhodesian regularAfrican battalion).1st and 2nd Battalions, Royal Rhodesia Regiment.Two independent companies of Europeans undergoing national service training in the Royal Rhodesia Regiment and a company of reservists from the 4th battalion of the same regiment were, inaddition, serving under the officers commanding the 1st and 2ndbattalions.C Company, 1st Battalion, Northern Rhodesia Regiment (the Northern Rhodesian regular African battalion).There were therefore some 3,000 troops, infantry armed with rifles and light machine guns ; the Europeans were in a slight majority, since theirplatoons are larger and, in some instances, they had four of them to a company. All these troops, to a greater or (in the case of the territorials)to a lesser degree, had been trained for internal security operations. Thereare standard drills how they should be deployed in support of the civil power, the formations they should adopt, the sequence, for example, in
which orders should be given. Should the civil authority ask the militaryto take over (the police having failed to achieve their object), a formshould be signed by the civilian, the military platoon halted in the rear of the police, a bugle sounded to attract the crowd&apos;s attention, then a loudhailer used to order the crowd to disperse. During this time the policemight withdraw. Should the crowd remain after this breathing space, abanner should then be displayed with brief instructions to disperse in thevernacular. The crowd still remaining, a sniper (or two snipers) should be ordered to load, to aim kneeling, then to fire (i.e. three separate orders)one round at (to kill, not maim) a selected individual, the ringleader ofthe crowd. Thereafter the crowd still failing to disperse, the forward sectionshould be ordered to load and carry out the same drill as the sniper orsnipers who have by then withdrawn. Should a controlled volley by theleading section fail to stop the crowd and it is &quot; completely out of hand &quot;,the LMGs (Brens) should be brought into action. The purpose is a deliberatesequence carried out &quot; without any sense of vengeance or partisanship&quot;with intervals between eaoh stage to allow a crowd time to begin to leave.The reason why the order is given to kill and not to maim is, first, because tofire into a crowd aiming to wound only creates the risk that the target maybe missed and a less guilty individual hit, and secondly because if theindividual is missed altogether or only slightly wounded, it may be regardedas a sign of impotence which may encourage the crowd. There were very few instances when this prescribed drill was precisely relevant to theconditions of Nyasaland in February and March 1959: perhaps only atLilongwe on 24th February. More frequently, in the absence of police,the troops were called upon to carry out police duties but without either the appropriate equipment or training. Special instructions were issued in the course of operations, enjoining, for example, the disuse of revolversor, in some instances, about the fixing of bayonets or re-emphasising that sub-machine guns should have the change-lever set to &quot; repetition&quot;, i.e. for single shot (as opposed to &quot; automatic,&quot; for firing a burst). A Sten gunis not however, we understand, to be relied upon to fire single shot andnot all formations had yet been re-equipped with the more modern Sterling.78. The Royal Rhodesian Air Force was ready to provide a show of force by Vampires, reconnaissance by Provosts, and long-range reconnaissanceby one Pembroke, leaflet-dropping, troop transport and supply and courierservices. Since the flying life of the ten available Provosts was limited,Beavers and one Cessna 195 were chartered. Dakotas were also emplyed to fly in reinforcements and supplies or to deport detainees. Apart fromflag-showing flights, the only instance of active intervention by the R.R.A.F.which came to our notice was the dropping of tear smoke at Lilongwe on24th February. The Governor forbade the use of any aircraft weapon againstAfrican crowds.79. The Nyasaland police has clear standing orders about dispersingcrowds. Batons may be used only if persuasion fails. Long batons maybe used if the crowd is disorderly and throwing stones (which Nyasasthrow well). &quot; If a disorderly crowd is large and the force available is small in proportion to it, tear smoke grenades may be used . . . beforeresorting to the use of batons.&quot;   In the event of the need to resort to
firearms, police action is to conform to &quot; Instructions to civil officers,military officers and police officers on the use of armed force in caseof civil disturbances &quot; with which all police officers of and above the rank of assistant inspector are supposed to be conversant. This pamphletrecites the law affecting civil disturbance, defines unlawful assembly andriot under section 77 of the Penal Code and the police duties arising,together with the relationship to be observed between the administration(Provincial and District Commissioners), the police and the military in times of civil unrest. Whereas the District Commissioner is requested toattend any possible disturbance, the police officer is solely responsible &quot; forthe execution of operations within the policy laid down by the administra-tive officer &quot; and for the decision whether and when to open fire. (Use ofthe P.M.F. is held to be justified where people are riotously assembled anda reasonable time has elapsed after the reading of the proclamation forthem to disperse. Before the emergency only in most exceptional circum-stances was it considered prudent to employ the P.M.F. earlier.) If andwhen the military commander is requested to take executive action, if heagrees to accept the task and &quot; he cannot be ordered to do anything except by his own military superiors &quot; he &quot; will take complete charge ofthat particular situation until such time as it can be handed back to thepolice.&quot;80. Since the ordinary African policeman is not, like a &apos; LondonBobbie&apos;, trained to &apos; use his loaf&apos;, he has to be given a set drill especially for dealing with crowds to which until recently the Nyasa policeman wasunaccustomed. When he finds his baton insufficient, the P.M.F. maybe summoned and another set drill follows (since it operates as a unit and at its present size is perhaps an unwieldy one): two baton waves(dubiously appropriate in open country), the use of tear smoke (an urbanweapon useful only in a confined space and then only when the windis right) and, possibly, in the last resort, of rifle fire (in this case, todisable not to kill). Similarly, if the P.M.F. prove inadequate, the militarywhen called upon, also have their own set drill. Stress is laid throughoutall these drills upon the minimum use of force. It is clear that an agreedprocedure is necessary to train a disciplined force (especially perhaps inAfrican conditions), but we have heard criticisms. First, the apparent inflexi-bility of the method may make the minimum use of force perhaps the harderto achieve. Secondly, the transfer of responsibility for example, the D.C.,who is familiar with the local situation, handing over to the P.M.F.; or thelocal police to the newly arrived military at a crucial moment brings in anew mind just when everything may depend upon a correct assessment ofthe temper of the crowd and may carry with it the danger that, once theswitch has been pulled, so to say, injury to someone in the crowd is almostinevitable.81. When you read our account of the disturbances you will see thaton a number of occasions the only force available to deal with a crowdwas the military. This was no doubt due to the shortage of police. Butthe whole of the military drill is laid down on the assumption that theywill only be called in as the last resort to deal with a manifestly dangerouscrowd whom the police have failed to disperse. Whereas police may go into a crowd (with a baton charge, for example), it is military doctrine
that soldiers shall stay their distance, not getting physically involved, sinceif a scrimmage begins their firearms may be useless and the military,as the final resort, must not themselves risk being overrun. When policemethods have failed to disperse a crowd, it is probably hostile enough tojustify the use of lethal force ; the same cannot necessarily be said of acrowd that merely fails to keep its distance. For that instance troops knowthemselves to be unsuited.82. There are also three points about the use of weapons which you may wish to bear in mind. First, with regard to the sub-machine gun. Theonly member of the police force who carries this weapon is a platooncommander in the P.M.F. It is also available to military platoon com-manders. You will however read of occasions when other persons, some-times special constables, have this weapon. Clear instructions are given thatit is never to be used on &quot; automatic &quot; unless in a desperate emergency. Aswe have said, the Sten gun although set for single shots, i.e. repetition, mayeasily fire a burst. You will be relieved to know that although the Sten gun isfor this reason an undesirable weapon for use where there are crowds andalthough it seems to have been more generally distributed than it oughtto have been, we have not found any case in which either of these factorswas responsible for additional casualties. Secondly, there seems to have been no general direction as to how special constables should be armed, whetherthey should have firearms and if so what instructions they should begiven about their use. Thirdly, ithere is an elaborate drill for the police in the use of batons. Blows are to be aimed at the collar bones, the armsand the legs and not ordinarily at the head. You may be surprised at thenumber of occasions on which a blow said to be so aimed did in fact strike the .head.Section 4.  Accra Conference and afterwards83. The Accra Conference was held from 5th to 13th December, 1958.That part of its conclusions which may be relevant to the situation in nyasaland is set out in the White Paper paragraph 20 and is as follows :: &quot; That the All-African People&apos;s Conference in Accra declares its full support of all fighters for freedom in Africa, to all those who resort topeaceful means of non-violence and civil disobedience as well as to all those who are compelled to retaliate against violence to attain nationalindependence and freedom for the people.   Where such retaliationbecomes necessary, the Conference condemns all legislations which con-sider those who fight for their independence and freedom as ordinarycriminals.&quot;This resolution represented a compromise. Some delegations wished for amuch less qualified statement of the circumstances in which violence shouldbe used. It is not suggested that Dr. Banda belonged to this group andthere is no evidence that he himself advocated at the conference the useof violence in any circumstances.84. On 22nd December Dr. Banda returned to Nyasaland, after a shortstay in Salisbury during which he addressed a meeting. The public werenot allowed to gather at the airport to meet him or to line the streets;the police pointed out that permission had been given for a public meetingon 28th December at which Dr. Banda could be suitably welcomed.
On 23rd December Dr. Banda gave an interview on television which isnoteworthy in two respects. First, on his attitude to violence. When hesaid he would fight Federation, he was asked, did he mean with violence?He replied : &quot; I mean not with violence but one can&apos;t exclude that if weare not allowed to get out of it&quot;. Secondly, he proclaimed his readiness togo to gaol in such terms as almost to invite arrest. Constantly thereafterhe dwelt on this theme, both in public and in private, saying that he was ready to die, to go to prison, to the Seychelles, to St. Helena or anywhere,that he would fight Federation from prison or the grave. In his speech at Blantyre on 28th December he referred three times to arrest, sayingthat they must all be ready to go to prison in their thousands for the sake of freedom. He made the usual references to the police. Pointing to therecording unit he said:  &quot; Do not look to those people there.  They are not to blame for it.They are civil servants.   They are doing their job.  The people you must blame are the people in Zomba . . . Don&apos;t hate the police. Hatethe Government.   They are the ones I am fighting, not the police.When we get our Government we will have the police, Europeans andAfricans.   So don&apos;t hate the police.   Hate the politicians at Zomba.These politicians who double, politicians as well as civil servants&quot;.He then referred to European civil servants in the same terms as we havealready recorded him as using in private discussion.   He complained of thedelay in announcing constitutional reform and gave no hint of his ownwillingness to compromise, saying that he would not accept any constitution which gave the Governor power to nominate anyone, either to the LegislativeCouncil or to the Executive Council.  The Government contends that onthis point Dr. Banda was speaking with two voices and infers that his offersin private discussion to compromise were not made sincerely.   We do notdraw this inference. We think that many politicians, who are truly preparedto compromise would still think it necessary, until a settlement was actuallysecured, to continue mentioning in public their full demands.   That hethought it necessary to speak to his followers in this way suggests rather that compromise meant a genuine sacrifice.85. On 2nd January Dr. Banda had a long talk with Mr. Youens on constitutional reform. Outspoken hut amiable, Mr. Youens reported; andhe counted six references by Dr. Banda to the likelihood of his imprisonment.On the constitutional question Dr. Banda remained firm on the need foran African majority in the Legislative Council. But he did not regardthat, he said, as the same thing as immediate self-government because heenvisaged that the Governor would have the power to veto any legislation.He gave Mr. Youens the impression that he might also be prepared to agreeto a rather bigger official representation in the Legislative Council. Hesaid too that he would consider some modification to universal adultsuffrage. At the end Mr. Youens said that there seemed to be no pointon which they had been able to reach agreement; Dr. Banda agreed butadded : &quot; Produce your White Paper and the matter can then be discussed further &quot;. Mr. Youens put it to him that he must realize that it was unlikelythat his proposals would be accepted and asked if he intended to organisea boycott of any other proposals; Dr. Banda replied that that would dependon their nature.  He said that he would be prepared to attend a further
discussion with the Governor and Mr. Dixon, one of the leaders of theEuropean unofficials.86. On 12th January in Zomba a group of about 50 people led by aCongress secretary dispersed peaceably at the command of the police. Theyhad been to see their friends in the central prison; and as on their returnthey were compact and walking in close formation and singing in unison,they were considered by the police to he an illegal procession. On 18thJanuary a meeting of the new Women&apos;s League was held in Limbe andaddressed by Dr. Banda. He dealt with the special role of women in themovement; but apart from this he covered only well worn themes theprospect of his own death or imprisonment, not hating the police, theagricultural rules and so on. He spoke as usual of Europeans: &quot;Now insaying all this I do not say that we must hate Europeans or white menat all, they are our friends some of them, and some of them are very good and very nice&quot;. He spoke of his meeting at Salisbury, saying: &quot; I put Salisbury on fire, and I don&apos;t care who knows it. Everybody knowsthat I got Salisbury rocking, rocking, and got it awake out of its politicalsleep &quot;. Men as well as women attended the meeting and youths were muchin evidence. The crowds moving away after the meeting blocked the road and passing cars which were hooting had stones thrown at them. minor damage was done to the coachwork of three cars.87. January 20th was the date fixed for Dr. Banda to go again to Zombato hold his discussions on constitutional reform with the Governor andMr. Dixon. Before Dr. Banda arrived a group of about 40 women &quot; started to gather in an organised manner &quot;, to quote the police report. They wereordered three times to disperse but refused, saying that they were going tothe Secretariat to see Dr. Banda arrive. The police pointed out that permis-sion had been given for a meeting in Zomba later in the afternoon at whichthey could see Dr. Banda. 36 of them were arrested and taken to policeheadquarters. All but four were later released without being charged ; andthe four who were later tried for unlawful assembly were all acquitted.88. The discussion with the Governor and Mr. Dixon on constitutional reform took place on the basis of the Congress proposals. These, youwill recollect, provided for a Legislative Council of 40, of which 32 wereto be elected Africans. Dr. Banda said that he was prepared to reconsider the exact number of African seats but that he could not be shifted fromhis demand for an African majority. The Congress proposals also pro-vided for an Executive Council of nine, consisting of two officials andthe rest elected by the Legislative Council. Dr. Banda was prepared toaccept what was in effect parity on the Executive Council five electedAfricans, three officials, two elected Europeans and the Governor presiding.In response to the objection that in the end the African majority in theLegislative Council would be bound to prevail, Dr. Banda returned tohis idea of the Governors veto. The meeting &apos; talked itself out&apos; withoutreaching any conclusion. At the end of it the Governors own conclusion was that Dr. Banda could not be negotiated with except by concedingan African majority in the legislature ; and that in the Governors view was &quot; a negation of negotiation&quot;. Dr. Banda&apos;s idea of the veto as a means of keeping the African majority under control was not further
discussed. The Governor considers that it would be impracticable to try to govern without a majority in the Legislative Council; and that in thelight of accepted constitutional practice it would be impossible for himto use the veto except on the rarest occasions.89. At the public meeting which followed Dr. Banda began his speechwith a reference to the talks which he had just had. &quot; I know you are anxious to know what was being discussed and what was decided but you must be patient, you must be very very patient. There was no questionof reaching any agreement or iinal agreement on the problem&quot;. Themeeting, he said, was in the nature of an exploration. He describedCongress proposals as being an African majority in the Legislative Counciland the Executive Council. They must have a majority in the LegislativeCouncil because that was where the laws were made. At present therewere stupid laws, such as the agricultural rules ; he believed in good agricultural methods but not in sending people to prison. Another example of a bad law was a law that permitted 50 women, who were only wavingto him in the streets as he passed, to be arrested. No one arrested women in the streets of London for waving to the Royal Family or to Churchill.This sort of thing, he said, might make them angry with the police, butthe people to blame were not the police but those who made the laws.His speech was followed by an intemperate and in parts extremely offensivespeech by Mr. Chipembere. He was afterwards rebuked by Dr. Bandafor the offensive parts; and he told us in his evidence that he regrettedthem but that he had been made extremely angry on hearing about the arrest of the women. His speech, which was short, was entirely devotedto this incident and at the end of it he said:  &quot; If we are men not womenwe must see that the women are released now, this very instant. YourKamuzu, your leaders and I shall see that these women will be released.You too must see that these women are released from police custody today,this very instant&quot;. In consequence of this a crowd of 400 or 500rushed to the police station. They were shouting and waving sticks. Thepolice drew a cordon in front of the station and were heavily stoned.No physical injury was caused but some damage to the surroundingproperty. The DC. arrived and read the Riot Act; and then the P.M.F.went into action and dispersed the crowd with tear smoke and batons.90. Mr. Chipembere told us in evidence that he did not intend to incitethe audience to riot. He said he intended to enforce the release of thewomen by legal means; and that on Dr. Banda&apos;s instructions after he hadfinished his speech he went to telephone to arrange for their legalrepresentation. He denied that he used the words &quot; now, this very instant&quot;,when talking about their release. We are satisfied that he did. The bestaccount of his part in the incident is given in a letter he wrote to Mr.Chiume on 2nd February, 1959* from which we quote: &quot; Now about the Zomba incident: Women Leaguers, under Mrs.Ntenda (Chairman, Zomba) lined along the road to see Dr. Banda* Mr. Chiume left Nyasaland in November on work for Congress and, being out of thecountry on 3rd March, has never returned. We shall in our Report give several extracts from this letter which Mr. Chipembere wrote to him and as you may like to read the letteras a whole we set it out in full in Appendix i of this Report.
pass. They had refused to move when police had tried to dispersethem. After his passing en route to Government House, they formedup and advanced towards Government House, shouting Kwaca, etc.They were stopped by Police and asked whitherto? They said we want to see Dr. Banda immediately he comes out of Government House to hear the results of his talks with the Governor. They were told togo away. Nothing doing! They advanced still. A clash occurred andsome of them were beaten. But no going back. They advanced! Inthe end, the police arrested a few of them. The remainder protested.They began to protest physically and insisted that if some are arrested,then all must be arrested! (Have you ever seen it?) So the Policearrested them 36 in all.When he came out of the Government House (with Karua photograph-ing us with the newly bought Congress Cinema Camera), Nyasulureported to us that over 50 women had been arrested. We were hot red hot.In the meantime, the Local Congress branch had forced the police togive a permit (at 5 hours&apos; notice) for a meeting to be addressed byKamuzu 15 minutes after his return from Government House. Themeeting was held in the open ground in front of the Recreation Hall.It was fireworks pure and simple. Doctor condemned the Governmentlike nobody&apos;s business and announced to the crowd (of no less than6,000) that 50 women had been arrested. Mrs. Chibambo paid tribute to gallant women. I declared that immediate action must be takento save these women. Our speeches at the meeting were tape-recorded.(We spoke into police microphones with a tape connection this hasbecome the rule for all Kamuzu meetings). My part in the Zomba riotis being fully investigated and Nyasulu tells me that there is an arrestwarrant ready for me at the police station -but the hitch? Nobodyis willing to give evidence against me. Even security boys have toldtheir officers that they will have to resign if they are forced to give evidence in court against me. But the arrest warrant has not been withdrawn. As late as the day before yesterday the investigation was still going on apparently there are some stooges who are preparedto face me in court. But the boys here are ready for them, the YouthLeaguers mean real business with such stooges.&quot;The riot on 20th January was the first occasion on which Congress leadersdeliberately stirred up violence. It was not premeditated and there is no evidence that it fitted in with any plan. Between this riot and those thatfollowed there was a very important meeting of Congress with which wemust now deal.
PART IIIJANUARY AND FEBRUARY, 1959Section 1.  Emergency conference91. We have said already that by the middle of 1958 the congress leaders were suffering from a feeling of frustration. Their continued protestsagainst Federation were falling on deaf ears and the Government had made it pretty clear that they were not likely to make much headway with their demand for an African majority. Naturally they must have been con-sidering what alternatives there were to negotiation. You will remember that, before the disturbances in 1953, Congress had passed a resolution infavour of non-cooperation and passive resistance. After the failure of itscampaign passive resistance had been abandoned but it had been discussedagain from time to time at Congress meetings. In particular it was being discussed during 1958 by those who mattered in Congress both before andafter Dr. Banda&apos;s return in July. No formal resolution was offered in theexecutive committee but discussions showed that all the members werein favour of some form of non-cooperation if by negotiation Congresscould not obtain the African majority in the Legislative Council which they felt was necessary before the 1960 review. Dr. Banda himself spoke of a movement of non-cooperation which would paralyse the Government.Economic sanctions was another term which was used ; and in particular Mr.Chaluluka you will see in the course of the next few paragraphs why wesingle out his name had spoken strongly in favour of it.92. Non-cooperation is a rather nebulous term but we were told clearlyenough what it was intended to embrace. It meant first of all that therewould be no cooperation in the machinery of government, that is, noparticipation in elections for the Legislative Council if the new proposals were unsatisfactory, and no African membership of district councils. Itcovered strikes and boycotting of European and Indian stores, refusing to buy goods there or to sell goods to Europeans and Indians. It includednon-payment of taxes. Apart from non-payment of taxes, it did not extend to any other breach of the law; in particular, we were told clearly, it didnot extend to holding meetings without permission. It did not of courseextend to any form of sabotage or damage to property or to any form of physical injury. In theory it is perfectly easy to draw a line betweenviolence and non-violence; it is not so easy to draw the line in action.What is to happen, for example, if the Government seizes and distrainsgoods for non-payment of taxes or if it arrests and imprisons defaulters?Non-cooperation presumably requires that government action of this sortshould be meekly accepted. The debate at Accra and the form of resolution which was eventually agreed upon illustrates the difficulty of finding asatisfactory formula about this. The test comes at the time of arrest:will the non-cooperator accept it and go to prison or will he resist? Hereinpresumably lies the difference between active and passive resistance and you will find that when the subsequent disturbances began there were personsin both categories.
93. The Governor had said (see paragraph 29) that by early in 1959he expected to announce the new constitutional proposals. By the beginningof 1959 therefore it was plain that Congress must anticipate that its demandswould probably be rejected and must come to some decision about its future course of action. We do not think that it is a pure coincidence that, at thebeginning of January on his return from Accra, Dr. Banda began to talkso insistently about the prospect of his arrest. The dynamic approach whichhe had made could not be allowed to peter out; and if he was going tofollow the way of Gandhi the sooner the matter was brought to a head byhis arrest the better. But to the younger men, like Mr. Chipembere andMr. Chisiza, there must have been the counter-attraction of violent policies which might well appear to them to have brought in other countries muchquicker results than gandhis methods. We are satisfied (the grounds forour conclusion will appear as we go on with the narrative) that by thebeginning of 1959 the extremists had made up their minds that they would get Congress to adopt a policy of violence.94. It has been suggested to us that one of the factors driving them toextremes (whether the extremes were violent or non-violent) was the Govern-ment&apos;s delay in announcing its proposals for constitutional reform. Wehave given you details already of the discussions which had taken place.Congress had put forward their proposals in the second half of 1957 and theGovernor had neither accepted nor rejected them; he had said that he mustconsult other bodies. It is contended that he had ample time long beforethe end of 1958 within which to consult other bodies and that he was simplyprocrastinating. On his behalf it was pointed out to us that the reformscould not come into force until early in 1960, that Congress had startedoff with proposals that were so unacceptable as to make compromise difficult and that the best hope of a solution lay in trying not to bring matters to ahead until, over a period of time, Congress could be got to modify itsdemands. There is obviously good sense in this attitude but two points were made against it. First, it was pointed out to us that when theGovernor in paragraph 4 of the White Paper dealt with the constitutionaldiscussions which were going on in 1958, he said that he knew that youshared his view &quot; that the best prospect of improving the uneasy situationin the territory lay in attempting to bring such discussions at the earliestpossible moment to a conclusion which might be acceptable to all concerned &quot;.This shows, it is said, that the Governor realized the anxieties which congress were feeling on this point and yet was doing nothing to meet them; heon the other hand would no doubt draw our attention to the phrase &quot; accept-able to all concerned&quot;. The other criticism is that on this point theGovernor and yourself were speaking with two voices. He told Congressthey could expect nothing before early 1959 and you led them to believethat some announcement would be made in or soon after August, 1958. How-ever this may be, we do not think that the delay was a factor of any great weight in the deliberations of Congress. Whatever may have been said in public, the Governor had made his position perfectly clear in private discus-sions. At one of these discussions Mr. Chiume told us that Congress had referred ito a demand by Europeans that no constitutional changes should bebrought about until after the 1960 review and that the Governor had saiddefinitely that he would not accept that.   The truth, we think, is that the
Congress leaders, certainly the extremists, had practically given up hope that anything satisfactory to them would come out of any more constitutionaltalks; if they had believed that it would, we cannot think that just beforethe talks were coming to maturity, they would have abandoned the way of peaceful negotiation.95. At the beginning of January Mr. Chisiza approached Dr. Bandawith the suggestion that an emergency conference consisting of delegates from each branch, the chairman and secretary if available, should becalled in Blantyre. In this connotation the word &quot; emergency &quot; does not mean more than &quot; extraordinary &quot; in contrast to &quot; annual&quot; ; an emergencyconference had been held in January 1958. Mr. Chisiza gave two reasons.The first was that men like Wellington Chirwa, the Federal M.P., had beencriticising Dr. Banda&apos;s policies and questioning his popularity and so it was desirable there should be a vote of confidence in his leadership. The otherwas the raising of more money. It was expected that Congress would shortly be banned in Southern Rhodesia and that that would interfere with the flow of subscriptions from Nyasas in Southern Rhodesia which was saidto be considerable, so fresh ways of raising money must be considered and enthusiasm engendered. We need not enquire into the genuineness ofthese reasons. It may be doubtful if anyone in Congress really thoughtthat a vote of confidence in Dr. Banda was necessary; on the other hand,there is no doubt that when the conference met finance was discussed.We are satisfied that they were not the only reasons. Dr. Banda agreed with the proposal for the conference and accordingly notices were sent outsummoning the delegates for Saturday and Sunday, 24th and 25th January.It was not intended that Dr. Banda himself should take any part in theconference except that on the Saturday afternoon he would make a speech to the delegates and obtain his vote of confidence. This was in accordancewith his usual policy.96. It is convenient at this point to say something more about the relationship between Dr. Banda and his three lieutenants. Dr. Bandais not one of those leaders to whom the cause is everything andnothing else matters at all. He had come to Nyasaland after muchhesitation and largely as a matter of duty. In the first three or four months he had done some very hard work touring the country. after that at the beginning of November he settled down to start a medical practice. His house and surgery were at Limbe but they were some distanceapart, and his work at the surgery kept him very busy ; after November,he found time for speechmaking only at week-ends. Moreover, he had little inclination for detailed work and he rarely, if ever, presided atbusiness meetings, even those of his Cabinet, as they called it. It may be,though he did not tell us so, that his inability to speak in the vernacularpartly accounted for his abstention at any rate from the general meetings.Inevitably the control of Congress passed into the hands of those who were willing to do the detailed work. To some extent this is what Dr. Bandawanted ; we think that he was quite genuine in his view that he believed inthe young and wanted them to be-trained for the future. No doubt hethought they would refer to him everything that mattered and to allappearances they did so.   Dr. Banda&apos;s reception in Nyasaland and the
reverence and adulation with which he was treated everywhere he wentwas enough to turn the head of even the most modest man and Dr. Bandais not that; it would not have crossed his mind that even his unexpressedwish was not law. But in fact his three lieutenants were all men withminds and ambitions of their own. There is evidence that when he treatedthem in public as subordinates, they did not like it. In all probabilitythey saw no necessity to tell Dr. Banda everything that was going on;they probably only consulted him when they wanted, for some specificpurpose, to invoke his authority and before they did so they probably madesure that the decision would be the one they wanted ; for Dr. Banda is a jman who is susceptible to flattery.97. On 22nd January there was a meeting of the executive committeein the house of Mr. Makata who in the absence of Dr. Banda was to takethe chair at the conference. In the evening of 23rd January Dr. Bandareceived at his house the delegates who had already arrived for the meetingthe next day. After that there was another meeting of the executivecommittee at Dr. Banda&apos;s house. Dr. Banda was not present at either ofthese meetings when the agenda for the conference was discussed. Wewere told that in addition to questions of finance and organisation thediscussion turned on what answer the committee should give if they were asked what was to happen in the event of the Government^ constitutional proposals being unsatisfactory. We were told that there was also discussion about what should be done if Dr. Banda was arrested and that what wasdecided upon in either contingency was non-cooperation. Mr. Chipemberewrote to Mr. Chiume about these meetings and in particular about thepart played in them by Mr. Chaluluka. &quot; He misbehaved at the mostcrucial moment. As soon as we began discussions on the secret items tobe presented to Conference, Bwana Chaluluka began to falter. Hisparticipation in the discussions became scantier and scantier, and hisexpressions of opinion more and more non-committal. He then decidedto absent himself from the final meeting of the Central Body &quot; (i.e. theexecutive committee or Cabinet) &quot; and ended by staying away from thefirst half of the Secret Session of the conference &quot;. Now there was nothingabout non-cooperation that would have upset Mr. Chaluluka. As we have said, it had already been generally agreed upon and, so Mr. Chiume told us,Mr. Chaluluka had been a strong supporter of it. We are satisfied thatlsomething more potent than non-cooperation would be needed to makejMr. Chaluluka falter and misbehave. Incidentally, the fate of Mr. Chaluluka Iaffords an interesting illustration of the way in which things were thenbeing done by Mr. Chipembere and Mr. Chisiza. On 25th January the con-ference ordered that Mr. Chaluluka should immediately be thrown out of thecentral body and, Mr. Chipembere said in his letter to Mr. Chiume, &quot; thishas been duly done&quot; ; this was done without the matter even beingmentioned to Dr. Banda whose appointee Mr. Chaluluka was supposed to be.98. The proceedings on the Saturday and Sunday fall into three parts.There was first on the Saturday morning a meeting at the Mikeka Hotel atLimbe at which routine matters of organisation were discussed. Then inthe afternoon there was the meeting addressed by Dr. Banda at Ndirande.Then on Sunday there was a meeting in the open at a place in the bush a
little way out of Limbe. This meeting began in the morning and went onuntil it started raining in the afternoon. The proceedings at the first and third meetings were secret but that does not necessarily mean that therewas anything sinister about them ; they were private meetings of officials in which organisation and policy - were being discussed ; great care wastaken to see that no unauthorised person was present. There was nothingsecret about the place of the meetings and the fact that the third meeting was in the bush is no evidence of a conspiracy. The fact that an emergencyconference of delegates was being held on the Saturday and Sunday waswell known to the police ; they had been asked for and had eventuallyrefused permission (there was a controversy about the timing and termsof the application which we need not go into) for the meeting on Saturdayafternoon to be public. Congress had failed to secure (they attributed theirfailure to the ill-will of the police) the hall they wanted for the privatemeetings on Saturday morning and Sunday. They had met on Saturday morning in a room in a hotel which we have seen and which was obviouslyfar too small and so on Sunday as they wanted more space, they chose a place in the open. They went there, about 200 of them, in cars andlorries, in a body and without concealment.99. After the customary prayer the meeting in the bush on Sunday beganwith a resumption of the discussion on matters of finance and organisation which had been left unfinished on the Saturday morning. As to what was discussed and decided after that there is an acute conflict of evidence. It is common ground that the possibility of the Governments constitutional pro-posals being unsatisfactory and the possibility of Dr. Banda&apos;s arrest were both considered and that there was discussion about what should be done in either of these events ; one set of witnesses said that what was decided wasthat there should be non-cooperation but that violence was not even men-tioned ; another set said that every form of violence was discussed fromsabotage to murder. Most of the evidence on either side is of doubtful value ;at a later stage in this report we shall attempt to analyse it. There doesnot emerge from it, or from so much of it as is at all acceptable, anyfull and coherent account of what was discussed and decided. on many topics it is probable that no clear line was drawn between discussion and decision. It is not suggested by anyone that any resolutions were put to the meeting. In the end we have thought it safe to conclude thatgeneral decisions were taken on four matters. First, it was clearly decidedi that Mr. Y. K. Chisiza (the brother of Mr. D. K. Chisiza, the Secretary-General) should be appointed as private secretary and as a sort of bodyguardto Dr. Banda. This followed upon talk that Dr. Banda&apos;s life had beenthreatened, which may well have been introduced so as to lead up to pro-posals for a black list and for violence generally. Secondly, it was decidedthat the Secretary-General was to keep a black list of &quot; stooges and marquis-lings &quot; headed by Mr. Chirwa and that branches were to write up and proposeadditional names. The black list was for Africans, not Europeans, andwas-to consist very largely of chiefs who refused permission for meetings.I We do not think it was at all clearly decided what was to be done withi people on the black list; suggestions varied from deportation when self-i government came to killing.   Thirdly, approval was given to a policy of
sabotage cutting of telephone wires, blocking of roads, destruction of Ibridges and the like and of defiance, such as holding meetings withoutasking permission. Fourthly, there was general approval of a policy of resisting with violence attempts to enforce unpopular laws, and attempts to arrest those who broke them ; most of the disturbances which we shallhave to consider in fact arose in this way. These policies were not tobe to the exclusion of non-violent methods but rather as an extension ofthem; non-cooperation, boycotts and strikes were all generally approvedof as well. The alternative of submission to arrest v/as not ruled out andthere was discussion about engaging counsel from Britain to representDr. Banda or other leaders who might be arrested.100. We do not doubt that there was also a great deal of talk aboutbeating and killing without any dividing line being drawn. Many men talkviolently in order &quot; to show spirit&quot;, as one witness put it. If murder wastalked of, as it may well have been, certainly no clear decision was takenabout the circumstances in which it was to be committed ; and you will hearthat although after 3rd March opportunities presented themselves in which both Africans and Europeans might have been killed, no murder was evercommitted. We have a document, which we reproduce in Appendix II to thisReport, which we think gives as good an impression as can be got of whatwent on at this meeting. The document consists of notes of items whichwere either discussed or decided upon and it was probably prepared sometime after the meeting, since delegates were warned against taking notesat the time. The notes reflect the confused impression of the whole whichprobably most delegates took away with them. There is an item:-&quot; Hit Europeans or cut throat&quot; ; but there is also an item that if a person is arrested because of Congress the case must be taken to &quot; seniorEuropeans&quot;, which presumably means the High Court or such of themwhose throats had not been cut. There is an item about what is to bedone if Dr. Banda is arrested ; and also a note that African police shouldnot wear puttees. The meeting was conducted in Chinyanja with interpre-tations into Tumbuka and it is very likely that at times several people were speaking- and that there was discussion among groups. We have tried to make what we think the effect of it was as intelligible as we can;but because we have tried to summarize it in four points, it must not bethought that anything at the meeting was neatly tabulated. Perhaps theeffect of it all can best be summed up by saying that there was to be fan all-out campaign to defy the Government, violence not excluded. When iwould the violence begin, how far would it go and what form exactlywould it take? The only answer is that it would depend on what happened. &apos;If it started in some places and was not checked, it would certainly havespread and might have gone very far; that was the real danger in the isituation.101. The meeting of the delegates naturally caused a good deal of ex-citement and interest in Blantyre and Limbe. On the Saturday evening acrowd assembled and groups of youths behaved boisterously jumping out into the road and interfering with traffic; they were dispersed without incident. On the Sunday afternoon a larger crowd of about two or three
hundred assembled outside the Ndirande Welfare Hall where it may bethey thought that the delegates were meeting. Small stones and gravel werethrown at passing cars. Two platoons of P.M.F. were called out and the crowd was ordered to disperse. It did not do so until it was dispersed by abaton charge, 21 arrests being made.102. No report was ever made to Dr. Banda of what was discussed ordecided at the conference. We were told that all the decisions were subjectto his approval and could not be effective without it. One would havesupposed that decisions to adopt non-cooperation and to expel Mr. Chalulukawould be sufficiently important to make it desirable to seek Dr. Banda&apos;approval at the earliest opportunity. As to that, we were told that it hadbeen decided that members of the committee should not discuss thesematters with Dr. Banda individually but that it must be done at a meetingof the committee as a whole. We were given no reason why the committeeshould not see Dr. Banda that evening or the next morning except thatthere was a dance for the delegates in the evening. After that, we were told that the engagements of various members made it impossible for the com-mittee to meet again for another six weeks ; before the six weeks had elapsed the emergency was declared. We were therefore invited to believethat between 25th January and 3rd March neither Mr. Chipemberenor any other member of the committee mentioned to Dr. Banda thedecisions taken although there was nothing in them that they wished to conceal. We found this all the more surprising since between 25thJanuary and 3rd March meetings of branch committees were takingplace all over the country at which the delegates were reporting what had gone on at the emergency conference. Here again we do not think that theevidence is sufficiently reliable to enable us to give an accurate accountof what went on at any one of these meetings. We have seen a letter dated3rd February from the secretary of a branch to his chairman. &quot; Things are getting hotter every day. The results of the last conference was done in themost secret manner that even the delegates find it very difficult to explainthey were not allowed to take notes anyone taking notes was beaten.&quot;We think it likely that there was a great deal of confusion in the reportingand that many different versions were current. It seems clear that at manyof the meetings there was opposition to the new policy but we have noreport of any meeting at which it was rejected. One very important meeting was held on 22nd February at Ndirande of the southern provincialcommittee of the Congress, of which there were about 70 members. Mr.Chipembere was there in order to ensure that the provincial chairman wasreplaced by a nominee of his own. At this meeting there was considerable opposition to the use of violence. No vote was taken, but there were thought to be more in favour of violence than against it.103. Notwithstanding the efforts that were made by Congress leaders tokeep their plan strictly secret, it is likely that rumours were spreading amongAfricans that something was afoot. It is also likely that rumour con-centraited on the more dramatic parts of the discussion and that the killingof Europeans was talked about. Several European witnesses testified totheir increased feeling of tension by the beginning of February. We havebeen told also of sinister enquiries being made about the habits of
Europeans ; with all the talk that there had been on 25th January it iscertainly conceivable that some Africans were thinking about murder. Butin most cases we think that it was the feeling of tension itself which caused a sinister construction to be put on innocent enquiries. Among the europeans there was a growing feeling that something must be done andthere was talk of a showdown. Dr. Banda refers to that in his letter of21st February to the Governor (see paragraph 143). We doubt whetherthis had much effeot on the Government. We think that by this timesome such talk was to be expected and it does not lead us to think thatEuropeans were not fundamentally on the defensive. It is not unnaturalthat they should react in that way whenever there is any real suspicion thatthe African may resort to violence ; they are a tiny minority in the countryand their safety depends on their striking first, for if the African populationonce got out of control, there is not in the country any force that couldcontain it.104. The general feeling in the administration at this time can best be illustrated by the comment made by a Provincial Commissioner on a speechby Dr. Banda at Dedza on 1st February. There was nothing new in thesubstance of this speech and, apart possibly from the reference to DistrictCommissioners mentioned in paragraph 33 there was no observation thatwas any more provocative than anything so far recorded. At the end of his speech, Dr. Banda made the only reference we know of to the behaviour of crowds after a meeting, saying: &quot;When you leave here this afternoon,behave like ladies and gentlemen so that the police will know that we area disciplined organisation&quot;. The Provincial Commissioner afterwardslistened to the recording of his speech. He regarded the whole tone of the speech and the manner in which it was delivered as &quot; flagrantly and in-flammably directed to undermining constituted authority and the forces oflaw and order &quot; ; he referred to the dangerous effect many of the utteranceswould have on an unsophisticated audience of close on 6,000 Africans. Inconclusion he wrote in his report to Zomba:  &quot; If Banda and his leadinghenchmen are to be allowed to hold mass meetings on these lines throughoutthe country and with seeming impunity for very much longer, then I am quite certain, as I am sure you are, that the consequences will be of the gravest&quot;. You will appreciate that at the time this was written nothing was yet known about any plot or plan for violence and the most seriousriot so far had been on 20th January outside the prison after the arrest ofthe Zomba women. There was nothing seditious in the speech. The worstthat can be said of it is that it was Hyde Park oratory. The conclusionwe have just quoted reached by a sober and experienced administrator shows that the maintenance of law and order in an African colony maypresent very different problems from those which arise in Britain.105. Before dealing separately with the incidents that occurred after25th January and examining them in order to see to what extent they suggest the execution of a plan that was then decided upon, it is convenient todeal en bloc with two categories of events that it would be tedious to itemisechronologically. First, during this period a greatly increased number of meetings were held without asking for permission enough, we think, tosuggest the execution of a deliberate policy. There is a letter (undated,but it must have been written in the third week of February) from a branch
chairman of the Women&apos;s League to Mrs. Chibambo, in which the writersaid that they had started convening meetings without a permit and had decided to hold meetings every seven days. The agenda for the southernprovincial meeting on 22nd February (see paragraph 102) contained theitem: &quot;Holding meetings without permission. Unlawful assembly&quot;.Secondly, we are satisfied that during this period the branches were sendingup suggestions for the black list. When the Congress headquarters weresearched after 3rd March, four letters of this sort were found. Oneletter asks that the name of a certain chief should be put on the list, givingas reasons that he supports agriculture, that he speaks scornfully of Dr.Banda and that he disallows small meetings. There is only one of these documents that throws any light on what is to happen to persons on the black list; this says that the bad chiefs are to be pensioned when inde-pendence comes. We saw the writer of another letter who recommendedthat the name of a chief should be put on the black list; he admitted thathe had written it and told us that he understood that chiefs on the blacklist would be deposed when self-government came. As two of these letterswere addressed to Mr. D. K. Chisiza, Secretary-General, and as Mr. Chisizahad denied all knowledge of the existence of any black list, we enquiredfrom him about them. He said that he had never seen the letters, that hehad been away for the last fortnight of February, and that while he wasaway his letters had been opened by Mr. Chipembere. Mr. Chipembere didnot know anything about black lists either. Mr. Chisiza said that whenhe returned to the office there was a small pile of unopened letters and hesuggested ithat the black list letters might have been among them. He saidthat on the Sunday and the Monday in which he was working in the officebefore he was arrested he had only time to go through the opened letters and no time to deal with the unopened ones; we did not believe this. two other documents were found which corroborated the existence of a blacklist. A branch chairman on arrest was found to have in his possession anotebook with a list of three names in it in his writing under the heading&quot; stooges&quot; ; he explained to us without its carrying conviction that under this heading he had put the name of some good men who supportedCongress. In a house that was searched there was found a paper headed&quot; To be put in black list&quot; with the name of a branch filled in and threespaces for names of individuals left blank.Section 2.  Karonga : 8th-19th February106. We have said that it is difficult to estimate the extent to which thenew policy had caught on. All the reports of branch meetings are of talk,not of decisions. It is probable that opponents of the policy would be lessvocal than its supporters and that the half-hearted would keep silent.Probably its reception varied greatly according to local feeling and thepersonalities of the branch leaders. Enthusiasm for Congress was strongestin the Northern Province. It was here also that the Government was most vulnerable; the ordinary police force was small, there was noplatoon of P.M.F. stationed in the province and communications were difficult. The policy of violence decided upon in January was moreeagerly accepted and more successfully acted upon in this province
than in any other. The story begins on 8th February when a smallpolice force found that a public meeting was being held by Congresswithout permission in a village in the Karonga district. Permission tohold meetings had in the past been readily granted and no action had yetbeen taken in the province against an illegal meeting. This meeting wasbeing held near a main road in a conspicuous place and the police believedthat it was being held as an act of deliberate defiance. They took state-ments from persons present and later decided to arrest the two men whom they believed to be the ringleaders. They effected the arrest on 11thFebruary. The men resisted arrest violently and when brought beforethe A.D.C. the next day refused to give their names and addresses or anyother information to the court; they did not ask for bail and wereremanded in custody. On 14th February some Congress leaders in Karongacame to see the A.D.C. and asked that the accused should be given bail; theA.D.C. refused to do so and gave as his reason the conduct of the men onarrest and in court.107. On the afternoon of 15th February a private meeting which didnot require permission was being held in a hall in Karonga. The assemblymoved into the market place and began to conduct itself as a publicmeeting. When the D.C. came on the scene there were between 250 and300 persons being addressed by a Mr. Kanyanya. The D.C., who was accompanied by the A.D.C. and the sub-inspector, told Mr. Kanyanyathat the meeting was illegal and must be dispersed. Mr. Kanyanya said he did not see why he should have to get permission for a meeting ; this was his own country and he could do what he liked. The D.C. requested Mr.Kanyanya and three other men who seemed to be leaders in the crowdto come to the police station. A clamouring broke out but Mr. Kanyanyaexhorted the crowd not to get excited and to follow them on foot to thepolice station. The four men made no attempt to resist arrest and gotquietly into the D.C.&apos;s car. Many of the crowd shouted that they wanted togo to prison too. The D.C. drove his car a mile out of Karonga in thehope that by the time he got to the police station the crowd would havecooled down. But when he arrived there the crowd, which was nowassembled outside the prison, moved over to the police station and tried toenter the charge-room while the accused were being charged. They thenthrew stones at the station breaking about a dozen windows; they brokealso the windows of the D.C.&apos;s car outside the station and ripped the flagoff the bonnet. There were only six policemen at the station ; the D.C.decided that this was an insufficient force to control the crowd and that theonly thing he could do was to release the accused. The crowd then dis-persed immediately. It was found afterwards that on their way to the prison from the market place they had gone across the airfield, which is prohibited to the public, and done some wanton damage to the shelter.They showed no hostility to the D.C. personally and gave him the impression that they were anxious not to attack Europeans ; as he said, nothing could have prevented them at any time from lynching himself and the A.D.C.But he thought that they were in a mood to do considerable damage to property if they had not got their way.
108. The police force in the province was not large enough to supplyany very substantial reinforcements for Karonga. Arrangements were putin train for getting assistance from Tanganyika over the border and mean-while 13 constables from Mzuzu and Rumpi were sent to Karonga.Thus on 19th February the D.C. had a force of about 20 police. Onthat day a crowd of 600 or more assembled in the market place and began to hold a public meeting for which they had not asked permission. TheD.C. went down with his whole force of police, read the Riot Act and gave them ten minutes within which to disperse. Part of the crowdremained where it was and threw stones at the police, who used tear smokeineffectively. Another part moved off towards the airfield and the D.C.,with his African District Assistant, tried to intercept them. The DistrictAssistant stumbled and was attacked with sticks and received a scalpwound bad enough to be stitched. This part of the crowd then went onto the airfield where they did considerable damage. Another part madefor the prison where they broke down the doors, beat and injured threewarders, one of whom had to be sent to hospital, and released 13prisoners. They then made their way to the police lines, where they didconsiderable damage, including serious damage to the inspectors car.The wives of the policemen had taken refuge in the house of one of them.The house was broken into and the women were struck with sticks. one man made as if to stab a child with a knife, saying that it would onlygrow up to be a policeman; the mother put up her hand to stop him and was cut between the fingers with a wound which needed seven stitches.At that moment the crowd heard a vehicle coming and they all ranaway. These two successes on the 15th and 19th aroused great enthusiasmfor Congress. A Mr. Nkata, a Congress member sent from Blantyre whovisited Karonga on 24th February, reported: &quot; Spirit of Nationalismnow high, more cards wanted.&quot; This incident is referred to in paragraph 26of the White Paper where it is said that it followed the arrival of twoCongress emissaries from Blantyre. We have had no evidence about theseemissaries and seen nothing to suggest that the trouble was instigated fromBlantyre.Section 3.  Fort Hill: 20th February109. The next event occurred at Fort Hill, a place in the Karongadistrict about 60 miles from the town of Karonga. It consists mainly ofan airfield which belongs to W.N.L.A. (Wenela), an organisation whichrecruits Nyasa workers for work in the Union of South Africa. There is an african trading centre near the airfield. The total population is about 200and there were only three Europeans, Mr. James, the Wenela manager, his wife and an assistant. On 18th February a Congress meeting was held atFort Hill at which the achievements of the 15th in Karonga were discussed and ways of helping considered.110. The Provincial Commissioner went to Karonga on the evening of the 19th and while he was there arranged for a platoon of P.M.F. tocome up by air from Blantyre. The airfield at Karonga is not large enoughto take a troop-carrying aeroplane so the platoon was to go to Fort Hilland from there to Karonga by lorry. At 8 a.m. on the 20th the Provincial
Commissioner telephoned from Karonga to Mr. James at Fort Hill. he told him that the P.M.F. would be arriving at the airfield and asked himto get in touch with the man in charge of the lorries, who was then atChisenga, and tell him to come at once to Fort Hill to transport the troops to Karonga. This conversation was overheard by two people. One wasthe telephone operator at Karonga and another was the storekeeper, whoheard Mr. James receiving the message at Fort Hill. One or the othermust have made contact at once with the Congress leaders at Fort Hill, whothereupon decided that they would try to hinder the arrival of the rein-forcements. Mr. James left for Chisenga and the only Europeans left inFort Hill were Mrs. James, who operates the radio at the airfield, andMr. Mackintosh, a Federal immigration officer who happened to be there.A quarter-of-an-hour after Mr. James had left, a mob of about 200 peopleapproached the radio hut where Mrs. James was. They were armed,mostly with pangas* and such like, but the leader had a made-up weapon,a big wooden ball with a handle. They told Mrs. James, who went out to meet them, that they were going to stop her passing messages through and that she must close down the radio hut at once. They started to pullthe aerials down and Mrs. James, realising that resistance was uselessand in order to save the equipment, locked the hut and gave the key ofit to the leader. Some of the crowd were saying that they would killher for helping the Europeans in Karonga. But the leader, though hehad told her that they would smash the set if she did not close it down,said that they did not wish to harm her. They told her to get into herlandrover, which was outside the hut and drive to her house with Mr.Mackintosh and remain there. When she got into the landrover she saidthat she had left her small dog behind ; the leader went to look for itand came back saying that he was sorry that he could not find it. TheJames&apos; house is about two miles beyond the trading centre, the tradingcentre being about 300 yards from the airfield. Mrs. James and Mr.Mackintosh drove to the house. After a while Mr. James returned, havinggiven his message at Chisenga, and he was allowed to go to the housetoo. There they remained surrounded by Africans.111. At 10.50 a.m. the P.M.F., with a superintendent in command,landed at the airfield. On hearing what had happened they set off at once for the James&apos; house. As they drove through the trading centre they founda crowd there which, however, let them pass without incident. When theygot to the house they put the European civilians into landrovers without opposition and then started off back to the airfield. When they reachedthe trading centre they found that a block had been made across the road which prevented them from going further. The platoon debussed about30 yards from the road block and advanced down the centre of the roadso as to remove it. There was a large crowd behind the block and on either side of the road and the platoon was heavily stoned. The superintendentread the Riot Act and tried to use tear smoke but the conditions were not* Panga means a sword. In this connection it refers to a knife, not unlike a kukri, about18 inches long by 3 inches wide, sharpened on one cutting edge. It is used as a general purpose agri;cultural cutting tool throughout East and Central Africa and is employed partly as a light axe in clearing bush and a knife for cutting. It makes a lethal weapon, if used assuch.57
suitable and he considered that the crowd were too scattered for a batoncharge. The police succeeded in clearing the block; except for stoning,the crowd did not attempt to interfere. But as the platoon returned tothe vehicles the crowd pushed closer and the stoning became heavier.The superintendent ordered two riflemen to fire a round each, but it had no effect. One of the police was attacked at close quarters with an axeand took the blow on the butt of his rifle. Seven men received minorinjuries from stones and bottles and both Mr. and Mrs. James who werein a landrover behind the platoon received injuries in the face from stones.While this was going on the superintendent ordered his men to fire again,and was not able in the melee to control the number of rounds. Six werefired by the constable who was attacked with the axe and two by thesuperintendent himself. In all, eleven rounds were fired before the crowddispersed. Four Africans were wounded. The party then proceeded to the airfield. Mr. and Mrs. James were evacuated by plane and the P.M.F.proceeded in lorries to Karonga. Fort Hill was not &quot; re-occupied &quot; until aweek later. During that time the airfield was obstructed so that no craftcould land. Mr. Nkata, the itinerant Congressman, moving on to Fort Hillfrom Karonga, found the spirit of nationalism very high there too. &quot; Sincedisturbances &quot; he reported &quot; our people have more confidence in the Congressthan before&quot;. On 28th February the Tanganyika police arrived by road,cleared the airstrip in an hour and took over the buildings.Section 4.  Livingstonia : 20th February112. These were the two gravest incidents, but from then on until theend of the month there was trouble of some sort all over the province.On 20th February there was an incident at Livingstonia where the greatChurch of Scotland mission is. It was not political in origin but we have seen reports which suggest that Congress took a hand in the matter withthe object of stirring up trouble. There is at Livingstonia a branch of awell known chain-store and on 19th February Mr. Robson, an assistantmanager of the company which owns the store, visited it and found ashortage of  40. He told the storekeeper that he would be transferred andthat he, Mr. Robson, would come back with a lorry the next day so as toremove the storekeeper, his family and his goods. The storekeeper was amember of Congress and on the afternoon of the 20th, when Mr. Robsonreturned with the lorry and went inside the store, he was visited by thelocal chairman and secretary of Congress who demanded to know whythe storekeeper was being dismissed. Mr. Robson told them that it wasnot their business. They left and shortly after a brick was thrown throughthe store window. Mr. Robson went out and saw a crowd dispersing. Hethen went up to the mission church to report the affair to the ReverendFergus Macpherson; that was a natural thing to do, for in Livingstonia Mr.Macpherson is greatly respected by Europeans and Africans alike. he found Mr. Macpherson in the church with about 80 students and Mr.Macpherson said he would come down later.113. Mr. Robson returned to the store and found a hostile crowd outsideit. Stones had been placed in front of the lorry&apos;s wheels so that it could notbe driven away. When Mr. Robson arrived stones were thrown at him and at the lorry and he went back again to Mr. Macpherson. Mr. Macphersonthen bicycled off to the store followed by some of the students. Mr. Henry,
Livingstonia: 20th Februaryan engineer on the mission, had heard shouts and joined them at the store.While the three of them were in the store discussing the situation with theCongress chairman and secretary, Mr. Macpherson saw his bicycle being flungto the ground by members of the crowd and jumped on. The chairman sug-gested that it would be better if Mr. Macpherson and Mr. Henry went away and left him to quieten the crowd. They decided to do this and as they were leaving stones were thrown ; one of them struck Mr. Henry but did not injurehim. It may be that the stones were being thrown at the lorry and that Mr.Henry was hit accidentally; but there is some evidence that they wereaimed both at him and at Mr. Macpherson. Considerable stoning went onthereafter. In all 26 windows of the store were broken and the lorry wasextensively damaged. One of ithe stone throwers was identified as a studentat the mission. When the stoning was over a crowd of youths marchedround the mission singing songs but they did not damage any property.Mr. Macpherson was shocked by this grievous incident; and indeed whatis serious about it is not what was done, when it is compared with the much worse happenings in other places, but that anything of the sort should havebeen done in Livingstonia. Mr. Macpherson later held a meeting with congress members at which they all expressed regret and condemned theviolence.Section 5.   Other Northern Province disturbances : 21st to 28th February114. On 21st February at Mzimba a police patrol was stoned at nightby a small group of Africans who disappeared. A grain store and the roofof the African staff quarters at the Church of Scotland mission at Loudonwere burnt, and a brick was thrown through a window of a house occu-pied by a European nursing sister there. In Misuku, Mr. Waterfield, theagricultural supervisor, returned on this day, 21st February, to his house in the district. In the evening he was visited by a gang of men whosaid that in future no black men would work for him or they would have their tongues cut out. No men came to work for him the next day ; andas he had heard of the troubles at Fort Hill and feared the possibilityof road blocks which might later prevent him from leaving, he and his family left.115. In Misuku, near where Mr. Waterfield is, about 35 miles fromKaronga, there is an American mission, one of the Pentecostal groups, ofwhich Mr. Udd is in charge. They had a school there and there was a group of nine buildings, a house, a shop, store, etc., and houses for the african teachers. On 22nd February a group of Africans led by a mancalled Abner Mwiba came to the mission and told Mr. Udd to stand up asthey had something to tell him, and also to call his wife. They thenwent through what he described as a chant about imperialism, colonialism,stooges and quislings and said that they wanted self-government now.Mwiba then told Mr. Udd that from then on no one would be permitted to work for him; he could hold his church services but he was not there-after to visit the people. He asked Mr. Udd whether in America it was asin to ask for freedom and Mr. Udd replied that it all depended on whatkind of freedom he asked for and how he went about it; Mwiba saidthis was too clever. He pointed to an African servant and said that whenthey spilt the Europeans&apos; blood they would spill his and he would be the59
first to do it as he lived close by. Nevertheless, some of the servantscontinued to work for the Udds and also two African ministers continuedto work at the mission. On the next evening the Udds were warned thata party was coming to beat the two ministers and so they decided to leave.116. This evening, 23rd February, the Provincial Commissioner tele-graphed to Zomba that he needed at least one company of troops ifcontrol of the situation was to be regained. The Nyasaland Governmenthad in fact already made a request to the Federal Government for troops ;we shall give you the details about this in the next Part of our Report.During the night of 23rd February at Rumpi a small gang went roundbreaking the windows of government buildings and damaging road signsand telephone lines. The house of the African District Assistant was stonedand the window broken and in the morning he found a letter which saidthat he was behaving as an Englishman, and allowing Europeans into his house. The letter went on:  &quot; Do not any European from today &quot; (sic),&quot; you are strongly warned, if we see you doing this again you should know that you will be stoned or else die.&quot; About the same time an anonymousletter was left for the Boma&apos;s head messenger which threatened him withbeing beaten as the District Assistant at Karonga had been beaten. On this day also, the first road blocks were found; they were not very serious andwere removed without difficulty.117. Between 23rd and 28th February there was no further trouble.Meetings were held by permission at Mzuzu and Nkata Bay and went offquietly. On 24th and 25th February two platoons of R.R.R. arrived. Theywere the first European troops seen in the province since 1918 and their arrival created a considerable stir. On 28th February there was a quietmeeting at Rumpi. But one at Mzuzu, which began in an orderly way,ended by stones being thrown at the police landrover in attendance. It wasdispersed with tear smoke and eight arrests were made.118. On the night of 28th February the main water supply at Mzuzu wasdeliberately cut; the supply was restored the next morning. On 1st Marchthere was trouble at Ekwendeni School. Five African Congress people arrived in a truck, went into the girPs dining room and said that there was to beno school the next day and that any girls who came &quot; might go to hospitalif they did&quot;. The following morning after prayers in church the localCongress secretary got up, walked to the front and said that there would beno school that day and that there was a general strike on. After that therewas a stampede out of the church and groups of young children went aboutseeing that nobody did any work. One or two windows were broken. Allthese incidents were symptomatic of a state of affairs which clearly could notbe allowed to continue.Section 6.  Some Central Province disturbances: 10th to 20th February119. We must now go back to the middle of February and recountwhat was happening in the Central Province. The first incident worthmentioning is one that happened on 10th February. A procession of africans marched to a court where three Congress members were beingtried by the resident magistrate for collecting money without a permit.
Stones were thrown at the resident magistrates car when he left. Amore serious incident took place the next day at the court of CouncillorSambani, sub-chief of an area near Dowa. The councillor was tryinga case for assault. The assault, which was an attack with a club, was committed by the accused upon an African veterinary assistant who hadshot the accused&apos;s dog which he had refused to have vaccinated. the accused was a member of Congress and while the case was being hearda crowd of 400 people assembled. They refused to leave when ordered todo so and they assaulted two court messengers. The messengers were not seriously hurt but an officer of the veterinary department and two of hisAfrican staff who went to the assistance of the messengers were alsoassaulted and were seriously hurt; the officers collar bone was brokenand he was knocked unconscious. The councillor fled into the bush.The crowd took away with them three shot guns and these were later sur-rendered by the branch secretary of Congress.120. The next incident arose out of a breach of the agricultural rulesat a small village in the Kota-Kota district. An African soil ranger founda large number of people cultivating land in breach of the rules. Heremonstrated with them and was beaten with hoe-handles and his bicyclewas smashed. The police arrived and ten arrests were made. The prisoners were taken to Kota-Kota and on the next day, 17th February, a crowdof between 150 and 200 came to the police station and demanded to be arrested as well. The D.C. explained the reasons for the ten arrests and offered to interview a delegation, the offer was not accepted, the crowdwas told to disperse and would not. The police then used tear smoke and made a baton charge. One man&apos;s arm was broken, and another&apos;s leg wasbroken but this was said by the police to have been caused while he was runnin away.  35 arrests were made.121. On 17th February the first road block in the province was set upin the Kota-Kota district. On that day and on the next day there were two more cases of illegal cultivation, both in the Kota-Kota district, bynumbers of people apparently acting in concert. In the second of these two cases there was evidence that it was being done as a deliberate act ofdefiance; it consisted of the illegal cultivation of sloping ground and therewas flat ground nearby which could easily have been cultivated instead.The crowd which was composed mainly of women refused to disperse. Thepolice inspector was hit and slightly injured with a hoe, an African sergeantwas attacked with a knife but not injured; both attackers were arrested and were slightly injured in the process. Some women who refused tomove were beaten, not severely, on the buttocks. The police thought thiswould have a salutary effect, for they believed that the women were therebecause they thought themselves immune.122. On 20th February there was trouble at Ncheu. This was theonly disturbance that occurred in this district either before or after thedeclaration of the emergency. It began with the conviction on 30th Januaryat a chiefs court of a man for convening an unlawful meeting. On 3rdFebruary 40 Congress members came to the Boma to demand his release;they refused to disperse when told to do so and 22 of them were arrested
Some Central Province disturbances: 10th-20th february and charged with unlawful assembly. On 19th February their trialbegan before the resident magistrate. A crowd of about 700 peopleassembled at the court and because of their unruliness the magistrate hadto adjourn the proceedings for 30 minutes and a platoon of P.M.F. was sent for. The trial continued the next day, the crowd present then number-ing about 300. All the accused were convicted and sentenced to six months&apos;imprisonment each. After the trial was over the crowd assembled in an open space in front of the court and were addressed by a speaker. TheD.C. told him that he was holding an illegal meeting but the crowd wouldnot disperse. The Riot Act was read and the P.M.F. broke up the crowdby means of a baton charge and tear smoke.Section 7.  Incident of African cyclist: 23rd February123. On 23rd February there was an incident of a different sort.   Oneof the precautions against trouble that was by then being adopted in the towns was night-time patrolling by special constables whose duty it wasto report to the police station if they saw any mob.  At Lilongwe at about1.45 a.m. on 23rd February three special constables were patrolling in alandrover when they saw an African riding a bicycle without a light andcoming towards them.   They motioned to him to stop but he did not doso.   One of the constables got out and ran after him, caught him up (hewas going uphill) and gave him a push so that he fell off his cycle on tothe ground.  The cyclist picked himself up and the constable asked himwhy he had not stopped when he had been told to do so.  The Africansaid something like: &quot; No, no, I want to go home &quot; and the constable told him not to be cheeky.   The African pushed his bicycle towards the con-stable and the constable then hit him on the head with his baton so thathe fell on his back.  He was unconscious and was taken to the hospital.The constable reported to the police station that he had been dealing witha drunk cyclist and that he had hit him.  There was no evidence to suggestthat the African was not sober ; he was a man of about 45 and was employed as a  messenger  in the  resident magistrate^ court.    He was foundto be suffering from a fracture of the skull and he died on 7th March.According to the medical evidence at the inquest the fracture was causedby a serious blow on the right side of the skull; the dead man had alsobruises and lacerations on the left side of his face and a haemorrhage behind the left eye.   It is not quite clear from the evidence given at the inquestwhether the fracture was caused by the blow from the baton or by the secondfall.  A verdict of manslaughter was returned.Section 8.  Lilongwe : 24th February124. On the next day, 24th February, there was a serious disturbancein the town of Lilongwe and troops opened fire for the first time in theCentral Province. There was, as we have seen, a large number of people who had been arrested in the Kota-Kota district and on 24th Februarythey were being brought to the prison at Lilongwe. At about 2 p.m. the D.C.reecived information, which he believed to be reliable, that the prison was going to be attacked that night. What happened thereafter is not veryeasy to follow without reference to a plan and you will see a rough sketchopposite.   You will see the prison and opposite it across the other side

of the road is a market which is a large open space enclosed by a v/allwith two gates. At the side of the market and separated from it by astreet, marked as a side street, there is a small hotel near the Congress head-quarters. About 4 p.m. the D.C. was passing this hotel and he saw a crowdof about 50 wearing Kwaca caps a Congress party headgear and they appeared to him to be chatting earnestly. In view of his suspicion that the prison might be attacked, the D.C. went in his car to the police station and returned with the assistant superintendent who was the officer-in-charge ofpolice at Lilongwe. The two of them mingled with the crowd which had then grown to about 200. The D.C. was talked to rudely and when he gotback into his car stones were lobbed on to the roof. He drove his car intothe prison yard, parked it there and walked back to the prison gate. he found that the crowd had collected outside the prison and more stones werethrown. The prisoners from Kota-Kota then arrived there were 20 or25 of them and they were got into the prison without any incident takingplace. The crowd remained outside the prison gate. It did not comeany nearer but it got noisier and it went on throwing stones. The D.C.told them several times to go home peacefully and stop throwing stones butthey took no notice. He thought that he and the superintendent couldnot get back to the town unaided so he asked the superintendent to telephone,from the prison to the police station for assistance. About 4.45 p.m. ariot squad arrived consisting of 12 or 15 policemen equipped with batonsand tear smoke. The truck in which they came was heavily stoned.They got out and lined up in front of the prison. The D.C. read the RiotAct, but there was so much noise that it was doubtful if it was heard.The crowd was not armed and they showed no signs of making any attack,but they did not disperse. The police fired smoke shells and advanced withbatons and drove the crowd up the side street past the hotel.125. The D.C. went a little distance with the police and then returnedto the front of the market. There he found another crowd and read theRiot Act again, but the crowd would not disperse. There was a platoonof K.A.R. stationed in Lilongwe and the D.C. decided to send for them.About 5 p.m. the platoon arrived under the command of a lieutenant andhalted outside the main gate of the prison. The D.C. asked the lieutenantto take control and to disperse the crowd in front of the market oppositethe prison. The lieutenant formed up his platoon and marched up and down, displaying the banners of warning and using a loud-hailer, tellingthe crowd that if they did not go home peacefully they would be hurt.All this was done several times and as a result of it many of the crowddid go home. But outside the market and at one corner of it there remained a group of about 60 that would not disperse. They were notshowing any signs of attack nor were they throwing stones; but theywere not dispersing. The lieutenant observed among this group one man with a bicycle, who we were told by Africans was a schoolmaster, shoutingand gesticulating. He ordered a sniper to fire at him and the man waskilled. This happened about 15 minutes after the military took over. TheDC. who had been to see what the police were doing we shall describethat in the next paragraph returned to the market and decided that it must
be completely cleared. This was done without incident and the marketgates were locked. All then was quiet outside the prison and the market and the lieutenant took his platoon to join the police force.126. The police, you will remember, had driven a section of the crowdup the side street.  The superintendent drew up his force across the streetabout half way up it with the crowd in front of him and remained therefor about a quarter of an hour while he was stoned from the houses on each side ; a man was hit but nobody was injured seriously.   He then decided that he would have &quot;to drive the crowd right up the street.   Hefired some more smoke shells and advanced, driving the crowd into theplaying field at the top of the street and there he again halted.   He waitedthere until he was joined by the platoon and by the D.C.  When the D.C.came he saw that a section of the crowd was moving off down the main road towards the town.   He was anxious to make sure that the crowddid not get into the centre of the town and so he asked the lieutenantto take his platoon back down the side-street the way he had come andcome round up the main road to meet this section of the crowd and drivethem out of the town towards Dedza. When this manoeuvre was completed,the military, following this route, would be able to join up with the policeagain on the playing field.  It was now about 5.30 p.m.  The lieutenantexecuted this manoeuvre successfully.   He had previously seen a planeoverhead and communicating with it by radio, he had asked it to droptear smoke on the crowd.  This was done and the effect of it, or possibly the effect of a shot which the lieutenant caused to be fired overhead ashe was coming up the road, caused a part of the crowd to disperse.   Butanother part of the crowd led by a man in a green shirt who was throwingstones very vigorously, formed up on the road.   The lieutenant gave a warning to disperse through the loud hailer but it was ineffective.   He thenordered a sniper to fire at the man in the green shirt.   The first shotmissed him but the second hit and killed him ; the crowd then dispersed.Later in this place another man was found wounded; he must have been hit by one or other of these shots.  The time of this firing was 6.10 p.m.127. It is clear that the crowds were warned many times to disperse andthat they did not do so. There is not sufficient evidence that they everintended to attack the prison ; the D.C.&apos;s suspicions were based upon somerather unreliable and confusing information. In any event, if they had made an attack on the prison a platoon of K.A.R. could have defendedit. They did not attack any property and except for throwing stonesthey did not attack any person. It is not possible to say what they mighthave done if they had not been dispersed ; there was some very aggressivestone-throwing from parts of the crowd. In the opinion of the D.C. ifthey had not been dispersed before nightfall it must be rememberedthat nightfall in a place like Lilongwe is very different from nightfall in awell lighted city they might have run amok and done damage. the description of this incident in paragraph 28 of the White Paper containstwo statements that cannot be supported by the evidence. The white paper says: &quot;The same day a serious riot took place outside the gaol inLilongwe. This began when a truckload of Congress supporters arrived from Blantyre at the same time as some 50 prisoners were brought in from
Kota Kota whom the crowd tried to release. The security forces had to open fire and two rioters were killed.&quot; The statement that a truckloadof Congress supporters arrived from Blantyre the inference being presume-ably that the riot was stirred up from there is based on very flimsy evidence,which we cannot accept. The statement that there were 50 prisoners isa very minor inaccuracy; there were about half that number. But the crowd never tried to release the prisoners and no one ever thought thatthey had tried. The statement in the White Paper is presumably based onthe D.C.&apos;s suspicions that they might be intending to attack the prison.Section 9.   Fort Manning: 28th February128. The last incident in the Central Province that we need relateoccurred at Fort Manning on 28th February. Mr. Mzembe, the FederalM.P., was staying there; he was the colleague of Mr. Chirwa, one ofthose who had been marked down as quislings at the emergencyconference. A crowd of about 100 Africans surrounded his house threateningto kill him. The Riot Act was read and the crowd was dispersed by thepolice. The hand of Congress was at work here as no doubt it was inmany other similar cases ; but in this case there happens to be clear proofin the form of a letter from one Congress member to another dated14th March in which the writer gives an account of what had beenhappening at Fort Manning. He says : &quot; Mr. Mzembe was staying here. . . We had organised an underground movement of villagers of more than100 people. They came and beseiged the Mandala Store where he wasstaying. Fortunate enough it was after the K.A.R.s had arrived. That was going to be the end of him &quot;.Section 10.   Some Southern Province disturbances : 17th and 22nd February129. In the Southern Province we can begin with an incident which occurred on 17th February in the Zomba district. The D.C. instructedtwo of his messengers to go and fetch two village headmen and bring themto the Boma as the D.C. wanted to see them ; he did not tell the messengerswhy he wanted to see them. The two messengers set off in the Boma land-rover and they met the first of the village headmen, Katebwe. They told him he was wanted by the D.C. and he agreed to go with them to Zomba.The other headman was called Chilumpha and when they got to where they expected to find him they found a crowd of about 50 people blocking theroad ; Chilumpha was standing in front and was carrying an axe and others in the crowd were armed with pangas and axes. They were all shoutingand saying that they wanted to take Katebwe from the vehicle. The roadwas entirely blocked by the crowd which surged around the vehicle andcaught hold of Katebwe and took him out. The messengers were threatened,blows were aimed at them and one was struck on the face with a fist. OnceKatebwe was out, the messengers drove away as fast as they could. this incident is referred to in paragraph 26 of the White Paper which says:  &quot; a crowd armed with axes released prisoners under lawful arrest in theZomba district&quot;. The report which we have seen shows that only one personwas released and he was not a prisoner under lawful arrest.
130. In paragraphs 102 and 105 of this Report we mentioned the provin-cial delegates meeting that was held on 22nd February. Afterwards atNdirande there was a public meeting addressed by Mr. Chipembere. Whenthe meeting was over there was a great deal of serious rowdiness from the crowd as they left. There was stoning of cars on the Blantyre-Limbe road and when a platoon of P.M.F. arrived they also were attacked with stones.The groups who were throwing the stones hid themselves in the long grasson both sides of the road and they were very difficult to deal with. Thesituation became so bad that the road had to be closed to traffic from.45 p.m. until 7.30 p.m. Several baton charges were made, three Africanswere injured and a number arrested.Section 11.  Blantyre mission school: 22nd and 23rd February131. On 22nd and 23rd February two incidents occurred at the church of Scotland mission school in Blantyre, about which complaints were madeto the police at the time and questions were subsequently asked in theHouse of Commons.&apos; We are not able to throw much further light on thefirst incident. The houseboy at the mission school complained that while he was walking in the grounds of the mission he was attacked by threepolicemen who beat him. There is no doubt that he received head injurieswhich required stitching. But no one else was present and there is nocorroboration of how exactly he got his injuries. We have not been ableto identify his attackers and the police can throw no light upon it; we haveno reason to think from our investigation of other incidents that the police would not have supplied us with a report if they could, even though the report was unfavourable to them. On the following evening a patrol of four special constables was driving along the road past the mission when they saw a group of Africans on both sides of the road. It was in fact a group of boysat the mission school going from the school building on one side of theroad to their dormitory on the other. They were noisy, and the special constables who had been newly enrolled and were probably a little too keento scent trouble, stopped to investigate. They chased the boys off the road and eventually halted when they reached one of the mission buildings. they then discovered, they said, that the group consisted of schoolboys and theyannounced that they would leave. But the boys were not willing to break off the engagement. A general fracas developed, stones were thrown at theconstables and one of them was struck by a half brick and collapsed. Anotherspecial constable was struck on the chin. Some of the schoolboys werebruised : five of them later showed their bruises, which were not serious, tothe police. We do not think that they had the worst of it. A Congresssupporter said : &quot; Fortunately, the soldiers were few and the boys were many, so they handled one soldier, beat him and took him to their head-master &quot;. The authorities of the mission, who originally made the com-plaint, told us that in view of the much more serious matters we had to enquire into, they did not feel justified in pressing for closer investigation.Section 12.  Balaka : 24th February132. The trouble at Balaka on 24th February may or may not have any political significance. It occurred at the railway station and began witha demonstration on 23rd February to protest against some grievance.   The
ringleader was a railway employee, the stationmaster reported his conductto the head office of the railway in Limbe and they said that he was to besent to Limbe to be questioned about his connection with the demonstration.He was to travel south in a railway coach on 24th February. The station-master, who had been alarmed at the demonstration, thought that therewould be trouble upon the man&apos;s departure. So when the time arrived therewere a force of a dozen policemen and a platoon of K.A.R. at the station.There was a crowd there, that is on railway property, which was told to goaway. One woman was very active inciting the crowd not to go away and she was arrested. This made the crowd very angry. The Riot Act was readand a baton party advanced and stones were thrown by the crowd. Thebaton party charged and cleared the crowd. In the course of this twoAfricans attacked an African police sergeant, one with a stone and the otherstabbed him in the chest with a large bladed pen-knife ; the sergeant was quite seriously wounded but is slowly recovering.Section 13.  Chigaru&apos;s court: 27th February133. On 27th February the first shooting in the Southern Provinceoccurred in the course of a serious disturbance at the court of ChiefChigaru. The trouble was foreshadowed by an incident which took place at the court of another chief, Lundu, some days before. Chief Lunduhad summoned a meeting of village headmen for 21st February. Severaldid not come saying that they had to attend a Congress meeting. so he summoned them to appear, presumably for contempt, at his court on24th February. They came with a crowd, threw down the summons withKwaca written across it, told him they would take no notice of it andthat he must not prosecute any more for breaches of agricultural rules.They talked about killing Indians and Europeans and they also talked aboutgrabbing Chigaru&apos;s court.134. Chief Chigaru was sitting on 27th February to try some offendersagainst agricultural rules and in view of what had been said at Chief Lundu&apos;scourt, trouble was expected. The D.C. decided to be there with a smallpolice party and a platoon of K.A.R. The court is set back a little distance from the main road and is separated from it by the long grass that growsalong the side of the road and by an open space between the grass andthe court. The whole of this is surrounded by an approach road that loopsround the court. When the D.C. arrived about 11 a.m. he found that the trial of the agricultural offenders was over. One of them had been fined  2and after he was sentenced he threw his Kwaca card on the table sayingthat he was not going to pay ; consequently he was fined an additional  for contempt of court. Both men were in the cells beside the court awaitingtransport to take them to prison. There was an orderly crowd of about 300at the court.135. At 11.50 a.m. a crowd of about 200 came down the main road,singing and carrying Congress banners, led by two men who had previously been seen at the affair in Chief Lundu&apos;s court. They turnedoff the main road and came up the loop road towards one side of thecourt. The troops took up their position in the open space between thecourt and the grass. The D.C. went forward and halted the crowd about50 yards from the court.  The leaders told him they had come to set free
the two Congress prisoners. The crowd was not armed except with suchsticks as men usually carry. The DC told them that they must disperseand he read the Riot Act and then returned to where the troops were.The crowd did not disperse; it did not advance but it remained whereit was. The D.C. went down and read the Riot Act a second time, butalso without effect. Then a section of the crowd moved back on tothe main road, along it and up the other arm of the loop road so that they came round on the other side of the platoon. The men on this side began to move in closer to the troops and the company commander orderedthem to move back. They all did so except for one man who stoodobstinately where he was. The officer turned him round and gave him ajab with a bayonet in the buttock. This section of the crowd then wentback and joined the main crowd and held up the wounded man for allthe others to see. They tried to get the D.C. to sign a chit saying thatthe man had been wounded on his orders. The D.C. refused to do thisbut he offered to send the man in his truck to the nearest dispensary ; andthis was done.136. After this the D.C. went down to the crowd a fourth time andordered it to disperse. He went right down to the crowd who pressedaround him and he had to keep pushing them back, but they did not strikehim or offer any violence. The DC then decided to hand over to themilitary. The crowd had of course no hope of securing the release of the prisoners, who could easily have been removed, and the business of thecourt was finished. But the D.C. considered that if the platoon left withthe prisoners and without dispersing the crowd, the crowd might burn thecourt and possibly might attack the chief. He would have preferred tohave dispersed them with a baton charge but the police had no batons.So he handed over to the military. The company commander leftit to the platoon commander, who had previously had experience of riotwork, to handle the situation. He caused the Riot Act to be read three times in Chinyanja and he then had two tear smoke grenades thrown intothe middle of the crowd. The crowd moved apart as the grenades explodedand then came together again afterwards. They then began for the first time to advance, shouting to the askaris to join them. They were notrushing or attacking but, according to the evidence of the platoon com-mander, moving forward slowly and steadily. The platoon commanderdecided to use controlled fire and he picked out as a target a man whowas carrying a banner. The shot missed him and the crowd came on toa point about 50 yards from the troops. The platoon commander thenordered three shots to be fired simultaneously at the men around the banner.Two men were wounded, one of them dying almost instantaneously. the crowd then dispersed.137. The only other incident that occurred before 3rd March was some stone throwing in Blantrye on 27th February. A bus-load of Africanwomen had chartered a bus to take them to the trial in Zomba of thewomen who had been arrested on 20th January. They were told that the trial was over and the women had been acquitted. They hung about andwould not move on ; and then a crowd of young boys began stoning a
shop and also stoning the police vehicle standing by. The boys were dispersed by a charge and no one was hurt.Section 14.   Activities of Congress leaders138. During this period the leaders of Congress had been variouslyemployed. On the day after the emergency conference, 26th January, Mr.D. K. Chisiza left for Northern Rhodesia, his object being to visit the branchesof Congress there so as to develop Northern Rhodesia as a source of income which might replace Southern Rhodesia. He also wanted to arrange fora &quot; summit conference &quot; of all the Congresses in Rhodesia and Nyasaland.He returned to Blantyre on 7th February and was at headquarters for a fortnight and then set out again for Northern Rhodesia, this time in company with his brother. He went through Ncheu, Lilongwe and FortManning and you will have observed that in all these places there weredisturbances within the next few days; it is possible, though it has notbeen sufficiently proved, that this was not a coincidence. The Chisizastook with them a film of Congress activities to use as propaganda and alsoa recording of a speech made by Mr. Chipembere for the same purpose.The recording was made at Blantyre on 19th February when the disturbancesat Karonga and elsewhere were already in the news. We quote the followingpassages from it:  &quot; We are no longer playing as we used to do in the days of therotten Manoah Chirwa and in the days of the rotten T. D. T. Banda andtheir filth-ridden hearts. We are now doing serious business. We meanto die for this country or win liberation. . . . The masses of Nyasalandhave been called to action by the great Kamuzu. His honesty andhis courage have impressed them and they have responded whole-heartedly. So much so, that from Port Herald to Karonga you findeverybody in state of mental revolt against the imperialists. In faraway Mlanje among peasants, people are struggling for liberty anddefying the authority of the District Commissioner. Away in FortManning, in Dowa, people have become so infuriated against imperialismthat they&apos;ve gone so far as to lay their hands on the dirty bodyof a white-skinned fellow. And away in Karonga you will hear people have stood in open revolt against British authority. . . . They aredefying death, they are defying all the diabolical instruments of deathin the face of the imperialist. They are defying prison bars of theCentral Prison Zomba and exposing themselves deliberately for arrest.&quot;The expression of these sentiments makes it difficult for Mr. Chipembereto contend that he disapproved of violence and would not encourage it in any form. Nevertheless, in his evidence before us, he did so. He told us that intruth he thought it a bad thing that hands had been laid on the dirty bodyof a white-skinned fellow. He just wanted to state the facts ; and the fact as he then understood them (no white man had in fact been hit) were that a european had been assaulted and that he was in fact a dirty man and a man of untidy habits. He thought that the statement of these facts would bring home to his audience the desperate mood in which the people were.139. In Northern Rhodesia on 23rd February Mr. Y. K. Chisiza made a speech which contained a number of references to disturbances, bloodshed
and to keeping the police busy. At one point he said: &quot;We mean to embarrass the local government, Nyasaland Government and the BritishGovernment about our demands. This is the only way. Negotiations won&apos;tdo. But we mean to create disturbances from Port Herald to Karonga evenif it means every person in the country dies &quot;. Mr. Chisiza denied that hehad ever advocated violence. He agreed that the parts of his speech we have just quoted and similar parts could only mean violence but he denied thatin fact he uttered the words. He continued to deny that even after therecording of his speech had been played over to him and thus made further examination unprofitable. We have no record of any speech made byMr. D. K. Chisiza but we have what we regard as incontrovertible evidenceof what he was saying, probably at this time, and we are satisfied that histhoughts on these matters were substantially the same as those of his brotherand Mr. Chipembere.140. Mr. Chipembere was also very active. On 1st February he and Dr.Banda addressed a meeting at Dedza which he described in his letter thenext day to Chiume as &quot; dishing out hot stuff ... we expect to hear some-thing from there and, as usual, I expect one or two of my sentences to be thesubject of criminal investigation&quot;. On 19th February he recorded inBlantyre the speech from which we have already quoted. On 22nd Februaryhe spoke at a public meeting in Ndirande. He said, among other things that since Federation every African looked on every European as an enemy;and after the meeting there was a great deal of rowdiness which we have described in paragraph 130.141. Dr. Banda spoke at Dedza on 1st February with Mr. Chipembere.We have referred to his speech in paragraph 104. On 8th February atMlanje Dr. Banda told his audience that moderate leaders were no use ;they had not got anywhere in Ghana or the Sudan &quot;because the british people prefer to face brave and open opinion and discuss things with them &apos;\That was why he opposed Federation. &quot; As long as there is a tie between us here in Nyasaland and the British common people in the ColonialOffice ... the common people of Britain and their House of Commons, atleast we have somewhere to take our case &quot;.142. On 20th February it was announced that Lord Perth, the Minister ofState for Colonial Affairs would come to Nyasaland for talks on the cori-stitutional question ; and on the same day the Chief Secretary, Mr. Footman,who had previously been away on leave, had an interview with Dr. Bandaabout the deterioration in conditions. He gave him full details of what had happened at Karonga and said that the Government had had reluctantlyto bring up reinforcements. Any further disorders, he feared, might makenegotiations impossible; and he hinted that the Colonial Office mightalready be taking the view that the talks with Lord Perth would not bepossible. He felt that this sank in. Dr. Banda said that he wanted to moveby negotiation. Mr. Footman said that he did not suggest that everydisorder was due to Congress ; there was always the hooligan element.But there were occasions when members of Congress were involved and he asked Dr. Banda to control the situation through his branches.Dr. Banda did not say that he would make any move, but the chief secretary felt that he had given him a good deal of matter for thought.
At this interview Dr. Banda asked, but was not told, whether any of there reinforcements that were coming in were Southern Rhodesian, and he addedthat he hoped not as that would really cause trouble.143. Dr. Banda did not respond to Mr. Footman&apos;s request. He did not entirely believe the official account of what had happened at Karonga.He thought and it was very likely true that his own letters and messagesfrom the Northern Province were being intercepted. However, from what mr. Footman told him he did not like the sound of things ; he was worried,he told us, and on 22nd February arranged to send Mr. Arnold Nkata (towhom we have already referred in paragraph 108 and who was Mr. D. K.Chisiza&apos;s assistant) up to the Northern Province to report. But what causedhim, he says, to abandon all thought of co-operation was that on the evening of the 20th he heard on the radio that troops from Southern Rhodesia, thatis, European Federal regiments, were being sent to Karonga. On the next day he wrote an open letter of protest to the Governor. Law and order hadnot, he said, been so broken down as to necessitate the calling in of Federaltroops. This was the showdown of which the European settlers had beentalking and it was dictated by them. The letter was in rhetorical terms.144. On 26th February an incident occurred, not very important initself, but which several witnesses mentioned as showing Dr. Banda&apos;spacific intentions. There was a quarrel and some fighting between a Euro-pean and some Africans. We have not investigated who was to blame,but in some way the Africans came into possession of the Europeansshotgun which they took to the Congress secretariat who sent them on with it to Dr. Banda. Dr. Banda at once telephoned the police who went to his house and recovered the gun.145. On 1st or 2nd March Dr. Banda saw Arnold Nkata on his return from the north and Mr. Nkata gave him a report in writing, whichconfirmed a great deal of what the Government had been saying and containedmany of the facts that we have already set out. It is an extremely militantdocument and we have had to weigh it carefully in considering whetherDr. Banda was privy to plans for violence. Dr. Banda had sent Mr. Nkataas his emissary and it would be natural to suppose that he reported in the sort of tone which he would expect Dr. Banda to appreciate. Dr. Bandatold us that he did not know much about Mr. Nkata and that he had onlymet him once or twice before.146. Mr. Nkata&apos;s report of the incident on 15th February at Karongacompletely corroborated the official account. On the rioting on the 19th,he reported that it had started because the police disturbed a meeting withtear gas shells. He recorded that the police officers truck had been com-pletely damaged so that it was irreparable; that the prison gate had been opened and all prisoners freed ; that a police officers personal car hadbeen completely damaged ; that the airport station had been damaged andall telegraphic instruments removed and destroyed ; and the property of african police had been destroyed ; a prison warder was wounded and was still in hospital and mobile police tents had been set on fire. Mr. Nkata&apos;s account of the Fort Hill affair was as follows:  &quot; On the 19th Feb. when there were disturbances at Karonga,the Fort Hill Branch hired two lorries to come to Karonga and assist
in the Noble Freedom battle. Noticing that these lorries had no petrolto take them to Karonga at once they put into practice the thoughts of action on the imperialist within their reach. They distroyed WenelaCamp, cutting the telephone wires, digging the airport in anger becauseof the wounded five. Casualties on our side 5 wounded with Rifle shotsby a Wenela Representative James by name. Same James ran awayto Lusaka. Wenela property all distroyed. No military troops inFt. Hill, all at Karonga. Spirit of Nationalism now very high. Sincedisturbances our people have more confidence in the Congress than before.&quot;Dr. Banda told us and, for. what it is worth, Mr. Nkata confirmedhim, that he was shocked when he received this report. He said that if hehad not been arrested on 3rd March he would have convened a committee meeting to discuss what should be done to show people not to do this sort of thing. But, he told us, he could not say that he would have been a hundred per cent, successful, because of the bringing in of European troops.147. Since Dr. Banda had expressed himself as shocked at the contents of Mr. Nkata&apos;s report, we enquired from Mr. D. K. Chisiza and Mr.Chipembere, who equally with Dr. Banda professed non-violence, whetherthey also were shocked. Mr. Chipembere said he had had time only toglance at the report and did not really take it in, though he agreed that what had been done was wrong. You will recollect that the only reference he made to Karonga in his recorded speech was that people had stood in open revolt against British authority. When Mr. D. K. Chisiza returnedto the office on 1st March, he also did not have time to look at Mr.Nkata&apos;s report. He did not even ask Mr. Chipembere what was in it thoughthe two of them found a few minutes in which to discuss Mr. Nkata&apos;spraiseworthy behaviour in returning  9 12s. 6d. out of the  10 which hehad been given for the expedition. They did not even find time so Mr.Chisiza told us-to ask each other what they thought of the damage atFort Hill airfield.148. For some days past Dr. Banda had expected to be arrested at any moment. The country was full of troops, the press was assembled in forceand everyone expected something to happen. The Government^ plans werein fact completed. On the afternoon of 2nd March the Governor gave a press conference where he was placed in a position of some difficulty;for security reasons he did not wish to disclose that he intended to arrestthe leaders of Congress in the early hours of the following morning and to declare a state of emergency so as to enable him to do so. According tothe news broadcast that was made that evening, the Governor said that he hadthe power under the present laws to deal with dissidents without having to declare a state of emergency. There is no completely reliable verbatimaccount of what was said at the press conference. The account we have seen is open to misinterpretation. The broadcast caused many people tothink that the worst of the crisis was over, and there was therefore someshock when on the following morning they learned that a state of emergencyhad been declared at midnight and a large number of Africans arrested.
PART iv the MURDER PLOTSection 1.  The Governments appreciation149. We are not, under our terms of reference, concerned with the underlying causes of the emergency. We have heard many opinions aboutwhere the responsibility for it should ultimately lie; it is not part of our task to choose between them. We apprehend, however, that it will be generally agreed that on the facts we have found and in the situation thatexisted on 3rd March, however it was caused, the Government had either toact or to abdicate; and since with the forces at its disposal the maintenanceof order could not be achieved within the ordinary framework of the law,it had to resort to emergency powers. Everyone may not agree about theextent to which it exercised them and the manner in which it did so. Itexercised its powers with the object of stamping out Congress wherever itcould be found and in the later parts of this report we shall describe themeans which were taken to that end. When we do so, we shall neither ex-press nor imply any view about what was the right policy ; our duty is to find the facts about the activities of Congress so that you can consider howit should be dealt with. This we have done; and you will have observedthat in some important respects our findings do not confirm the appreciation of the facts set out by the Government in the White Paper. In particularwe have not found any detailed plan for massacre and assassination; v/eshall refer to this shortly as &quot; the murder plot&quot;, a term which was after-wards applied to it though not one which is actually used in the White Paper.150. Accordingly anyone who wishes to consider in the light of ourfindings the policy of the Government will have also to consider to what extent this policy was based upon the supposed murder plot and how far the extent and severity of the measures employed to crush Congress were due to a belief in the plot. We propose, therefore, in this part of our report to examine that question and to begin by setting out what informa-tion the Government had at its disposal before 3rd March about Congressactivities. We shall also set out what steps it was taking to deal with congress ; it has been criticised from one side for doing too little and doing it too slowly and from the other for allowing itself to be forced into action by outside pressure. Finally, we shall assess the evidence about what was decided upon at the emergency conference and state our reasonsfor rejecting the contention that violence was never discussed at all as wellas the contention that a plot was framed for massacre and assassination.151. Information about what was going on in Congress circles wasconstantly being collected and digested by the special branch and wasmade available to the Governor and his Executive Council in the formof monthly intelligence reports. Until towards the end of 1958 none of these reports indicated the possibility of any violent action on the part of Congress.To the contrary, the Governments information was that in the NorthernProvince when violence was discussed earlier in the year it was dis-approved of.  We have been given the name of the man who was said to
be advocating violence. From what we have heard about him, and notmerely from sources unfavourable to Congress, we have little doubt thathe was in fact a man of violent tendencies and that he was probably theinstigator of a good deal of the trouble in February in the Northern Provincewhich we have already recounted. But in the second half of 1958 his views were making little headway and he was definitely in the minority. The firstreference to violence as a possibility is contained in the intelligence report forthe month of September. It is there reported that as a result of intensepolitical activity following upon Dr. Banda&apos;s campaign, there had been anumber of references by Africans to possible violence against Europeans.The Government began to take into consideration the possibility of disordersif, when its constitutional proposals were announced, they did not satisfyCongress; but it did not anticipate that this would happen until aboutJune, 1959. Whenever there is a prospect of an outbreak, the policy ofthe Government is naturally to anticipate it by preventive action which includes the arrest and detention of the leaders believed to be responsiblefor its organisation. In Nyasaland it has been the practice at least since1954 for the special branch to maintain a list of &quot; suspects &quot; whom it thinksmight have to be arrested on the declaration of an emergency. In November1958 a complete revision of the list was undertaken on the assumption thatthere might be serious trouble from Congress some time in 1959. The listwas to include all those persons who were believed to be members of thecentral executive committee, or of the three provincial committees or were known as the chairman or secretary of any branch.152. Throughout December and January the Government regarded thesituation as worsening by reason of the events we have already recorded.But it was felt that these did not give sufficient ground for any change inthe appreciation that there were unlikely to be widespread disorders until after the constitutional changes were announced. So plans proceeded for constitutional talks and by 9th February had proceeded far enough forarrangements to be made for the visit of Lord Perth on or about the 22nd.At the beginning of February reports about the emergency conference began to come in to the special branch from informers. These reported specificallythe dismissal of Mr. Chaluluka and the appointment of Mr. Y. K. Chisiza and generally that civil disobedience, violence and murder had been discussed.These informers were not present at the meeting and claimed to have gottheir information from those who were. On 11th February the special branch received from one informer a comprehensive and detailed accountof what was supposed to have been decided at the meeting; he claimed tohave got it from a branch official. They found it convincing and immedi-ately embodied it together with the other information received in a specialintelligence report dated 13th February; this is the assessment, the contents of which are summarised in paragraph 24 of the White Paper from whichwe now quote.&quot; According to these reports it was agreed at the meeting that: (a) until such time as the announcement of the impending constitutional changes was made, unlawful public meetings and processions shouldbe held throughout the Protectorate. These meetings were to beheld where possible in the bush. Those attending them should notresort to violence but should offer themselves for arrest if the need arose.
(b) If Dr. Banda were arrested, four persons, Messrs. H. B. Chipembere,D. K. Chisiza and M. W. K. Chiume and Mrs. Rose Chibambo,elected to run Congress in his absence, were to fix a day whenviolence was to begin, to be called &quot; R&quot; day. Every branch inthe Central and Northern Provinces should be informed of the arrest. In view of the difficulty of communications &quot; R &quot; day wouldprobably be from ten to twenty-one days after Banda&apos;s arrest. Allaction was to begin simultaneously in every district on this &quot; R&quot;day.(c) The plan for violence on &quot; R &quot; day included:(1) Sabotage of telephone wires, road and rail bridges, airfields(including Chileka) and installations, petrol dumps and the mainpower station at Blantyre.(2) Murder of District and Provincial Commissioners, DistrictPolice Officers and other Europeans, including missionaries, also of certain Chiefs and other Africans classed as &quot; Quislings &quot;. Inthe townships Europeans and Asians were to be killed, includingwomen and children.(3) Assassination of the Governor and other senior british officers.It was also reported that at the meeting on the 25th January the delegates were told to go home and brief the Chairman and Secretary of eachCongress branch about the plan.&quot;153. The informer went into considerable detail about the plans for murder and assassination. Each district chairman was made responsiblefor the murder of his District Commissioner to be followed by that of thepolice officer and then of any other Europeans. Mr. Chipembere was reported to have said that the murders should include all women and children and their bodies should be mutilated and then burnt if possible. In districts where there was also a Provincial Commissioner, the district chairman was responsible for him as well. Inevitably the greatest responsibility fell uponthe district chairman for Zomba. He had to see to the assassination ofthe Governor, which was to be done by the Governors own staff of servants ;and then to that of the Chief Secretary. After that there came in order of priority the Commissioner of Police, the senior police officer in Zomba andthe senior K.A.R. officer there ; these were to be murdered by the police andthe K.A.R. themselves, 75 per cent, of whom were expected to go over to congress with their arms and ammunition. To begin with any sort ofweapon would have to be used; but after the first killings weapons wouldbe obtained from murdered Europeans. After all this had been done,Congress leaders, and those who had taken part in the outrages, were toretreat into the bush until such time as things had quietened down.154. On 18th February another special intelligence report was produced.Further information had been obtained, the report stated, indicating that congress was setting up an organisation to acquire data about the habitsof Europeans and their arms and ammunition and that particular attention was being paid to the murder of European children. The report also stated
that since 24th January there had been eight cases of illegal meetings, three&quot;of which (we have referred to them in paragraphs 106-108) has been followedby rioting or stone throwing. This, we may observe, was inconsistent withthat part of the reported plot which laid it down that until Dr. Banda&apos;sarrest no violence was to be offered ; but it was treated in the report not as casting doubt on the sources of the information but as showing that congress instructions regarding passive resistance were not being followed.But, as the intelligence report pointed out, taken by themselves theseincidents revealed serious deterioration in the security situation ; the viewgenerally held in the Southern Province was that any incident might sparkoff immediate violence. On the same day, the Commissioner of Policeexpressed to the Governor his view that the information about a plan for the mass murder of all Europeans and Asians, men, women and children,in the event of Dr. Banda being arrested, was correct and must be acceptedseriously. He believed it to be the intention of Congress to overthrow the &apos;Government and to place the country in a complete state of anarchy. Inhis opinion, urgent action was necessary at once to prevent the situationbecoming out of hand. He stated it as his considered opinion that unless \the forces of law and order were immediately reinforced substantially and action was taken against Congress, the situation might get beyond control. I155. On this advice the Governor decided to ask the Federal PrimeMinister for a battalion of K.A.R. ; he decided also that he would ask theGovernor of Northern Rhodesia to provide two platoons of P.M.F. Hehad earlier, on 29th January, asked the Government of Tanganyika whetherthey would be prepared to help, if there were disturbances in the courseof the next six months, with two platoons ; and the Government of Tan-ganyika had somewhat reluctantly offered one platoon if they were ableto spare it when the occasion arose. These were precautionary measures and the Governor, Sir Robert Armitage, had not yet made up his mindwhat action he would take. He noted that the information about the plan was secondhand from informers and had not yet been fully confirmed. Henoted also that it called for action only if the constitutional proposals wereunacceptable or if Dr. Banda was arrested ; and he believed that Dr. Bandahad every intention of participating in the constitutional talks. On the whole he believed that in the immediate future there was more likelihood ofisolated disorders than of an organised outbreak of violence. On and after18th February the list of suspects prepared by the special branch wasrevised, to include any person known to have attended the emergency con-ference who was not already on the list as an official of Congress. Ineach case history sheets were prepared for submission to the Governor.By 3rd March a list of 208 people had been approved by the Governor.It consisted mainly of officials and participators in the emergency con-ference but with some others added whose names the special branch had submitted as likely to be a menace to public tranquillity.156. On 20th February Sir Robert went to Salisbury for a meetingof the heads of government, that is, of the two Prime Ministers, Sir roy welensky of the Federation and Sir Edgar Whitehead of Southern Rhodesia,the Governor of Northern Rhodesia and himself. These meetings wereregularly held to discuss common problems and this particular meeting had
been arranged for some time before and had nothing to do with the problemsof Nyasaland. But naturally the problem in Nyasaland was discussed ; all three territories had similar problems since there were Congresses in eachof them. The Federal Prime Minister as Minister of Defence had the finalsay about the disposition of the troops. Sir Robert stated the factors affect-ing his decision and in particular that he still felt that the visit of Lord Perthwould have a restraining effect; he believed that Dr. Banda with his westernupbringing would want to carry through with the constitutional talks before he allowed other plans to take place. It was while he was at this meeting that Sir Robert received news of the events at Fort Hill.157. On 21st February, the Nyasaland Operations Committee, which theGovernor set up to plan for an emergency, held its first meeting. Thecommittee considered that there was nothing at present to indicate that the overall plan of Congress had been put into action. Troop movements were discussed ; and also the question of accommodation for detainees who might be arrested when an emergency was declared. At a meeting of thecommittee on the next day, a direction was given that security plans mustbe completed within ten days and special attention must be paid to a detailed operation for the pick-up of suspects, which operation must be planned meticulously.158. By 24th February a number of further incidents had occurred. Wehave recorded them ; they included the disturbance at Lilongwe at whichthe troops had opened fire. But the Governor still did not come to any finaldecision. As he saw the situation, the two factors restraining him were theneed for further reinforcements before he acted and the talks with LordPerth.159. On 25th February Sir Roy Welensky asked the Governor in viewof the further developments in Nyasaland to give serious consideration todeferring Lord Perth&apos;s projected visit. In his, Sir Roy&apos;s, view it would be wrong to hold constitutional discussions so long as Congress were de-:liberately adopting a policy of intimidation since any constitutional advancecould be represented by Congress to be a direct result of pressure broughtto bear by them. On the same day the Governor telegraphed to Lord Perthsuggesting that he should postpone his visit and saying that the situationmade an early declaration of a state of emergency inevitable. On the next day the Chief Secretary flew to Salisbury in order to make final arrange-ments for the despatch of troops ; the arrangements that he made and whichhe reported to a meeting of the operations committee the same eveninggave the Governor the assurance of those forces which he had been advisedwere necessary before he took action. So at this meeting the declarationof the emergency was fixed for the night of 2nd/3rd March. ^ On 27thFebruary it was announced in the House of Commons that the visit of LordPerth had been postponed because it would provoke disturbances.160. After the emergency was declared the suggestion was made inParliament that the Governor had acted under pressure, in particular fromSir Roy Welensky. It is for this reason that we investigated closely andhave set out in detail the factors which were operating on the Governorsmind. We are quite satisfied that we have been given all the information,oral and documentary, which bears on this point and in particular we are
satisfied that the only contribution which Sir Roy made was the expressionot opinion which we have set out in the preceding paragraph. No one, wethink, will suggest that it was a point on which he ought to have keptsilent. The Congresses in the three territories were closely associated bodies and the object of the &quot; summit conference &quot; to which we have referred inparagraph 138 was to concert common action ; the way in which a threatfrom Congress in any territory is met is the concern of all three territories and of the Federation as a whole. Sir Roy&apos;s fear that any constitutional advance would be represented by Congress as a victory for a policy of violence was not an imaginary one. This is shown by the speech of Mr.Y. K. Chisiza in Northern Rhodesia two days before Sir Roy expressed his opinion. We have quoted from that speech in paragraph 139, the passage in which Mr. Chisiza said that negotiations would not do and that Congressmeant to create disturbances all over the country. After this Mr. Chisizawent on:  &quot; Now, you will be pleased to know that already the British Govern-ment in London is shaking ... the Britishers are sending Lord Perth. . . usually all they do is let Lennox-Boyd or whoever it is announce the reforms from London, but now they understand that the situationin Nyasaland is a delicate one. They can&apos;t afford to do that. otherwise the whole country is going to be in bloodshed. Now they are sendingLord Perth to try and persuade Dr. Banda, beg him, to let his peoplecool down and perhaps ask him to compromise &quot;.Sir Roy&apos;s intervention was not directly on the question of whether or not an emergency should be declared. But by this time in the Governors mind the choice lay between Carrying on with the constitutional talks and de--claring a state of emergency, so that the two things were bound up together.We have no reason to think that the Governor did not give to Sir Roy&apos;sexpression of opinion the weight which it obviously deserved ; but equallywe have no reason to think that the decision to postpone the visit anddeclare a state of emergency was not his own. He did not make up his mind until a week after the Commissioner of Police, who under him was responsible for the security of Nyasaland, had pressed for immediate aotion ;and during that week the most serious disorders occurred.Section 2.  Evidence showing a policy of violence161. The evidence now available about the meeting on 25th Januarycan be placed in four categories. The first is that of the police informers,whose accounts are based largely, if not entirely, on hearsay. The secondcategory consists of statements made and evidence given by detainees.These are all first hand accounts from people who were present at the meet-ing. All detainees were interrogated in the first few days after their arrivaland some made statements ; the majority of these subsequently appeared before us and withdrew their statements. Many of them said that the statements had been obtained by physical violence or the threat of violence.Some of these allegations struck us as implausible but we did not investigateany of them in detail; we did not place sufficient weight on any of the statements involved to make it worth our while to do so. They lackedweight first, because of the fact that they were withdrawn, and secondly
because of the circumstances under which they were made. We were satisfied that conditions at some of the places of detention this maynot apply to more than the early days when there was a high degree ofimprovisation were such as to offer a strong temptation to anyone to say what he thought his interrogators wanted to hear if he thought that it wouldbe likely to secure his release. Although there is no satisfactory evidencethat any of the interrogators made any threats (except by drawing attentionto Emergency Regulation 47 which makes it an offence, punishable withimprisonment up to seven years, to refuse to furnish information requested by an authorised officer) or offered any inducements, we think that in most cases they probably succeeded in conveying the impression that silencewould not do the detainee any good and that a helpful statement might.The third category consisted of documentary evidence. The fourth categoryconsisted of what happened, and what did not happen, after 25th january and the inferences that can properly be drawn therefrom. You will appreciate that the Government had to act on the evidence in the firstcategory (which we regard as being the least valuable) and little else ; theevidence in the second and third categories and most of the evidence in thefourth was not available until after 3rd March.162. The most valuable class of evidence, so far as it went, was thethird. We have already mentioned the significant documents. They arethe itemised notes made after the meeting (paragraph 100); the lettersrelating to black lists (paragraph 105); the documents relating to holdingmeetings without permission (paragraph 105) these are significant because we were definitely told by Congress witnesses that holding illegal meetingswas not regarded as non-cooperation and was not discussed on 25th January ;and the letter of 2nd February from Mr. Chipembere to Mr. Chiume(paragraph 97). We have already said all that need be said about thefirst three; we shall now quote and comment on the relevant passage fromthe fourth. Mr. Chipembere wrote: &quot;The agenda was secret and I am afraid I must avoid committing it in writing just now. In short, I canonly inform you that for the first time, Congress adopted &quot; action &quot; as theofficial policy and &quot; action &quot; in the real sense of action.&quot; The explana-tion offered by Mr. Chipembere himself about &quot; action in the real sense &quot;is that it referred only to the decision to adopt a policy of non-cooperation.We cannot accept this as plausible. We can understand that such a decision might be secret in the sense of private, but not so secret that it could notsafely be mentioned in a letter to Mr. Chiume. There was nothing illegalabout it; Dr. Banda and Mr. Youens had openly discussed the possibility.Mr. Chipembere said that he feared the letter might fall into the hands ofthe police. But if he was being so excessively cautious as not to mention theword non-cooperation, it is hardly likely that he would have admitted tothe part he played in the Zomba riot on 20th January. Then we had toask ourselves what was the real action that Congress had adopted &quot; forthe first time&quot; ; was it likely to be nothing more exciting than the non-cooperation that everyone had talked about and everyone was agreed on?And what would Mr. Chipembere regard as worth describing as real action?
The quotations we have already given from his utterances show the sort of thing he is likely to have had in mind; when he emphasized it was actionin the real sense, we are quite satisfied that what he was referring to was something more than passive resistance.163. Any finding about what Mr. Chipembere is likely to have thought and said is of importance because there can be no doubt that in the absenceof Dr. Banda he dominated the meeting. We have already given amplereason why we cannot accept his protestations that he never mentioned oreven thought of violence as a political weapon. It is more difficult to deter-mine how far he is likely to have been prepared to go. Three years before this in a letter written to a friend on 10th December 1955 while he was stilla District Assistant at Dedza, he referred to Mau Mau. He was thenevidently still considering what position he would take up on the question ofthe withdrawal of the Federal M.Ps.  He wrote: &quot; My view is that withdrawal can only be useful if Nyasaland is reallygoing to be extracted. If it remains in the Scheme, then withdrawalof M.P.&apos;s will only result in worse conditions for our brethren, and indeed for the whole country. Any man who wants to propose with-drawal must put forward also a concrete and practicable plan for thecomplete extraction of Nyasaland. My belief is that any such planmust include something quite akin to Mau Mau, for the extraction of nyasaland cannot be accepted by the White Settlers and their Govern-ments except by catastrophic pressure.&quot;It would be unfair, we think, to treat a reference of this sort in a private letter as if it were a declaration of policy. Moreover, later in the sameletter Mr. Chipembere referred to events in the Sudan where he said thatthere was a &quot; Graduates Convention &quot; which drafted a constitution whichwas presented to the British Government as a basis for negotiation for self-government and did it so well that it was accepted by the British Governmentalmost without alteration. Mr. Chipembere pointed out to us that theletter had been written in 1955 and said that he had changed his views after he became a member of the Legislative Council in March 1956. But MauMau denotes to most people cold-blooded murder; it seemed relevant to enquire to what extent something akin to murder had been in Mr.Chipembere&apos;s mind, even if only as a possibility which he had abandoned.Mr. Chipembere insisted that to him Mau Mau meant no more than ostracismand said that whereas he once believed in ostracism he now no longer did so.   We did not believe this.164. Many other detainees gave evidence to the same effect as Mr.Chipembere. They said that all that was resolved upon at the meeting wasnon-cooperation, that violence, in which they did not believe, was nevereven mentioned and that there was no talk of black lists or of holdingmeetings without permission. It was plain that this was &quot; the party line &quot; ;most of these witnesses had, when interrogated, admitted that violence andeven murder were at least discussed without disapproval. All this and more were retracted ; and by &quot; and more &quot; we mean that many witnesses declaredthat harmless pieces of information which the interrogator could hardlyhave got from anyone except themselves had been invented by him.   The
party line was adhered to no matter what it cost in good sense; someexamples of the cost we have given in the case of the witness (paragraph105) who wanted us to believe that stooges were good men and the witness(paragraph 139) who refused to believe the sound of his own voice. Theonly use to which we could put this evidence was to draw from it theinference that something had taken place which the witnesses wished to conceal.u 165. We have therefore what we regard as a firm basis for a findingil that violence was discussed on 25th January. It consists of, first, the docu-ments ; secondly, the fact that something was being concealed ; thirdly,the inference that can reasonably be drawn from what actually happenedafterwards, for there is no doubt that violence was committed and that,particularly in the Northern Province, it was violence in a form that suggestedsomething much more than the reaction to an ad hoc situation. On top ofthis we had testimony given directly to us not a great deal of it, but some to the effect that violence, and even murder, had been discussed ; and wehad such material as we felt we could accept out of the statements originallymade by the detainees whose fresh evidence before us we disbelieved. we did not therefore need to use this additional evidence except for the purpose of trying to find out how far discussion and decision had gone. We have set out in paragraphs 99 and 100 our conclusions about this. We did not need to rely at all on the evidence of informers.166. When we had reached the conclusion that a policy of violence wasadopted at the meeting and that Mr. Chipembere, Mr. Chisiza and theCongress leadership generally was a party to it, we next had to make up our minds whether Dr. Banda who was not there authorised or assented toit. There was no direct evidence to show that he did. But we had totake all the circumstances, and especially his position as the President-General of Congress, into consideration and ask ourselves three questions.1. Was Dr. Banda&apos;s absence from the meeting deliberate, and did heknow what was going to be discussed and decided?2. Was he taking care not to know what was being decided?3. Was he throughout in complete ignorance of what was going onbehind his back?The answer to all these questions depends very largely upon the impres-sion which we formed of Dr. Banda as a witness and as a man from what we knew and had been told about his character. The answer to thefirst question depends almost entirely upon that; and we answer it by saying that we accept Dr. Banda&apos;s account of how and why he v/as absentfrom the meeting. For reasons which to a considerable extent we havealready indicated we find the relationship which Dr. Banda&apos;s evidenceshows to have existed between himself and his principal lieutenants to be quite a convincing one. We have given careful consideration to the other two questions and we think that the answer lies somewhere between them.We think that Dr. Banda would never have approved a policy of murderand that he would have intervened decisively if he had thought that it was so much as being discussed. We think that he was quite honest in say-ing that he did not approve of violence in principle. But we think alsothat he had come to regard some degree of violence as inevitable ; hewould do his best to restrain it but he could not always succeed   It
would indeed be very difficult to succeed, for a policy of civil dis-obedience, which Dr. Banda was prepared to enforce, requires, as he must have known very well, a much higher degree of discipline and restraintthan the average of his followers possessed.   Dr. Banda made his own position clear that he would accept arrest, and he exhorted others tofo:follow him; but he did not, as he once frankly said (paragraph 84) excludeviolence and he never condemned it categorically.  It was this inaction onDr. Banda&apos;s part which made the meeting of 25th January possible.   If jhe  had been known  to have  condemned violence  unreservedly, Mr.Chipembere&apos;s proposals could not have succeeded.   If every official of congress knew that Dr. Banda disapproved of violence in every form,those proposals would have failed.   We think that the ordinary officialdid think, and could reasonably have thought, that Dr. Banda would notdisapprove.  We shall give some examples later of the sort of vaingloriousboasting that Congress supporters indulged in ; and we have little doubtthat the stoning and other conflicts with the police which had taken place,not to mention the riot after the affair of the Zomba women, which Dr.Banda left unrebuked, had been represented by the more militant leadersas victorious action which Dr. Banda approved of.   We doubt indeedwhether Mr. Chipembere would have gone as far as he did if he had thought that Dr. Banda was irrevocably opposed to violence in all cir-cumstances.   We think that he and the others knew quite well that theycould not get Dr. Banda&apos;s approval in advance to what they proposed;but we think also that they could reasonably hope that he might bebrought to accept it after it had happened, particularly if it couldplausibly be represented as a response to provocation or as the over-.enthusiasm of the young. It is conceivable too, that if it brought resultsthat paid, Mr. Chipembere might have felt that any opposition by Dr.Banda could be overruled ; but that is to speculate about the extent ofhis loyalty to Dr. Banda and there is no need for us to do that.167. We thought Dr. Banda to be a frank witness. He gave us the impres-sion that he was probably aware of the danger that Mr. Chipembere andothers like him might go further than he himself would approve; but thathe felt that he was doing as much as he could reasonably do and going(to the limits of what was practicable by discountenancing any violencewhich was brought to his notice. He said that he several times had to restrain his supporters from acts of violence after his meetings ; we gave an example at Mzimba in paragraph 62. You will have observed alsothat although he himself condemned what happened at Karonga on 19thFebruary he expressed a doubt about whether he could get the Committeeto adopt the same attitude. In the course of his evidence he gave someanswers which we quote below and which illustrate the impression we received from it as a whole that he was uneasy about the possibility thatviolence might be advocated about which he did not know.&quot; Q. You would not exclude the possibility of doing things behindyour back of which you did not approve? A. Just now I would sayit is possible, but I would not say it is probable. People could do that if they thought I was too moderate. As a matter of fact someof them sometimes did.* * * * -
Q. Was Chipembere one of those people who entertained ideas of violence from time to time? A. Not to my knowledge not in mypresence anyway, definitely not. He has been accused in the white paper of that, but he denied it to me.* * * * *Q. &quot;. . . action in the real sense of action.&quot; What do you think that means? A. I cannot explain that. I cannot explain that atall.   Quite frankly.   I am just being honest.* * * * *Q. Did anyone come and tell you anything about that (i.e. massacreplot)? A. Nothing at all, and I tell you why. If anybody has evermentioned anything like that, I know nobody would do, if they had,they knew far too well my attitude, and they also knew the type ofmen they were handling, if they had done that they would not telime that, because they knew I would not have it. I said I was nego-tiating, and that is that.&quot;Section 3.  Evidence showing a murder plot168. There are two main differences between the effect of the meeting aswe have found it to be and the effect as stated in the White Paper. We have found that violent action was to be adopted as a policy, that breaches ofthe law were to be committed and that attempts by the Government toenforce it were to be resisted with violence. We have found further thatthere was talk of beating and killing Europeans, but not of cold-bloodedassassination or massacre. That is the first difference. The second difference is that we do pot think that there is anything that can be called a plotnor, except in a very loose sense of the word, a plan. Branches wereencouraged to resist the enforcement of the law and ways were suggested ;but we do not think that anything more detailed than that was planned.The White Paper and the intelligence report upon which it is basedsuggest a plot, worked out in reasonable detail, of which the principlefeatures were:  1. That a committee was appointed to take over in the event of Dr.Banda&apos;s arrest,2. That the action hinged on R-day, and3. That the assassination of specific persons was planned and theresponsibility for it assigned.169. We may note here that R-day in Nyasaland has a recognised mean-ing well known to African civil servants. The term was first used in agovernment circular dated 25th April 1958. Under the constitution of1953 certain government services which up till then had been the responsibilityof the Nyasaland Government were taken over by the Federation. Thecivil servants who were employed in them were seconded to the service ofthe Federal Government for a period of five years. In most cases this period was due to expire on some day in 1959 depending on the exact date ofsecondment. It was arranged that if on the day following the five year period
the civil servant had not transferred to the Federal service and could notbe re-absorbed in the territorial service he must retire. That day, the circular said, should for convenience be referred to as R-day.170. There is only one witness who deposes to all three features andwho attempts to describe the meeting as resulting in a neat series of decisions. That is the informer upon whose report the intelligence report is based. Only one other witness mentions R-day (referring to it as Red day)and no one else at all mentions the appointment of a substitute com-mittee. Three other witnesses, all detainees, refer to assassination havingbeen discussed, but none of them suggests any decision about how itwas to be executed. There were circumstances about all these others which cast doubt on the value of their evidence and on their veracity. Oneof them, the one on whom the special branch placed most reliance ascorroborating the main informer, was called by both sides, being willing at different times to oblige each, and was in our opinion a man who was readyto say anything that he thought at the time would further his interests. Themain informer obtained his evidence from a branch chairman. Eleven dayselapsed between the time when he got it and the time when he gave it tothe special branch. There is a double danger about this sort of evidence,even assuming the essential honesty of both parties. There is a danger thatthe first speaker may be embroidering for the sake of sensation; and thereis the danger that the second speaker, particularly if he has thought about it for eleven days, may be adding still more to the original story. We sawand heard the main informer and found his evidence most unconvincing.171. By contrast with the sparseness of the positive evidence in favourof the plot, there is a vast quantity of negative evidence. This is not the type of case in which negative evidence proves nothing in favour of either side. If a plot of the sort alleged had been hatched at the meeting, no person there could have missed it; and inevitably it would have been thehighlight of his story; everything else, cutting telephone wires, black listsand the rest of it, would have faded into insignificance. It is quite clear from what we have heard that to obtain evidence in confirmation of theexistence of the plot was the object of every interrogator. Every witnesstherefore who speaks of violence and yet fails to depose to the existence of aplot to assassinate and massacre on R-day is a witness against it. The offices of Congress and the houses of every officer were searched on the morning of3rd March and no document was discovered to corroborate the existence ofthe plot. The writer of the itemised notes must have missed it. Even in Mr.Chipembere&apos;s letter, &quot; &apos; action&apos; in the real sense of action &quot; is a mild term inwhich to describe the upheaval which would be caused by the assassination ofthe Governor and his chief officers. The events that happened thereafter offer no corroboration. The violence that occurred had nothing to do with R-day.No attempt at assassination was ever made; notwithstanding that there were considerable districts which for a time were controlled only by Congressgangs, no European was ever killed, though upon one occasion (see para-graphs 217-218) one was at the mercy of the mob.172. A good deal of criticism was directed at what were said to beinherent improbabilities in the murder plot. Is it likely, it was asked,that conspirators would have spent time in discussing unlawful meetings
in the bush and offering themselves for arrest, as stated in paragraph 24 (a)of the White Paper, if their real plan was to murder the Governor and all his officers? The answer suggested is that the two things were separatedby R-day passive resistance before R-day and murder afterwards. Butif the plan hinges in that way on R-day, it is extraordinary that only two witnesses claim to have heard R-day mentioned. It may suggestthat someone, making up the story of murder and knowing that civildisobedience had been discussed, inserted R-day so as to make sense ofthe two things. Then it is pointed out that under the first phase of theplot that before R-day all the natural leaders of Congress might berequired to offer themselves for arrest and so would be out of action whenthe important part came; that the committee appointed to run congress on Dr. Banda&apos;s arrest consisted of people likely to be arrested with him and included Mr. Chiume who was known to be out of the country; andthat the delegates, whom everyone knew to consist mainly of branch chair-men and secretaries, were told to go home and report to branch chairmen and secretaries.173. Then it is said that the Congress leaders were too intelligent to suppose that violence would pay. Here, we think, a difference may bedrawn between the sort of violence that Mr. Chipembere and Mr. Chisizasponsored and the sort of plot with which they are credited. They are certainly intelligent men who must have known that they could not succeed in taking over the government of the country by assassinating the governor and his Council. &quot; That would have been tantamount to declaring war &quot;as Mr. Chisiza pertinently observed, &quot; You cannot kill a representativeof the Queen and expect the people in the United Kingdom to take thewhole thing lying down. After all we had the example of Kenya before our very eyes &quot;. Nor do we think that Dr. Banda could have been expectedto swallow any possible explanation of it. For this purpose the violencemust not be indefensible. It must be done in response to government measures and must be something which could be represented as an answer to provocation. It is now being said in Nyasaland that the blood shedwas that of defenceless men and women. That can be made into notincredible propaganda, whereas assassination and massacre would wreck thecause.Section 4.  Extent and effect of Governments belief in murder plot174. For all these reasons we have rejected the evidence, such as it is, forthe murder plot. We must now consider to what extent the Governmentsbelief in the supposed existence of a murder plot affected its policy. Ithas not proved at all easy to ascertain to what extent the Government was convinced of its existence. Quite apart from the murder plot, everyone inthe Government felt that the declaration of the state of emergency was justified by the attitude which Congress had adopted and by the disturbanceswhich had taken place before 3rd March. Accordingly, the Governmentnever had to look at the murder plot in isolation or sought to make up its mindhow far it justified any particular measure. No one at the centre of Govern-ment positively disbelieved in the murder plot; but no one appears to havebelieved in it with sufficient intensity to allow it to colour his actions. Thus,on 20th February the Chief Secretary exchanged &quot; the usual complimentsover a cup of tea &quot; with the man who, according to the White Paper, there
was reason to believe had a month before directed his assassination; and said that he had made an impression on him by threatening the suspension ofthe constitutional talks. Five days later, on 25th February, an appreciationwas prepared of the internal security position in the Northern Province. It was prepared in the light of the intelligence report of 13th February and of allother relevant factors. Karonga was the district in which by far the worstviolence had already occurred and in which, as was afterwards shown,the Congress hold was stronger than in any other. The appreciation of the&quot; possible future intentions&quot; of Congress in the district is worth quotingbecause it turned out to be remarkably accurate. &quot; They will continue tohold meetings and to advocate all forms of illegal action including riots and damage to property but stopping short of incitement to murder.Undefended government officers may well be subjected to violence in the districts. The possibility of better organisation to co-ordinate simultaneousriot activities in different centres must not be overlooked.&quot;175. A murder plot obviously would be the best justification for thedeclaration of a state of emergency and, one would have supposed, thebest argument for convincing all shades of opinion in Nyasaland of itsnecessity. But no reference at all to it was made in the broadcast at 7 a.m.on 3rd March ip which the Governor gave his reasons for declaring astate of emergency seven hours before. He said:  &quot; I have taken this stepbecause of the action of the leaders of the Nyasaland African Congress. Ithas day by day become increasingly apparent that they are bent on pursuing a course of violence, intimidation and disregard of lawful authority . . . .Under emergency powers the principal organisers of the campaign of violence and unlawful demonstrations are being arrested and will be detained &quot;. Asimilar statement was made in a leaflet for distribution to the public through-out Nyasaland on 3rd and 4th March and also in a circular issued to all government employees on 3rd March by the Chief Secretary. In a specialletter to chiefs the Governor referred to the Congress plan of violence andto a number of the incidents which we have already recorded but saidnothing about any murder plot. In a statement made on 6th March theGovernment referred to &quot;a carefully prepared Nyasaland African Congressplan, designed to disrupt government services, and to destroy communica-tions and to bring about widespread violence directed against property andlives&quot;. The word &quot; murder&quot; was first used on the following day, 7thMarch, when a government leaflet said, referring to the arrest of congress leaders ^ &quot; the Government has done this because these leaders had madea plot to destroy property and to murder many people both Africans and europeans &quot;. On 9th March the Governor directed that no information should be disclosed of the Congress master plan unless it was authorised by him. On 11th March he directed that action should be taken urgently tobuild up the full story of the Congress plan. This no doubt was in preparation for his despatch which was published in the White Paper on18th March and which sets out almost the whole of the plan.176. In the House of Commons references to massacre and murder andto plots were being freely made on 3rd March, by yourself and by Mr.Amery, the Under Secretary of State. We understand that you had receivedthe intelligence report of 13th February. On the evening of 3rd Marchyou said that a massacre was being planned. Later in the debate Mr. Amerysaid there was a conspiracy of murder and he referred to Mau Mau and toa blood bath.
111. The Government view, as expressed to us, was that the murder plotwas a possibility rather than a probability, but something which had to betreated seriously and taken into account. We have no doubt that it was treated seriously but it is difficult to put into words how it was taken intoaccount. If the Government had had no information about a murder plot,we believe that they would still have declared a state of emergency on or about3rd March. None of the measures taken to give effect to that declarationcan be isolated and stated to have been included because of the supposedexistence of a murder plot. We have found no evidence that any particularmeasure was made more severe because of the belief that the Governmentwas up against something in the nature of Mau Mau. We cannot find,for example, that the list of persons to be arrested was made any more extensive than it would otherwise have been. We think that before therewas any suggestion of a murder plot it had been contemplated that allbranch officials of Congress should be&quot; arrested in the event of an emergency.The decision to suppress Congress we think, owed more to the belief thatits continued activities were making government impossible than to the feeling that it was, or might be, a terrorist organisation. On the whole therefore we think that belief in the murder plot did not materially affect the con-ception of government policy. When the time came to prepare the justifica-tion for government policy, the murder plot began to play a larger part;no doubt it was natural to make it the frontispiece of the story. Butpeople naturally asked themselves why, if it were true, the Governorhad not referred to it when he declared the state of emergency. Wehave found that the effect of this upon opinion in Nyasaland (we are notreporting upon opinion anywhere else) has been unfortunate. Most Africansare incredulous on this subject and the attempt to involve Dr. Banda inmassacre and assassination is generally thought by those who have seen orheard him to be ridiculous. We have found that the publicity given tothe murder plot has distracted attention from the real strength of theGovernment^ case against Congress. This is particularly unfortunate inthe case of moderate opinion, by which we mean Africans who do notbelong to Congress or are not on its extreme wing and those europeans and Africans in the Church of Scotland mission who support Congress in the belief that its policies are not violent.178. We have said that the belief in the murder plot did not materiallyaffect the conception of government policy. But it may have affected theattitude of mind of the policy-makers towards the members of the organisa-tion which they were suppressing and it may have affected too the attitude ofthose who had to execute the operations which were set in train. Did theordinary European policeman or special constable think that on the morning of 3rd March he was arresting the potential murderers of his wife and children. If so, that fact might offer an explanation, if not an excuse, for some of the incidents which we shall record below. We havenot found any witness who would endorse the view that this belief mightexplain any unnecessary degree of violence that was used after 3rdMarch ; it was suggested that if there was anything of the sort, it was more likely to be typical of the state of tension which had grown up betweenthe races before 3rd March.  The fact is however that some knowledge of
the supposed murder plot had penetrated to quite a wide circle. We do notthink that anyone below the Provincial Commissioners was officially in-formed, but it was left to the discretion of the Provincial Commissionerwhom he told ; and if he told the District Commissioner, then, to thelatter&apos;s discretion how far it went below him. In some districts special branch officers were the source of information. The position thereforevaried from district to district but we are satisfied that in some districtsevery police officer and most of the special constables had heard talk of thesupposed plot.
PART VOPERATIONS: 3rd to 6th MARCH, 1959Section 1.  Emergency powers179. We have already said that on 21st February the NyasalandOperations Committee was set up to direct operations during the emergency.Beneath it in each province there was a Provincial Operations Committeeand in each district a District Operations Committee. The Provincial Com-missioners and District Commissioners were chairmen of their respectivecommittees. In dealing with orders given and action taken by them, weshall not find it necessary to distinguish between their function as Com-missioners and their function as Chairmen of their Committees.180. The first operation that was planned was called &quot;Sunrise&quot; becauseits intention was to pick up at or shortly before first light on 3rd March the208 persons whose names were on the Governors list of hard-core detainees.The general terms of the &quot; Sunrise&quot; operational order were settled by the nyasaland Operations Committee on 27th February. Each province and dis-trict (had its quota of police and military and each pick-up operation was to beundertaken by a separate body of men numbering about half a dozen. Theneed for strict secrecy was emphasized because, it was said, surprise was vital to success. The arrested men were to be taken at once to prisons which hadbeen established at two airports, Chileka for the Southern Province andLilongwe for the Central Province. Since there was no convenient airportfor the Northern Province, the men arrested there were to be taken toNkata Bay prison ; at Nkata Bay the m.v. Mpasa, one of the vessels sailingon Lake Nyasa, would be waiting to take the detainees to Chipoka orSalima, from where they would proceed by road to Lilongwe airport. Atthe airports the detainees were to be handed over to the Federal autho-rities for transport by air to Federal prisons outside the Protectorate. Assoon as the pick-up operation was over the security forces were to engage in active patrolling to guard against any violent reaction and to secure theapprehension of any of the wanted men who might have been missed.181. On the basis of this general order the Provincial Commissionersissued their own orders to their various districts with some amplifications.The Southern Province^ order, for example, stressed the need for speedas well as secrecy; the pick-up teams must return to base as soon aspossible so as to consolidate to meet any possible reaction to the pick-up.It was also directed that, if time permitted, all documents found in thehouse of the detainee should be seized and a searcher was provided with each party. The general order directed that persons obstructing the pick-upoperation should be arrested but that the apprehension of detainees was totake priority. The Southern Province&apos;s order amplified this by saying that&quot;arrests of obstructors should be avoided though they can be otherwise
dealt with &quot; ; this addition suggests that they should be dealt with sum-marily on the spot, but no case in which such action was in fact taken was reported to us. The general order said nothing about handcuffing thearrested men except that they would be handcuffed on the aeroplane. Prac-tice in this respect varied in the different provinces. In the southern province handcuffs were almost invariably used ; in the Central Provincetheir use seems to have been the exception; in the Northern Province theprovincial order directed that it should be done and that if enough hand-cuffs were not available alternative methods of securing the detainee shouldbe used.182. You may wish to be reminded of the main provisions in the Emer-.gency Regulations which justified these orders and also of some of theprovisions of the ordinary law which it is useful to have in mind when considering the operations of the security forces recounted in this part ofour Report. The Emergency Regulations which the Governor made on 3rd March in pursuance of his powers under the Emergency Powers Orders-in-Council, 1939 and 1956, are an elaborate code giving him extensivecontrol over persons and property in the Protectorate. In particular, heis empowered to arrest and detain any person without charging him withany crime or bringing him to trial and the detainee may be kept in a prison or in any other place. In the Governors view it would not have beensafe to have kept the hard-core detainees in prisons in Nyasaland and thatis why they were being sent to Federal prisons outside the Protectorate.The detention orders, as they are called, fall into three classes.(1) A Governors order. This is so called because it is made by theGovernor personally and the power to make it is not delegated.It authorises detention for an indefinite time, though at the endof every six months the Governor is obliged to consider, &quot; havingregard to all the circumstances of the case&quot;, whether it should remain in force and if so to what extent. The Governor maymake it whenever he is satisfied that it is necessary to do so forthe purpose of maintaining public order.(2) 28 day order. Any authorised officer may make this class of order provided that he has reason to believe that there are grounds for a Governor&apos;s order. It authorises detention for 28 days, pre-sumably so that the Governor can make up his mind whether thereare grounds for an order by him. The regulation does not say whether or not this sort of order is renewable by the authorisedofficer.  In some cases the period of 28 days has been repeated.(3) Detention pending inquiries. If a person on being questioned byany police officer or soldier or anyone else authorised for the pur-pose, fails to satisfy the questioner as to who he is or why he iswhere he is and the questioner reasonably suspects that theperson has acted or is about to act in a manner prejudicial tothe public safety etc., he may arrest and detain him pendingenquiries. The period of detention depends upon the status of theperson arresting and other conditions; it cannot be more than seven days hut in all cases may be up to 24 hours.  This class of91
order was used most extensively in the operations which we shallhave to consider in Part VI of this Report.The only other regulation which we need mention, at this stage is onewhich gives to any police inspector and to any soldier of the rank of warrant officer and above power to disperse any assembly, meeting, procession orgathering whatsoever of three or more persons in any place whatsoever andto use suoh force as may be necessary for the purpose.183. The Emergency Regulations contain no special provision aboutthe manner of making the arrests which they authorise and we understand the view of the Government to be that the officer arresting has thesame powers and is subject to the same obligations as if he were arrestingfor a crime. We therefore draw your attention to the Criminal ProcedureCode section 17 which provides that the person arrested shall not be sub-jected to more restraint than is necessary to prevent his escape. We are told that in Nyasaland the ordinary practice is to use handcuffs on arrest.184. There are various offences both under the ordinary law and underthe Emergency Regulations with regard to offensive or dangerous weapons.The statutory definition is wide; it includes specifically an axe, hatchetor stick and generally any article or thing &quot; suitable for causing injury to the person &quot;. The law appears to class these as weapons irrespective oftheir use. As Nyasas are so largely engaged in agriculture, they are necessarily provided with a lot of tools which in the eyes of the law are alsoweapons and some of which of course are capable of causing serious injuryif misused, for example, axes, hatchets, choppers and pangas. As well aspangas, Africans generally have an axe or chopper for cutting wood.In the remoter areas they use spears and bows and arrows against animals ;many of the older men carry a spear or stick as a matter of course. Ninetyper cent of African men normally carry a knife. A firearm is of course a dangerous weapon and requires a licence; 4,665 guns, of which over 80 percent were shotguns, were licensed to Africans at 23rd April 1959.185. The Governor in Council has power under the ordinary law (PenalCode sections 70 and 72) to declare a society to be dangerous to thegood government of the Protectorate and thereupon it becomes unlawful.He did so in the case of Congress on the morning of 3rd March and thereafter any person who was a member of it was liable to imprisonment for up to seven years.186. It is evident from the orders that were given about the &quot;Sunrise&quot;operation and the size of the force that was sent to arrest each man thatthe Government anticipated violent resistance. In fact there was almostnone. The great majority of detainees came quietly as soon as they were called for. A dozen or more who were not at home when the policecame, gave themselves up voluntarily later that day or in the followingdays. In about a dozen cases, most of which we record below someresistance was offered. This is not surprising when it is considered thatthe house was broken into in the hours of darkness and the householder
had no way of knowing the character of the intruder. There are onlyone or two cases in which the facts suggest that resistance was knowinglyoffered to the forces of law. There was only one case, the one we are going to describe in the next paragraph, where there was a rousing of theneighbourhood followed by bloodshed. The Government was howeverright in thinking that the arrests would be strongly resented. The troublecame later in the day ; and that it did not come at the time of the operation was no doubt due to the speed and secrecy with which it was carried out.Section 2.  Arrest of Kachigulu187. Kachigulu is the headman of a village of the same name in the fort Manning district. The party sent to arrest him was a large oneconsisting of eight K.A.R. under a captain and four constables under an inspector and was led by the D.C. The party went to his house and he was notthere. They began to search it and a crowd began to form. Then Kachigulucame back from a funeral which he had been attending. The D.C. methim, said that he was being arrested under the Emergency regulations and told him to come quietly, which he did. He was asked where hisshotgun was but would not say; he pointed to the people round about and said : &quot; These are my guns &quot;. He was thereupon handcuffed, either becausehis reference to guns was thought to be threatening or because his refusal to give up his shotgun was considered to be uncooperative ; the hand-cuffing caused the people to get discontented. Kachigulu was taken intohis hut so that he might get extra clothing to take with him ; and while he was there, the crowd increased to about 50 or 60 and people begancoming in from surrounding villages. Accounts differ as to whether anyof them had any weapons; it is clear that at most there were not morethan a few pangas. But the attitude of the crowd was hostile. they said: &quot;Why are you taking our headman? You cannot take him withouttelling us why &quot;. This attitude caused the captain to feel that the party should leave without bothering about the shotgun and the extra clothesand he called to the inspector to bring Kachigulu out of the hut. The D.C.then read the Riot Act. He told the crowd to go away because Kachiguluwas being arrested but he still did not tell them why. They said : &quot; Thisis war&quot;. Kachigulu said to them: &quot;Let them kill me but you go home in peace &quot; ; hut this did not quieten them.188. Meanwhile the captain had formed up his party ready to leave andthe D.C., after reading the Riot Act, handed over to the military. the captain asked the D.C. to tell the crowd that if they did not go awayhe would shoot. The D.C. did so and his sergeant-major did likewise, bothspeaking in Chinyanja. Then a group of young men from one side of the crowd came walking slowly round. The captain heard them say theywere going round to the back and he understood from this that they would try to cut the party off. He lifted the Sten gun which he was carrying and held it in the firing position by way of warning, but they took no notice and when they got to about 20 yards from him, he fired and killed theleading man. He immediately swung round and found that from the centre of the crowd men were rushing towards him and he fired again. He fireda third time, a burst of fire so as to frighten and not to hit, at a group93
who appeared to be coming in from further away. The party then gotaway without further incident, leaving behind them one African killed andone wounded.189. There is not much in this evidence that points to an intention onthe part of the crowd to use force in an attempt to release Kachigulu ; the crowd was almost unarmed and the pick-up party was a strong one. the captain&apos;s judgment of the situation was based upon the principle, whichwe have already mentioned in paragraph 81, that the military must neverallow even an unarmed crowd to get too close. On this principle thequestion whether the captain acted rightly or not depends upon thereliability of his impression that the men who were walking round to hisflank intended to cut him off and to try to get to grips with him. We aresatisfied that all three of the witnesses we saw the captain, the inspectorand the D.C. honestly believed that the party was in danger.Section 3.  Dr. Banda&apos;s arrest190. We think that you would wish to know the manner in which thiswas effected. Elaborate preparations were made for it and a large forceassembled which consisted of: -(1) An assault group, platoon of P.M.F.(2) A support group, platoon of K.A.R.(3) A diversion group, six men under a police inspector.(4) A snatch party, six men under a police inspector.(5) An escort group three special constables.(6) A search group, two special branch men.The diversion group rushed the servants quarters at the rear and the assaultgroup rushed the house. About 60 men sleeping round the house andassumed to be a bodyguard fled leaving behind them itwo bows and arrows,four catapults, one spear, twelve batons and knobkerries, three axes andsundry metal bars. The front door was forced with an axe. It opens into thesitting room where the snatch party found Mr. Y. K. Chisiza lying on thesettee. He led them to the bedroom occupied by Dr. Banda who was asleep.Dr. Banda was refused permission to dress but was allowed to put on adressing gown and he was then taken to a waiting landrover. The house wassearched, all locks being broken open with an axe or bayonet. Dr. Bandawas not handcuffed until he got to the aeroplane. A suit of clothes, but nounderclothes, was taken so that he could dress at the airport.Section 4.  Other &quot; Sunrise &quot; arrests191. Chikafds arrest. We propose now to set out without comment thefacts relating to a number of arrests which we investigated. Chikafa&apos;sarrest took place in the Mlanje district. He is a man of about 40 andnot strongly built. He is an elder of the Church of Scotland and we have heard nothing to suggest that he is a man of violent habits. The partysent to arrest him consisted of a police inspector, three special constables andthree police sergeants.  The arrest was effected at 4 a.m. on 3rd March.
The inspectors evidence was that he entered the room where Chikafa was,which was of course in darkness, and flashed his torch on Chikafa. he saw that he was out of bed and was stooping down. The inspector didnot tell him who he was or what he had come to do but hit him with hisbaton, aiming for the shoulder. The inspectors explanation, which we found most unconvincing, of why he did this was that he thought Chikafawas bending down to get a weapon ; no search was made for any weaponafter the arrest. The inspector said that this blow had no effect. Hewas a large and powerful man and he next caught hold of Chikafa andthrew him towards the door, six or eight feet away, with sufficient force so that he crashed into one of the speoial constables who says that hewas just coming through the door at the time. The constable says thathe thought that Chikafa was trying to escape so he hit him on the headwith his rifle butt. In his first report of the incident the inspector said thatChikafa was &quot;strongly resisting arrest&quot;. Chikafa was then carried to thelandrover and on his arrival at the police station two hours later he stillappeared to be unconscious and was carried into it. A medical examina-tion made at the prison showed that he had sustained four wounds on thehead, two three-inch lacerations and two one-inch lacerations, which re-quired to be stitched. Chikafa says that he was held down on the bed andbeaten. We think that this is probably exaggerated, but the wounds on hishead suggest that he was beaten even more severely than the police admit.192. Arrest of Lumbe. This took place in the Cholo district at 4 a.m. on 3rd March. The pick-up party consisted of three special constables, oneof whom was in charge, one soldier of the R.R.R. and one African constable.They entered the room in which Lumbe slept with his family. He was stand-ing on the bed and his family was asleep on the floor. The special constablein charge told Lumbe that he was going to be arrested and was required atthe Boma, but did not tell him why. Lumbe flung himself at the wall of thehut which collapsed. He shouted for help and was tackled by four men with whom he struggled. None of the four men was injured ; Lumbereceived three two-and-a-half inch lacerations of the scalp down to thebone, but the skull was not fractured.193. Arrest of Nikodimo. This took place in the Cholo district at.30 a.m. on 3rd March. The party effecting it was not the same as thatwhich made the earlier arrest in this district but was similarly composed. Itconsisted of three special constables, one of them being in charge, one soldierand two African constables. Nikodimo was arrested and handcuffed withouttrouble and put in the back of a landrover. He was given no reason for hisarrest. We quote from a special constable&apos;s evidence : &quot; We were sent out to arrest him and that was our job ; we did not have to tell him anything aboutwhy&quot;. In the landrover he began shouting about freedom. He said:--&quot; Do you call this freedom? &quot; and that sort of thing. He also tried to getup. He was struck three times with batons by two special constables. Theblows were given together without waiting to see what effect the firstone had. Handcuffs were then put on his ankles. There were six menin the back of the landrover with him who could have restrained him andwe were given no reason why, if it was necessary to handcuff his ankles,that should not have been done without his being hit.
194. Arrest of Nanseta. This was also an arrest effected in the Cholodistrict, but not on 3rd March. It took place two days later at 3 a.m. on 5thMarch. Nanseta was the village headman and there were some grounds forthinking that his arrest might cause a disturbance. He was believed to havebeen responsible for the procession which was encountered on the Cholo-Luchenza road on 3rd March (see paragraph 205): He was said tohave been &quot; extremely violent&quot; in 1953 ; the evidence produced for thiswas a conviction for counselling and procuring the unauthorised use of land,for which he received six months imprisonment. The arresting partyconsisted of the A.D.C. who was armed with a pistol and five special constables armed with batons. They found Nanseta in a house with one small room with his wife and three children. He was standing up butundressed ; the party had made a noise beforehand as they had gone tothe wrong house and a dog had started barking. The A.D.C.&apos;s evidence was that he told Nanseta that he was being arrested and tried to tell himwhy but Nanseta started shouting. He wrestled with a special constablewho tried to get him outside ; and then when he was got outside he struggledwith the other constables and was shouting all the time. While he wasinside he was given two blows with batons on the head ; and when he wasgot outside, they gave him eight other blows about the middle of the body and the legs so as to keep him quiet. One of the special constables was an ex-policeman and presumably used to making arrests. Nanseta was still naked when taken outside. It is not suggested that in the courseof his wrestling and struggling he managed to injure any of the special constables ; medical examination at the prison showed that he had threetwo-inch lacerations of the scalp and one two-inch laceration of the leftshin all of which had been stitched. Nanseta&apos;s story is that four special constables came in and started beating him. We are not satisfied that hebegan shouting before he was struck. We think that the A.D.C. expected himto give trouble. There was some evidence that there might have beentrouble if Nanseta&apos;s removal had been delayed. On the way back the partylost their way in the dark and the A.D.C. was twice struck with a stick by men he did not see. The second time it happened he fired off his pistol andafter that there was no further trouble.195. Arrest of Ziba. In the Northern Province, resistance was offered in the case of two arrests. One of these was Ziba at Loudon, whoappears to have been thought of generally as a violent man though no act of physical violence is alleged against him. The arrest tookplace at 3.30 a.m. on 3rd March and the pick-up party consisted of the A.D.C., one special constable and four African policemen. Thefour policemen, two of whom were P.M.F., were said to have been toonervous to take any part in the arrest which was conducted by theA.D.C. and the special constable. A pane of glass was broken to effectan entry and this roused Ziba who started yelling and shouting; he openedthe door a fraction and then shut it again. The A.D.C. broke down the door and entered and found Ziba with two sticks, each about five feet long,one in each hand, which he waved at him. Owing to the noise, it slippedthe A.D.C.&apos;s mind to say what he was there for. Ziba did not advance to
attack and the A.D.C. approached parrying the sticks with his rifle. Some-how they got outside where the special constable joined in and struckZiba on the head with his shotgun so that it shattered and both barrelswere discharged in the air.  The A.D.C. hit him on the head with a batonwhich broke ; and then again with the butt of his rifle. Ziba did not isucceed in hitting either opponent with his sticks.196. Arrest of Muhoni. This occurred on 3rd March in the Mzuzudistrict. The arresting party consisted of an African sergeant and constablewith a special constable in charge. The special constable knocked at the door and Muhoni opened it and then at once tried to shut it again but theconstable stepped in. Before the special constable could say who he was,Muhoni attacked him. He had a torch fixed to a band round his head.Muhoni pulled the band down and they fought each other with their fists.Then they got Muhoni into a corner and subdued him by striking him twiceon the head with a pistol. Nobody was badly hurt. Afterwards Muhoni kepton saying &quot; I did not know &quot;.197. Arrest of Mazunda. This is the only case in which the detainee wasarmed with a weapon which might have inflicted serious injury. The arrestwas effected by an African sub-inspector, Mr. T. Mwalukuwo of the NkataBay police. Mazunda had an axe but the sub-inspector did not begin byfearing the worst because as he said, Mazunda &quot; is a business man having astore just near by the roadside and he thought perhaps we were criminalscoming to break his store &quot;. The sub-inspector&apos;s method of dealing with thesituation is in contrast with some of the methods we have recorded above and we think it is worthwhile giving his account of it in the terms of hiswritten report. The phrase in it &quot; the District Commissioner is not myrelative &quot; is a little puzzling ; the sub-inspector thought that by it Mazundameant to indicate &quot; that he was not in favour to hear about the name ofthe District Commissioner&quot;.  The report runs as follows:  &quot;Acting on instruction received, on 3rd March, 1959, at 3.10 a.m.,I with Police party of four constables proceeded to Chapalapatavillage, Sub-Chief Timbili, N.A. Mankhambira in Nkata Bay district to arrest Lameck Mazunda under Detention Warrant. At 3.45 a.m.,we arrived at the village and found Lameck Mazunda outside his house. Having seen us walking on towards him, he also walked ontowards us very fast and when approached him I noticed he was holding an axe in hundle in his right hand. I was in front of theparty and walked nearby him and at the same time he lifted up theaxe against me by means of making himself ready for any struggleevents. I and the Police party were all armed with rifles but none of us attempted to use the fire-arms upon him. I then bravely andpatiently went on nearer to him and asked him about his name. Inreply he shouted &apos; I am Lameck Mazunda! &apos;. I then produced a detention Warrant to him and as I had a torch with me, I read the contents therein to him both in tumbuka and English as he appearedto understand English. I told him that I was an authorized officer to arrest him and detain him in lawful custody and that The Nyasaland
African Congress was declared unlawful Society in the early hoursof that particular day by His Excellency the Governor of Nyasaland.He asked me &apos; Who issued the Warrant&apos; I told him that it was theDistrict Commissioner of Nkata Bay and in reply he said &apos; D.C. is notmy relative I have not committed any offence that I can be arrested and detained in prison&apos;. I said: that is an order received. At thisstage he was still lifting up the axe against me. I talked to himpolitely so as to make him a bit sleepy and I then soon grapped his right hand together with the axe and arrested him. I handed overto him the detention Order but he entirely refused to receive it. Wethen took him to Nkata Bay Police Station with the axe. At 4.50 a.m.,we arrived with him at Nkata Bay Police Station where he was thendetained in lawful custody at Nkata Bay Prison. Lameck Mazundamade no struggle after arrest.Sgd.     T. Mwalukuwo, S/Insp.&quot;198. Arrests in the Mzimba district. We have said that the NorthernProvince order required all arrested persons to be handcuffed or otherwisesecured. This order went down to the District Commissioners who had a discretion as to how they should execute it; and the general instructions inthe Mzimba district permitted arrested persons to be handcuffed, tied at theelbows and at the ankles and gagged. The majority appear to have been treated in this way. This included a party of four, all of whom had comequietly on being arrested. They were handcuffed, trussed and gagged andthen put into landrovers and taken to the Eutini road junction which hadbeen arranged as a meeting place. The four men were picked up at different points. There was only the one pick-up party to cover the four points so the landrovers had to follow a circular route, the total distancebeing 120 miles. The party was taken, still tied up, from the Eutini junctionto Mzuzu. One of the four was a Presbyterian minister and the other avillage headman. Two of the landrovers were open ; the prisoners&apos; conditioncould therefore be seen. The minister, who was also an active and out-spoken member of Congress, was the Reverend Henry Makwakwa who hadbeen arrested at his manse. He had been a chaplain in the K.A.R. for two years and he was described by the camp commandant at Kanjedza,who knew him, as &quot; a very good front line padre &quot;. The same witness alsosays that on arrival at the camp (this was 4 days later) Mr. Makwakwa&apos;s armswere bruised.199. Another party, similarly treated, consisted of those who took thelorry from the Loudon mission, we shall describe this incident in para-graph 240, and were arrested on their way to Mzimba in the afternoon of 3rd March. One of these was a Congress leader, Chunga, who wasdown to be arrested; it is not known why the other three were arrested ;one of them was Msyali, the mission driver, who claims he thought thelorry had been hired ; he was released on 16th April. These four werehandcuffed, trussed and gagged and loaded into a truck at 5.45 p.m. to goto Mzuzu. The escort consisted of one special constable who was driving,another special constable and two African constables.  The journey was
a difficult one, as the lorry became stuck in the mud, and lasted until3.10 a.m. The escort said that the prisoners became &quot;restive&quot; ; they saidthat because they were tied they could not sit up properly and were thrown on their faces at the bumps. While the truck was being got out of themud, they had to be unloaded and put on the ground ; the escort said they were lifted out; they said they were thrown out. When they werebeing reloaded, they asked to be let loose ; this was refused and they were told they would be beaten if they caused trouble. Some were found to havebitten through their bonds, and they were retied.200. Another man, Nkoma, who was arrested by the District Commis-sioner himself, came without giving any trouble. His wife was arrestedwith him in case she might give the alarm ; and after two miles was dropped out and left to walk home. Nkoma was handcuffed and had his hands tied ; but he was not gagged except when going through Mzimba,because the D.C. thought he might have shouted to the populace.201. Conditions in the m.v. Mpasa. Since we are covering the &quot; Sunrise &quot;operation up to the point at which the detainees were handed over to theFederal authorities, we shall include a description of the conditions on them.v. Mpasa. Prisoners travelled in the hold. The master unfortunately didnot know the dimensions of the ship but from other information v/e think thehold must have been about 50 feet long, 20 feet wide and 12 feet high. it contained as well as the detainees 84 tons of cement in paper bags. This was laid along the bottom of the hold and covered by a tarpaulin. At the topthe hold is completely covered in with planks, which form a deck and canbe taken off when cargo is worked. At sea the planks are covered by two tarpaulins which are wedged down. While the prisoners were inthe hold these tarpaulins were kept wedged down when the ship wasin port or during the night time ; but during the day while at sea, twoof the corners were opened up so as to let air in. There was electriclight in the hold. A privy was brought in from the prison and placed in the hold. There were no blankets. The prisoners in the holdwere not handcuffed. The ship arrived at Nkata Bay about 6.30 a.m.on 3rd March and took on board a few prisoners about 7.15 a.m. Owingto the trouble there she did not leave Nkata Bay until 10.40 p.m. when she had on board nine prisoners. At 2.0 p.m. on 4th March she arrived atKaronga where she took on board eleven more detainees. She then returnedto Nkata Bay where she arrived at 9 a.m. on 5th March taking on board55 further detainees. These 55 included the parties from Mzimba who hadbeen taken to Mzuzu as described in paragraphs 198 and 199. The 55 hadbeen taken from Mzuzu to Nkata Bay early that morning being handcuffedor bound with wire (where handcuffs were not available) for the journey.Thus the ship left Nkata Bay with a total of 75 detainees on board. Shearrived at Chipoka on the morning of 6th March and the detainees weredisembarked at 10 a.m. The first few had therefore been in the hold forjust over three days and three nights. The 55 who were embarked whenthe vessel called at Nkata Bay the second time, were in the hold for aday and a night. Most of the 75 proceeded, we presume, by road toLilongwe airport.   We have no information about their journey.   Twelve
of them were sent by rail to Limbe. They sat on the floor of the train in the centre of the gangway under an armed guard ; the journeywas long as the train was considerably delayed and they did not arriveat Limbe until 11.30 p.m. on 6th March when they were handed over tothe prison authorities.Section 5.  Blantyre: 3rd March202. We have concluded our account of the &quot; Sunrise &quot; operation andits execution and must now pass on to the next phase which began allover the country about 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. as the news of the widespreadarrests became known. Except in Blantyre, the reaction in the southern province was less strong than in any other. There was an almost completestrike of civil servants in Zomba which had apparently been organised theday before on the rumour that Dr. Banda was to be arrested. In Blantyrethere were disturbances all the morning and the police were kept very busy,at one time having to deal with seven separate crowds. Firearms were used against the crowds on only one of these occasions. On this occasion the trouble began about 8.30 a.m. when two patrols of special constablesfound road blocks being erected in the Ndirande Road. They saw Africanschopping down trees. There was stone throwing from both sides of theroad, where the long grass and mealies made very good cover, and also from in front. The stone throwing was heavy; some of the special constables were hit and their trucks were badly damaged. They fired tenshots overhead but without any effect. Another patrol of special constablesarrived with the deputy commander of the special constables in charge.The deputy commander was a man with previous police experience in hong Kong and in London and he has since been transferred to the regular police force with the rank of inspector; as a matter of convenience weshall refer to him as the inspector. He at once took command and was,in our view, competent to do so. He estimated the crowd at about 200.mostly armed with spears, axes and the like. He first used tear smoke whichwas not effective. Then an African threw a spear which struck a specialconstable with the butt end. The inspector considered that a baton charge was impracticable because it was open country and the special constables hadno shields. He ordered four riflemen to fire one round apiece. He himselfpicked out as a target for the rifleman on his left a man with a spearwho was saying that the European bastards should go away and thatthey had stolen Dr. Banda. This man was shot and killed and the crowdthen started to disperse. A second man however jumped up on the roadblock with a hatchet and looked as if he was about to throw it; he also was shot.203. About the same time on the Kirkcaldy Road just outside Blantyre aplatoon of P.M.F. under the command of an assistant superintendent meta large crowd, mostly carrying weapons, proceeding down the road. Theywere proceeding slowly with men in front walking backwards and wavingthem on. If they were allowed to continue further down the road theywould come to a railway bridge. The superintendent wanted to dispersethem before they got there as he thought that once they crossed the bridgethey might spread out into the town.  He read the Riot Act, which had
Blantyre: 3rd Marchno effect. There was a man in front shouting. &quot; Kill the white settlers,chase them away &quot;. The superintendent could not use tear smoke becauseof the wind. He ordered a baton charge and the crowd dispersed. Itwas then found that a man had been struck on the head and killed. Thisis the only case in which a man was killed in a baton charge. TheP.M.F. platoon involved in this incident was the last to be raised and had only had two months training.204. There was a number of other cases of road blocks and damage to property in Blantyre and many cases in which crowds were dispersed bythe police without the infliction of serious injury. We select one othercase as an example of what was going on. At 10.15 a.m. the platoon ofP.M.F. that had been concerned in the Kirkcaldy Road incident was sentto Kanjedza to investigate the burning of vehicles. They found one land-rover on fire and about 30 people setting fire to another one. The policefired one shot at this group of 30 without hitting anyone and the groupran away and joined another crowd of about 100 further up the road.The police advanced and stones were thrown at them. The crowd was told to disperse without effect. The superintendent fired one shot which he believed wounded a man, but he was not sure, and then the crowd ranaway.Section 6. Cholo-Luchenza road : 3rd March205. The only other noteworthy incident on this day in the southern province was on the road from Cholo to Luchenza. A party under the command of a police inspector and containing a number of special con-stables encountered a crowd marching from Luchenza towards Cholo. Thisis the procession which we have already referred to (paragraph 194) andwhich was believed to have been organised by Nanseta. The inspectortold the crowd to disperse; they did not and he used tear smoke. While thesmoke was taking effect, the inspector was organising a baton charge. an african, swinging an axe across his body, came round from the side andgot to within two or three yards of the inspector who did not notice him at all. He was not rushing at the inspector and from the way in whichthe incident was described to us we do not think that he intended to attackhim. A special constable fired at him and hit him in the leg. If theconstable had shouted a warning to the African or to the inspector, itmight have turned out that there was no need to shoot, but the constablefelt that there was no time to do that and we do not think that he can beblamed. The African was later charged with being in the possession ofan offensive weapon, but not with any more serious offence, and he wasconvicted and sent to prison.Section 7.  Zomba : 4th March206. On 8th April 1959 there appeared in the London &quot; Daily Herald &quot;an article entitled &quot; The terror that broods over Africa&quot; in which anincident that occurred in Zomba on 4th March was described. our attention was drawn to the article by the Government who regarded the statements in it as grossly exaggerated.  They furnished us with a report
on the incident by the Zomba D.C. and invited us to enquire into it. Wecommunicated with the editor of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; and in due coursereceived from the author of the article, a memorandum setting out, so faras he thought it proper to disclose them, the sources of information uponwhich the article was based. We shall describe without comment the factswe found about this incident. An African called Barton was seen to beloitering on the verandah of the post office. The post office had been declared a prohibited area under the Emergency Regulations on the day before and consequently the African was committing an offence. He was told to move off by the postmaster. He went across the road to the headquarters of the public works department. The post office was guardedby a detachment of the R.R.R. in charge of an N.C.O. The N.C.O. sawBarton dragging another African away from outside the P.W.D. office. Itis not quite clear what Barton was trying to do ; it was suggested to us that he was intimidating the other African, presumably to dissuade him from doing any work for the P.W.D. This may be so but there is no real evidence of it and although Barton was later charged with severaloffences, intimidation was not one of them. The N.C.O. got two ofhis men to get hold of Barton, called out the rest of the guard andsummoned in a police patrol that happened to be passing and which wasunder the command of an assistant superintendent. The superintendentfound Barton in a corner of the vestibule of the P.W.D. building being heldby two soldiers and the rest of the guard round him with rifles and fixedbayonets. Barton was screaming. A woman clerk in the P.W.D. office,who came out of her room to see what was happening, described it as&quot; non-stop crying similar to that of a person suffering from meningitis &quot; ; itcaused her to be greatly distressed. The D.C.&apos;s report says that whensurrounded by the R.R.R., the African started shouting and creating adisturbance. We think that an African who was screaming in this fashionwas probably hysterical and that, as he was surrounded by soldiers, with fixedbayonets, the hysteria may have been due to fright; the doctor whoexamined him at the police station at the end of the incident said that hewas extremely hysterical and that an injection which would have knocked out an ordinary man, served only to quieten him. The N.C.O. told the superin-tendent that Barton had been acting suspiciously and that they last saw himdragging away an African and the superintendent told us that in view of thecircumstances and the noise the man was making he decided to arrest him forbeing a disorderly person whose actions were likely to cause a breach of thepeace. He placed his hand on Barton&apos;s shoulder and told him to come.Barton hit him in the chest, enough to knock him off his balance, and made adive for the door. The superintendent got hold of him and they managed topropel him through the door but on the verandah he twined himself roundone of the steel supports and continued shouting and screaming. Eightpolicemen tried to pull him off but were unable to do so, the superintendentsays, so they &quot; tapped &quot; his knuckles with a baton. While they were trying to get him away from the verandah he was also struck across the thighwith a baton ; why this was done the superintendent did not know. Thepostmaster, who came out because of the noise, was shocked by the volumeand pitch of his screams. They prised him loose and four or five mentried to get him into a landrover.   He broke away and made for the
P.W.D. building. The superintendent ran after him and hit him with a longbaton. He says that he aimed for his right shoulder but in fact he hithim on the side of the head. The blow caused a laceration two inches longwhich required three stitches. He was then finally captured and taken tothe police station. He was charged with conduct likely to occasion a breach of the peace and also with resisting arrest; he pleaded guilty and wassentenced to four months imprisonment.207. The author of the article in the Daily Herald obtained his storyfrom a Scottish missionary who got it from an eye-witness. The authorsays that he checked the facts with a special constable and a member ofthe regular police who saw the incident but that he could not disclosetheir names without a breach of confidence. He was not therefore ableto give us any reliable information which added to what we had alreadygot. In the article it is stated the African was &quot; beaten to the point of death &quot; ; this is obviously an exaggeration. The article also states that a white woman clerk who witnessed the incident was sick; this is presumablya reference to the woman we have mentioned who did not in fact seethe beating at all. In his report the D.C. states that he was satisfied thatno excessive force was used in the arrest. When he made this comment,the D.C. knew all the facts set out above except the evidence which showed that the man was suffering from hysteria.Section 8.  Miomba&apos;s court: 5th March208. This was the gravest of the incidents which took place in theSouthern Province; it resulted in six Africans being killed and another sixbeing wounded. It was also one of the few incidents in which a body of africans offered pitched battle and one of the two occasions in which afirearm was used against the police. On 3rd March sub-chief Mlomba&apos;scourt had been attacked and badly damaged, the reason being no doubtthat the chief had joined Congress and then later resigned from it. on 5th March a patrol, consisting of a P.M.F. platoon, a platoon of K.A.R.and a small police party went to make arrests in connection with this incident of 3rd March and they returned with a number of prisoners. Ontheir way back they encountered a road block defended by about 200Africans armed with spears, pangas and sticks. The P.M.F. platoon whichwas in front of the party debussed and formed up 50 yards from the roadblock. Stones were thrown at them. The inspector in charge gave a warning to the crowd but there was a great deal of noise. He then formedup a baton party but before it could charge the crowd had advanced on it.An African on the side of the road was firing a shot gun. The inspectortried to shoot him with his Sten gun, but it jammed. He ordered twopolice riflemen to fire one shot each but it is not known whether either hit.Tear smoke was used without effect. The baton party which was engagedwith the crowd was being fought so hard that the inspector thought themto be in danger and withdrew them. He then ordered four men to fireone round each at the crowd which cleared it from the centre of the road.But they came down from the side and began to approach the truckswhich contained the prisoners. He formed up the riflemen on each sideof the vehicles and ordered them to shoot at anyone who got to within
ten yards of them. They fired about 20 rounds and the inspector himselffired six shots with his revolver ; this at last made the crowd draw off andretire to some buildings beside the road. But although the crowd withdrewit did not disperse. The A.D.C. saw it being harangued by a man in agreen shirt and in order to prevent further attack he asked the K.A.R.to shoot him. A soldier fired and missed the man in the green shirt butit was thought that he hit another man. The whole thing took only five or six minutes. There was a great deal of firing and there were found at the end to be the twelve casualties we have recorded. There is no reliable evidence to show exactly how any one of them was caused. Two shots were firedfrom the African&apos;s shotgun but no one was wounded.Section 9.  Port Herald: 6th March209. On 6th March there was an incident of a different sort at thestation at Port Herald. The District Commissioner had information thatsome Congressmen would be holding a meeting in the evening at the stationbuildings. So he sent a party of ten men, including four of the R.R.R.,under the command of a police inspector to round them up. The inspectortold the R.R.R. men that they were to surround the building and to arrestanyone they found in the vicinity or whom they saw leaving the house. he told them that if such a person attempted to escape, he was to be shot.He says that he explained to them that &quot; attempting to escape &quot; meant ifanyone who had been captured tried to break away or if his rescue wasattempted ; but it is doubtful if he made this clear to the men. Whenthey arrived there, the inspector went into the building and searched it,while the men moved round to surround it. As they moved round, a man who was sitting outside against the wall, got up and began to run away.The R.R.R. men called on him to stop but he did not do so. They allfired, one of them twice, five shots in all, and the man was hit in thethigh. He was seriously wounded ; he was still in hospital on 26th Junebut was said no longer to be seriously ill.Section 10.   Thornwood estate: 7th March210. This is a tea plantation in the Mlanje district. On the morning of 7th March a man called Mambo who was employed on the estateand who was also the local Congress secretary was arrested, and later inthe day a crowd gathered at the Thornwood dispensary. A party consist-ing of fourteen police under a superintendent and a platoon of R.R.R.commanded by a lieutenant went to disperse the crowd. The party was accompanied by a special constable, Mr. Mcllroy, as magistrate. they found the crowd which was armed with spears and similar weapons erectingroad blocks and when they arrived the crowd demanded the release ofMambo. Mr. Mcllroy explained that he had been arrested as a Congressmember and had left the district. Mr. Mcllroy then told the crowd toshift one of the road blocks which they had been erecting and they did so. He then told them to shift another and then a man, who seemed tobe a ringleader, started to dissuade them. The police made a baton charge and the superintendent broke his baton on the head of a man who was
Thornwood estate: 7th Marchwaving a knife. The military were drawn up behind the police, waiting to go into action if necessary, and the lieutenant was in front. TwoAfricans approached him, one with a spear running at him and saying&quot; You will die &quot; ; they got to within ten feet of him when the superintendentfired at one with his revolver and the lieutenant at the other. Neitherfell but they may have been fatally wounded. The superintendent firedthree shots into the crowd so as to extricate the baton party and thiscleared the road immediately in front, but stones were still being thrownfrom both sides. The superintendent then asked the military to take over which they did. The lieutenant ordered a sniper to shoot an African whowas rallying the crowd. This man was shot and fell and later died in hospital. In all there were two deaths.Section 11.  Mkanda&apos;s court: 3rd March211. In the Central Province the first incident on the morning of 3rdMarch arose because a crowd had assembled to enquire about the arrestedmen. They collected at the chiefs court and demanded to know from him why their leaders had been arrested. The chief said that if theyhad been arrested by the police, they should enquire from the police.The crowd demanded that he should give them a letter to take to the Bomaand the chief refused to do this. The crowd moved to the chiefs houseshouting that they would kill the chief, and they did considerable damage to his house and to the court. One of the chiefs councillors was struckon the head with a stick and slightly wounded. Eleven days later aCongress member writing about Mkanda&apos;s area to a friend, said:  &quot; Itswhere we have rough people &quot;.Section 12.  Mponela : 3rd March212. A crowd of about 500, mostly armed with axes, pangas, and knob-kerries, met in a canteen at Mponela about 2 p.m. At 3.30 they came out to in front of the police post, where there were only three or fourpolicemen unarmed. They talked threateningly about damaging the post.About 5.15 the DC with a police party of about eight under a policeinspector arrived. The spokesman of the crowd said they were the com-bined branches of the Mponela and Madisi Congresses and they had cometo find out what had happened to the leaders arrested that morning. TheDC. said they were no longer in Nyasaland and that the crowd should return to their homes. There was much dancing, stamping and singing of congress songs ; and there was talk of going down to Dowa to release the prisoners. A few bricks were thrown at the police post but no damage done, though it was afterwards found that the wires between the police post,and the post office had been cut. This went on for about two hours. the crowd then dispersed but a large section of it going down the road met aplatoon of K.A.R. on its way north to Lilongwe and this caused them to assemble again. The D.C. joined the K.A.R. party and read the Riot Act.The crowd did not disperse, but as there was a section trying to persuade the others to go home, the K.A.R. did not open fire. The D.C. told them thatif they would disperse quietly he would meet them again on the Friday
Mponela: 3rd march next at Kawere, a place about four miles north of Mponela. This satisfiedthe majority ; but a nucleus refused to go away and the Riot Act was read again. They then retreated and the K.A.R. followed them up anddispersed them without opening fire.Section 13. Yisanza : 3rd March213. At Visanza there is a small police station in which there are nevermore than two or three constables under a sergeant. At 2 p.m. on 3rdMarch a crowd of between 150 and 200 men, armed with spears, axes, hoesand bows and arrows came up to the station. The first thing that thesergeant, who was inside, knew about it was when he saw a stone comingthrough the window. It so happened that just at this time one of theconstables who had been out was returning to the station. When he came up to the crowd they attacked him. He was struck with a weapon which made a hole in his steel helmet. He was seriously wounded in the headand had other wounds as well; he was in hospital for some time, though he had recovered by May. He tried to defend himself with his baton whichbroke and he succeeded in getting into the station. The sergeant came outwith a gun, found the crowd all close up to the station and shot and killedthe nearest man. The crowd then dispersed. It was found that the deadman had a big knife and stones in his pocket.214. This is plainly a case of a crowd armed to make an attack and carrying it out. The object may have been to release prisoners at thepolice post there was in fact one prisoner and he escaped during the incident or it may have been simply to attack the post. A letter writtensix days later by a Congress member gives a strong indication that this attack was stirred up; it also gives an illustration of the wild and vain-glorious way in which these people wrote, and doubtless spoke, as well.He describes Visanza as being &quot; another catastrophe for the police&quot; andgoes on: &quot; During the war which was between police and rioters two ofthe constables were chopped down to death, but the trouble is you neverI know how many have lost their lives on the sides of Europeans and theirservants.&quot;215. The A.D.C. heard of this attack on the police post and, accom-panied by a special constable, arrived there just after the crowd had dis-persed. They set off in a car in the direction which they thought the crowdhad taken. They came to a road block which held them up and 50 to100 people came out from the side of the road and stoned the car. Neitherthe A.D.C. nor the special constable was injured but the car was dented,the A.D.C. used a pistol, which misfired, and he told the constable to fire.The constable fired four or five shots over their heads but that did notdeter the crowd from coming nearer. Then the constable picked out the leader and hit him in the shoulder and then he aimed at another leaderwhom he thought he hit.  The crowd then dispersed.Section 14.  Chisepo: 4th March216. Between 1 and 2 p.m. on 4th March a platoon of K.A.R. underthe command of a captain was on patrol.   It was accompanied by a police
inspector and three African policemen. They found many road blocksand they were able to arrest three men who were carrying assegais andbicycle chains. They met a White Father coming in the opposite directionwho told them of many more road blocks ; he said that the men besidethem had told him that they would allow him through but not themilitary. Then when they got to Chisepo, which is a small village, they found a crowd of about 200 armed, mostly with axes and knives, but some with bicycle chains and other made-up weapons, and one or twowith bows and arrows. The patrol was halted about 20 to 30 yards fromthe crowd and the inspector advanced. The crowd demanded that heshould release his three prisoners, which he refused to do. He read theRiot Act and gave them five minutes to disperse. After about threeminutes some began to move away and a man came forward out of the crowd and asked the inspector to wait while he tried to persuade the restto disperse. So the inspector waited and about 50 more went. Then the inspector advanced again and gave them another five minutes. Duringthis time there was a great deal of shouting and waving of weapons, butthere was no sign of attack and also no dispersal. The captain countedout the minutes and produced the banner with the warning on. When thetime expired he ordered a sniper to fire one shot and that killed a man.Just as the shot was fired, a knobkerry was thrown which slightly injuredan askari on the arm.  After the firing the crowd dispersed.Section 15. Attack on Mr. Bundy : 4th March217. Mr. Bundy is a European forestry officer and early in the morning at 8 a.m. on 4th March he set out in his car with an African forest rangerto go to Monjezi, six miles north of Mponela on the Kasungu road. Onthe way he found a road block ahead with a crowd near it. He swervedoff the main road to get round the block but he had to stop the carbecause of a ditch. He and the ranger got out and the ranger filled inthe ditch while Mr. Bundy stood guard with a shot gun. The crowdthrew stones at the car, also an axe and a hoe, but did not stop themgetting the car across the ditch. They went on and came to a secondroad block. They found an Indian there whose truck had been stoppedin front of it. The three of them moved the block and they all continued.Then they came to a third road block. They stopped their cars about15 yards from it. An African came out from the side of the road unobservedand punctured the wheel of Mr. Bundy&apos;s car; then about eight or a dozenAfricans came out on to the road. Since Mr. Bundy&apos;s car was out of action the ranger transferred his gear to the Indian&apos;s car while Mr. Bundy keptthe crowd off with his shot gun. While this was being done the crowdincreased to 20 or 30. One man put his hand on the butt of the shotgun and Mr. Bundy hit him with the barrel. Then the three of them got into the Indian&apos;s car and reversed back to the second road block. Butthe second road block had by then been rebuilt, so that they found them-selves caught between the two blocks. Some of the crowd followed thereversing car, others stayed behind to smash Mr. Bundy&apos;s car and came up later. The Indian and the ranger disappeared and Mr. Bundy found himself with his back to a tree, being hit at with sticks and axes and trying
Attack on Mr. Bundy: 4th march to keep his attackers off by using his gun as a stick. Someone grabbed thebarrel and forced the gun to the ground ; the gun went off and the remainingcartridge went into the ground. Mr. Bundy went down and was struckon the head. For a long time, about an hour, he laid on his face, coveringhis head with his hands and was beaten all over the back. As he lay therethey came up and struck him from time to time.218. After a while he got up and he was allowed to go and sit in theIndian&apos;s car. Then a man who revealed himself as a Congress leader arrivedand said that he was going to hold a court of inquiry to find out whyMr. Bundy had assaulted Africans. Mr. Bundy and he had a discussion about this which developed into a talk about politics, conducted in quite a friendly way, so that when another man turned up and tried to incite themob to beat Mr. Bundy again, the Congress leader stopped it. He then asked Mr. Bundy where he had been going to and Mr. Bundy said that hehad been going to see a friend at Monjezi so as to make sure that he was still all right. The leader clearly knew about everything that was going onin the area and told Mr. Bundy that his friend was still unharmed. Hethen offered to take Mr. Bundy to Mponela. He got his bicycle andsomebody lent Mr. Bundy a bicycle. They were just going to start offwhen a detachment of police and military came down the road fromKasungu and Mr. Bundy walked towards them. The police dispersed thegroup of Africans with batons and made three arrests. Mr. Bundy&apos;s skullhad been very slightly fractured ; although severely shocked, he was ableto leave hospital after two or three days. He had as well a wound onthe arm and very severe bruising all over his back. The writer whom wehave quoted before in paragraph 214 wrote of this incident also in anexaggerated and gloating way. &quot;The unlucky chap fell a victim to mycourageous people who if they were rifle armed would break the record ... hesustained great injuries which, but for the K.A.Rs., would have sent himback to his ancestors &quot;.Section 16.  Mponela: 4th March219. The detachment we have just referred to was under the command of a Kasungu inspector and was on its way from Kasungu to Mponela. after it had rescued Mr. Bundy it went on its way, arrived at Mponela and spentthe two hours after its arrival in dispersing crowds without incident. Whiledoing this the party broke up, dispersing crowds in different parts of thetown and about 4 p.m. the inspector was left with two special constablesand three African constables; the special constables had guns and the policebatons. With this force he met a group of 15 to 20 men carrying spears,axes and pangas. He ordered them to stop and they went on to theverandah of an Indian store about ten yards from where the police were.He decided that he would make arrests and he told them to put theirweapons down, which they refused to do, though they showed no signsof active hostility. The inspector said that if they did not put down their weapons he would count three and shoot. He had decided to shootbecause he did not consider that he could send his police in with batonswhile the group were still armed.  His ultimatum had no effect and he
fired three shots with his revolver, missing with the first two and possiblyhitting with the third. If he did make a hit, it was not obvious, becausethe man he aimed at did not fall but continued shouting. The inspectorthen ordered one of the special constables to fire ; this man was armed with a Sterling gun which the inspector had given him. He fired at a man and at first thought he had missed so that when the man started to run,dropping his weapon, the constable fired again and hit him in the leg.The man still ran and the constable followed a trail of blood for about three miles without success. The man came into hospital the next day tohave his wounds treated and was found to have been hit in the shoulder andthe leg.Section 17.  Mponela : 6th March220. There was, as you will have seen, a great deal of trouble aroundMponela, many road blocks and one or more gangs out to make mischief.The view of the police was that armed gangs must be dispersed wheneverencountered and whether at the time they were being aggressive or not.There are two more incidents, in this area, both happening on 6th Marchwhich we must record. The first of them was a slight affair. A platoon ofK.A.R. under the command of a major was on the way to Mponela. the major was leading the way in a landrover in which he had two of hisaskaris. He managed to come up behind two Africans, who were endeavour-vouring to replace a road block and had their backs to him, without attract-ing their attention ; he turned off the engine and cruised quietly up, tellingthe two askaris to jump out and grab the men. One of the men got away and the two askaris grabbed the other. They were holding him when hemanaged to get a hand free and drew a small knife, one with a four-inchblade. He tried to stab one of the askaris and the major fired and hit him in the leg.221. The other incident was more serious; it resulted in one death andten men wounded, though most of them only slightly. It involved twodetachments of police, each under its own inspector, one from Mponelaand the other one from Kasungu ; in order to avoid confusion we shall refer to the Mponela inspector as Inspector M and to the Kasungu inspector asInspector K ; Inspector M was in command of the joint detachment. Youwill remember (see paragraph 212) that on 3rd Maroh the D.C. had arranged with the crowd at the Mponela police post to meet them on the Friday, thatis 6th March, at Kawere. So at 2 p.m. he went there, found no one there and went on to Mponela. He was there told that a crowd of about 600,mostly armed, were waiting in the market place to see him. He went therewith the police party ; on their arrival a number of women left the crowd.The crowd was quite orderly. The D.C. said that before he spoke to themthey must hand in their weapons; and most of them did so. The D.C. thenaddressed them for about 20 minutes. He told them about the emergency,that their leaders had been arrested and that leaflets explaining the positionwere being dropped. He then gave them ten minutes in which to disperseand most of them did so.
222. But a party of about 100, who had retained their weapons, kepttogether and went about 200 yards up the road where they stopped and made a good deal of noise. The D.C. with the police party, which consisted of about a dozen men all armed with rifles and one Sterling gun, went afterthem. When they were about 50 yards away the police party halted.Inspector K fired two shots over the heads of the crowd which had no effect.The D.C. went up and read the Riot Act, which likewise had no effect.The crowd showed no signs of attacking the police but it did not move.Inspeotor M and Inspector K then moved up until they were about 40 yardsfrom the orowd. Inspector M raised his rifle and held it in position for about half a minute. He then fired at a man in the front rank who waswaving a stick. He hit him in the stomach and the man fell and diedshortly after. The crowd did not move. After a minute or more InspectorM told Inspector K to fire because, as he said, he was sickened by it.Inspector K fired twice. No one was seen to fall but the crowd dispersed.Fifty of them formed up again about 50 yards down the road. After three or four minutes Inspector K went up to them and without further warningfired another shot, and they then dispersed.223. It was afterwards found that in addition to the man shot in thestomach who died, eleven were wounded with leg injuries. Some of them were only slightly wounded and it was clear that in one case at least abullet had splintered. Medical evidence shows that these wounds could have been caused by four bullets. If this incident is looked at in isolation,it might be difficult to find evidence of a riotous purpose. The view of thepolice was that this was the hard core of a gang that had been doingdamage in the neighbourhood: some of the people who had been present at the police post on 3rd March were recognised and the police felt thatthe gang had to be dealt with.Section 18.  Rusa rest house: 4th March224. As these last three incidents all occurred in and around Mponela,we have taken them together. But there were two incidents before 6th Marchwhich we ought to record, the first of them being on 4th March at Rusarest house. A crowd of about 50 people came to the rest house and saidto the caretaker that the day before he had directed the Europeans toSanthe where they were arresting people in the pick-up. He admitted this.They beat him with a whip and bicycle chains and left him unconscious.He was severely bruised and was in hospital for a week. They did con-siderable damage to the rest house, breaking doors and windows to theamount of  50. This was clearly a gang at work because they were heardthe next day discussing the job they had done and planning another one inthe Santhe area.Section 19.   Chiwaliwali: 5th March225. This village was being searched by a police patrol who werelooking for a particular Congressman. The police inspector saw a man with a shot-gun run out of the house. He gave chase and got to withinabout 40 yards of him when the man stopped and turned round with hisgun.   He fired twice and the inspector fired five times with his revolver.
Apparently there were no hits. This incident is one of the only two occasions on which an African was armed with a gun.Section 20.  Nkata Bay: 3rd March226. We must now move to the Northern Province and record first theaffair at Nkata Bay, which was by far the gravest of any that occurred in the emergency. You will remember that Nkata Bay had been chosenas the port from which the m.v. Mpasa should transport the NorthernProvince detainees to their destinations in the south. The Mpasa had on her a small contingent from the Royal Rhodesian Regiment to act as aguard for the detainees. The master of the ship and the sergeant in chargeof the escort had not been told what they had to do but simply to placethemselves under the orders of the District Commissioner. As an assemblypoint, Nkata Bay was a place of some importance in the &quot; Sunrise&quot;operations; and it was intended that it should be manned by two platoonsof the R.R.R. These two platoons were part of a company commandedby Major Morrison which came up from Lilongwe on 2nd March and reported at Mzimba at 6 p.m. The Provincial Commissioners intention wasthat the force should leave Mzimba at 1 a.m. on 3rd March, report atMzuzu at 7 a.m. and then be sent on to Nkata Bay, where it might beexpected to arrive about 9 a.m. The distance by road from Mzimba toMzuzu is 69 miles and from Mzuzu to Nkata Bay is 29 or 43 miles depending on the road taken; the time allowed was sufficient for transport by lorryand took into account the possibility of some dislocation from roadblocks. Nevertheless, it was a stiff programme for a territorial regiment andthe arrival at 9 a.m. some three hours after dawn was running it ratherfine. But, as the Provincial Commissioner said, he had only limited forcesat his disposal and he had to take a chance somewhere; Nkata Bay hadbeen a quiet place which had not in the preceding month given any trouble.227. The force arrived at Mzimba at 6 p.m. It was not until he gotthere that Major Morrison was told that Mzimba was not his final destinationand that he was to go on to Mzuzu and report there. Two lorries with hissupplies had broken down on the way from Lilongwe and there were difficulties about refuelling. Major Morrison spoke to Mzuzu on the tele-phone at 11 p.m. and there is a conflict of evidence about the instructionshe received. In the event he did not leave Mzimba until about 5 a.m.and did not arrive in Mzuzu until 11.30 a.m., four and a half hours later than expected.
228. The Mpasa docked at Nkata Bay (a sketch is printed opposite)at about 6.30 a.m. She had on board a sergeant of the R.R.R. and elevenother ranks. The D.C. went down to the ship and explained the natureof the operation. About 7.15 a.m. a few of the detainees who had beenpicked up in the district and were then in the prison at Nkata Baywere transferred to the ship ; she had to wait for other detainees andalso for rations from the prison to be brought on board. The D.C.returned to the Boma and about 8.30 a.m. he received a telephone message from the postmaster who told him that he and his staff were beingthreatened that if they continued to work their families would be in danger.The D.C. went to the post office and found that the staff was alreadyleaving. This made it impossible for him to communicate with Mzuzuin the ordinary way. He returned to the Boma so as to get a telephonespeaker unit which he could use at the V.H.F. station and thus reportdevelopments to Mzuzu. At Mzuzu they were still without news of MajorMorrison&apos;s force. There was a platoon of K.A.R. under Lieutenant Southeywhich had been given the task of bringing more detainees down to NkataBay. It was decided that this platoon should proceed at once to Nkata Baywith such detainees as had already been collected. While he was at theV.H.F. station the D.C. saw a large crowd coming down to the town. Hetelephoned again to Mzuzu and reported that the situation was deteriorating.They told him that help was on the way but they did not say when it was expected to arrive. He had previously been told that he might expect thetroops to arrive at dawn ; on receipt of this further message he assumed that they had left Mzuzu and would probably be at Nkata Bay in an houror an hour and a half. At Mzuzu the K.A.R. platoon was ordered toproceed forthwith to Nkata Bay without waiting to collect the detainees.But it had to get hold of the necessary transport and did not in fact leaveMzuzu until 9.40 a.m.229. Until reinforcements arrived, the D.C. had a small mixed force at his disposal. The police force ordinarily stationed at Nkata Bay num-bers about 20. Some of these were away on other duties and on the morning of 3rd March there were available 14 African policemen under a police inspector. Two of these, although trained policemen, normally acted asthe bookkeeper and the radio operator and were therefore only to be usedin an emergency. The remaining 12 were armed with shields, batons andtear smoke and were trained to form a riot squad, though not of courseas highly trained as the P.M.F. Then there were eight men of the k.A.R., armed with rifles, who had formed part of the &quot; Sunrise &quot; pick-upforces and were still in the town. Finally, there were the sergeant andeleven men of the R.R.R. This was a larger escort than was needed for the six prisoners then on board the Mpasa and some of them couldbe used at other points. Four of them were sent to guard the Boma andtwo to the post office. Two out of the eight K.A.R. men were sent toguard the V.H.F. station. This left the sergeant with four men, but even with this reduced force, there could be no difficulty about guarding the prisoners whose release, as it afterwards appeared, was the declared objectof the crowd. They had been safely transported to the Mpasa and batteneddown in the hold; and she could have put out into the lake where she

could not have been successfully attacked. Even if she had stayed where she was, tied up to the jetty, the dock area was easily defensible againsta crowd which had no firearms. As you will see from the rough sketchopposite, it was surrounded by a fence, over six feet high, made of wiremesh and with barbed wire on top. At the entrance to it there were two gates, also of wire mesh, on a tubular frame and the same heightas the fence. They were each nine feet wide and met in the middle ofthe entrance where they could be kept in place by two vertical boltslowered into sockets in the road, and secured by a sliding bolt witha padlock. At this time of the morning the gates were open and the key of the padlock had been removed. But the safeguarding of the prisoners was not the D.C.&apos;s real anxiety. From first to last his chieffear was for the European women and children. This is the only clearcase we have come across of a belief in the murder plot having a signifi-cant affect on the course of events. The D.C. had heard from the special branch that at an emergency conference plans had been made to killEuropeans and he had held a meeting of European government officers atwhich he had warned them that there was some danger of assassination.His tactics were therefore to hold the crowd together, to prevent them from running loose and to use every device he could think of to keepthe situation quiet until the main force arrived.230. It must have been 9 o&apos;clock or after when the D.C. left the V.H.F.station. He went back to the Boma to get his copy of the Riot proclama-tion. When on his way there he went down to the dock again and told the master of the Mpasa to put out into the lake in the event of there being any trouble. He then went back into the township to join thepolice force at the police station ; and on his way there went past thepost office where he found that the crowd had assembled. He found thepolice inspector with his twelve men.drawn up as a riot squad on theroad between the police station and the prison with the six K.A.R. behind them. The crowd then numbered several hundreds. It was unarmed;one or two men had sticks but no weapon was at any time used. Someof their leaders may have been out to stir up trouble ; but we think thatthe great majority had come in from the countryside in order to find out what had happened to the men who had so suddenly been arrested. Butas time went on and their enquiries were not satisfactorily answered, theybegan to threaten and to demand that the arrested men should be released.231. The D.C. left his car at the police station and went back on footto meet the crowd which was now coming up from the post office to the prison, where at that time they probably thought the arrested men to be.He went into the middle of them and spoke with their leaders. They saidthat Congress had hitherto behaved itself in the district and that they couldnot understand why their leaders had now been arrested. The D.C. told them that an emergency had been declared by the Governer, that congress leaders all over Nyasaland were being arrested and that he had no powerto release them. In order to gain time he suggested that if the leaderscould find the postal staff he would speak to the Provincial Commissionerby telephone. Accordingly the whole crowd moved over to the postoffice. The DC. was thus separated from the police force ; he had not told

the inspector what his plans were nor what role he expected the police to play. About half an hour passed with the crowd at the post office gettingless controlled and the D.C. trying to pacify them. He suggested that ifthey could not find the postal staff some of their leaders should come tothe Boma where they could talk things over quietly. During this timethe word must have been going round that the arrested men were not inthe prison but on the ship. Eventually, the cry went up:  &quot; To the boats &quot; ;and the D.C. was pushed or pulled or jostled off the step of the post office on which he was standing and they all moved off down to the harbour.We do not think that at that time the crowd was really hostile to the D.C.The two soldiers who were on guard at the post office did not intervene;and when the police inspector asked them later where the D.C. was they said simply that he had gone to the jetty with the crowd.232. Meanwhile the R.R.R. sergeant had taken four of his men off theship, leaving one to guard the prisoners. Telling the four to stay in the dock area, he went into the township to see what was happening. he saw the crowd, which had by now grown to between 500 and 1,000, comingdown from the post office with the D.C. towards the front of them butsurrounded. He went back to the dock, called up his four men and closedthe gates; he then decided to leave one slightly ajar so that the D.C.could be let in. The result was that the other was secured in place only by the vertical bolt which let down into the socket in the ground. Heand his men remained inside the dock gates. When the crowd had comedown the D.C. decided to remain outside and to read the Riot Act from there. He stood with his back to the gates facing the crowd and read the Riot Act in Chinyanja, calling upon them to disperse. By the time he had finished, the crowd was right up against the gates, surrounding theD.C., and pressing against the gate that was ajar and unsecured, so thatthe R.R.R. were unable to let the D.C. through and close it. Someonereached round behind the D.C. and lifted the bolt of the other gate; andthe pressure of the crowd forced both gates slowly open against the resistance of the soldiers. Gradually the gates were pushed wide open and the crowd was being held back only by the four soldiers who had formed into line with fixed bayonets. The crowd was pressing right up against them, pushing their bayonets out of the way and edging forward.Under this pressure the line was slowly giving ground. Over an hourelapsed from the time the crowd came down to the dock gates to the timewhen, the line having been pushed back to the point where the levelground widens out into the dock area (beyond this point the sergeantwas not prepared to allow the crowd to go) and where the shooting tookplace. During all this time the D.C. was arguing and pleading withthe crowd to disperse until in the end, he was, as he says, dazed andemotionally exhausted.233. During all this time the inspector and his 18 men remained at the other end of the town, having taken up their position between the prison and the post office. There was a crowd of about 200 people movingabout in the market place; they were unarmed and not hostile. Butthe inspector felt that he must stay where he was in order to protect thepolice station and the prison and the European quarters. He did not think
it prudent to send any of his men to establish contact with the D.C. If hehad done so, he felt that it would weaken his force and he was not sure that the crowd in the market place would let them through safely.234. The temper of the crowd at the dock gates was growing worseas time went on. The D.C.&apos;s action in offering to telephone to the ProvincialCommissioner and in accompanying the crowd down to the jettyundoubtedly led some of them to believe that if they were persistentenough they would get the prisoners released, although the D.C. kept onreiterating that he had no power to release them. When the D.C. read the Riot Act, he was surrounded by the crowd and on the same level asthey were. It must be doubtful how many of them heard it, though he himself thinks that a number did because at that time, when the crowd was still outside the gates, many were on the bank by the side of the entranceand could look down on him. The leaders were passing back through the crowd what was said though possibly in a garbled version. One of themshouted that there was a message from the Queen. Others understood thatthe Queen had said that the prisoners were to be shot. We think thatsome never really appreciated the true position. One man insisted ongiving evidence at the inquest; and notwithstanding that he was warnedmost solemnly three times by the coroner that he need not incriminatehimself and that by admitting his presence in the crowd he might berendering himself liable to a sentence of life imprisonment (he was in factsubsequently prosecuted and sentenced to three years hard labour) heinsisted on giving his version: it was a story of a peaceable crowd takendown to the jetty by the D.C. to get the prisoners. After the reading of the Riot Act we do not think that anyone heard what the D.C. wassaying except those who were close up to him. But these were the people in front and therefore those who suffered when the shooting began. Weare satisfied that, so far as words could bring it home to them, they musthave known the danger they were in ; though no doubt it was not easy forthem, either psychologically or physically, to turn back. The truth is,we think, that the crowd as a whole did not believe not even right atthe end that lethal force would really be used. They thought that ifthey went on demonstrating long enough, they would get their way. Theynever tried to get their way by physical force. Once they were past the dock gates, any of them who were prepared to make a determined move,might have tried to rush to the ship. They could have got round theline of soldiery by climbing the low bank on one side or possibly byscrambling along the ramp on the other. They did not attempt this.Neither did they attempt to wrest the guns out of the soldiers&apos; hands whichthey might have done by trying to grab the barrels. Indeed, there wasinherent in the situation all the dangers that arise when a crowd gets atclose quarters with soldiers whose only defence is to shoot. During thehour or so when this situation prevailed, the crowd made no attempt totake advantage of it. But by the end they were manifesting every sign of hostility short of physical violence. They were gesticulating in the facesof the soldiers. One old woman was clawing and shrieking. They weresaying that they would die for Nyasaland, asking to be killed and at thesame time saying that they would kill too; one man said to a young
soldier that he would take the ring off his ringer when he had his dead body.If the ship had left the jetty, it would have shown the crowd that theycould not have achieved their object. Contrary to instructions, the masterhad remained where he was because he thought it necessary to provide aline of retreat for the troops. The D.C. could have sent a message tothe ship to leave. But he felt that if he had done so and the crowd had seen that their aim was frustrated, they might have run amok and madefor the European housing area. Throughout his object was to hold the crowd together either until he could get them to disperse peaceably or until reinforcements arrived.235. The sergeant is a cool and capable man with military and policeexperience outside the territorial army. He spent six years in the Britishregular army and thereafter three years in command of a riot platoonin the Northern Rhodesian police force. For the last three or four monthshe was the riot drill instructor in that force and he has had considerable experience of riot work. He was in fact at this time on long leave pendingresignation from the police. The four men whom he had with him were allyoung men who had had no training except that which the territorialarmy gives and had never experienced a crowd of this sort. They admittedlyfound it a very terrifying experience and, though none of them faltered, thesergeant had to consider how long they might be expected to hold out.For some time before the end perhaps a quarter or half an hour he feltthat the crowd could only be dispersed by force and he was urging theD.C. accordingly. He said: &quot; A few shots now should fix it&quot; and he felt then that one round might have been sufficient. But the D.C. wouldnot then agree. He spoke a second time and still the D.C. would not agree ; and then a third time, when he said that they would soon have touse force in self-defence. The position then was that the line had been forced back almost to the end of the approach road. Once that point was past and the level space widened out, it would not need any dash onthe part of the crowd to outflank the line; it would happen automaticallysince the crowd would inevitably fan out, and the line could not be extendedto hold it.236. When the sergeant spoke for the third time, the DC. took thedecision to hand over to the military. The line then marched backwardsabout 15 yards. This was done not only to get a field of fire but so that theaction of the troops could be more clearly seen by those behind. Thesergeant gave the order:  &quot; At the crowd in front, present&quot; ; and then the order:  &quot; As you were &quot;, in the hope that this demonstration might besufficient. Then he gave the order &quot; Present&quot; again, and then &quot; Fire &quot;.When the soldiers retreated, the crowd moved forward slowly ; by the timethe order to fire was given, they had advanced five yards or a little more. Thesergeant had previously told his men that when he gave the order to firethey were to fire one volley ; but if the crowd still came forward and he gave the order to fire again, they were to look after themselves and fire intheir own time. After the first volley, that was seven shots, for the sergeantfired his Sten gun three times, half a dozen or more fell, but the crowdstill came forward over their dead bodies. It may seem surprising that acrowd which had for more than an hour submitted to being held back
when an attack might have been successful, should now charge intothe muzzles of the guns. But the evidence of the five men is unanimousthat the crowd not merely continued to come forward but that they rushed.Perhaps they felt that it was the only alternative to being shot where they stood. Anyway_w _ar^Jali^eJOhat._it..did..hap.pen. It might be naturalfor the four younger and less experienced men to have overestimated theirdanger, but we do not think that the sergeant did, and he was quite definitethat what had been a slow movement became after the first volley a sharprush. He gave the order to fire again and three or four more volleys were]fired. In all 27 shots were fired, 18 from the rifles and nine from the Sten gun.In the dense crowd there were 48 casualties, 20 of whom were killed out-right or died subsequently from their wounds. The last of those to fall were only a yard or two from the firing line. -237. The shooting occurred just after 11.30 a.m. At 11.15 LieutenantSouthey with his K.A.R. platoon had reached the top of the hill leadingdown to Nkata Bay about five minutes drive from the dock. He there founda crowd of about 200 Africans on the road ; they were not armed, except forthe sort of sticks that are usually carried, and they were not hostile. He wasunder orders to get to Nkata Bay as quickly as possible but he did not thinkthat it would be safe to drive through the crowd since his men were in open vehicles. He therefore debussed and advanced forward on foot so asto get the crowd to disperse. As he approached nearly the whole of the crowd did disperse. About 20 were left, and he arrested two of them whowere &quot; cheeky &quot; and then returned to his vehicles and drove on. But for this operation, which took ten or fifteen minutes, he would have arrived beforethe shooting began. But he would then have been in the rear of the crowdand whether it could then have been dispersed without lethal force mustbe a matter for conjecture.238. After the firing ceased the crowd broke and ran in all directionsout of the town. Lieutenant Southey as he went down met many of themcarrying the wounded away. He and his men helped at once to attend tothe wounded who were left behind and to clear away the dead. The D.C.ordered all the European women and children to go on board the Mpasa.They remained there without food and in some discomfort until 6 p.m.Major Morrison, who arrived at Nkata Bay between 3 and 4 p.m., foundthem there and with the consent of the D.C. sent them back home. Therewas no sign of any further disturbance in Nkata Bay either that day ofthereafter.239. The casualties at Nkata Bay were so very much greater than inany other place that inevitably the actions of the D.C. will attract a closerscrutiny. It may perhaps be said on one side that if he had acted with greater firmness in the early stages, the death roll would have been less;and on the other, that if he had not entertained unreasonable fears aboutthe intentions of the crowd, there need have been no death roll at all. Wehave set out all the facts so that you may judge for yourself whether thereis any substance in these criticisms. It is plain from the narrative that he isnot a man lacking in courage ; we should not do him justice if we did not also record, having seen him and heard his story from his own lips, that heis not a man lacking in humanity. He saw things, as few others did on the
morning of 3rd March, from the viewpoint of the African ; he felt that atthe beginning at any rate many in the crowd had come only to make a legitimate enquiry and ought not to be dealt with harshly ; he felt morethan most the horror of shooting unarmed men and women. A legend hasalready grown up in Nkata Bay that he tricked the people by leading them down to the jetty with the promise that their leaders would be released andthat then he led them into the arms of the soldiers who shot them. Thefacts show that there is no foundation for this.Section 21.  Loudon: 3rd March240. We must now consider what was happening in other parts ofthe Province where there were also reactions to the &quot; Sunrise &quot; arrests. Weshall take first a small incident at Loudon where there is a Church ofScotland mission and a school. Mr. Petty was a European missionary there and he was unpopular with the Africans because he takes rather different views about Federation from those generally held by the Scottishmissionaries ; he had issued a news letter in which he discussed the question.The party that came to pick up Ziba (see paragraph 195) went to Mr. Petty&apos;house before making the arrest in order to warn him that there might betrouble ; and when this became known later in the day it was thoughtthat he had instigated the arrest. Schoolboys, led by Mr. Chunga, thelocal Congress secretary, stoned the mission, caused considerable damage to property inside it, e.g. a typewriter and a bicycle, and threatened Mr.Petty with murder by hanging. He withdrew to his house and was stonedon the way, suffering minor cuts and bruises. He gave up the key of themission petrol store and Chunga took the lorry and left in it for Mzimbawhere he was arrested. At about 1.45 p.m. a group of teachers approachedMr. Petty and advised him to leave. He and his family left in his car at p.m. which was lightly stoned but otherwise was not interfered withThat evening a store was broken into and looted.Section 22.  Karonga : 3rd March241. In Karonga there was serious trouble which resulted in threedeaths; eleven others were wounded by gunfire and a number more bybaton. The local police force in Karonga had been reinforced by a con-tingent of Tanganyika police under the command of a superintendent.The trouble took place just outside the town where there is a roadjunction in the shape of a Y with the tail pointing inwards to Karongaand the two arms pointing outwards to Kaporo and Fort Hill respectively.At 5.30 a.m. a party of 17 police under the command of the local inspectorleft Karonga to effect the arrest of a man who had not been picked up in the &quot; Sunrise &quot; operation. Some distance out on the Kaporo roadhe met a crowd who told him that they were coming to release the prisoners. One of them said: &quot; Please release the prisoners and savetrouble; if you do not, there will be big trouble.&quot; The inspector and his party turned back with the crowd and managed to get a message to theDC. warning him of trouble. About 8 o&apos;clock the DC. got the messageand he went down to the Kaporo road with the Tanganyika superintendentand a body of ten police leaving the rest of the police force to guard the prison.   Meanwhile another crowd in front of the inspector had been
coming along the Kaporo road and the D.C. met them about 400 yardsfrom the junction. He went forward alone with the superintendent and told them to disperse but they were making a lot of noise and it is doubtful if they heard the proclamation. A few were armed with sticks. They didnot threaten the D.C. but their manner was rather insolent. A little time before two of the wanted men had come from the Kaporo road and giventhemselves up. The crowd was then joined from behind by the inspectorscrowd making a total of a thousand to fifteen hundred. At first the crowdin front told the inspector that he must not go through but they did infact let him through without physical opposition and he joined the mainforce. The crowd became more excited and men in front were openingtheir shirts in apparent invitation to the police to shoot. The D.C. handedover to the superintendent who decided to warn the crowd that force mightbe used by firing two shots overhead. These had no effect. He also firedsix rounds of tear smoke which likewise had no effect.242. The crowd then began to move through the long grass to the FortHill road and this gave rise to fears that they would make for the airfield and outflank the police and do the same sort of damage as they had doneon 19th February. The main part of the crowd collected on the Fort Hillroad. The police made a short bayonet charge and a baton charge atsmaller groups which they dispersed but the main part continued to comeslowly forward and a group on the left began to run towards the airfield.The superintendent said he must use firearms and the D.C. agreed. Oneshot was fired at the running group on the left but it did not hit anyone.The superintendent gave the order to his ten riflemen to fire one volleyand almost immediately afterwards he gave the order for a second volley,since the first volley had checked but not stopped the crowd which was still surging forward in the centre. After the second volley they began to move back, slowly at first and then in a stampede. Half an hourlater the D.C. and the superintendent went back along the Kaporo road and found that some of the &quot; elders&quot; were telling the crowds to gohome. They took the elders along with them addressing different groups,the D.C. stressing that there had been killing and that it was due to falseleaders who had stirred up the crowd.Section 23.   Mzimba : 3rd March243 .x In Mzimba there were disturbances throughout the day of 3rdMarch. At 8.30 a.m. a crowd of about 250 assembled outside the Boma ;it included some Congress members whom the D.C. recognised. they wanted to know about the arrests. The D.C. explained and ordered themto disperse. After about five minutes they began to move off in groups.They were not armed except for a few sticks, but they picked up stonesand bricks from the walls. The police found it impossible to get to gripswith baton charges ; they used some riot shells without effect; they found it difficult to use firearms because of the number of women and children in the crowd. There was a good deal of stone throwing. A crowd attacked the prison and was chased away ; but later a second crowd broke in andreleased six prisoners.  During this time a police inspector fired two bursts
from a Sten gun at a distance so as to frighten the crowd. Also in the afternoon two rounds of .303 were fired at a crowd of about 20 foundmanning a road block. No casualties were observed at the time ; butlater it was found that one woman had a bullet wound in her arm and aman had a wound which was probably from a bullet.244. Another patrol under another inspector and made up of special constables had been chasing Africans most of the day and failed to catchany. In the afternoon they saw a group by the Macdonald Hall throwingstones. The inspector went round one side of the building and one ofthe special constables, armed with a shot gun went round the other. Asthey came round the Africans ran away. The special constable called on one of them to stop; and when he did not do so, he fired at him withhis shotgun, peppering him in the back. The shot was small (No. 7);and the wounds were not serious. It was not lawful for the constableto shoot at a man who was running away.Section 24. Rrampi: 3rd March245. You will of course appreciate that on 3rd March the security forces were in action all over the country dispersing crowds and they didnot always have to resort to gunfire. It is the incidents in which theydid so which you will want to know in detail about and that is why weare recording chiefly them. But it would give a lopsided picture of whatwas going on if we did not make some reference to the occasions onwhich crowds were dispersed either with tear smoke or a baton charge, orsometimes without the use of force at all. Some of these occasions wehave brought into the story as we went along. In Rumpi crowds (quitepossibly composed of the same people) were being dispersed all throughthe day and it was only in the afternoon that firearms were used. we intend to set out the story from the beginning so that you may have a picture of one day as a whole in one place. It began at 8.30 a.m. whenthe D.C. encountered a crowd of about 150. He had with him a forceof eight policemen under the command of the Rumpi inspector. TheD.C. told the crowd to disperse. There was a good deal of argument andsome dispersal and then the crowd reformed. The D.C. instructed the.police to disperse the crowd, which was then throwing stones. The policedispersed the crowd with batons without calling on the military who werein reserve. About 9.30 a.m. another crowd of about 150 armed withaxes and knobkerries, was ordered to disperse and was eventually scatteredwith tear smoke and batons.246. At 10 a.m. the D.C. in his car saw a crowd of about 150 approach-ing the police station. Some were armed with axes and knobkerries. Hestopped and asked what they were doing and they told him they wantedtheir leaders back. He told them to disperse, that a state of emergencyhad been declared and that many Congress leaders had been arrested.In order to make himself heard and seen he stood on the bonnet of hiscar. The crowd surrounded him, continually calling that they wanted their leaders back. They did not attack him, but he felt that unless they were dispersed they might attack the police station.  He was talking to them
RUMPITRADINGCENTREPOLICE TRANSPORTMAIN  ROADROAD BLOCK- FELLED TREETOPOLICE STATION
for about six or seven minutes before he read the Riot Act; and by thattime he found that police had formed up along the road about 20 yardsaway and he told the police officer to disperse the crowd. Tear smoke was used and the crowd scattered into the maize on either side of the road from which they threw stones. The police went in with batons and madearrests and the rest of the crowd dispersed.247. At 11 a.m. another crowd was told to disperse and failed to doso. The D.C. said he would withdraw the police and return in 15 minutesand, if they had not dispersed by then, force would be used. he returned in 20 minutes with police and troops and found that the crowdhad increased. He read the Riot Act; and as they still made no move,the police took charge and made a baton charge, which failed to dispersethe crowd and they were heavily stoned. The police then handed over tothe military who warned the crowd that they would open fire. It thendispersed without further force being required.248. At 2 p.m. the D.C., with the inspector and six police and a K.A.R.platoon under a subaltern, found a crowd of about 400 who had recently made a road block by felling a tree. You will see this marked on therough plan on the preceding page. They were most of them armed withknobkerries, etc., which they were brandishing&apos;; and they were more hostilethan any of the morning&apos;s crowds. The D.C. told them to disperse whichthey did not do and he handed over to the police. The inspector consideredthat they were too numerous and too heavily armed for him to do anythingwith his force of six and he handed over to the military. The subaltern hadthe bugle blown and the banner displayed and his sergeant major gaveseveral warnings. After that he picked out a ringleader and ordered a sniperto fire. The man fell wounded and afterwards died.249. When the inspector left the scene of the last incident after handing over to the military, he with his police force and the D.C. walked backalong the road past the Welfare Hall to the place where their transport was.While they were doing this they heard the shot fired which the subalternhad ordered and some of the crowd began running parallel to them tojoin a small crowd of about eight or a dozen people who were at the corner of an access road which goes off to the hotel lines. Just beyond this access road there was another road block. The inspector was ahead of the D.C. and he negotiated the road block and got to the other side of it.The D.C. stopped at the corner to talk to the small crowd who were armed with spears and knobkerries, to tell them not to be silly and to go home orthey would-be injured:- The inspector stayed on the other side of the roadblock to see what was happening to the D.C. while the rest of the policewent on. The D.C. then turned his back on the small crowd and proceeded to go towards the road block to walk round it. One man came out ofthe crowd and walked after him brandishing or pointing a spear. the inspector shouted at him, raised his rifle, fired accidentally before he had hisrifle in position with a shot that went over the heads of the crowd and thenfired again at the man, killing him and also another man beside him, thebullet having passed through.
250. We_are.nojt_saJMed.that the man was really going to attack the.D.C. ^ He had ample time in which to throw the spear if he had wanted to ; or if he was going to make a jab with it, he would have run at the D.C.Moreover, though we are quite sure that in his evidence before us the inspector was honest in his attempt to reconstruct the situation, we arenot satisfied that at the time he thought the D.C. to be in imminent danger; if he had, we think that he would have shouted to the D.C. ratherthan to the man, and the D.C. heard no warning. But the crowd had been told to disperse and they did not do so ; the man had been told to stop andhe did not do so. The inspector, a young man, had had a very long and difficult morning he was concerned in nearly all the incidents we haverecorded above and this was the first time in his life at which he had had to shoot at a man.Section 25. Kafukulc : 3rd March251. A slight incident occurred here. A platoon of the R.R.R. was engaged in removing road blocks under a barrage of stones from Africansaround. The Africans were told to disperse and warned and they did not do so. First a shot was fired overhead. Then a shot was fired at the legsof a man who appeared to be the leader, and it missed. It did howevercause the mob to disperse, but later they began to come back again.A shot was fired again at the same African and hit him in the foot. the crowd then dispersed.Section 26. Congress gangs in the Northern Province252. During the rest of this week in the Northern Province there wasno other encounter in which the security forces opened fire. But large areas of the Northern Province had passed out of government control andin many places gangs under Congress leadership were behaving as theyliked. At Deep Bay a gang burned the houses of the chief, the postmasterand the schoolmaster. They then went to the schoolmaster^ farm in thecountry and burnt his house there, killed some of the cattle and cut down the crops. They also burnt three dip tanks in Deep Bay. Also in this area a loyal chief was seized by a gang and tied to a tree. They tookhis shotgun and threatened to kill him with it. They did not do so butthey did beat him and burn his house. On 4th March at Rumpi a crowdof about 150 approaching the town were met by the District Commissionerwith a force of police and military. They said that they had come to seethe arrested leaders. They were told to disperse and finally did so. Buteither on their way to Rumpi or on their way back they did a great dealof damage, serious damage to three concrete bridges, burning of an agri-cultural instructors house, looting of a store and the erection of many roadblocks.253. You will remember the activities in February of the gang headed byMwiba which we have recounted in paragraphs 114 and 115, and which caused the Waterfields and the Udds to leave their houses in the district.On 5th March this gang burnt Mr. Waterfield&apos;s house and all the ninebuildings of Mr. Udd&apos;s mission; almost everything in Mr. Udd&apos;s house wasburnt or looted. They then went on to the house of Mr. Muhonia, aveterinary assistant in government employ.  They got there about 5.30 p.m.
and they numbered about 500 with spears and axes. Mwiba told mr.. Muhonia that he had five minutes to take out his property and then his house would be set on fire. When within the five minutes Mr. Muhonia&apos;sthings were not all out, Mwiba told six boys to help him carry them.The gang then set fire to the house and other buildings. They thenwent on to the house of a Mr. Munthali, the court clerk and Mwiba saidthat if he did not give up the keys of the court they would cut off hishead. So he handed over the keys and they went to the court and tookall the money,  120, from the safe, which Mwiba said he was going to use for Congress. They told Mr. Munthali that now that self-government was achieved there was no need for him and that he should pack up and gohome. Another house-burning took place on 6th March at Nchenachena.The house belonged to Mr. Bowmaker, an agricultural supervisor, who wasaway on duty as a special constable. Some of his property was later foundin the houses of persons arrested as Congress members.Section 27. General observations on arrests and riots254. We conclude this part of our report with some general observations on the incidents we have recorded which fall into two classes, first themaking of arrests, and secondly, the suppression of disturbances. We thinkthat it is quite evident that unnecessary and therefore illegal force was usedin making a number of these arrests.; jllegal measures of restraint were also^*lmTplbyedr&quot;&quot;Apart from those instances which may not be defensible judged&quot;by any&quot;standards, you may think that the incidents show generally a freeruse of the baton than would bejolerated in this country. The arrests were carried out in the main by small groups of &quot;inexperienced officers lo-the,darkjrf an African^jfight. Operating often in unfamiliar terrain they wereto arrest people whom they did not know personally and whose arrest they feared might provoke violence by the local populace. These have beenput to us as grounds for regarding ordinary British standards as inappropriate-priate. In this respect it may be useful for you to have a comparison witha similar operation which was carried out in Southern Rhodesia on the night of 25th-26th February. This operation was also planned secretly so as tocreate the maximum amount of surprise. It was conducted by the regular police alone. Just over five hundred persons were arrested ; we are informedthat none of them was injured in any way and that there were no incidents of any sort.255. From the account we have given of the suppression of the dis-turbances you will have seen that it was the general policy on 3rd March and thereafter to order any crowd to disperse wherever it had collected and toenforce the order by shooting if necessary. The Government took the viewthat every crowd was an unlawful assembly and could and should be ordered to disperse. In some cases the security forces were clearly dealing witharmed gangs. In other cases, particularly in the morning of 3rd March,the crowds may have assembled, at least originally, for an innocent purpose and without a common intent to break the law. The Government view was that trouble was stirred up by agitators who knew quite well that what they were doing was wrong. We cannot entirely accept this. Wethink that many people were genuinely bewildered by the sudden turnI of events and wanted to know what was happening and, it may be,
to make what they believed to be a legitimate protest. We do not doubtthat Congressmen who were still at large were at work ; they were likely tobe the most vocal members of their communities. Nor do we doubtthat some of the crowd were determined if they could to recapture by force the arrested men. But one must not entirely overlook the fact that on theday before no one could have been lawfully arrested without being chargedwith some crime. What made that possible was a sudden change in the laweffected at midnight, without warning and left unexplained. We think th&apos;at&apos;Jthe Government^ attitude, consciously or unconsciously, was based on theassumption that every right-minded African ought to know that what was done in the name of the Governor or the Boma must be right and that to resist it must be wrong. We believe that the administration, which we foundto consist in the main of conscientious and devoted men, has been greatlytrusted by the African villager. It was scarcely surprising then that he came ito the Boma on 3rd March to find out what was happening. The ordinaryAfrican is not of course a student of constitutional law; but we found thatquite a number of Africans who gave evidence before us had some generalnotion that in British territory the Queen does not allow her subjects to be arrested without charge or imprisoned without trial.   It would be a poor ;, advertisement for 60 years of British rule if it were otherwise.    If, :however good the cause may be, this is to be swept away overnight, we j: think there might have been expected in Nyasaland at least a small part ofthe consternation that a similar act would cause in Britain. ^256. Emergency powers have never been employed in Nyasaland before.Sudden arrests on a large scale are without precedent. Congress was apparently flourishing ; Dr. Banda was being treated by the government as the leader of political opinion among Africans and the Governmentwas in the middle of discussions with him on constitutional reform. Therewas nothing at the end of February to warn a Congress member that aweek later he would be going to prison for six months because a member-ship card had been found in his house. In some places, such as Karongaand Fort Hill, where Congress had clearly offered violence, the populationmay well have been prepared for some form of reprisal. But in otherparts of the country, such as Nkata Bay, Congress had behaved itself andeverything had been quiet. The new policy of violence was hardly amonth old ; and we think it would be wrong to assume that it had com-pletely captured the movement; you will have seen that in some of theincidents men were offering themselves for arrest. We believe that in many parts of the country the sudden seizure of leaders may well have been seen as an in^Dlicable-jct,of. aggression on the part of the Government. .We do not&quot;ThTnk that the Government ought to have been satisfied thaton 3rd March a bare statement by the Governor, which very few Africanswould have heard, that Congress was a bad thing and guilty of violence, inti-midation and lawlessness, would automatically carry conviction everywhere.Whether or not it was due to the belief in a murder plot, we think that theGovernment overestimated the extent to which the idea of violence had pene-trated Congress ; and underestimated the impact which their own emphaticaction would have on the minds of persons who were normally law-abiding.127

257. We base our observations in the last paragraph upon a closestudy of the incidents and the evidence in relation to them as well as thegeneral evidence we have had about opinion among Africans. With theseobservations we go as far as we can properly go on the facts. Anythingbeyond this would be a pure matter of opinion. There are of course other questions which arise on which we have tried to collect all the relevantmaterial. Would it, for example, have been wiser to have initiated theoperation on a smaller scale? Could the public have been prepared tosome extent for the measures which the Government intended to take?On this point the considered government view was that absolute secrecywas vital. Was it wise to insist on the dispersal of every crowd before itwas quite clear that it was bent on doing damage? Was the shortage of policea material factor? these are all questions. Jar, you and we hope that thisReport may help..you.Jo, answer......them.   But we must record one other observation that is also based on our hearing of the evidence.  As we have, said, we saw everyone who was responsible for the shooting. In the incidentsI that we have so far recorded we have not found anyone who was &quot; trigger-I happy &quot;. The general policy for dealing with rioters may have been rightor wrong; the individual may have been mistaken in his assessment of theposition ; but having seen all those who were responsible for the shootingsj in the incidents so far recorded, we are satisfied that each man did what he did because he honestly felt that he could not discharge his duty inI any other way.
PART VISUBSEQUENT OPERATIONSSection 1.  Nature of operations258. In the evening of 3rd March the position at the end of thefirst day was reviewed at a -meeting of the Operations Committee. It was reported that 122 persons had been arrested on Governor^ detentionorders and a further 44 on 28 day detention orders. It was decidedthat there should next be a vigorous policy of harassing and breaking up Congress organisers, supporters and hoodlums at a lower level, an aggressive policy being needed to break up the existing pattern ofintimidation, threats and truculence and to demonstrate the Govern-ment&apos;s determination to break the Congress organisation. It was intended that the security forces should be regrouped with this end inview. The three African battalions should be used for a clean-up opera-tion in the Northern Province while the Central and Southern Provinceswere contained by European troops. In accordance with these plans an operation instruction was issued by the Operations Committee on 7thMarch to take effect on 9th March. It is there recorded that about 250hard-core Congress leaders had by then been arrested but that a numberwere still at large. The objectives of the new operation were to arrestleaders still at large, to make propaganda, to give firm but friendly displaysof force in quiescent areas and to take tough, punitive action in areas where lawlessness and acts of violence were being perpetrated or planned.In pursuit of this last objective the recorded intention was that swiftand offensive retribution should be meted out to convince that lawless-ness did not pay ; such areas must be dealt with firmly but withoutbrutality, leaders must be arrested and searches made for arms and offen-sive weapons. We think that the most convenient way of describing theexecution of this operation is to set out under separate heads the differentways in which it was being implemented.Section 2.  Break-up of Congress259. This was being achieved by the examination of suspects, search-ing of their houses, and their arrest and subsequent detention either under emergency powers or upon conviction as members of Congress. We havenot investigated this in any detail, as it seems to us to be only on thefringe of our terms of reference. We have included this section upon it first, because it shows so clearly the need for privacy in our inquiry; and secondly, because it may be evidence of a belief, perhaps only half-conscious, in the murder plot. Methods which may be justifiable whendealing with even the outer members of a terrorist organisation might,when employed at large upon a political party, be regarded as the persecu-tion of permissible beliefs. The methods used depended upon the powerswe have already set out (paragraph 182) of examination and of detention-tion pending enquiries and upon Emergency Regulation 46 which gives a wide power of search. It authorizes any police officer or soldier or anyone
acting under his direction to search without warrant any premises if hesuspects that any evidence of the commission of an offence against theregulations or against the ordinary law is likely to be found and to seizeanything found therein. The main object of these searches was to discoverevidence of membership of Congress. Until 3rd March Congress was ofcourse a lawful body and membership of it no offence. Without the aid of some special provision in the law the prosecution would, we presume,in order to secure a conviction have to prove the commission of an actafter 3rd March showing some activity consistent only with continued membership. But in most cases the prosecution appears to have relied upon a provision in the law (Penal Code section 73 (3)) which says thatwhen any document relating to an unlawful society is found in the posses-sion or under the control of any person, it should be presumed, until thecontrary is proved, that such person is a member of the unlawful society.In some cases a search of premises has shown a membership card or areceipt for a subscription dated after 3rd March ; then the position isclear. But in most cases what has been found is a membership card orother similar document dated before 3rd March. A liberal constructionof section 73 (3) would he that a document did not &quot; relate to an unlawfulsociety &quot; unless at the time of its issue the society was unlawful. This view hasnot so far been taken by the courts in Nyasaland. Indeed, the discovery of olddocuments has been held in a number of cases to be virtually conclusiveproof, for it is said, that the failure to destroy the document after 3rdMarch shows that the holder intended to continue his membership. Weunderstand that former Congress members have been warned in the press and by broadcasts to destroy such documents. Nevertheless, the resultsmay be haphazard. Announcements of this sort take time to penetratein Nyasaland; we have seen a letter from a Congress branch secretarydated 9th March to his District Commissioner asking for permission tohold a Congress meeting. There is a danger that carelessness or ignorance of what to do, rather than malignance, may become the test of guilt. Dis-covery of an old document has not in every case led to conviction ; in somecases the accused is allowed to escape imprisonment by abjuring onoath his political beliefs. A substantial number of persons has been sent to prison as members of Congress, the sentences (subject to confirmation by theHigh Court) varying from six months to two years. This is the punishment for membership alone ; a heavier sentence up to five years is passed for taking part in the management as. for example, by collecting subscriptions.260. Where membership of Congress cannot be proved, persons whoare suspected of subversive tendencies can be detained under the emergency regulations. You will no doubt have the figures ; we understand that bythe middle of May about 1,000 persons had been or were detained, most ofthem on 28 day orders. In this context we think that &quot; subversive &quot; behaviouris being given a very wide meaning. We said at the beginning of thisreport that we doubted whether it was safe for anyone in Nyasaland to criticise the policy of the Government except in the most restrained way.This was the impression we gained from quite a number of African witnesseswho were nervous of giving evidence before us. We can illustrate it by oneincident which was brought to our attention and also from observations
made by Government witnesses. An African civil servant was seen by hissuperior to be typing a private memorandum in office hours. The superiornaturally looked at it and finding it what he considered to be a seditiousdocument, he reported the matter to the police. The police seized the document and the clerk was at once arrested on a 28 day order ; weunderstand that he was arrested on the contents of the document. Thepolice had no means of knowing it, but the document was in fact amemorandum addressed to us ; the clerk was not the author of it but thepolice had at first good reason to think that he was. We found it to belittle different in character from many of the memoranda submitted to us.It is a statement of the writer&apos;s view on the causes of the emergency and an account of the incidents thereafter, such as Nkata Bay, which he may havebelieved but which is in fact quite false. The comment on the missionschool incident on 23rd February, which we quoted in paragraph 131,is a quotation from this memorandum. There is also a complaint aboutthe treatment of detainees.261. Two observations made to us by District Commissioners showthat it has become difficult to distinguish between opposition to the Govern-ment and subversion. Speaking of the missionaries at Livingstonia oneDistrict Commissioner said that they were of course completely anti-Federation; and he added: &quot;My impression is that they are also com-pletely opposed to the measures which Government has taken, and my view is that if they make that clear to people who live round Livingstonia,the African population, their students, their staff, if it is not subversive it is something very near to it&quot;. One missionary was visited by a Congressmanwho had been released from detention; and his District Commissioner not at all a dictatorial man but obviously sincere and earnest felt itnecessary to warn him that if he continued to meet people of that sorthe might get into trouble and even be offending against the emergency regulations &quot;by causing doubt to be cast on the work of the security forces or the police&quot;.Section 3.  Road blocks and special areas262. The erection of road blocks created a very difficult problem forthe security forces. As soon as they removed one, they might find,almost before their backs were turned, that Africans had emerged from hiding at the sides of the roads and had begun to rebuild it. Wehave described in paragraph 220 how one man was taken in the act;generally it was only too easy for them to run away at the approach of thesecurity forces. Accordingly, the Attorney-General suggested that in orderto deal with this problem, Emergency Regulation 11 should be invoked.This regulation enables the Governor or a Provincial Commissioner to declare any area to be a special area if he thinks that special precautionsshould be taken there to prevent malicious injury to persons or property.Any person in a special area who fails to stop when challenged or calledupon to do so is guilty of an offence and may be arrested without warrant.In order to effect such an arrest such force as may be reasonably necessarymay be used and the regulation specifically provides that it may extend to the use of lethal weapons. Under the ordinary law force can be usedto restrain a person once he has been arrested; this regulation makes it
clear that force, including lethal force, can be used in order to effect the arrest. It solves the problem of how to deal with a person who runsaway on the approach of the police as happened in Mzimba (paragraph 244)and Port Herald (paragraph 209).263. Accordingly on 9th March special areas were declared. In theNorthern Province they were the whole districts of Karonga and Rumpi,in the Central Province they were a number of specially troublesome areas and in the Southern Province they were in parts of the Mlanje district.Leaflets were dropped warning the inhabitants of these areas of the riskthey ran. But it does not appear that the power to shoot on failure tohalt was ever used at a road block certainly no casualty was causedthereby. It was used in connection with the cordoning and searching ofvillages which we shall consider in the next paragraph. We have not beenable to trace the way by which a power that was invoked for one purpose was used mainly for another ; the powers of course were granted in relationto areas and not in relation to any particular purpose, and the cordoningoperations were undertaken in special areas.Section 4.  Cordoning and searching operations264. You have seen how in the Northern Province both before andafter 3rd March lawless gangs were at work defying the authority of theGovernment. In paragraphs 114 to 118 and 252 and 253 we have set out the sort of things they were doing. In certain districts in the Central Province for example the Santhe district (see paragraph 224) there was the same sort of trouble. It was continuing during the period we now have under review and we shall give some examples of it. At Muhuju in the Rumpi districttwo American missionaries of the Church of Christ had found much hostility to Europeans in their district but had been told that they were safebecause they were Americans. They were not themselves harmed, buton 8th March, when they went into Rumpi town, one of the missionbuildings, not on the station, but between the station and Rumpi wasburnt. On 11th March a gang of 20 came to the house of the veterinarycapitao at Kaseye and,told him they had come to burn it but that firsthe must take his belongings outside. They took precautions to see thatthe goods were not burnt, telling him to move the goods from the place where he had put them, which was downwind from the house. Then they said : &quot; According to our law you must be the first to set fire to yourhouse &quot;. He refused to do so and they set it on fire themselves and whenit was burning they went away. It may well be that the gangs who were doing this sort of thing consisted of the same men who were erecting roadblocks and committing other acts of sabotage.265. One of the objects of the cordoning and searching operation wasto search for wanted people or for evidence of where they might be found.The operation had to be conducted at night&apos; or in the early hours of the morning because the wanted men would be out of the village before dawn;sometimes villages were found to be wholly deserted during the day. Themethod usually employed was for the village to be surrounded by acordon of troops. Police or soldiers would then go to the village, bangingon the doors of the huts, breaking in if necessary, bringing the men
Cordoning and searching operationsout into the centre of the village, where they were held under guard forquestioning, and searching all the huts for evidence. We have already referred to the powers of search and of detention pending enquiries givenby the Emergency Regulations. The men might be questioned in the village or they might be put into a lorry and taken off to the police station,sometimes in considerable numbers, a hundred or more. According to theway in which they answered their interrogators, they might either be releasedwithin a day or two or they might be subjected to a 28 day order.When the alarm was given at the beginning of the operation, men mighttry to run away from the village and the duty of cordoning troops wasto prevent them from doing so. Under Emergency Regulation 11 theyhad power to shoot such people if they failed to halt.266. Over a period of 12 days 11 casualties were caused, six ofthem fatal, during these operations. You will appreciate that we knowonly of those incidents in which a casualty occurred and we have nofigures which would enable us to say what proportion they bore to thewhole. All the same it struck us as a high casualty rate and we sought to ascertain what the cjmjse^nnght^te^ Some were clearly unavoidable.&quot;But in some cases we think it probable that the African was guiltless ofany offence and acting out of fright or misunderstanding. Of course, whetherguiltless or not, he ought to have stopped when called upon to do so in hisown language, &quot; Ima&quot;: but when the word was used by a Europeansoldier, it may be that he did not grasp what was happening. Thereaotions of those who are mentally alert would no doubt be to stop and put their hands up ; it may be that the reaction of the rural African is tokeep on running. The warning leaflets that were dropped seem to have referred only to road blocks. We think that the instructions givei^to thetroops were too rigid. In the directive of 9th March which laid down thenew policy about road blocks and stated the powers conferred by Emer-gency Regulation 11, it was emphasised that subordinate commanders mustunderstand that the power, that is the power of shooting on failure to stop,should be exercised sparingly and with the utmost discretion. As a general statement of principle this is unexceptionable but it does not give muchguidance to the ordinary soldier. No guidance is given to him as to the cir-cumstances in which he should shoot: ought he, for example, to try to catcha man who is running away and shoot only if he thinks that there is no reasonable chance of success? The only instruction which we can trace as having gone down to subordinate commanders was that they should study the Emergency Regulations &quot; in order that they were fully aware of thepowers which they could and should exercise under them &quot;. We thinkthat the emphasis was on &quot;could&quot; rather than.,&quot;should&quot;. We have found that the drill as understood by all those who had actually to take part in these operations was that if they saw anyone run-ning away, they were to challenge and call upon him to halt a numberof times sometimes two,--three or four, according to the particularunit and if he was still running they were to shoot to disable him. Noalternatives were suggested to them. In our view there are at least two cases in which the deaths need not have occurred. In saying this we are having regard to all the circumstances and not considering only thosewhich are appropriate in the determination of legal liability.
Casualties at Mwenechipwera and Sandwe: 8th and 9th MarchSection 5.  Casualties at Mwenechipwera and Sandwe: 8th and 9th March267. It is convenient now to give a chronological account of the inci-dents during this period in which casualties were incurred, though not all of them were in special areas or involved a failure to halt. On 8thMarch a K.A.R. patrol went to search a village called Mwenechipwerain the Misuku hills where it was hoped that some Congress leaders mightbe found. There was a struggle outside a hut and a man threw a spearat a soldier which hit him and would have wounded him but for theprotection of his webbing pouch ; the soldier fired at the man and shothim in the leg. On 9th March at Sandwe in the Central Province aplatoon of R.R.R. was searching the village shortly before midnight look-ing for a wanted man. The method was to bang on the door of eachhut with a rifle butt and tell the person inside to come out. At one huta man, who was not the wanted man, came out and started struggling.He was hit on the head with a Bren gun and told to stand still and keepquiet. He did so for a moment and then dashed off. A lance-corporalfired one shot with a Bren gun after telling him to stop and wounded him in the right hip. .....Section 6.  Casualty at Santhe: 10th March268. On 10th March there was a large operation going on in the Santhedistrict in the Central Province. Troops were searching the area for members of the gang who had been giving trouble at the Rusa Rest house and other places (see paragraph 224). The Santhe area is bounded on one side by the Rusa river and the operation included patrolling on thefar side of the river so as to stop people who crossed by the ferry andmight be trying to escape. One of the patrols had a special constable incharge and included a K.A.R. rifleman. The Santhe area had not been declared a special area ; nevertheless both men were under the impression that if they called on a man to stop and he failed to do so they were entitled to shoot. An African came towards them on a bicycle. Theconstable called on him to stop when he was about 50 yards away andinstead of doing so, he turned round and began bicycling off in the way in which he had come. He was called on to stop again and did not doso. The constable fired a warning shot which went over his head. Therifleman fired a shot, which he says he intended also as a warning shot,and this hit and killed him. At the inquest a verdict of manslaughter wasreturned against the rifleman, on the ground that he had no legal rightto fire at all; had the place been within the special areas regulation,the rifleman would have been legally protected.Section 7.  Casualty at Mbuyidziko: 11th March269. On 11th March a village called Mbuyidziko was being searchedat 9 a.m. by a platoon of R.R.R. A corporal had been searching themealies and was standing in the open when two men came running towardshim. He called on them to stop and one of them did, but the other keptstraight on ; he was not armed and had got within ten yards when thecorporal fired. He had a Sten gun on repetition and it fired twice. Hewas aiming low and he hit the man in the calf. It must be uncertain whether the man intended to attack the corporal.     T&apos; 7 134&quot;
Misuku Mission: 13th MarchSection 8.  Misuku Mission : 13th March270. On 13th March in the Northern Province an incident of a differentsort arose out of the searching of a village ; it was in fact the last occasion on which firearms were used to disperse a crowd. A K.A.R. platoon com-manded by a subaltern and accompanied by two police officers went to search Mwakayela village in Misuku. This village is near a mission whichhad recently been burnt and looted and the patrol were looking among other things for evidence of looting. When they got to the village they found it quite deserted. They broke into the houses and, finding no evidence of loot,they nevertheless took away a quantity of documentary material and alsowhat tools and weapons they saw, mainly choppers. They then went to themission, and since it was about 5 p.m, they prepared to camp there. they found themselves surrounded by about 200 people in groups of about 30 or 40who were undoubtedly the villagers from Mwakayela and who began stoningthem. One stone cut open a soldier&apos;s head so that it needed six stitches. the crowd was^calling on the askaris to turn against their European leaders.The police officers, supported by three soldiers, went forward and read the Riot Act. The crowd did not disperse and continued shouting andstoning. After about ten minutes the soldiers were ordered to fire at theleaders in the crowd. They fired six shots in all and at the time none was seen to hit. The crowd then dispersed to some distance away and stoppedstoning. Later it was discovered that two men and one woman had beenwounded ; and one man subsequently died.Section 9. Nambuma : 14th March271. On 14th March this village in the Central Province was being searchedby the R.R.R. Three riflemen, whom we shall call M., B. and J. were involved in the incident. Rifleman M. saw an African running, followed him and he ran into a hut. M. looked into the hut and saw him hiding in the corner. M. called him out and motioned to him to join some other Africanswho had been detained. He tried to get back into the hut and M. put hisrifle across the door. The African slipped underneath and closed the doorof the hut. M. pushed the door open and went in. The African came athim from behind the door with an axe. M. warded off a blow with hisrifle and the African ran on towards Rifleman B. who was approaching.B. told him to stop but he came on and swung the axe at him. B. wardedoff the blow with his rifle which afterwards had two cuts on it a quarterof an inch deep. B. struck him with the rifle and the African ran ontowards Rifleman J. So B. fired at him when he was about 20 yards away from him and 15 yards from J. and wounded him in the head. J. alsofired and he had another wound in the right elbow. He died shortly after-wards.Section 10.  Kasiya: 14th March272. On 14th March another village in the Central Province was beingcordoned by the R.R.R. A rifleman saw an African running towards him and told him to stop, which he did. He told him, speaking in kitchen kaffir,to lie down and the African squatted. The rifleman stood over him with hisrifle and bayonet fixed pointing at him. The African was talking andjabbering and the rifleman could not understand a word.  The African
made a lunge at him and the rifleman hit him with the butt of his rifle. the african got up and made another lunge and was hit again several times.Then he got up and grabbed the rifle and the bayonet went into his chestand he was killed. We are satisfied that the rifleman thought that he wasbeing attacked ; but we think it rn^rejprobable the African was frightenedand thought he was going to be bayoneted.Section 11.  Misuku Court: 17th March273. On 17th March a K.A.R. platoon was searching houses near Misukucourt in the Northern Province. A man ran out of a hut and ran towards a group of three askaris obviously without seeing them. He got to within10 yards of them and we think that at that distance away he could havebeen apprehended by one or more of the group without the need forshooting. He was running towards them when he was told to stop andhe then at once turned round and ran away. The leading askari, accordingto the orders he had been given, called again three times and then firedand hit the man in the leg. The man got up and went on running, andwith a wounded leg could then surely have been caught. But the askarifired again, hit him in the chest and he was killed.Section 12.  Chiwaliwali: 19th March274. On 19th March an extensive operation was going on in the CentralProvince to surround three villages in the Kota-Kota district of whichChiwaliwali was one. The plan was that the troops should take up their positions at dawn on the hills on all four sides of the villages and thenmove down into the villages searching the bush on the way, and, it was hoped, driving into the villages anyone who had gone into hiding outsideof them. Just after 5 a.m., while it was still half light, a warrant officer in command of a R.R.R. platoon got his men to the top of the hill wherethey were to spread out. Although in a territorial battalion, the warrant officer was a regular soldier and had had previous experience in Malaya.As he got to the crest he saw four figures crouching down, moving up the hill towards him. When they got close to him, closer than 20 yards, he called on them to stop. They turned and ran back towards the villages.He called out a warning a second time and then fired. He had a Sterlinggun which was supposed to be on repetition but which was actually firingautomatically. Altogether he fired three bursts of three shots each. Afterthe first burst he was aware it was not firing on repetition as it should havebeen. In the half light he assumed that the figures were men, but in factone was a woman with a baby on her back. The woman was killed butthe baby was unharmed. We do not ftinkjhat this shootmg^was^ donewilfully; but we are clear that it was not&quot;necessary. The party had beenrurnedTmcY so that they^ were running in the direction towards which it was intended to drive them, back into the villages which were being surrounded.Section 13.  Complaints against security forces275. Cordoning and search operations had another object besides the search for wanted men and evidence against them. Indeed, we are inclined to think that the search for wanted men was hardly more than incidental to the main purpose of the operation, which was to impose a form of
Complaints against security forcescollective punishment upon troublesome villages. In the Central Province,where separate operation orders were prepared, the object of the operation is always stated as being the restoration of law and order or something insimilarly general terms ; the apprehension of wanted men is not referredto. You will remember also that when this type of operation was originallyplanned, it was made clear that what was intended was tough, punitivetreatment for troublesome areas and swift and offensive retribution. Wehave received numerous complaints about the behaviour of the security forces in the course of these operations. We heard allegations of rapeiand other outrages and we are satisfied that there is nothing in anyof them. Only once or twice did we obtain even the name of anyone whowas said to have been raped and we never heard any first hand evidenceabout it. But we are satisfied that there was a great deal of aggressiveand bullying behaviour, frequently accompanied with blows from fists andrifle butts inflicting minor injuries which sometimes necessitated medical treatment. Men were herded into the middle of the village, shouted at, told to stand up, sit down, hold their hands over their heads and so on, and ifthey were not completely submissive, they were beaten. They were alsostruck for &quot; not being cooperative&quot;. Not being cooperative embracedsuch things as not at once giving information about where people whowere wanted by the security forces might be found or giving it in a manner which the questioner found unconvincing. It was not cooperative to protest if other people were being struck. We heard also many complaints about the manner in which the searching of houses was done includingallegations that property was seized or stolen. Apart from implements,which we deal with in a separate paragraph, we are not satisfied that therewas seizure or stealing of property on any large scale; but we think it very probable that a great deal of the searching was rough and did unnecessarydamage.276. These tactics were employed only in areas where gangs had beenperpetrating arson and sabotage. To detect and apprehend actual offenderswould be a laborious process and very likely beyond the powers of thepolice force. The military were only available for a short period and theGovernment were obviously determined to use them while they were thereso as to cow the population in troublesome areas. It is quite clear thatthese were not expeditions in which the military was simply acting in aid of the police to assist the apprehension of wanted men. They were punitiveexpeditions intended to make it plain that siding with Congress led to veryunpleasant consequences.Section 14.  Burning of houses277. We heard many complaints that in Mlanje district the security forces had burnt houses or huts. It is admitted that 38 houses were burntby the order of the D.C. given on 9th March, 1959, and it is not suggestedthat the order was legal. Eleven of the houses were said to be shackshear road blocks and were assumed to have harboured persons responsiblefor erecting the blocks. The remaining 27 were said to be houses in whichlooted property had been found. The D.C. did not satisfy himself personallythat looted property had been found in any of the houses burnt; nor didhe, as he might have done (leaving aside the question of legality) give any
Burning of housesverbal warning of his intention to burn, or burn one or two houses firstby way of warning to see what effect that had. He says that he issued a general order to security forces that, if they found loot in any house,they were to burn it and that they had no discretion in the matter. Youwill have observed that in some of the Northern Province burnings byAfricans the householder was first allowed to remove his goods ; thismitigation was not adopted in Mlanje and the house went up with all theproperty, except the supposedly looted property, inside it.278. The complaints we received said that houses were burnt simply because they belonged to persons who were thought to be Congresssympathisers. We believe this to be the case. We do not doubt that lootingon a very considerable scale was going on, but we do not believe that theburning of houses was or was intended to be a punishment for looting only.Memoranda in justification of the burnings were at the time addressed by theD.C. to the Southern Provincial Commissioner and by the latter to the Nyasa-land Operations Committee. More than two-thirds of each memorandum istaken up with a description of the degree of disaffection in the area in whichthe burnings were authorised, the strength of Congress there and the presenceof alleged agitators ; none of this has anything to do with looting. Lootingis of course a crime; no prosecution for looting was brought against anyonein the district. We could perhaps have tested the matter to some extentif we had been furnished with the names of the owners of any of thehouses burnt on the ground that they were looters; we were informed thatthese were not obtainable. We were unable to identify any officer who had actually ordered any of the burnings so that we were unable to ascertainupon what evidence of looting he had acted. The Provincial commissioner in his memorandum said that the burnings were necessary &quot; to ensure thattlooting, intimidation and arson were stamped out as quickly as possible &quot;. Itis significant that immediately after the d.s.c order was given, the NorthernProvince asked for permission to destroy the houses of known agitators; itwas refused.Section 15.  Collective fines279. This form of extra-judicial punishment is quite usual in africa and well understood. The principle is that in a country where the police force is not sufficiently numerous to enforce the law unaided and when,in the case of a grave crime, the neighbourhood will not help in bringing the offender to justice, then the neighbourhood must suffer. Under theEmergency Regulations this principle is extended to cover every case inwhich the community has failed to take reasonable steps to prevent thecommission of an offence against the regulations. The regulations alsopermit a District Commissioner to impose a fine upon any village if hesuspects it of containing a substantial number of members of Congressor of persons who consort with members of Congress. This last provision would practically allow a DC to impose a fine whenever and whereverhe wanted ; and no limit is put to the amount. But we did not receivemany complaints of arbitrary action and we found that in most casesthe law has been carefully used for the purpose of securing compensationfor damage done rather than for the infliction of punishment. The exercise
of the power was kept to areas where damage had been done to public or private property, an assessment was made of the cost of making good the damage and the inhabitants made to pay on the basis that some atleast must have been responsible. This was the general rule. We have however seen cases in which an act of arson, for example, might havebeen committed from one of several neighbouring villages; the D.C.selected one and may well have been right. But if he was wrong therewould be no redress since it was not a judicial proceeding ; and indeed in law it would not matter whether he was right or wrong since thecommon form notice imposing the fine has only to recite a belief thatthere were members of Congress in the village. The power is not alwaysused simply to get compensation. Thus in the case above mentioned andin others we have seen of the same sort, a fine of double or treble theassessed value was imposed and the village informed that the excess wouldbe remitted if by a certain date they brought in the actual offender withevidence sufficient to secure his conviction.280. In the Mlanje district, in the area where houses were burnt, theD.C. imposed a fine of  8,734 to cover damage assessed at  8,510; the assessment was of course his own and it was not our business to checkit. He considered that the main damage was caused by at most two hundred men but that the remainder of the people in the district had&quot; tacitly assented &quot; to what the two hundred were doing. The adult malepopulation of the district amounted to 5,823 so that the suspected perpe-administrators represented about three per cent of the population. &quot; My own view is &quot;, the D.C. wrote, &quot; that the levy on all the people, whether guilty or not,will have the effect of making Nyasaland African Congress really un-popular &quot;.281. The total of the collective fines imposed in Nyasaland amountedto a little over  30,000 ; on 30th April in a written answer in the House ofCommons you gave the details of how it was made up. The fines are assessedon the basis of a contribution from each adult male inhabitant varying from5/- at the lowest to 30/- at the highest. 30/- represents roughly a man&apos;swages for a month and it is also the amount of the annual poll tax forwhich every African is liable. There is power to enforce the paymentof the fines by imprisonment or seizure of property, but the usual methodof enforcement was one that is not provided for in the Emergency Regula-tions. In the case of the Mlanje fine with which we have just dealt, it isstated:  &quot; Between April 6th and April 9th security forces will operatethroughout the area in order to apply the necessary pressure on all people to pay &quot;. In another district the notification of the fine stated: -&quot; failure to pay the fine will result in the immediate entry into the area of K.A.R.troops and police &quot;. The fines were paid &quot; surprisingly willingly &quot;. TheD.C. who said this acknowledged that the fear of reprisals was a factorbut said there was also an acceptance of responsibility and we think thatin many districts this may have been true.282. Under the Emergency Regulations a D.C. has also power to orderinhabitants to make good by their own work any damage done in thedistrict.  This method was used in some areas in the Northern Province.
We quote from the evidence of a D.C.: &quot;I gave them a finishing date for the work and said that the K.A.R. would remain until it was done andif it was not done quickly they would become unpleasant and impatient.In every case the work was finished before the date &quot;.Section 16.  Confiscation of implements283. We heard many complaints that implements, axes, choppers,pangas, etc. were taken wholesale from houses which were searched inthe course of the operations we have described in this Part of our Report.It is admitted that a great deal of this was done and we find that it wasa very general practice to take all the implements from a house that wassearched, which would frequently mean from all the houses in a village.Searches were not conducted on this scale in areas in which there hadbeen no trouble; and the seizing of implements which could be used asweapons seems usually to have been done as a precautionary measure,though in one case we were told it was done because &quot; the people adopted a threatening and insolent attitude&quot;. It seems inevitable that in somecases, perhaps many, tools essential to the earning of a livelihood were taken from men who would never have used them for any offensive pur-pose and never would have permitted such use. For a man whose annual income is  20,  3 of which may have gone in taxes and in his contribu-tion to damage done by others, the cost of replacing a chopper may be aserious matter. No arrangement has been made for returning the imple-ments or for the payment of compensation. We must note that no firearmswere ever confiscated. One District Commissioner gave an order that fire-^&quot;^rms were &quot;fd&quot;&quot;be&quot;h*anded in but his Provincial Commissioner thought it unnecessary and they were returned.284. We were informed by the Government that the confiscation ofimplements was within the law. There is no provision in the law which gives a blanket authority for the seizure of implements in any circumstances,so we summarize for your information the two main provisions which are said to apply.(1) Seizure of implements from persons carrying them. Under Emer-gency Regulation 40 it is an offence, punishable with imprisonmentup to ten years, for a person to have in his possession any dangerousweapon (which by definition would include any agricultural implement)in circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that he had used or intends or is about to use it for any unlawful purpose. It iscontended that this presumption would arise in areas where &quot; riots etc.&quot;had occurred. This means that any person carrying on agriculturaloperations in a disturbed area or having an implement in his possessionfor the purpose can be arrested and imprisoned ; and as an incidentalconsequence the implement could be seized.(2) Seizure of implements from houses. So as to be sure that wedo no injustice to the argument we reproduce it verbatim. &quot; EmergencyRegulation 46 dealing with powers of search provides that where under that regulation premises may be entered and searched the police officer,etc., entering and searching &quot; may seize anything found therein &quot;.  There
Confiscation of implementsis no limitation whatever on this power. It is not in any way hmitedto seizing articles or things connected with an offence with which theperson is charged or in respect of which the searching officer suspectsthat evidence may be found. Thus, where an officer has entered under emergency Regulation 46 because he suspects the presence of Congressdocuments which might be evidence of an offence against section 72of the Penal Code there is nothing to stop him seizing any weapons which he finds in the house or on an individual in such house. Shortly,the effect of this regulation is that provided the officer can lawfullyenter under it he may seize anything which he finds in the premises oron any person therein.&quot; We did not go into the question whether regulation authorizing the seizure of property without compensation would be intra vires the Orders in Council 1939-1956.Section 17.  Governmental responsibility285. We considered that some of the acts recorded in this Report, cheifly this Part of it, as committed by or on behalf of the Government mightbe the subject of criticism. While the Government must and does take responsibility for all acts done in its name, we sought to ascertain to what extent they were part of a deliberate policy inaugurated by the Governmentand to what extent they were unauthorised irregularities. We shall give you the information we have obtained on this point under four heads.(1) Burning of houses. This occurred only in the Mlanje district andwas initiated by the D.C. on his own responsibility. It was not suggestedthat he had any legal power to do it and indeed he was at the timeaware that he had none. The Provincial Commissioner describes itas &quot; not strictly in accordance with the rules &quot;. It seems clear that the nyasaland Operations Committee immediately called for a report onthe subject. There were no more burnings and, as we have already mentioned, an application from the Northern Province for permission toburn was refused. On 13th March all D.C.&apos;s in the Central Provincewere instructed that punitive action of this nature must not be taken.(2) Confiscation of implements. No general orders were given about this. It was done on the initiative of the officer in command of thetroops which were searching the village; and when so done, itwas approved. The question of its legality did not arise until we askedfor information about it and this was produced after some research.(3) Use of unnecessary force in arrests. It was admitted that in somecases unnecessary force might appear to have been used and it wasnot suggested that that was other than illegal. There was no ex-press authorisation, but we think it is plain that individual officers were given a latitude which allowed them to behave as they thought fit and that their illegalities, often recorded in their own reports, wentunnoticed ofTmTebuKeaT^(4) Use of force in villages. It was not suggested that this was otherthan illegal and we are satisfied that these illegalities were expressly orimpliedly authorised from the top. We have referred to the conception of these operations and to the use of the words tough and punitive.
: I We do not suppose these words were used in orders of the day, but  we are satisfied that the intention behind them was clearly conveyed to the troops who had to execute them. We had very frank evidence onI  this point from the High Command of the Army. The Army regardedI  it as a military operation the object of which was to subdue trouble-some areas. It was a job which fell to the troops ; and it was felt better that they should do it rather than the police because the police hadi   to live with the people.   An aggressive and bullying attitude was^.;  part of the treatment ancTlack of&quot;submission to it meant hitting,.,&quot;and. beating... All this. was generally known and we sought opinionsabout it at every level in the administration.  They varied from thosewho thought it proper and desirable to those who thought it regrettablebut inevitable.286. The Government has not at any time, either before us or, so faras we are aware, to anyone else, expressed any regret for or disapproval ofwhat has been done under these heads. We record this as a fact and not as indicating that any expression of regret or disapproval is necessarilyappropriate ; that is a matter for you. We think that for many of theseactions there are thought to be sound administrative reasons. If that is so, no doubt you will be furnished with them. We do not set out such aswe have heard because it would be outside our province to discuss them or to discuss the larger question whether sound administrative reasons canjustify breaches of the law.
CONCLUSIONAt the end of this inquiry we are left with many debts to acknow-ledge, the first being to the Government of Nyasaland. It cannot be atall agreeable for any organisation to have to submit at short notice toan inquiry which demands the urgent preparation of a great deal of inform-ation. The task was nevertheless undertaken with speed and efficiency ;and without exception every officer in the administration willingly co-operated with us in the discharge of our duty. We had also to be accom-accommodated at short notice and we are particularly grateful for the use ofthe offices which were placed at our disposal in Zomba, no doubt at somesacrifice on the part of their normal occupants. The Government placedalso at our disposal the services of a liaison officer, Mr. P. A. Richardson,and we are greatly obliged to him for the work he did in the arrangement of a complicated itinerary.The Federal Government willingly provided us with all the informationwe asked for from them and made all the necessary arrangements to ensure that officers and men in the Federal army gave such evidence as we required. An act of Parliament of Southern Rhodesia permittedus to sit as a Commission in Bulawayo and take evidence there. We aregrateful to the Governor of Southern Rhodesia and to the Federal PrimeMinister personally for acts of kindness which made our visit to Bulawayoparticularly pleasant.Finally we must record that the work of Mr. A. J. Fairclough was far more onerous than that which usually falls to the secretary of a Corn-mission. He was the officer through whom we made all our enquiries andcollected all our material. A great deal of this v/ork had to be done while we were on the move from place to place in Nyasaland. It was necessaryfor us to adhere to a rigid timetable and at the same time to make sure that every witness was available at the place where it was most convenient for him to be heard. It was largely due to our secretary that while keepingstrictly to our schedule we never left any place without taking the evidenceof every witness who desired to be heard there, including many whopresented themselves at very short notice. Mr. Fairclough was responsiblealso for the collection and filing of a constantly increasing mass of oral andwritten evidence. In this he was greatly assisted by Mr. W. E. Sorrell and miss M. Wigley and, in expressing our gratitude to them, we would addalso the names of our verbatim reporters, Miss B. s. Dunn, Miss M. P.Hutton and Mrs. C. E. Perkins ; they all very willingly worked extremelylong hours and contributed their share to the completion of our task. Finally,our secretary achieved a mastery over the voluminous data collected whichhas proved indispensable in the preparation of this Report. All this required a degree of ability, efficiency and industry far beyond the ordinary measure and v/e are all most grateful to him for the whole of his work.
APPENDIX ILetter from H. B. Chipembere to M. W. K. Chiumec/o The Nyasaland African Congress,Congress Secretariat,P.O. Box 30,BLANTYRE.2nd February, 1959.M. VV. K. Chiume, Esq., M.L.C.,200 Gower Street,London, N.W.I.Dear Kanyama,Thanks for yours to Du. He is out of office for the present moment,having gone to with George Nyandoro.   My ban in SouthernRhodesia made it impossible for the preparatory meeting of leaders to takeplace in Salisbury. George, being determined to have the meeting held, arranged that it takes place in Blantyre, but then a sudden ban descended on Sipalo he was arrested and sent back to Northern Rhodesia! They had, however,managed to lay down plans and dates for the Blantyre meeting and Georgecame here on the agreed date, but this still couldn&apos;t&apos;t suit Sipalo. So It wasdecided that Du and George should go to and meet Sipalo there.This has at last been achieved. The imperialists are quite baffled. Policehave been enquiring where George and Du are!So I am staying in Blantyre to try and fill the vacuum created by Du&apos;sabsence.   You would pitty me if you saw how miserably I fail to fill it fully!You may have heard that we had an Emergency Conference. although some of the branches had as little as-24 hours&apos; notice for it, it was by far themost representative of all conferences ever held by Congress. We must havehad no less than 220 delegates. The agenda was secret and I am afraid I must avoid committing it in writing just now. In short, I can only inform you that for the first time, Congress adopted &quot; action &quot; as the official policy and&quot; action &quot; in the real sense of action. Some suspected delegates were thrown out, and &quot; I am told &quot; that some of them were given fists by Congress Policeas they left the conference venue. Bwana Chaluluka has met his fateful end.He was unanimously rejected by conference as a delegate and the conferencewent on to order that he should immediately be thrown out of the Central body and this has been duly done. You and I need suffer no qualmes about this.We did our best. We saw merit in him and we caused him to be elevatedto the Cabinet. But he misbehaved at the most crucial moment. As soonas we began discussions on the secret items to be presented to ConferenceBwana Chaluluka began to falter. His participation in the discussions becamescantier and scantier, and his expressions of opinion more and more non-committal. He then decided to absent himself from the final meeting of theCentral Body and ended by staying away from the first half of the secret session of the conference. He arrived very late and gave lame explanations.In view what we had advised him to say to his employers in order to be released from duty that day, these explanations failed to satisfy delegates andthe more he explained the more suspicious the delegates became. I cannot saymuch here; but it is clear that the Bwana was a real snake, and it is a greatpity that you and I had placed so much confidence in him.No abandoning of the Kwaca plans please. You retain the manuscriptsand when you get to Dar, remind us to send you some more, based on recentoccurrences. The Newsletter is a mere stop-gap and cannot satisfy the thirstof Nyasas. (Brother, you cannot imagine the state of nationalism now. Ifwe are not careful, the whole thing might go out of hand. Boys are really,really hot and determined.
We understand your desire for news both for yourself and for our friendsout there; but we just can&apos;t cope. The work of the office is simply stupendous.When I am here, it is worse because I have to handle everything, constituencycomplain included, and these come in their hundreds.I do not seem to be well-informed about the documents to which yourefer which Chiefs Kuntaja and others were asked to sign. None of these, tothe best of my knowledge, were released and in fact, it is only Mwasi whosigned Kuntaja and Msamala refused. The documents were taken back bythe European officers. But Mwasi wrote a letter of self-explanation to Dr.Banda to state exactly what it was he had signed i.e. that he had not sold usdown the river, but that he had merely been asked to refresh his promise of 1953 to the effect that he would not associate himself with Congress. Wecaused this letter to be duplicated and I read a copy in Legco.Now about the Zomba incident: Women Leaguers, under Mrs. Ntenda(Chairman, Zomba) lined along the road to see Dr. Banda pass. They had refused to move when police had tried to disperse them. After his passingen route to Government House, they formed up and advanced towards Govern-ment House, shouting Kwaca, etc. They were stopped by Police and askedwhitherto? They said we want to see Dr. Banda immediately he comes out ofGovernment House to hear the results of his talks with the Governor. Theywere told to go away. Nothing doing! They advanced still. A clash occurredand some of them were beaten. But no going back. They advanced! In theend, the police arrested a few of them. The remainder protested. They began to protest physically and insisted that if some are arrested, then all must be arrested!   (Have you ever seen it?)   So the Police arrested them 36 in all.When he came out of the Government House (with Karua photographingus with the newly bought Congress Cinema Camera), Nyasulu reported to us that over 50 women had been arrested.   We were hot red hot.In the meantime, the Local Congress branch had forced the police to givea permit (at 5 hours&apos; notice) for a meeting to be addressed by Kamuzu 15minutes after his return from Government House. The meeting was held inthe open ground in front of the Recreation Hall. It was fireworks pure and simple. Doctor condemned the Government like nobody&apos;s business and announced to the crowd (of no less than 6,000) that 50 women had been arrested.Mrs. Chibambo paid tribute to gallant women. I declared that immediate action must be taken to save these women. Our speeches at the meeting weretape-recorded. (We spoke into police microphones with a tape connection this has become the rule for all Kamuzu meetings). My part in the Zombariot is being fully investigated and Nyasulu tells me that there is an arrestwarrant ready for me at the police station -but the hitch? Nobody is willingto give evidence against me. Even security boys have told their officers thatthey will have to resign if they are forced to give evidence in court against me.But the arrest warrant has not been withdrawn.
