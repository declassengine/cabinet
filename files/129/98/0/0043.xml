DEVELOPMENT OF CO-OPERATION WITHMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation am circulating this note for the information of my colleagues.It represents the agreedview of the Civil Aviation Policy Committee onthe policy we should adopt towards the possible development of closerassociations between the British air line corporations and the air linesof Commonwealth and Continental European countries.2.     We have considered the problems posed for the corporations bythe formation of Air Union (which is an association, but not a completemergersof the air lines of France, Germany, Italy and Belgium), andwhether, in the field of civil aviation we should take any initiative inrelation to the wider movements towards the integration of european economic affairs.   While the formation of Air Union has certainly been influenced by political considerations in the Common Markets countries,it is also the result of some of the major problems facing the air lineindustry throughout the world.3.     The airline industry today needs bigger markets to match the greatly increased capacity of the new jets.   The struggle between individual air lines to increase their share of the total traffic willintensify and rationalisation methods (whereby two or more air linesco-operate in their efforts to achieve economies in sales, routeoperation and maintenance) will become more widespread.4.    We are dealing with this situation in a number of ways.   Thepolicy of cheaper fares which the British air lines will pursue at thenext meeting of the International Air Transport Association (I.A.T.A.)is part of the answer.   If it fails we may have to introduce speciallycheap fares on our own domestic routes to the Colonies and reconsiderour policy towards I.A.T.A. as far as international routes are concerned.5.   Next, our Commonwealth partnerships in civil aviation must be developed to the greatest possible extent.      British Overseas airways corporation (B.O.A.C.) already have commercial agreements with thenational airlines of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Central AfricaEast Africa, Malaya, Ghana and Nigeria and partnerships with Canada,India and Pakistan are also being explored.   The Corporation also have investments in Colonial air lines and help the air lines of emergentterritories.-1-$DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 143 CO PY NO.v^27th July, 1959CABINET
6.   There are other countries, outside the Commonwealth, where our air lines can by co-operatives arrangements safeguard their interests without detriment to the Commonwealth partnerships.For example, B.O.A.C. are at present negotiating with the Portugueseair line with the object of rationalising their respective services to South America and Central and Southern Africa.   They are alsonegotiating with the Argentine air line who are attracted to theidea of an agreement with B.O.A.C. because they too operate Comets.7.     british european Airways (B.E,A.) for their part rely very considerably on commercial agreements with other air lines as a means of maintaining and improving their share of the Europeantraffic, which is very high.   They carry in fact nearly 60 per cent of the total intro-European traffic and their negotiating position istherefore one of considerable strength.   They are in pool with allthe Western European air lines and have recently negotiatedparticularly close agreements with the air lines of Greece and portugal which will bring important benefits and involve, in the firstcase, the use of Comets and, in the second, Viscounts.Co-operation with Air Union8.   We have carefully considered whether it would pay for our air lines to take a share in Air Union.   Both Corporations are agreedthat Air Union would not admit them unless they reduce substantiallytheir present share of traffic.   B.E.A. believe that they can maintain their position in relation to the individual members of Air Union by continuing their present policy of commercial agreements with eachof them, Air Union having let it be known that these agreementswill continue in force.   B.O.A.C. for their part could not reconciletheir Commonwealth partnerships with a share in Air Union.   Wehave come to the conclusion that our air lines will do better todevelop the Commonwealth and other partnerships of their ownchoosing rather than to attempt to join an existing &quot;club&quot; at this stage.Co-operation with SAS (Scandinavian Airlines System) ancl/orKLM (Royal Dutch Airlines)9.  B.E.A. are in pool with these two airlines, as they are with theair lines of Air Union, on routes which they operate in common.B.O.A.C. have not ruled out the idea of co-operating with either ofthem but feel they cannot take the initiative at present as itmight prejudice their relations with their Commonwealth partners.They have said, however, that they are ready to consider anyproposition which either air line may put to them.   So far no approachhas been made to B.O.A.C.Implications for the air craft manufacturing industry10. The Committee have considered whether, in the long term, asRussia develops as an influence in international civil aviation andas supersonic transport aircraft come closer, it might be in our interest to co-operate more closely with the Americans.   TheCommittee have also born closely in mind the interrelationshipbetween the aircraft operating and the aircraft manufacturing industries.At present for example the air lines of Air Union look like going,in their future purchases, entirely for American and French aircraft
(albeit with a proportion of British engines);  whereas a closer link with European air lines, including possible membership of Air Unionrather than co-operation with it, could conceivably influence theseair lines, particularly if the association led to a common equipmentpolicy, to adopt the British types at present in use or on order bythe Corporations.   Such a link might, therefore, be accepted as aproposition of advantage to the .national economy in the long term,despite its immediate unattractiveness to the Corporations from theirown commercial point of view.   A detailed study by officials on the implications of our civil aviation policy for the future of the aircraftmanufacturing industry has been put in hand.Conclusions11.   My conclusion which is endorsed by my colleagues in theCommittee on Civil Aviation Policy is that our strength in air transport depends for the present primarily on developing ourpartnerships with Commonwealth air lines and with selected foreignair lines who have the most to offer to us.    E.ecent Commonwealthdevelopments in the field of civil aviation have not been unhopefuland consideration should now be given to their further developmentperhaps at Governmental level.   In general the aim of our policyis to do all we can to improve the commercial position of the corporations and to assist them to meet existing competition fromthe Americans, Air Union and other Continental European air lines.The establishment of closer relations with the European air linesthrough such links, including the possibility of sales of our aircraft,presents greater difficulties which we are still examining to see how we can maintain our present advantages while improving our prospects for the longer term.H.W.Ministry of transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1.27th July, 1959-3
