^CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITA .INIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)On 23rd April the Cabinet agreed that the United Kingdom Governmentshould support the initiative taken by the International Bank for reconstruction and Development to secure a settlement of the Indus Waters problem andshould be prepared in principle to contribute  15 millions provided the plan was accepted by India and Pakistan and that Canada and Australia were alsowilling to make contributions of the order of  6 millions and  4 millionsrespectively (C.C. (59) 25th Conclusions, Minute 6).    After ascertainingthat Canada and Australia were prepared to make these contributions, Iinformed the President of the International Bank, Mr. Eugene 331acktaccordingly.    We also asked New Zealand whether she would be prepared tomake a contribution and were told that she was witling in principle tocontribute  1 million.2.     Mr. Black&apos;s presentation of the proposals to the Indian and pakistan Governments, during visits to Delhi and Karachi in May, was inthe main successful and there is now good reason to think that a settlementof this important problem will be reached on the basis of the international bank&apos;s proposals.    The Bank has,   however, agreed to make some minor amendments to their plan to take account of certain Fakistani objections.These amendments, apart from securing Pakistani agreement, will be animprovement to the plan  but, together with certain other adjustments in the financing of the plan, they led the Bank on 27th May to say that it wanted theUnited Kingdom, Canada and Australia to put up an extra $30 millions betweenthem.    The Bank justified this increase on the grounds that it had alwaysenvisaged that the total contribution from these three countries should be$100 millions but had put in a first figure of $70 millions in order to secure a larger United States contribution.3.     Before I could seek the views of my colleagues on this request,there was a further development.    When the Federal Minister for economic affairs, Dr. Erhard, was in Washington in June he told Mr. Black that theWest German Government would like to make a contribution and Mr. Blackin turn told us that he hoped the German contribution would be at least$30 millions and would thus take account of the increase asked for fromthe Commonwealth.    Accordingly, I arranged for the Bank to be informed on 8th July that, while we were ready to consider sympathetically anyproposal which the Bank put forward to help enable them raise the money required, we found it difficult to justify to ourselves the bank&apos;s proposal that the whole of the  $3 0 millions needed should be provided by the threeCommonwealth contributors.    We assumed, however, that Dr. Erhard&apos;sC.(59) 13 828th July, 1959CAB I &quot;ETINDUS waters memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations-1-
initiative altered the situation and we proposed therefore to await revised proposals from the Bank as to the size of the Commonwealth contribution which would take into account the possibility of a German contribution.4.     On 14th July, Mr. Black wrote to me (and to the appropriateMinisters of the United States, Canadian, Australian and New zealand governments) asking me to confirm our willingness &quot;to give favourable consideration to making a contribution towards the cost of the proposedestimate of works over a ten-year period&quot; before the Bank began its meeting in London on 5th August with representatives from India and Pakistan witha view to drawing up the Heads of an International Water Treaty.    Mr. Blackasked for a reply by 28th July if possible, but I did not submit the matter tomy colleagues at that stage because we still lacked clarity about the german contribution.    If a German contribution was to be forthcoming we hoped thatit might be possible to get the Bank to agree that it should be used firstlyto reduce the sum asked for from the United Kingdom, Canada and Australiafrom $100 millions to the $70 millions originally requested and that any additional sum should be used to effect a pro rata reduction of the grantsbeing made by all contributing countries, including the United. States.5.     We have, however, now heard that Dr. Erhard has written toMr. Black expressing German willingness to make a grant equivalent to$30 millions to be used specifically for relief of the Indian contribution tothe settlement, and expressly not to be used to reduce the amounts beingcontributed by the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia andNew Zealand.    The Bank proposed replying that, whilst Germany is morethan welcome to contribute to the Indian balance of payments problems ingeneral, a contribution in this manner cannot be accepted by the Bank asbeing a contribution to the Indus Waters scheme.    I am sure that this line,which the Bank has already agreed with the United States State Department,is the right one.    The Indian contribution is in effect a fixed payment forthe use of the Eastern Rivers waters and is different in kind from the othercontributions.    Furthermore, it has been agreed with the Indian and pakistan Governments and to re-open discussion of it might result in the pakistan Government wishing to re-open other matters already agreed.Lastly, the German presentation of their proposal suggests a risk that theymight argue subsequently that it should be offset against whatevercontribution they made as a member of the &quot;Creditors Consortium&quot; togeneral economic assistance to India.6.     The figure which the Bank is now asking us to provide (in freeforeign exchange over ten years) is $58.4 millions ( 20. 8 millions).    when allowance has been made for the New Zealand contribution this works out at the same proportion of the Commonwealth contribution ($100 millions)as we had agreed in principle to provide when the Commonwealthcontribution was to be $70 millions.    The Eank has undertaken that &quot;ifany other friendly Governments should participate in the financing, theBank would then review the situation and propose such adjustments in the financing of the Plan as might be appropriate for the altered circumstances&quot;,but it may be some time before it is known whether the BankTs rejoinderreferred to in paragraph 5 above will induce the Germans to withdraw their conditions and make a free grant.    I understand that the Canadian Govern-ment have already given an assurance, on the lines asked, that they willgive the figure asked from them ($23. 2 millions) and that the australian government ($15. 6 millions) is likely to do so shortly.-2-
7.     For the reasons set out in paragraph 7 of my memorandum C. (59) 72I feel that it is in our widest interests to give the Bank the assurance forwhich they ask and I recommend that I should be authorised to do so.     Iwould, of course, make it clear in my reply to Mr. Black that our assuranceboth as to magnitude and as to its being in free foreign exchange availablefor competitive international tender, is conditional on the other contributorsgiving similar assurances.Commonwealth Relations Office,S. W. 1.27th July, 1959.
