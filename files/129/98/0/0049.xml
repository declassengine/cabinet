(59) 149 Copy No. 3 2Nth September, 1959CABINETSUEZ CANAL COMPENSATION: INCOME TAX LIABILITYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Suez Finance Company (formerly the Suez Canal Company) is in processof receiving compensation totalling  29 millions from Egypt. Payment is beingmade by instalments; the initial instalment of  5,432,000 was paid at the end of1958;  4,100,000 was paid on 1st January, 1959; and further instalments are dueas follows:  1st January, 1960...............      7,175,0001st January, 1961   ...............       4,100,0001st January, 1962   ...............       4,100,0001st January, 1963   ............      ...      4,100,0002. Following receipt of the first instalment the Company (which since the seizure of the Canal had been unable to pay any dividend) made a specialdistribution to the shareholders. The distribution was, in fact, mostly in the formof shares in one of the Company&apos;s subsidiaries, but the income tax problem which arose was essentially the same as if the distribution had been wholly in cash.3. In the light of a House of Lords decision on a similar case (commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Reid&apos;s Trustees: 30 T.C. 431) the Inland Revenue ruled that united Kingdom shareholders would be liable to income tax in respect of thisdistribution. The ruling led at the time to protests and Press criticism, and Ihave since had representations from the Chairman of the London Stock exchange and other sources, urging me to intervene. I have not yet replied to these representations, but I shall have to do so shortly.4. I am advised that the legal position is clear; but shareholders who wishto dispute liability on legal grounds have of course the right to appeal to theCourts. In fact the criticisms have been mainly in the sense that, whatever thelegal position, it is inequitable that shareholders should be taxed on paymentsarising out of compensation for the loss of a capital asset, i.e., the Canal concession.5. The argument by reference to equity is not, however, so clear cut as might appear at first sight. Where an overseas company makes a distribution toshareholders the amount is treated under United Kingdom law as their taxableincome so long as the company&apos;s capital remains intact, i.e., unless it is paid inreduction of capital or in liquidation. This principle was endorsed by the RoyalCommission on the Taxation of Profits and Income (who recommended its extension to &quot; capital&quot; dividends paid by United Kingdom companies) and there seems in general no reason to alter it.6. It is not easy to find any clear ground for making an exception in favourof the Suez Finance Company&apos;s shareholders. The company had a largeaccumulation of profits ploughed back over many years, and since its capital remainsintact the present payments are essentially equivalent to a distribution out of theseaccumulated profits, which, of course, have not paid United Kingdom tax in thepast since the company was not resident here. The existence of the accumulatedprofits is illustrated by the fact that the paid up value of the Suez Finance55836
Company&apos;s shares is 10,000 francs per share, while the current market price(31st August, 1959) is 47,470 francs. (The possibility that United Kingdom taxmight have been avoided by dressing up the distributions as a capital reconstructionseems to have been precluded by complications of French law, and the divergentinterests of the French shareholders who have most of the voting strength.)7. In any event, it would be out of the question to provide special relief fromtax ip this one case of the Suez Finance Company&apos;s distributions. Any relief wouldhavo to apply generally to some defined class of cases where the distribution islinked with the payment of compensation for the nationalisation (or otherexpropriation) of a capital asset. Such cases, however, do not necessarily involve any unique degree of hardship to the shareholders fundamentally different fromother risks of overseas investment; the compensation received by the company maybe equal to the full current value of the expropriated assets. In such a case thereare no obvious grounds for departing from the principle of the present law. Therewould, however, be no practical means of distinguishing such cases and limiting therelief to those cases which arouse sympathy because the compensation appears tobe inadequate. Incidentally it is possible now that some of the present shareholdersmay have bought their shares quite recently and, indeed, with the understandingthat the distributions out of the compensation would be liable to United Kingdomtax.8. This is not the sort of case where relief from tax can be given in the formof an extra-statutory concession a procedure which is not appropriate where, thereis room for argument and controversy. Relief would have to be given by an amendment to the law in favour of a defined class of cases-in a direction oppositeto that recommended by the Royal Commission. Further, if the present case wereto be met in full the amendment would need to be given retrospective effect; thiswould be an unusual procedure even if the principle of the existing law were generally thought to be wrong, and in the present instance it might well be highly controversial. I am therefore doubtful whether there are sufficiently strong grounds for legislation.9. I am prepared if my colleagues think this course best to tell the Chairmanof the Stock Exchange and others that I am sorry I cannot intervene. It is likely that this decision will be strongly criticised in financial circles and, in any case,the controversy is likely to be reawakened when, as seems probable, the SuezFinance Company make a further distribution to shareholders in some form later this year. On the other hand, there is no reason to think that any considerablenumber of private shareholders will be affected. Precise information is notavailable, because the shares are in bearer form, but the indications are that onlya small proportion of the Company&apos;s shares are held in the United Kingdom (apartfrom the Government^ own holding).D.
