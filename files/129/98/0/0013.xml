1 -   j- vCONFIDENTIALthis DOCUMENT is THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1959C. (59)113 Copy No.     329th July, 1959.CABINETARGENTINAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the following note on the background to recent events in Argentina, and their bearing on British interests.2. In December 1958, Argentina faced bankruptcy. With the support of,and indeed under pressure from, the Armed Forces, which have been since theRevolution the ultimate source of power, Dr. Frondizi, the President of Argentina,introduced an austere and conservative economic programme based on therecommendations of the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.). He thus obtainedan I.M.F. standby of $75 millions and loans to a total of $24 millions from UnitedStates official and private sources. The largely Peronista controlled unions,however, were determined to do all they could to retain the privileged position andstandard of life which they had enjoyed under General Peron. They consideredthat the President had betrayed his election promises and bitterly opposed hisausterity campaign. There has been some evidence that the Peronistas, who havemass support but whose leadership is weak and divided, and the Communists, whohave skilful leadership but little mass following, have been considering workingtogether, especially in the unions. Well organised strikes caused considerable damage to production. The Government, however, showed great firmness. they refused to negotiate with the unions until the strikes were called off. Theymobilised the strikers, imprisoned their leaders and accused the Peronistas and the communists of threatening Argentina&apos;s recovery by their subversive activities.After the riots in April 1959 the Communist Party was banned and four iron-curtain diplomatists expelled. Avowedly Peronista activities have of course beenprohibited since the Revolution.3. Since the early part of the year therefore Dr. Frondizi has governed withthe support of the Armed Forces and the Right, i.e., his opponents in the 1958elections, against the opposition of his erstwhile supporters of the Left. nevertheless he has not abandoned his policy of national reconciliation which included some kind of agreement with labour leaders as being, in his opinion, the only long-termsolution of Argentina&apos;s troubles. The bulk of the Armed Forces remain bitterlyopposed to anything which smacks of appeasement of the Peronistas. In the armed Forces there appear to be three main groups. The first and probably thelargest are the moderates as exemplified by General Aramburu who wasprovisional President from 1955-58. Although determined to prevent anyrecurrence of Peronism this group believe firmly in democratic government andwould only remove Dr. Frondizi if convinced that the country faced catastrophe.The second group are. the so-called &quot; Gorillas.&quot; Their anti-Peronista feelings are so strong that they would like to remove all &quot; collaborationist &quot; elements and have for a considerable time now favoured removing Dr. Frondizi as utterly unreliable.They are quite prepared if necessary to see the restoration of military government.The third group are the so-called &quot; Green Dragons &quot; who are ultra-Nationalist butare even more strongly opposed than the other groups to the use of Armed forces for breaking strikes, &amp;c, and to what they regard as the unfair incidence ofausterity on the rich and the poor. In all cases as so often in Latin Americapersonalities are as important as policies.55473
4. The President has thus been under continuous pressure to purge his administration of collaborationists and those who were thought not to support the recovery programme. But although he has made a number of concessions, and,for instance, dispensed with the services of some of his more objectionable personaladvisers, he has wriggled with considerable skill to preserve the maximum of independence.5. The present crisis is the latest step in the Armed Forces campaign and wassparked off by the publication on 11th June by the Peronista leaders of what wasclaimed to be the text of an agreement between General Peron and Dr. Frondizibefore the elections of 1958 under which Dr. Frondizi in return for the Peronistavote is alleged to have made quite far-reaching promises to the Peronistas. Themoderates and the &quot; Gorillas &quot; combined to demand the resignation of the Under-Secretary for War who was thought by some to have neo-Peronist designs (hopingfor the support of the &quot; Green Dragons &quot; and some elements in the Unions). The&quot; Gorillas &quot; then went on to demand the resignation of Dr. Frondizi himself butin the final resort the moderates sided with the President, possibly as the only alternative to a military government. Some of the &quot; Gorilla &quot; leaders were arrestedbut Dr. Frondizi was forced to agree to replace the whole of the economic side ofhis Administration. The direction of economic and social policy has now been entrusted to Sefior Alsogaray, for long a strong opponent of Dr. Frondizi and anardent advocate of free enterprise. The Minister of War who was also regarded with suspicion by the Right-wing groups has also been obliged to resign.6. It is very doubtful however whether a lasting solution has been found.Dr. Frondizi has clearly suffered a major setback. The Government also facesvery serious economic difficulties over the next few months if not years. the armed forces still remain suspicious of the President^ intentions and theappointment of Senor Alsogaray has greatly displeased the moderate Left andsympathisers with the &quot; Green Dragons &quot; in the army. Nevertheless opinionremains overwhelmingly in favour of the maintenance of constitutional governmentand so far at least no strong personality has arisen who could canalise the discontentof the Left.7. It is much in our interest that Dr. Frondizi should remain in power.Austerity is essential for some time to come. If economic and political stabilitycan be restored Argentina could be a very good market for our exports. On theother hand a relapse into military government would probably, in the long run,strengthen the hand of extreme Peronist and Communist elements. It is extremely doubtful, moreover, whether the armed forces contain any personality capable ofsustaining an unpopular economic policy long enough to set the country on its legsagain. Finally the failure of Argentina&apos;s attempt to resume democratic governmentwould have a depressing effect on the present healthy trend towards more genuinelydemocratic methods all over Latin America.S.
