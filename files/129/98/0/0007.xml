secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majestys GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. June 1959C. (59) 107 Copy No.26th June, 1959CABINETEVACUATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy SealEvacuation policy the Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence have been considering the problemof planned evacuation; and I think the Cabinet should now decide on the action weare to take.2. In 1956 we put to the local authority associations a scheme for theevacuation of some 12 millions of the priority classes from the larger, centres of population. This scheme must now be abandoned because the reception areas inthe eastern half of England, where the aerodromes and missile sites are likely to beprimary targets, can no longer be used, and the rest of the reception areas cannotaccommodate so large a number of people.3.  We are satisfied that the alternatives now are (a) To have no general evacuation arrangements at all, but to urge people to stay where they are.(b) To investigate a modified scheme which might cover the evacuation in aperiod of seven days of about half the number of people previously proposed. The reduction in numbers would be achieved by omittingsome of the evacuation areas originally included. An outline of thisscheme is given in Annex A.4. A case can be made out for having no evacuation scheme at all. Itis doubtful whether evacuation would ever be ordered or, if it were, whether theenemy would allow us the time required for its completion. A limited scheme wouldbe the subject of complaint from areas not included in it; and if it were put intoforce, it might stimulate a mass movement of people outside its scope. This woulddefeat &quot; stay-put,&quot; which must be our basic policy. Finally, if BLUE STREAKsites were established in the west of the country as I understand the Minister ofDefence may propose no part of the country would be safer than another, andevacuation might become quite impracticable. Any scheme adopted now might therefore have to be abandoned in 1965--when BLUE STREAK is expected to beready with the awkv/ardness that the Government of the day would have to explainwhy at that stage they were tearing up plans made public only a few years before.5. On the other hand, an evacuation scheme, even if it is on a reduced scale,would be likely to save more lives than any other single measure, in the absenceof specially provided shelter. An announcement that no evacuation scheme is planned would serve notice that the whole country is equally at risk (which is notat present true, or likely to be in the near future) and that there is in theGovernments view no means of reducing the very heavy casualties which wouldresult from nuclear attack on the larger centres of civilian population. The argument that Civil Defence is of no value would seem to its critics to be strengthened; the55399
maintenance of the Civil Defence Services and of Civil Defence planning would, tothat extent, be made more difficult; the credibility of the deterrent might be undermined; our position in relation to our North Atlantic allies would be an embarrassing one; and there would be renewed agitation for the provision of shelterin the built-up areas.P 6. My view is that we cannot at present abandon evacuation planning. doubt whether a scheme would be implemented is not a sufficient reason for not havingone which could be put into operation if the Government of the day so decided; itcould not be improvised at short notice. I suggest, therefore, that we should ask the local authority associations to come and discuss with us perhaps after the recess the outlines of the modified scheme to which I have referred. In themeantime, I do not think we should give them any advance details of it, at any rateuntil the discussions are imminent; and when we do discuss it, we should make it plain that we are prepared to consider any comments they might have, includingcomments from areas initially omitted. If I have to make a statement in Parliament I have in recent weeks had to deal with a number of Questions on this subject Ishould propose to do so on the lines of the draft appended to this memorandum(Annex B).An Interim Evacuation Scheme7. It is also necessary to decide whether any work should be done in themeantime, in secret, on an interim evacuation plan (based very broadly on thelong-term one). Any fully organised scheme would take about two years to workout. If we have to contemplate as I think v/e must the possibility of an extremeemergency in that period, should we have some interim evacuation plan which couldbe operated if Ministers so decide? Such a plan would necessarily be very roughand ready, but it should at any rate be more effective than anything that could beimprovised at the last moment. Its preparation would require more staff, or the diversion of officers from ordinary peacetime work. The plans would, of course,be made in secret, without consultation with the local authority associations. Onthe whole, I think we ought to have such an interim scheme.conclusion. I shall be glad to know whether the Cabinet agree that the long-term problem should be handled as I have proposed; and that, in the meantime,the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment should prepare in secret an interim scheme.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,25th June, 1959.
Annex A .Outline of Modified Evacuation scheme the scheme would provide for the official evacuation of about 6\ million people from the following centres of population:  Approximate numbers to be EvacuatedMillionsLondon ............ 2-9Birmingham    ...      ......... 0-7Manchester     ............ 0-4Merseyside     ............ 0-6Tyneside        ......      ...... 0-3Leeds/Bradford       ......... 0-4Sheffield        ............ 0-3Tees-side       ............ 0-1Hull     ............... 0,1Glasgow        ............ 0-5Edinburgh      ......The persons to be evacuated would be expectant mothers, young childrenaccompanied by their mothers or other responsible persons, adolescents, theaged-infirm, the blind and the crippled. This is about 45 per cent, of the population in any given area.The reception areas in England and Wales would be generally to the west ofa line running from Bournemouth to the south of the Tees, with, in addition, Sussexand the southern parts of Kent and Surrey.It is estimated that the movement of these numbers could be completed withina period of seven days, about 65 per cent, being carried by rail, 15 per cent, by publicroad transport, and 20 per cent, by private transport.The task of local authorities would be the marshalling of evacuees in evacuationareas, and their reception and billeting in reception areas. The movement by rail and public road services would require the preparation of schedules in advance.Annex draft Parliamentary Statement on EvacuationAs I informed the House in February last, the Government have been-examining the scheme for the evacuation of priority classes.The targets which would be selected for attack in any future war must be amatter for conjecture: and the effect of fall-out would depend upon conditions ofwhich only a general forecast can be made. No evacuation scheme can thereforebe precisely related to probable risks.Moreover the geographical circumstances of our island, the nature and effectof modern nuclear weapons and the psychology of resistance alike coincide in thedesirability of the maximum number of able-bodied persons staying put and seeingit through.Nevertheless, the Government remain of the view that plans, which could be implemented if the Government of the day so decided and time allowed, should beprepared for reducing the concentration of population in some of the largest urban areas by the dispersal of mothers, young children and adolescents, and the aged andinfirm, to billets in the country.The evacuation scheme previously mentioned in the House was a tentative oneproposed as a basis of discussion. It has now been reviewed in the light of thelatest appreciation of the strategic situation, of the accommodation available in suitable reception areas, and of the transport and other factors which have to betaken into account. As a result, my right honourable Friends the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Minister of Housing and Local Government propose, indue course, to discuss revised arrangements with the local authority associations.Until these discussions have taken place it would be premature to indicate the natureof the plans we have in mind, which at present are necessarily still tentative.
