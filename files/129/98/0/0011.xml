OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)AGRICULTURAL POLICY: WIT HDRAWAL OMARGINAlTpROD tjCTION&quot; GRANT S&quot;Memoranc1 up by the Secretary of State for scotland on 10th March the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture, to arrange for a more gradual withdrawal ofthe Marginal Agricultural Production Scheme in Scotland and authorisedme to announce my intention of meeting the Scottish National Farmers&apos;Union (N.  .U.) to hear their views on the subject (C. C. (59) 15thConclusions, Minute 4).   This announcement had the desired effect ofending, for the time being, the widespread agitation in Scotland aboutthe proposed withdrawal of the marginal grants.2.     I am now able to report to my colleagues the conclusions I havereached in the light of the N.F.U.&apos;s representations.   If we are to avoid a fresh spate of criticism on this issue it is essential that I should makea statement of the Government&apos;s intentions in the House before the summer recess and, for convenience, I have therefore put my proposals in theform of the attached Parliamentary statement which could be used as the reply to an arranged Question.3.     On the immediate issue of a more gradual withdrawal of MarginalAgricultural Production (M.A.P.) assistance, the Scottish N.F.U. leadersare prepared for a further tapering of the total amount of assistanceavailable under the Scheme over the next three cropping seasons 1960,1961 and 1962 so long as there is no exclusion of marginal units fromassistance solely on account of their size.    This is a reference to theprovisions of the Agriculture (Small Farmers) Act, 1959, which enablemarginal grants to be continued until July, 1962, to those already receivingthem but only in respect of farm businesses of no more than 150 acres of crops and grass.    There is, in my view, considerable substance inthe N. F. U.&apos;s contention that, because of the character of the marginalland problem in Scotland, it would be quite inequitable to apply an automatic cut-off based on the acreage of marginal holdings.    An orderly and politically defensible arrangement for any running-down of M.A.P.assistance in Scotland requires in my view that the Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees should not be bound by an arbitrary acreage limit, although they would take into account the economy of the enterprise as a whole.1 propose, therefore, to make a further Scheme for the three croppingseasons I960 to 1962 under the general powers provided by Section 75 ofthe Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948.4.     Under this further Scheme, the total allocation of money to theAgricultural Executive Committees for marginal assistance, which amounted to  1.2 millions for 1958 (the last year before the process of withdrawl started) and  900,000 for the current year would be furtherC.(59) 111COPY NO. 3i3rd July, 1959CABINET:ret
progressively reduced to  600,000 in 1962.    As the Small Farmer Schemeitself has only a limited application in Scotland, the total annual cost ofboth Schemes over this period would not exceed the  1. 2 millions spenton MA-.P. assistance alone in 1958.5.     As regards the position after 1962, the view of the Scottish N.F.U.leaders is that special assistance of some kind will continue to be requiredfor a hard core of marginal aid recipients if livestock production andemployment in the Highlands and other upland areas are not to be prejudiced.    This view is,-l know, shared by other responsible leaders of farming opinion in Scotland and also by our own supporters in the House.1 am bound to recognise that the gradual withdrawal of marginal assistance will leave a hard core of difficult cases in 1962, and 1 feel that some further consideration will need to be given to them.    1 accordingly proposein paragraph 4 of the statement that, before the expiry of the M.A.P.Scheme in 1962, a review should be carried out of those farms stillreceiving assistance.    The Government have already stated their intentionof studying the special problem of non-viable farm businesses throughoutthe United Kingdom, and the review 1 have in mind would have regard tothe results of this study.6.     The Minister of Agriculture, with whom 1 have discussed theseproposals, feels unable to agree to paragraph 4 of the statement in itspresent form, in view of possible repercussions in England and Wales andNorthern Ireland.    He has suggested that this paragraph should beprefaced by a categorical statement that the Government adhere to theview that the M.A.P. Scheme as such must be brought to an end in 1962.I understand that his view, which he intends to state in a separate paper,is that unless we clearly rule out now any continuation of M.A.P. grants in Scotland after 1962 there will be strong pressure in England and wales and Northern Ireland for reconsideration of the marginal grants schemesthere.    While I appreciate the Ministers concern, 1 should have thoughtthat any representations to this effect could well be met with the reply that the statement as drafted does not involve any commitment to continueM.A.P. assistance in Scotland beyond 1962.    Insofar as any English orUlster case rests on the ground of comparable treatment, there can beno basis for discussion until the Government reach the stage of deciding what special action, if any, should be taken in the light of the proposedreview in 1961.    1 must emphasise, however, that from the Scottish pointof view the whole value of the statement would be lost were paragraph 4to be prefaced in the way the Minister suggests.    The whole weight of responsible agricultural opinion in Scotland would be against us if wesought to qualify the promise of a review with the proviso that whatever it disclosed any further assistance of the nature of M.A.P. grants wasruled out.    It may well be that when the time comes we can avoid anyrenewal of the scheme, but to say this in advance of the review would be,in my view, illogical.    It would also, 1 fear, be disastrous since itmight well throw doubt on the good faith of the proposal.7.     1 accordingly invite my colleagues to agree that I should make astatement in the House along the lines of the attached draft.J.S.M.Scottish Office, S. W. 1.3rd July, 1959.-2-
annex proposed PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENTMARGINAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION scheme in scotland the Secretary of State announced in Parliament on 18th Marchthat the Scottish N..T.U. wished to make further representations about thefuture of the M.A.F. Scheme in Scotland.    Talks between the Departmentof Agriculture and the N.F.U. on the subject have now been completed, andthe Government have reviewed the situation in the light of these talks andof the objectives of agricultural policy set out in recent White Papers onthe annual review.Z. The Government now propose to make a further scheme underSection 75 of the Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, to cover the three croppingseasons 1960, 1961 and 1962.    Assistance under this scheme will take theform of grants designed to encourage the production of feed for livestock.The needs of the farms that have been receiving MA.P. assistance will bekept under review to see how far, in the light of the other forms ofassistance made available since the inception of the MA-.P. Scheme, thenumber of farms that continue to receive such assistance can be progressivelreduced.3. The Agricultural Executive Committees will continue to have discretion to adjudge the degree of marginality of a holding.    They willalso take into account the benefits derived from other forms of assistance(such as improvement grants under the Kill Farming and Livestock RearingActs) and the economics of the enterprise as a whole, including the suitability of the type of farming practised.4. Before the expiry of this scheme a special review will becarried out by the Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees of those farms still receiving assistance.    The position ofthese holdings will then be discussed with the N.F.U. of Scotland in thelight of the review and of other forms of assistance then available.July, 1959.-3-SECRET
