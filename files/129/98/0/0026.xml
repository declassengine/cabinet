Document is the property of her britannic majesty*s government)c(59) 126 copy no.,&amp;20th July, 1959 .cabinetOPTICIANS&apos; FEESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of HealthWe feel that we should refer to the Cabinet the question of the paymentof opticians for hybrid dispensing, i. e. , National Health Service (N.H.S.)lenses in private frames.2.       There are two sorts of optician:-(i)  Ophthalmic opticians (numbering about 6,400) whoexamine sight, prescribe appropriate lenses where necessary and dispense the prescribed lenses inframes.(ii)  Dispensing opticians (numbering about 600) whodispense lenses on prescriptions given byopthalmic medical practitioners or ophthalmicopticians and supply frames.3.       Opticians are paid by way of fees for items of work.    These feesare intended to give them proper remuneration for their personal services,to cover their expenses and to provide a reasonable return on capital.    Atpresent the same dispensing fee is paid where N. H. S. lenses are dispensedin private frames as when they are dispensed in N.H.S. frames.    The amountof the fees has been the subject of joint enquiries by both sides of the whitley Council into expenses and remuneration actually earned, following a claim by the opticians in 1952;  and after long negotiation the position is asfollows:-(a) The average sight-testing fee was increased from14s. 2d. , at which it had stood since May, 1949,to 16s. 3d. with effect from 1st December, 1958.This was estimated to produce an extra  420,000per annum for ophthalmic opticians.(b) The average dispensing fee was left unchanged at26s. 6d. , at which it also had stood from may, 1949.-1-SECRET
(c)  We have reserved our right, as part of the packagedeal involving (a) and (b), to reduce the dispensingfee by 20 per cent where N. H. S. lenses aredispensed in private frames.    If this action were taken it would reduce the opticians&apos; receipts fromthe Exchequer by about  250,000 per annum, whichwould fall partly on dispensing opticians and partly on ophthalmic opticians.    The opticians are opposedto such a reduction being made when the generaldispensing fee, which they consider should havebeen increased, has been left unchanged, and thequestion arises whether the reduction should now be imposed by administrative action.4.        The arguments for imposing the cut are:-(a) It is the third element in a &quot;package deal&quot;.    The twoelements favourable to the opticians have been implemented.    The third element, which is theonly one which does not benefit the opticians butbenefits the Exchequer, should also be implemented.(b) On general grounds, it is reasonable to pay at a lower rate for hybrid dispensing because the optician makes a profit on the private frames.5.        The arguments against are:-(a) The dispensing opticians in fact voted against the package deal, but were out-voted by the ophthalmicopticians.(b) If the cut is imposed, the package deal will representa net loss to the dispensing opticians, who do not benefit - as do the ophthalmic opticians - by themodest increase in prescribing rates.(c) The dispensing opticians will feel a keen sense of grievance, which will find expression in a campaign of criticism of the Governments action.    This isparticularly inconvenient at a time when Govern-ment supporters are very sensitive to exposure tosuch criticisms.6. We ask the Cabinet to decide the appropriate course, having regardto all these considerations.J.S.M.D.W. -S.20th July, 1959.
