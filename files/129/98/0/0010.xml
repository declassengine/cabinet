secret this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1959C. (59) 110 Copy No. ^  3rd July, 1959CABINETREPLACEMENT OF THE &quot; QUEENS &quot;Memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation the problem in C. (59) 51 the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I reported on the position about the replacement of the &quot; Queens.&quot; It seemed to us that the abandonment oftheir weekly North Atlantic service by the Cunard Steamship Company would bea major blow to our reputation as a shipping nation. I remain very strongly ofthis view. We made it plain that we saw great difficulty in justifying the Cunardproposals on sound economic grounds.2. On 17th March the Cabinet instructed me to inform the Cunard Companythat, with the object of seeing whether a satisfactory scheme could be worked out, they might approach John Brown and Company for&quot; the purpose of drawing up detailed plans and estimates (C.C. (59) 17th Conclusions, Minute 6).3. I therefore authorised the Chairman of the Cunard Company to enter into discussions with John Brown and Company. I also made a statement inParliament to the effect that I had authorised such discussions to take place.I was careful at the time and subsequently to make it quite clear that pending theresults of these discussions and of further consideration by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, no commitment of any kind had been entered into. In addition, put four questions to the Chairman of the Cunard Company on which I invitedhis considered views.  These questions and his answers are at Annex A4. The Cunard reply does not, in my view, measure up to the complexity ofthe problem at all. Nor has the Chairman&apos;s attitude been helpful, for his reiteratedclaims that Cunard deserve special treatment from Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave caused considerable irritation amongst other shipowners.Summary of Cunard proposals.   (a) finance the proposals of the Cunard Company remain broadly as summarised in paragraph 2 of C. (59) 51, i.e., the first ship will cost about  30 millions of which some  12 millions is as much as the cunard company can produce from their own resources. This would leaveHer Majesty&apos;s Government to find some  18 millions. The operatingfigures produced by the Cunard Company show that the annual surplusafter depreciation on the basis of a capital cost of  12 millions, i.e., the cunard share, is unlikely to exceed  1  millions a year. Since thegreater part of this would be required to service the money put up bythe Cunard Company, the chances of the Government contributionbeing adequately serviced and eventually repaid are extremely remote.In these circumstances it would be difficult to rebuff allegations thatwe were, in effect, subsidising the Cunard Company.55448
In the course of discussion between my officials and the accountantswho are acting for the Cunard Company, an alternative proposal hastentatively emerged though it has not as yet been put to the cunard company. This is that so far as the first ship is concerned the wholeof the cost should be borne by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and thatthe ship should be chartered to the Cunard Company for operation.On this basis after assuming a scrap value of  2 millions for the ship,and also assuming that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would forgo the equivalent of the sums the Cunard Company might be expected to earnby way of investment allowances if they financed the ship themselves(some  6 millions), there is a reasonable expectation that enough mightbe earned to service and pay off the loan with interest at a rate ofabout 3 per cent, per annum. On the other hand, if the  6 millionswere not taken into account in this way, earnings would be enough topay off the loan with interest at only 1-j- per cent, per annum. It wouldbe part of any such scheme that if operating profits were earnedgreater than those assumed in the calculations, a fair share of such additional operating profits would come to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.Moreover, this scheme would get over one of the disadvantages ofthe Cunard scheme, i.e., that the Company&apos;s shareholders would be doing better in so far as their share of the capital was concerned thanHer Majesty&apos;s Government. It is, however, by no means ideal inother respects.(b) General Policy ConsiderationSince I made my public announcement, I have had representations from members of the shipping industry. While they have not gone sofar at this stage as to suggest that they would be wholly opposed to any assistance to the Cunard Company, they have made it clear that any action Her Majesty&apos;s Government takes in this matter will haveextremely important repercussions for the shipping industry as a whole.As my colleagues well know, the shipping industry are becoming increasingly concerned about their prospects. Not only is trade badbut the increasing restrictions which are being placed on our shippingby countries such as India, to say nothing of the highly restrictive practices adopted by the United States, are making them increasinglygloomy about the future. At a&apos;time when Her Maiesty&apos;s Government,at their prompting, are making strenuous representations to foreigncountries about the evils of shipping subsidies, the industry fear thata subsidy to the Cunard Company to keep the North Atlantic servicegoing might have seriously adverse effects for British shipping worldwide.In fact the attitude of Cunard, who have made no attempt topresent this as other than a subsidy, plus their own difficulties are likelyto cause them to ask for similar assistance on other routes on thegrounds that assistance to Cunard is a direct subsidy. We could defendour position on the ground that there is indeed a special case but Ishould be happier about taking this action if I had greater faith in the ability and dexterity of the Cunard Board. In any case I recommendthat I sihould be authorised to discuss matters with the General Councilof British Shipping. I have reason to believe that they would supportthe decision that I recommend.The Shipbuilding Problem&apos;6. Lam personally convinced that we are within a few months.of very grave difficulties in the shipbuilding industry. In that case every M.P. with shipbuildinginterests will fight for this ship to be built in his constituency, however unrealisticthe claim may be.The Course I Recommend7. In all these circumstances while it may well still be that in the event weshall have to proceed on the basis of one or other of the financial schemessummarised under paragraph 5(a) above, improved from Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ point of view as far as is possible in the course of further negotiation,
I have reached the conclusion that my right course at this stage is to seek outsideadvice. When the Government was faced with a similar problem in 1932 outsideadvice was sought from Lord Weir. J doubt whether in present circumstances wecould find one man who could deal adequately with the problem now before us.I What I would propose, therefore, is to seek the advice of an outside committeeof three persons. This might consist of a distinguished retired shipowner, anaccountant of high repute and possibly a distinguished retired civil servant as a third member to ensure that due consideration was paid to the broad problemsof the national interest. I have reason to believe that a committee of this kind would go a long way to relieve the anxieties of the shipping industry. It would alsohelp with the presentation of the difficult subsidy point and the allocation of theship to John Brown and Company if that turns out to be inevitable. &apos;The committee could also provide the answer to those who will inevitably say that the design ofthe ship to replace the Queen Mary is not sufficiently advanced. Such a decision will probably be unpalatable in the extreme to the Cunard Company but theywould, I think, put themselves in an intolerable public position if they refused toco-operate.8. I seek the authority of my colleagues to enter into discussions with the cunard Company and the shipping industry on these lines and, unless I encounterserious difficulty with either party, to proceed accordingly.a. w.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1,2nd July, 1959.ANNEX AQuestions put to the Chairman of the Cunard Steamship Company and a Summaryof his RepliesQuestion 1&quot; What in broad terms will be the size, tonnage, speed, draught and carrying capacity of the replacement ship for the Queen Mary, and what are the determiningconsiderations in these various respects?&quot;answer the replacement ship would be a little smaller (80,000 tons against81,237 tons); a little faster (30 knots against 28^ knots); have amuch smaller draught(30 ft. against 39 ft. 4 ins.); and carry a few more passengers (2,100 against 1,940).The determining considerations are based on speed. Cunard say that 281 knotsis the minimum speed for a regular two-ship service across the North Atlantic andthat a small margin is needed to cope with the vagaries of North Atlantic weather.This speed calls for a length of ship of about 1,000 ft. to cope with wave and weather conditions and within this size limit passenger carrying capacity will be maximised,bearing in mind that:  (a) Passengers must be given as much space as possible.(b) Overall dimensions must not be increased beyond the point whereunacceptable limitations in freedom of operation at the terminal ports are encountered.(c) The ship must have a beam designed to secure minimum resistance and adequate stability.The smaller draught is due to the use of light alloys and improved methods of construction.Question 2&quot; What will be the approximate cost of such a vessel?&quot;Answer 29 millions on present-day costs. The ship would be designed to be more attractive than any other on the North Atlantic but the United States would still have a greater reserve of speed, which is not needed for commercial purposes.
Question 3&quot; What special features will be incorporated in the ship to increase flexibility of operation and to maximise its competitive power in an age of supersonic air travel?&quot;answer the ship must be built for one purpose in order to achieve maximum efficiency. Passenger accommodation will be designed to be interchangeablebetween classes to the greatest possible extent, and the higher speed and smallerdraught will enable the ship to maintain an absolutely regular service. Cunardconsider that the competitive power of the ship will lie in the fact thatholidaymakers, who constitute 70 per cent, of the passengers carried, will still preferfive days of pleasure, with free board and lodgings, to tjhe discomfort of air travel.Business men will tend to travel at least one way by sea because of healthconsiderations and of the opportunity for getting essential work done. Air and seatravel on the North Atlantic should therefore be complementary. Cunard saythat they have carefully considered nuclear propulsion but that, at present, thereis no practical alternative to the turbine.Question 4&quot; Can as detailed a justification as possible be given of the estimates of revenuealready provided, taking into account the nature and scale of air competition thatis likely to develop over the next twenty-five years, including the possibility of airtransits being reduced to two or three hours in each direction ?&quot;Answer(a) Sea traffic has continually increased since 1950, except in 1958. In 1958the reduction in sea traffic was all in the Tourist Class and average carryings persailing were the same. The fall in 1958 was due to the recession and to unemployment in Canada.(b) The progress in sea traffic has been slow but steady and well proven.(c) The cheapest sea fare is still lower than the cheapest air fare and is likelyto remain so. Any rise in sea fares will be slower than the rise in air fares becauseof the longer life of ships and because of the heavy increase in air terminal, ascompared with sea terminal, costs.id) In the past air travel has mostly bred its own traffic, e.g., those with only three weeks&apos; holiday. The increase in air traffic in 1958 was due to the introductionof the Economy Class, but the load factor per flight fell. In the future it is unlikelythat the large expansion of aircraft carrying capacity will be accompanied by acommensurate increase in passengers, and airlines will find it increasingly difficultto break even financially.(e) &quot; Human feelings &quot; must be taken into account, and special attention mustbe paid to the feminine point of view. The only advantage of the air is speed andthis will pall.(/) Cunard firmly believe that over the next twenty-five years or more seatraffic will continue at about the same level as heretofore.0
