S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 118 COPY NO.10th July, 1959CABINETFUTURE STATUS OF THE POST office memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Lord Privy SealThis memorandum contains the views of the Committee on nationalised Industries on the proposals for the future status of thePost Office (C.(59) 67).   We were asked to consider them in the light ofour examination of the report by the Nationalised Industries (Official)Committee, our views on which are contained in a separate memorandum(C.(59) 117).2.     The proposals form a logical sequence to the grant to the PostOffice, in 1955, of a measure of self-contained finance.   The anomaliesand inefficiency in the existing accounting system and in the existingprocedures for Parliamentary and Treasury control would be removed.They could also be regarded as an indication of the vitality of Governmentthinking in the field of nationalised enterprise.3.     We recognise that the proposals may attract some criticism onthe grounds either that they go too far, e. g. by departing radically fromthe traditional forms of Parliamentary and Treasury control, or not far enough, e. g. by adhering to the Departmental type of organisation, with a minister at its head, staffed by civil servants.4.     But there are reasonably convincing answers to such criticism:-(a) Parliamentary control will still be effective - perhaps even more effective than now - as a result of the safeguards describee in paragraph 11of C.(59) 67.   We are agreed that these should be reinforced by theprovision that the Postmaster-General&apos;s power to draw on the statutoryTrading Fund should lapse unless annually renewed by affirmative resolution.(b) Treasury control will only be given up in the areas where it is relatively meaningless:  it will be preserved over important matters of pay, grading, conditions of service, investment and foreign exchange.(c) In its very nature, the Post Office is, and always has been, a hybridorganisation.   This was recognised in the 1955 reforms.   To transform it into a public corporation would be unacceptable both to the communitygenerally, who expect that in this country, as in most others, the mails willbe carried by State servants under the direct control of the Government,and also to the Post Office staff, who would be strongly opposed to anychange in their status.-1-SECRET
5.     On balance, therefore, we support the proposals for the Post Office.But the presentation and timing of the proposals would need careful handling.6.     Those who advocate a closer Ministerial and Parliamentary controlover the nationalised sector may tend to hold up the Departmental styleorganisation of the  ost Office, as it will remain after these proposals have been implemented, as an appropriate pattern for the other nationalised industries.   It is important, therefore, to prevent the possibility of pressure developing along these lines, since it might seriously prejudice the attempt to put the other nationalised bodies on a sound footing.   Weare satisfied that it is possible, on grounds of tradition and function, todraw a clear distinction between the Post Office and the rest of the nationalised sector;  and we fully endorse the reasoning which led the nationalised Industries (Official) Committee to reject the Departmentaltype of structure for the other nationalised industries.7.     Therefore, in presenting the Post Office proposals to publicopinion, stress should be laid on the unique character of the Post Officeand on the practical effects of this as an extension of the 1955 reforms,rather than on any novelty in the concept of the Post Office as a tradingconcern.   We also recommend, for this and other reasons, that theproposals to make all tariff changes (and not just some as at present)subject to Parliamentary authorisation should be discarded, since it mightbe quoted as a precedent by those who wish to see parliament exercise a closer control over the prices of all nationalised bodies.8.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Postmaster-General have undertaken to settle,in consultation together, the basis of the calculation of the Post Office&apos;s contribution to the Exchequer and of its charges toother Departments for agency services.   We feel that the exchequer contribution might be related, in some degree, to the capital employed bythe Post Office.9.     Even if we do all we can to distinguish the Fost Office from the nationalised industries a public announcement of these proposals in detailmight well stimulate enquiries about the Governments intentions regardingthe rest of the nationalised sector. To publish a White Paper before aGeneral Election could therefore arouse political controversy aboutnationalisation.   We feel that this should, if possible, be avoided.   On theother hand, we suggest that a general reference should be made to theplan in the Governments Election literature, since it would have somepopular appeal.   Any informed comment which was evoked could be takeninto account in preparing a White Paper for publication at a suitable time,probably fairly early in the life of a new Parliament.   The necessary legislation should then be drafted, modified as necessary in the light ofpublic and Parliamentary criticism of the White Paper.   It must be clearly understood that the legislation would involve radical reforms, particularlyin the repeal of the requirement which has held good since the end of the18th century that all Government receipts must be paid into the consolidated Fund.   The drafting will therefore require considerable care,and the Bill would be unlikely to be ready for introduction before thesecond session of a new Parliament.   (The 1955 arrangments expire in1961.)
10.     In sum, we recommend that:-(a) Our colleagues should approve in principle the broad plan setout in C.(59) 67, subject to -(i)   the inclusion of the provision under which the Postmaster-Generals power to draw on the statutory Trading fund would lapse unless annually renewed by affirmative resolution;(ii)   the omission of the requirement that all proposed tariffchanges should be made subject to Parliamentaryauthorisation;(iii)   the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Postmaster-Generalsettling between themselves the precise basis of the calculation of the Exchequer contribution and of the PostOffice charges for agency services.(b) A carefully worded reference to the plan should be includedin our Election literature.(c) The Postmaster-General, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, should draw up a draft White Paper for publication at a suitable time after an Election.   This documentshould emphasise the distinctive character of the Post Officeand should stress the practical benefits likely to accrue fromthis extension of the 1955 reforms.(d) The necessary legislation, which will be novel and probablycontroversial in character, should be provisionally scheduledfor enactment in the second session of a new Parliament.R.A.B.Home Office, S.W.1.10th July, 1959
