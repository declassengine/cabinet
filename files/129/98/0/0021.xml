(59) 12115th July, 1959CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1959-60 session memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy SealThis year the construction of a programme of legislation for the next Sessionof Parliament is a rather difficult operation. It is clear that we must be ready, but less clear what we must be ready for. In approaching the problem the future legislation Committee have therefore felt that they had no alternative but to makea number of assumptions.  These are (a) that the Session will be one of normal length and(b) that the quantity of legislation planned and prepared at this stage shouldbe such as would occupy Parliament throughout a normal Session. Atthe same time, the Committee have felt(c) that it would be preferable to adopt a relatively unexacting programme,avoiding issues of exceptional difficulty or controversy but, nevertheless,including a limited number of important Bills of public appeal and interest.2. With these assumptions in mind, the Committee have, in accordance withthe normal procedure, considered all the Bills put forward by Departments andclassified them provisionally into A.l.  Bills known to be essential.A.2.  Contingent Bills, which may become essential in certain circumstances.B.l.  Main programme Bills.B.2.  Other programme Bills.C. Desirable Bills, from which some might be selected if time permits.D. Other Bills.But I must add that on this occasion it has not been possible to give departmental ministers the opportunity to comment on the classification and to argue for the promotion of their own Bills from lower to higher categories.3. The Cabinet will perhaps prefer at this stage not to be asked to reachanything like a final decision on the content of a legislative programme, still lessI of a Queen&apos;s Speech. But if we are to legislate at all, a great deal of preliminary work on drafting (in addition to the work that is already in hand) needs to be done.The Committee&apos;s proposals therefore amount to their assessment of the Bills towhich priority in drafting should be accorded; and it is to this assessment that we seek the approval of the Cabinet.55492
2 TOP secret. The Bills in lists A.1 and A.2, which are or may become unavoidable,call for little comment. Drafting will proceed as and when the necessary policy decisions can be taken and at least some of them will be ready by the beginningof the Session.5. If the Bills in lists B.1 and B.2 were ultimately adopted, they would, theCommittee suggest, provide a reasonably attractive and coherent programme withan emphasis on reform (Betting and Gaming, Criminal Justice, and Charities) and.a businesslike approach to certain economic problems (Distribution of Industryand Horticulture). There is no hope that all of them can be ready for introductionwhen Parliament reassembles, but steps have already been taken to expeditenearly all in B.1 and some in B.2. Our aim should be to make as rapid progressas we can with all which the Cabinet decide should remain in these two lists.6. At this stage there is little we can do with the Bills in list C, unless theCabinet wish to promote any of them to B. Some progress has been made towardsthe preparation of a few of them and this process might continue to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to those in the higher categories.R. A.
