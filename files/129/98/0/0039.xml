THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1959C. (59) 139 Copy No. 3 227th July, 1959CABINETGERMAN ASSETS IN THE UNITED kingdom note by the Minister of State for Foreign affairs at his meeting with the Prime Minister on 9th October last year the federal german Chancellor, Dr. Adenauer, raised the question of the return (mainly forpsychological reasons) of those German assets in the United Kingdom confiscatedunder war-time legislation and not yet disposed of. The Prime Minister said thatthis was a complicated legal question but that he would have it looked into.2.  The main issues are:  (a) Which assets, if any, should be returned to German ownership and when?(b) What should be done with any residue retained in the United Kingdom?Background3. The Distribution of Enemy Property Act, 1949, required the proceeds ofGerman assets to be distributed as a dividend to certain classes of United Kingdomcreditors of Germany, unless it was not practicable to do so. By 1957, 2s. lOJd.in the pound had been so distributed. It then appeared that the residue of german assets known or likely to be available (about  250,000) would only be sufficient to yield a dividend of something under id. in the pound, and that this was not worthdistributing. As a result, the Distribution of German Enemy Property (No. 3)Order was issued in August, 1957, under which  250,000 was assigned to the NaziVictims Relief Trust, any further residue (which was expected to be small) beingpayable to the Exchequer. But recently a much larger sum of German assets than was estimated has in fact fallen in, and the present estimate might be as high as 1,000,000 to  1,250,000 in one year&apos;s time. This, of course, excludes the  250,000already paid to the Nazi Victims Relief Trust. The figure of  1,000,000 to 3,250,000 would be made up as follows:  (a) Liquidated assets now in the hands of the Administrator of German enemy property or assets shortly becoming available for his use about 900,000.(b) Assets frozen pending settlement of legal issues or for similar reasons, partof which, estimated at  300,000, may become available to the administrator over the next twelve months.(c) Unliquidated assets consisting of known interests acquired from deceasedpersons. An estimate of this sum would be  40.000.4.  In addition to known interests acquired from deceased persons there wille others, of which we do not know at the moment, falling in over the years. Bydefinition the amount of these can only be guessed, but it is not thought likely thatit wiil exceed  100,000.   These interests are referred to hereafter as &quot; futureinterests.&quot;55561b
5. The estimated residue of  1,000,000 to  1,250,000 would represent adividend of some 2^d. in the pound, but since, under the Distribution of GermanEnemy Property (No. 3) Order referred to above the Administrator^ existingliability is to pay any residue he may have to the Exchequer, an Order in Councilsubject to Negative Resolution would be necessary to revive his previous dutyunder the Act itself to make another Distribution. I do not recommend this course at this stage. As explained more fully in Part II of this Paper, I consider that therignti course is to suspend for twelve months a decision on the disposal of theestimated residue referred to above. By that time it should be possible to ascertainmore precisely the total available. If this is agreed, it follows that none of this money can be returned to the Germans now. Nor do I expect to recommend intwelve months&apos; time that any liquidated assets should be returned to Germans as there are serious objections (see paragraph 9, below) to such a course.Part IRETURN OF ASSETS TO GERMAN OWNERSHIP6. There remains the question whether &quot; future interests &quot; can be returnedto the Germans, who have indicated that it is this in which they are chieflyinterested. As explained in paragraph 4 above, a guess at these &quot; future interests&quot;is  100,000.Relevant Factors7. (a) Under the 1946 Paris Agreement on Reparations from Germany,German assets in the United Kingdom counted against the United Kingdomentitlement to reparations and the United Kingdom undertook to dispose of the assets &quot; in a manner designed to preclude their return to German ownership or control.&quot; The accounting rules of the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency (I.A.R.A.),which was established under the Agreement permitted exceptions in the case of :-(i) Individuals of German nationality who left Germany and proved that theyhad not been hostile to the Allied cause (in particular victims of Nazi. persecution).(ii) Assets which would provide little or no net value because of the costsinvolved in seizure, administration or sale.(b) The Advisory Committee on the Distribution of German Enemy property which was set up by the then President of the Board of Trade recommended in itsReport in 1951 that moneys due to Germans from United Kingdom insurance companies should be returned to them as part of a comprehensive and mutualsettlement of insurance matters. This recommendation was made because of theimportance of maintaining confidence in the British insurance service and was accepted on that basis. An Anglo-German Agreement regulating mutual insurancedebts will shortly be signed, but insurance moneys due to Germans under LifePolicies or Annuities are already being returned.(c) Under the Bonn Settlement Convention, 1954, the Federal GermanGovernment are responsible for compensating the dispossessed German owners and have been provided to this end with full particulars of the assets disposed of,but they have so far compensated very few owners.(d) The return of &quot; future interests&quot; in one operation would require legislation. It could be done by administrative means, but only on a case-to-casebasis. The Board of Trade greatly prefer the former method since the latter wouldinvolve keeping the Administrator of German Enemy Property in being indefinitely.(Arguments in Favour of Meeting the German Request8. (a) The Germans attach importance to the matter mainly forpsychological reasons. To meet their request would be a contribution to Anglo-German good will.
(b) The further away we get from the war the less acceptable does it becometo deprive individual Germans of such interests as bequests under old Wills, interestscontingent upon another life and so on, for the benefit (now) of the Exchequer.(c) The estimated sum involved of not more than  100,000 is small, and in anycase Will fall in over an unknown period of years.Arguments Against - &amp;uli j9. (a) Possible breach of the Paris Agreement of 1946 which states that1 suchassets should not be returned to German ownership. To return liquidated assetsnow held by the Administrator would be very difficult to defend under theAgreement. As regards &quot; future interests,&quot; however, it can fairly be argued thatliteral compliance with the Paris Agreement would be very difficult, since for every country there must come a time when the amount of property to be liquidated is so small that it is not worth the administrative cost of doing so, particularly sinceinterests still unknown to us may not fall in for 20 years or more. Every country will in time have to fix a cut-off date of some kind, and we could justifiably saythat for us that date had now arrived. I consider that this argument would providea satisfactory defence against any accusation of breaching the Paris Agreement byreturn of &quot; future interests.&quot; In addition the I.A.R.A. accounting rules mightmight provide a defence (paragraph 7 (a) (ii) above).(b) We joined with the Dutch last year in protesting against an Americanscheme for the return of the proceeds of some German assets in the United States,which has so far come to nothing. The Americans would not object but the Dutchmight, so possibly might some other I.A.R.A. countries. (The Australians haverecently been asked by the Germans to release German assets in Australia and havetold us that they are awaiting our decision before sending a reply). It would benecessary to inform at least the United States, the Dutch and the Australians.(c) The German Government have a treaty obligation to compensate individualGermans who were deprived of our assets by our legislation. There is no reason why we should relieve the German Government of this obligation.(d) Criticism of the United Kingdom on the grounds that Germany had notfulfilled her obligations to compensate allied and stateless victims of the Nazis.Discussion10. The most serious difficulty is the possible public reaction here(paragraph 9 (d) above). There are a number of groups in this country looking forany sticks with which to beat the Germans. There are, furthermore, groups(notably the Ryder-Cheshire Foundation) campaigning against the federal republic for its failure to compensate certain classes of Nazi victims. All these groups, which have support in Parliament, would protest very strongly at the return of any German assets while the German compensation to Nazi victims remainsincomplete. I cannot foresee any circumstances which would warrant the return ofliquidated assets to Germans. Nor would the return of &quot; future interests &quot; bepossible without some mitigating factor; but I consider that they could be returnedprovided:  (a) Their release could be linked in some way with an improvement in Germancompensation for Nazi victims who are stateless or of british nationality. We are negotiating with the Germans about this and possible release of &quot; future interests &quot; could be used as a bargaining counter.(b) That some part of the liquidated assets were devoted by us to Nazi victimsgenerally, e.g., to the Nazi Victims Relief Trust, and that this were announced simultaneously with the announcement of return of the&quot; future interests &quot; to Germany.11. Condition (a) may be met in the course of the negotiations referred to.Condition (b) cannot be met now, since it is not possible, without amending theexisting legislation, to earmark a portion of the estimated residue for the NaziVictims Relief Trust. The Cabinet will not want to take a decision now on whatthey may do in this respect in 12 months&apos; time. I do not, therefore, consider thatwe should give a firm commitment at this stage to return &quot; future interests &quot; to theGermans. When this matter comes up for consideration in 12 months&apos; time, and provided that the compensation negotiations have gone well, it should be possibleto provide that some part of the residue should be allocated to the Nazi VictimsRelief Trust.55561
Conclusion to Part I12. I invite the Cabinet to agree that the Federal German Government beinformed:  (a) That we cannot agree to return any cash assets.(b) That we may be able to return the &quot; future interests &quot; provided that thereis an acceptable outcome to the compensation negotiations referredto in paragraph 10 (a), but that we cannot give a definite undertaking3.il *       now. We might be able to do so in a year&apos;s time.(c) That the Australian Government be informed of the foregoing.Part IIDISPOSAL OF THE ADMINISTRATORS RESIDUE13. The residue, or any part of it, might possibly be used in one or more ofthe following ways:  (a) Distribution of a further dividend to British creditors of Germany.(b) For payments to British creditors who were out of time under the GermanAdministrator^ existing distributions.(c) Payment to the Exchequer.(d) A further payment to the Nazi Victims Relief Trust.(e) Compensation for losses incurred by other victims of Nazi Germany suchas persons of British nationality.14. As stated in paragraph 3 above, the No. 3 Order of 1957, which providesfor the residue to be paid to the Exchequer, was made on the basis that it was impracticable to make a further distribution of any residue likely to accrue afterthe Administrator^ third dividend. But the situation is quite different now thatwe know that the Administrator is likely to have a residue of the order of  1 million to  1^ millions. It would be practicable to distribute this sum which would providea dividend of about 2^d. in the pound. In these circumstances the two possible courses are either to make another Order to revive the Administrator^ statutoryliability to make a further Distribution to British creditors of Germany or to amend the provisions of both the No. 3 Order and the 1949 Act. Departments have been advised that a new Order could again provide that any surplus then impracticable to distribute and any further accruals within a year from that distribution up to 250,000 (representing a dividend of under ^d. which it can safely be said would be impracticable to distribute in isolation), should be allocated to a charity, or indeedto be used for any other purpose. If it were desired to pay to a charity any sumother than the surplus remaining after a distribution has been made, then new legislation would be necessary.A Further Distribution to British Creditors (paragraph 13 (a))15. In 1949, when the Distribution of German Enemy Property Act waspassed, it looked likely that German assets in this country would form the mainsource from which pre-war creditors could expect any payment. The presentposition however is that:  (a) Large creditors have in many cases had their 20s. in the pound already,since Article 9 of the No. 2 Order a creditor who could point to specificassets of his debtor in the Administrator^ hands could receive up to20s. in the pound if the assets allowed it.(b) All distributions paid by the Administrator were ex gratia and, so far asdomestic law is concerned, did not affect the debtor-creditorrelationship. The Creditor was still entitled to payment from hisGerman debtor in full. But it is known that many creditors in settlingwith their German debtors took into account what they had receivedfrom the Administrator.(c) The Agreement on German External Debts in 1953 again put a differentcomplexion on the matter. In particular, British bondholders have little to complain of in 1959.
16.   Nevertheless some of the creditors have received no more than 2s! lOjd.in the   and are unlikely to receive any payments, direct from their German debtors.They would complain very strongly if a residue as large as  1 million or more wereto be used for other purposes than a further dividend.  There are, however, seriousHadministrative difficulties in the way of any selective distribution to creditors.Payments to Out-of-time British Creditors (paragraph 13 (/;))17. There were also some creditors Who failed to submit their claims to the administrator in time to participate in the Distribution. They might,, however,expect consideration to be given to their claims when it is known that there is asubstantial residue available for disposal. If these late claimants were now admitted to the existing distributions, it appears unlikely that a further (fourth) distributioncould also be made to claimants who are already in time!Payment to the Exchequer (paragraph 13 (c))18. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is prepared to forgo any payment tothe Exchequer from the residue of the German Administrator provided that nocharge falls on public funds from the operations of the other Administrators of enemy Property. At one time it appeared that the Administrator of RoumanianProperty would be left with insufficient funds to repay the Board of Trade the sumsadvanced to him for operating expenses. At present it appears that no deficit will arise if he is successful in a case which has been taken against him in appeal to theHouse of Lords. This question is likely to be decided within a year. The otherAdministrators appear to have sufficient funds to meet all their expenses.A Further Payment to the Nazi Victims Relief Trust (paragraph 13 (d))19. Until the final dividends to British creditors under the variousDistributions of Enemy Property were declared in 1956 and 1957 the assets in theUnited Kingdom of victims of Nazi persecution of enemy nationality could be released to them ex gratia subject to certain conditions being fulfilled including that they had left the ex-enemy territory concerned. When the final dividendshad been declared such releases were no longer possible, and there has been anumber of victims who have subsequently left ex-enemy territory and then claimedtheir assets. The Prime Minister has directed that their cases should be considered.The victims concerned are in the main Roumanian nationals and as such theGerman Administrator has no powers to recompense them. The transfer to theRoumanian Administrator of part of the German residue for this purpose wouldrequire legislation. If a further sum could be paid to the Nazi Victims Relief Trustadditional relief to that already given to these admittedly hard cases could beprovided, but the adoption of such a course now would require legislation (as hasbeen mentioned in paragraph 14). Legislation for this purpose alone appearsundesirable in advance of the decisions on the disposal of the residue as a whole and of the winding up of the affairs of the German Administrator.Compensation to Other Victims of Nazi Persecution (paragraph .13 (e))20. If the German Government do not provide adequate compensation forthe British nationals whose interests will be the subject of the negotiations referredto in paragraph 10 (a), it would be possible to use some part of the residue of theGerman Administrator to supplement the compensation. Again legislation wouldbe necessary if this were to be done immediately. There are also a number ofcharities other than the Nazi Victims Relief Trust to which a sum out of that residuemight be allocated.Conclusion to Part II21. In about a year&apos;s time it should be possible to determine much moreexactly the amount (see paragraph 14) which will be available for disposal. Weshould know then whether it would be desirable to make provision for compensationfor British victims of Nazi persecution. We should also know the amount, if any,by which the Roumanian Administrator might be in deficit. At that stage it mightbe convenient to dispose of the residue of the assets.
22. Since postponement for a year of action to dispose of the residue of the assets would fit in well with the Foreign Office interest and would not appear toclash with the interests of other Departments concerned, I invite the Cabinet toagree that no action to dispose of the residue of the assets should be taken for ayear, and that the position should then be reviewed in the light of the circumstances^at that time. &quot;D. 0.-G.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd July, 1959.f
