C. (60) 165 Copy No.15th November, I960CABINET5?COLOURED IMMIGRATION FROM THE commonwealth memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department in my memorandum of 19th July (C. (60) 128) I drew attention to the problems which were likely to result from a continuance of the high rate of immigration fromother Commonwealth countries, and I said that if administrative measures failedto reduce the flow of immigrants it might be necessary for us to consider the case for some measure of statutory control. The Cabinet took note of the position on 26th July (C.C. (60) 46th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. Since then, there has been a remarkable increase in the rate at whichWest Indian immigrants are coming here. This is strikingly shown in the followingmonthly figures of net inward movement:January 1960	700February	.....       1,150March	.....       3,300April         .......	.....       4,600May..........	.....       4,950June ...	.....       4,700July.......	.....       4,950August	.....        5,800September   ...	.....       7,900Equally striking is the comparison of this year&apos;s figures with previous annual totals:1955 ...............      27,5501956 .........1957 ...      ......1958 .........1959 .........1960 (nine months only)29,80023,00015,00016,40038,1003. There is no immediate problem of unemployment: the latest Ministry ofLabour figures (early August) show only 5,500 West Indians unemployed, out ofa total West Indian population estimated at that time at 160,000. Nevertheless,West Indians constituted nearly two-thirds of the total register of colouredunemployed and, in contrast with the employment situation of other categories,the number of West Indians unemployed increased by 420 compared with May 1960(the figure of 9,000 unemployed quoted in C. (60) 128 should have referred to thetotal number of coloured unemployed at the time not to West Indians alone),and by 650 compared with August 1959. The Ministry of Labour believe that itwill become more and more difficult over the next few years to place unskilledimmigrants, and are seriously concerned about the position which would ariseshould there be only a slight fall in the general level of employment.4. This continuing and increasing influx naturally worsens the already seriousovercrowding in those areas where the immigrants congregate. There is no prospectof any early improvement in this situation.58053THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1960
5. The immigrants are attracted to this country by the prospects of full employment and high wages, and so long as economic conditions remain much asthey are now, there is no prospect of any voluntary limitation of their numbers.It looks as though the net intake for 1960 of West Indians alone will be of theorder of 50,000. The Government Actuary recently estimated that, on the basisof an annual intake of 40,000 coloured immigrants (with men and women in theproportion of 5 to 3 and on certain assumptions as to birth and death rates, thecoloured population could reach 880,000 in 1970 and 1,520,000 in 1980, representing1 - 6 and 2 - 7 per cent, respectively of the total population and a far higher percentagein those towns were they are concentrated. (The assumptions on which theGovernment Actuary&apos;s projection was based were necessarily arbitrary, and maywell be unreal; but his estimate may serve as a pointer.)6. We have so far rejected the idea of introducing legislation (includinglegislation on deportation) which would breach the traditional right of commonwealth citizens to come to, and remain in, this country. Such legislation would be controversial in itself and would remove one of the bonds which help to unite the Commonwealth, and might also seem to cast doubt on the idea of theCommonwealth as a multi-racial society. The restrictions would have to applyto the whole Commonwealth and to the Republic of Ireland, though it would be unnecessary to enforce them against most parts of it and impracticable to do soagainst the Irish.7. Instead, we have tried to encourage the Governments mainly concerned(those of the West Indies and, to a lesser degree, of India and Pakistan) to restrict anddiscourage emigration by administrative means. India and Pakistan have for sometime been co-operating with us by placing restrictions on the issue of passports to people wishing to come to the United Kingdom, and their measures have had theeffect of considerably reducing immigration from those countries. Nevertheless, both governments are under considerable pressure to relax their controls. TheGovernment of Pakistan have pointed out that their emigrants to the UnitedKingdom are being absorbed into employment here without difficulty. TheGovernment of India on the other hand have recently reaffirmed their intention oftightening up on the issue of passports to illiterate persons wishing to come to thiscountry; notwithstanding this, there was a sharp increase in Indian immigrantsduring September possibly due to a newly started exodus of Indians from theBritish East African colonies.8. As regard the West Indies, recent consultations with the unit Governmentsshow that they generally expect the present very high rate of emigration to the UnitedKingdom to continue and possibly even to increase. Their efforts to bring home tointending emigrants the housing and employment difficulties which they are likelyto find here are outweighed by information about conditions in the UnitedKingdom sent back by friends and relatives already here; and these favourableaccounts are frequently emphasised by the ability of West Indians here to sendmoney home to help pay for the cost of passages. It must be expected that, in theabsence of more positive measures to restrict the rate of emigration, the present rateis unlikely to fall materially unless and until conditions here worsen appreciably.There appears to be no prospect of the unit Governments being willing to place any effective restrictions on the issue of passports.9. The situation is clearly disquieting and is certain to attract increasingParliamentary attention. I propose, therefore, that the Cabinet Committee oncoloured immigration should be reconstituted: and that its terms of reference shouldbe &quot; To consider and keep under review the problems caused by the uncontrolledentry into the United Kingdom of British subjects from overseas &quot;.R.
