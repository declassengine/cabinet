Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1960C. (60) 179 Copy No.   562nd December, 1960CABINETTOURISMMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Prime Minister has asked me to circulate a paper setting out the presentobstacles to the expansion of our tourist earnings.2. Our earnings from overseas visitors have increased from  21 millions in1947 to  153 millions last year. This excludes earnings by British carriers which now amount to about  67 millions. Viewed in the light of our credit balance on current account, which last year was  139 millions, the importance of our touristearnings is readily apparent. In the field of visible exports, only chemicals( 293 millions), electrical machinery and appliances ( 232 millions), motor cars( 223 millions) and iron and steel ( 192 millions) contributed more to our earningsthan tourism.3. The tourist market is still expanding in the world generally and there is agood deal more money for us to earn if the necessary efforts are made to obtain it.Although the total number of nights spent in this country by overseas visitors is higher than in any other European country, and our tourist earnings are exceededonly by Italy, we cannot afford to be complacent. If Commonwealth visitors are excluded, the following broad picture emerges:Nights Spent by Visitors       Nights Spent byfrom O.E.E.C. Countries    United States VisitorsMillions MillionsAustria	22	0-75France       ......	22	6Italy         ......	20	3-45Switzerland	12-5	1-3United Kingdom ...	8	4(Source: O.E.E.C. &quot; Tourism in Europe &quot;.)No less than 7 countries of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.E.E.C.), including France, achieved a greater rate of increase than the UnitedKingdom in visitor traffic in 1959. The popularity of the United Kingdom as a resortarea for European tourists clearly leaves a lot of room for improvement. It is toEuropeans, in particular, that our immigration and customs formalities seemirksome and much more formidable than their own.4. Our instrument for the task of promoting travel to Britain and ensuring thatvisitors are well received and accommodated is the British Travel and HolidaysAssociation. Their &quot; Come to Britain &quot; campaign has been well received overseas and the Association is generally considered to be doing a good job. Since its maintask is to attract holidaymakers, it naturally exploits primarily the country&apos;s beautiesand antiquities, but it also addresses some of its publicity to the business visitor. Itoperates offices in nine countries (three in the United States and two in Canada) andhas representatives in several others. The Association has also still a big job to doin educating public opinion here on the importance of attracting tourists.58118
5. The continuing obstacles to the expansion of our tourist traffic, particularly with Europe, to which attention is constantly being drawn in the Press and elsewhereare:(i) our system of immigration control, particularly the segregation ofnon-British from British passport holders and the nature of the questionswhich the immigration officer is bound to put to the alien visitor tosatisfy himself that the alien is entitled to enter; .(ii) the need to obtain a carnet or tryptique before a tourist can bring his carinto the country without paying duty and purchase tax, deters manyEuropean tourists from even considering a visit to Britain;(hi) the serious shortage of hotel accommodation.  Some new building is nowin prospect but it remains to be seen if this will keep pace with theexpansion in tourist traffic;(iv) the poor facilities for the reception of visitors at many of our seaports.particularly Folkestone and Harwich;(v) the overcrowding of our resort areas because of the extreme peak in ourown holiday season.6. I do not wish to minimise the importance of maintaining properimmigration or customs arrangements, or the difficulty of finding the large sumsneeded to improve our ports. I should, however, like to draw attention to theprobable effect on our tourist earnings of these obstacles and suggest that a fresheffort should be made to overcome them. It is impossible to say how far ourimmigration formalities, which are probably the most severe in Europe, areresponsible for making the United Kingdom less attractive than other countries, orhow many people find it preferable to tour almost anywhere in Europe without acarnet rather than to go the trouble and expense of getting one to come to England,but certainly these obstacles have a bad effect on our competitive position. Theyhave often been criticised, as have our poor reception arrangements at seaports, andthey have also been accused of discouraging foreign businessmen from coming hereto buy goods. Though these factors cannot be quantified, they cannot be ignored.There is also the effect on our relations with overseas countries. Our Embassieshave frequently drawn attention to the unfortunate impressions left in Europe by our refusal to abandon the requirement for carnets which have been dispensed withby all other European countries except Spain, Portugal and Iceland. This is regardedas another example of our insular and unco-operative attitude.7. I should welcome any assistance that my colleagues can give me in reducingthese handicaps to the expansion of our earnings from tourism.R. M.Board of Trade, S.W.1,29th November, I960.
