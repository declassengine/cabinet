ANNEX AREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON LAND TENUREIN KENYAIntroductionIn their discussion of a memorandum by the Colonial Secretary(C. (60) 110) on future land policy in Kenya, the Cabinet decided on 14th July(C. C. (60) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 3) that a Committee of Ministers underthe Chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor should give further study to&apos; theproblem of the future security of title to land.    In a subsequent statement in the House of Commons the Colonial Secretary promised that as soon asdetailed proposals had been prepared further discussions would take place with the Governor and his Ministers with a view to a final statement beingmade.2.        The Cabinet were agreed that the four schemes for compensationor guarantees mentioned in paragraph 10 of C.(60) 110 appeared to be unacceptable since they would impose a financial burden which would be beyond the resources either of the farmers themselves or of the UnitedKingdom Exchequer.     We endorse this view and have therefore examinedother possible measures which might be taken.    These are:-(a) What legal and constitutional arrangements to safeguardproperty rights might be made upon independence?(b) What administrative and political steps might be taken,outside the legal framework, to re-assure investors and property holders?We also considered what statement could be made now.Constitutional and legal arrangements3.        After examination of several precedents it seems clear to us thatreasonably satisfactory and detailed provisions could theoretically beentrenched in the fundamental law of an independent Kenya so as to protectproperty.     These provisions might be based on an improved version ofthose in the independence constitution for Nigeria, which were one of themodels for the Code of Rights included in the new Kenya constitution madeat the end of November.4.        The new Kenya Code represents a reasonable balance between therights of the State and those of the individual.    Its provisions limit thepower of compulsory acquisition to certain public purposes, in circumstances in which the hardship caused to the right-holder can be reasonably justified;  they require the prompt payment of full compensationthey confer rights of access to the Supreme Court, with such rights ofappeal as are given in civil proceedings.    They do not however limit thecommonly accepted rights of the state to levy taxes, administer the estates of bankrupts, etc.    A special provision is included to guaranteeequality of economic opportunity and to prevent discriminatory taxation and discrimination in the use or enjoyment of a persons property,-1-SHCRET
5.        If safeguards of this kind are to work properly it is particularly important to ensure the independence of the Judiciary, and it is desirable ifpossible to allow for appeals to a final court outside the territory.    Thisshould be possible, since even if the Judicial Committee of the privy council is not acceptable for this purpose, and no progress is made withthe suggestion for a Commonwealth Court, it is probable that a Court ofAppeal will continue to function for the East African territories as a whole.6.        Eoth the provisions safeguarding basic rights and those guaranteeingthe independence of the courts should if possible be specially entrenchedin the constitution.     We reviewed various methods in which this might bedone within a unitary State.    Theoretically it would be possible to make these provisions unalterable, as was done in Cyprus (certain basic articlesof the constitution are declared to be unalterable, and are also guaranteed by treaty with the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey).    In practice this is unlikely to be politically possible, and we might have to fall back on thedevice of making amendment of the basic ipiro vi s ions as difficult and expensiveas we can.     For instance, it might be specified that there should be tworeferenda held at a prescribed interval (six months or a year), together withan absolute two-thirds majority in two successive Legislatures, with acertificate from the Council of State that the proposed amendments are notunfairly discriminatory.7.        Whatever the formal position, there is however always the chanceof some action in an independent Kenya which would be in breach of thespirit of the constitution and would simply ignore, suspend or abolish thesesafeguards.8.        One way in which the United Kingdom might be able to retain rights in international law if this happened would be to conclude an Agreement uponindependence under which Kenya undertook to observe the constitution, or at least its basic provisions in respect of British subjects and Kenya citizens.The Agreement might include provision for arbitration by an independent tribunal (for instance, a Commonwealth Court or special Commonwealthtribunal).    It could be given the status of fundamental law by theconstitution.    Treaties of Guarantee of this kind are not uncommon,(Cyprus is the most recent example),but have not so far been negotiated withany other Commonwealth country.9.        An Agreement of this sort would give farmers and investors somefeeling that Her Majesty&apos;s Government still retained some interest in theirwell-being and fair treatment, and should help to reassure them.    On theother hand, as guardian of some parts of the constitution,, Britain might be exposed to special moral pressure to give ex gratia help to the victims if their rights were in fact infringed, although perhaps no more than would arise aven if there were no agreement.10.        We emphasise that, although a detailed constitution and an agree-ment of this kind are technically possible, it will   be for political decision at the time when independence is being negotiated how far Kenya can andshould be pressed to accept them.     There are other special problems(notably the problem of the Coast Protectorate) which may require to bedealt with at independence by concluding a special agreement.    An
An agreement to safeguard fundamental rights may therefore be easier tonegotiate, as one among several.    On the other hand, some commonwealth countries might be reluctant to recognise Kenya as an independent memberif they thought these agreements derogated too far from her sovereignty.Administrative and political measures11.        These fall into two classes:   sanctions against a breach of propertyrights, and positive measures to encourage African leaders to a sense ofresponsibility about land.12.       Although in theory both physical intervention and the freezing of kenya&apos;s assets in London might be possible, we cannot conceivecircumstances in which the former would be defensible politically, whilethe latter would injure us and non-Africans in Kenya more than it wouldhurt an irresponsible Kenya Government.    Any decision to freeze sterlingassets, whoever owned them, would seriously impair the confidence ofholders of sterling throughout the world;  in any case, Kenya has virtually no disposable assets in London that could be frozen, and is most unlikely to have accumulated any by the time of independence.    Nor could we fullyrely on the refusal or withdrawal of financial and technical help, since bothmight be replaced from other sources, which might well cause us political embarrassment.13. The Tanganyika leaders have given explicit pledges to all holders of land during recent months and it may be possible to hold them up to KenyaAfrican leaders as an example.    It has now been agreed to hold aconference in March, 1961; to discuss the problems involved in the final stages of Tanganyika1 s advance.    At that conference the protection of human rights will be discussed;   and if we could reach agreement to entrench these rights in a detailed form in the independence constitution, this would againhelp in due course when negotiating independence for Kenya.14.       Meanwhile the International Bank&apos;s mission, investigating Kenya1 application for  5 millions to help in land resettlement, visited Kenya inOctober.    Before they left, the Economic Minister in Washington stressedto them the importance of their discussing the prospects of stability on landwith political leaders in Kenya;  they did so, with reasonably encouragingresults, and it now looks as though the Bank may participate in the schemeto at least the extent of  2 millions.15.       We should also encourage any demand which may naturally arinein East Africa for an economic development or investment conference,attended by officials of international agencies and private interests as wellas political leaders, whose aim would be to find ways of stimulatinginvestment.    This might arise either from the economic difficulties of thearea, or from the publication of the Raisman Report on inter-territorialeconomic and financial relations (expected this month), or as a result ofgood publicity for the proposed Nigerian development conference inJanuary.    Such a conference would be unlikely to take place for about ayear.16.       We are agreed that it is very important to continue attempts to influence African leaders to make reassuring statements in Kenya.    some progress in this has been made by the Colonial Secretary, by the Kenya-3-
Government and by private interests both with the elected African ministers and with Mr. Gichuru, President of the Kenya African National Union(K. A. N. U.), and Mr. Mboya, its General Secretary.    But their K. A. N. U.colleagues include a strong wing of irresponsible people and one or two,like Mr. Odinga the Vice-President, who are influenced by their contacts with Communist bloc countries.    On present form it is probable thatK. A. N. U. will secure a majority at the election.    The Party policy whichthey have apparently at last adopted does not go so far as it might have donetowards extremism, since it holds out some prospect of compensation for those affected by the promised land &quot;reforms&quot;, but its publication hasfurther depressed non-African farmers and investors who were hoping forexplicit and satisfactory pledges.    It is against this background that wehave to consider what more should be said now by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenand the Colonial Secretary has undertaken to make a statement in theHouse as soon as possible.Statement17.       Some weeks after the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement to parliament on 20th July, the Governor made a forthright speech emphasising that we intended to stand by the new constitution and to plan realistically for independence without giving way to demands for short cuts.     This speechhad temporarily a reassuring effect, though it also provoked strongcomments by the more extreme African leaders.    The speech has, however been overtaken by the development of the internal debate in K. A0 N. U. andthe publication of their policy, and some further statement of our attitude is now needed.18.       Unfortunately, there are still signs of a recession in confidence.As the Cabinet know (C. C. (60) 55th Conclusions, Minute 5) the Common-wealth Development Corporation are discussing a scheme of reorganisationwith the three building societies operating in Kenya under which the Commor.wealth Development Corporation will participate financially so as to support them in their current difficulties.    A number of important tea and planta-tion companies have asked the Colonial Secretary for a guarantee of theirinvestments, but were induced to drop this demand as unrealistic.    the k. A,N. U. policy statement has led to further alarm, and it seems unlikely that their tactics after the election, even if their leaders enter theGovernment, will quiet existing fears.    If the further statement which wehave promised is not reasonably forthright, this of itself will help finallyto destroy confidence.19.       The Governor and his advisers therefore believe, and we agreewith them, that the proposed statement should be as forthcoming as thesituation allows.    It should rest so far as possible upon the more moderateutterances of the African leaders and, by implication, reject the statements of their more extreme colleagues.    It should reaffirm the importance of security for land titles, stress the degree to which this will protectAfricans as well as non-Africans, and make it clear that the continuedprotection of property rights will inevtably be an essential part of anyfurther discussions on future constitutional advance.    A statement on theselines is attached and we suggest that it should be made by the colonial secretary in the House on 15th December.    The date is acceptable to theGovernor.
20.      We invite our colleagues -(a) To endorse this report.(b) To   authorise the Colonial Secretary to make thedraft statement attached.December, I960ANNEX BKENYA - SECURITY OF LAND TITLESQuestion and Draft AnswerCuestion by Major Patrick Wall for Oral Reply on 15th December -To ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he will makea statement about the security of land titles in Kenya.Draft AnswerAt the Lancaster House Conference there were proposals from allthe delegates for the enactment of a code to protect the fundamental rights ofthe individual, including his rights in property.     Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentthen undertook to provide for the judicial protection of human rights in thenew constitution.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have noted increasing recognition amongKenya political leaders of the need for measures and policies which will encourage the expansion of local and oversea investment.     We welcome thisrecognition because without security and confidence private investment inagriculture and industry will not take place, and it will also be extremelydifficult to proceed with resettlement schemes in any part of the territoryfor peasant and yeoman farmers.    Security of title to land is an essentialprerequisite to confidence and to renewed investment and the full use and settlement of the land;  this of course is a problem not confined to one raceonly, nor only to agricultural titles.    As a result of land consolidationunder the Swynnerton Plan there are already over 145,000 African farmerswith registered titles.     Outside the coast there are over 11,000 agriculturaltitles held mostly by non-Africans and over 17,000 residential, commercial and industrial titles spread among all races.    At the coast registered titlesexceed 16,000.    If confidence is to be won and maintained, all these mustbe fully secure. ^secret &quot;
Her Majesty&apos;s Government have now completed their examinationof methods of ensuring this security both up to and after independence.Detailed provisions designed for the protection of all rights, including rights in property, have now been included in the new constitution.    The resultsof this study will also be taken into account in any further discussions on further constitutional advance, since the continued protection of fundamentalrights, including rights in property, will inevitably be an essential part ofthose discussions.    Indeed, such protection for all individuals without regard to race, tribe or religion, follows naturally from the general acceptance of the right of all to stay and take part, without fear of discrimination or victimisation, in the public and economic life of thecountry.December, I960- o-
