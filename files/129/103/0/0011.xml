jj SECRET9THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1960C. (60) 161 Copy No. g g3rd November, I960CABINETLICENSING bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandThere is a point arising out of the discussion on 25th October about local pollson the opening or closing of licensed premises in Wales on Sundays to which Ithink I should draw my colleagues&apos; attention (C.C. (60) 55th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. At present in Scotland only hotels are open on Sunday and liquor can onlybe served to hotel residents and to bona fide travellers. Last year I appointed aCommittee under the Chairmanship of Lord Guest to consider inter alia thequestion of Sunday drinking generally. I recently received a unanimous reportfrom them, which is now being printed for publication, which recommends theintroduction of legislation providing for Sunday opening of both public houses and hotels on lines similar to the English Sunday permitted hours legislation. TheCommittee recommend that this legislation should be applicable throughoutScotland and there is no mention of polls for the exercise of a local option on thequestion.3. There is, of course, already provision for local polls about licensing inScotland. These do not relate to the question of Sunday drinking, but to the wholequestion of whether or not there should be facilities for the supply of liquor in the poll area. One-tenth of the electors in the area (the parish) can requisition for apoll on a &quot; no-licence &quot; resolution and, if the resolution is carried by the appropriatemajority, the Licensing Court is prevented from granting any licences in the area.4. If a provision for local polls for Sunday drinking in Wales is introduced intothe forthcoming Licensing Bill, then it seems almost inevitable that, when it comes to Scottish legislation on the recommendations of the Guest Committee, we shall be faced with demands for local polls on Sunday drinking in Scotland. (The positionwould not be on all fours with that in Wales where all licensed premises are at presentclosed on Sundays, but it seems probable that a demand for some form of localoption will arise.) Our present thinking in Scotland is that it would be wrong tohave local option on this question. There is a need for uniformity in the interestsof tourism, and local option would, in the areas which voted themselves dry, resultin persons going into other areas to drink the sort of &quot; travelling to drink &quot; which caused us to set up the Guest Committee. I therefore feel that any attemptto introduce local polls into the Scottish Bill implementing the Committee&apos;srecommendations ought to be resisted.5. I appreciate thoroughly the difficulties of the Minister for Welsh Affairs inregard to Sunday drinking in Wales and would not wish to oppose the possibility oflocal polls in Wales for the reasons given above. But I think I should draw mycolleagues&apos; attention to the fact that a solution based on local polls might result inthe Government having to resist a strong demand for the introduction of a similar provision in Scotland.J. S. M.Scottish Office, S.W. 1,2nd November, 1960.58005
