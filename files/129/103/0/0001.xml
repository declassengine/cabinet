Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1960C. (60) 151 Copy No.   5617th October, 1960CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CONTRIBUTIONMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his paper (C. (60) 148) proposes immediate legislation to increase by Is. the National Health Service contribution as fromthe beginning of April 1961. I offer for the consideration of my colleagues certainarguments which it seems to me bear on this proposal from the standpoint ofnational insurance. My specific points relate &apos;(i) to the timing, and (ii) to the-merits of this proposal, and I have sought to set these out in separate parts ofthis paper.2. I would, however, add first two general comments. As stressed in thepaper (C. (60) 150) by the Minister of Health, whatever the merits or demeritsof the Chancellors proposal, it is not one which will effect any reduction in public expenditure. It amounts simply to a proposal to impose a particular form ofhypothecated tax. It therefore requires to be looked at, not as a measure of economy, but of taxation. The question for decision is, it seems to me, whetherthe merits of this particular kind of taxation, as against other forms of taxation,are sufficient to outweigh its manifest disadvantages, plus the necessity for separate and contentious legislation.3. I would add that the proposal will not even give the appearance of economy in public expenditure. For the yield of the Health Service contribution is shown in the Estimates of the Ministry of Health as an appropriation in aid,and does not affect the gross cost of the Service shown in the Estimates.4. The other point is that so long as this contribution is collected along with the national insurance contribution, and as a result appears as part of thesame deduction from wages on the worker&apos;s pay packet, it is, and will continueto be, regarded as a single contribution.Timing5. From the general political angle it would be difficult to find a worse timefor such a change than next April. For it is at that date that the new graduated contributions imposed by the National Insurance Act, 1959, will first become payable and heavy increases in contributions will be required from many workers.Mr. Crossman, M.P., has already given notice at the Labour Party conference that the Labour Party intend to try to rouse opinion on this question at the time.6. The Cabinet will appreciate the importance of this when they note thatthe result of the coming into operation of the 1959 Act will be to increase theamount of contribution paid by employers, workers, &amp;c. (i.e., excluding theExchequer contribution) in 1961-62 by nearly  120 millions over the amount paidby these contributors during the current financial year. As the amount of graduated pension to be paid during 1961-62 will be negligible, virtually the wholeof this additional contribution will be raised in order to meet the deficit whichwould otherwise have arisen on the National Insurance Fund and which, it hasbeen and will again be argued, should have been met by the Exchequer; in other words, the effect of the coming into operation of the 1959 Act is to shift from the57893
Exchequer on to the contributors to national insurance the payment ofapproximately  120 millions a year at the outset, increasing later.7. In order to achieve this, contributions in particular of what we describeas the higher-paid worker rise sharply. The higher-paid worker for this purpose is the man earning  15 a week, i.e., only 18s. a week above the most recently published figure for average industrial earnings. Under the 1959 Act as it standsthe total contribution in respect of this man will increase by 7s. 4d. (from 18s. 2d.to 25s. 6d. a week) and his own contribution will increase from 9s. lid. to 13s. 5d.These figures take no account of the further increase which he will have to payin order to meet the cost of the improvements in pension benefits which we are toprovide next session in implementation of our Election pledge.8. At the other end of the scale is the worker earning  9 a week or less. i feel that the Chancellor in paragraph 5 of his paper misleads himself in seeking to compare the new minimum contribution with average earnings. Under his proposal the person on the average earnings presupposed in his paper of about15 per cent, above the 1958 figure (i.e., about  14 10s. a week) would be contributing15s. 4d. a week or 5 - 3 per cent, of his earnings, not 3 - 6 per cent. The contribution of 10s. 7d. which he quotes would relate to earnings of  9 (or less), of which itwould be 5-9 per cent, (or more). One of the attractions of the 1959 Act, andone which we exploited to the full in the House and in the country, was that thelow wage earner, on whom many people feel that the present 9s. 1 Id. contributionfalls heavily, was to secure reduction in his overall contribution to 8s. 4d. Weare in any event denying him this reduction in order to pay higher benefits, and,on this basis and for this reason, I think we can sustain this. But to go further and impose upon him an actual increase in his contribution not justified by higherbenefits would, in my view, be very badly received, and might well be thought to have in it an-element of breach of faith. Further it will be necessary to defendthis rate of contribution, not as we have defended the existing rate against a background of, and in comparison with, rising average earnings, but in relationonly to earnings of  9 a week (or less).9. There is also the case of the contracted out. Whatever their earnings,the 1959 Act provided that their national insurance contribution should remain at the present level of 18s. 2d. This must now in any event go up, pan passu,with the increase in the minimum contribution.10. Finally there are the self-employed and the non-employed. In view ofthe burden of contributions (of which they pay the whole amount) on the lesswell-off section of these, we are deliberately keeping their increase in the national insurance contributions under our new proposals as low as possible. We were unable to give them any relief under the 1959 Act as we were pressed to do. Ithink we should be jarring a particularly sensitive spot if we were to impose anyfurther increase in their overall contribution.11. I come, therefore, unhesitatingly to the conclusion that whatever the merits or demerits of this proposal in the abstract, it would be singularly unwise to proceed with it at this particular moment. And it is relevant to the question of timing that the Chancellor in paragraph 1 of his paper forecasts an increase in1961-62 of only  6 millions over what he has found from the Exchequer for thispurpose in the current year.Merits12. The last two increases in the National Health Service contribution were decided upon very quickly in view of what the Cabinet regarded as the urgency ofthe then situations. In the light, however, of the objections which some of us have seen to this form of taxation, the Social Services Committee on 8th February agreedto set up a &quot; Working Party&quot; to review the present method of financing theNational Health Service. This Committee have been at work for some months and have a draft Report under consideration. This is not yet an agreed document and the Cabinet may well feel that they would like to see and consider this reportwhen it is in its final fonm before taking a further step to increase the national health Service contribution. I confess that the small increase of  6 millions in theExchequer cost of the Health Service next year does not seem to me to be of anorder to necessitate our proceeding, as a matter of urgency, with an increase in a form of taxation to which there is such strong political objection.
13.   In present circumstances I see the following objections to the national health Service contribution:(a) As a form of taxation, it is subject to the criticism that it falls equally onthe better and on the worse-off. It imposes a measure of direct taxation on those whom the mechanism of the Inland Revenue goes tosome pains to exclude from income tax, e.g., the man on modest wageswith a large number of children. Moreover, it falls on such a personwith full, not with modified, weight. If, for reasons of policy, it were thought right, as I am inclined to think it right, that such people shouldbe made aware of the impact of direct taxation, it would seem more appropriate, equitable and efficient to bring them in some degree within its scope by a downward extension of the income limits in respect of income tax, rather than by crudely placing on them a burden as great as is placed on those with larger incomes or smaller family responsibilities.(b) It falls arbitrarily on those who pay national insurance contributions,and not on those who do not, and payment of it coincides in no way with use of the National Health Service. For example, it falls onmarried women only if they do not exercise their option not to paynational insurance contributions..(c) By increasing the contribution collected from the worker to a point andin a manner which will exacerbate Trade Union opinion, a further increase now could well have an effect on wage claims, the inflationaryresults of which could far outweigh the disinflationary advantagesclaimed for it by the Chancellor in paragraph 6 of his paper. In this connexion the figures given in paragraph 7 above are material.id) By increasing the element in the joint contribution which is plainlytaxation, it must undermine the insurance concept under which atpresent over  700 millions a year are raised for the National insurance funds from contributors outside the normal system of taxation.Moreover there is in my view a real risk that, by effectively claimingback for the Exchequer a further  50 millions from the contributions,we shall upset the settlement achieved in the 1959 Act for limiting theExchequer liability to the National Insurance Fund.(e) Though this is a matter for the Minister of Health, it would seem to mevery difficult to introduce a measure of this kind at a time when any economies in National Health Service expenditure were in contemplation.14. My present view is that this is a bad and regressive tax, which is completely at variance with our policy of introducing a progressive graduatedelement into the National Insurance contribution and that on merits there is little to be said for meeting in this way part of the cost of the National Health Service.15. For the reasons given, I very much hope that the Cabinet will not acceptthe Chancellors proposals. For the purpose of completeness, I would, however,add the comment that his suggestion that this proposal should be included in theforthcoming National Insurance Bill is open to grave objections on both proceduraland political grounds. I am advised that the scope of the composite Bill would bewidened to such an extent as to make virtually any amendment admissible and thatthe Bill would probably have to be introduced on a ways and means resolution(as was the case with previous National Health Service Contributions Acts) anydebate on which would almost inevitably range much more widely with a compositeBill. It would also destroy at one stroke my defence against attempts, and amendments, to increase benefits since our defence of a moderate increase can onlyrest on the limitations imposed by the rate of flat rate contributions which it ispossible to charge. If the same Bill were to raise contributions openly for the sake of the Exchequer, that defence would be gone.J. A.
