Printed for the Cabinet.   November I960C. (60), 162 Copy No.   584th November, I960CABINETNATIONAL THEATREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer think that I must ask the Cabinet for a decision about the National Theatreproject, which has been twice discussed by the Home Affairs Committee.2. This project must be judged against its historical background which goesback more than half a century.History of the project3. The Shakespeare Memorial National Theatre Committee were firstformed in 1906 and by the 1930s had collected some  150,000 in donations  70,000 from one donor, Sir Carl Meyer. In 1937 the Trustees bought for  75,000a not very suitable site in South Kensington, which they subsequently agreed to exchange with the London County Council for a site on the South Bank.National Theatre Act, 19494. The Labour Government, while making it clear that the economicsituation would not allow the theatre to be built for some time, passed an enablingAct the National Theatre Act, 1949 empowering the Treasury, on the submission to them of a satisfactory scheme for the erection of a National Theatre by the trustees on the South Bank site, and for the Theatre&apos;s equipment and management,to contribute up to  1 million to the Trustees funds upon such terms as they might think fit. The foundation stone was actually laid on the South Bank by the queen Mother (then The Queen) in 1951.Joint Council5. Meanwhile, the National Theatre Committee had in 1946 joined with the governors of the Old Vic Theatre in establishing a Joint Council for the national theatre and the Old Vic on the basis of an understanding that the National TheatreTrustees would provide the National Theatre building and the Old Vic thecompany. In 1958 Lord Chandos, as a Trustee and Chairman of the joint council, led a deputation to my predecessor to urge that the economic situation was now favourable to the National Theatre project, and that it should accordingly be proceeded with. Lord Amory gave the deputation littleencouragement, and referred to the enquiry which the Arts Council were thenconducting into &quot; the housing of the arts &quot;.6. In June of this year the Joint Council was joined by the Governing Bodyof the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, and at the sametime appointed a small Executive Committee under the Chairmanship ofSir Kenneth Clark (formerly Chairman of the Arts Council). This ExecutiveCommittee is known to be actively engaged on preparing up-to-date plans both for the National Theatre building and for the organisation of the company.Lord Chandos has now asked to bring a further deputation from the joint council to see me early in December, and I expect to be strongly pressed then to make the Governments intentions known.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
The present position .7.   The other main features of the present position are as follows:(i) The Arts Council the official body to which the Government looks for advice in such matters have, after considerable investigation,expressed themselves unanimously in favour of going forwardimmediately with the National Theatre, to which they give first priorityamong cultural projects needed in London.(ii) The London County Council are anxious to complete their plans for thedevelopment of the South Bank, and for the use of the original SouthKensington site, which they have agreed to exchange with the Trustees,and which is likewise &quot; sterilised &quot; until the future of the South Banksite is settled. The London County Council passed a Resolution lastFebruary asking the Government to act upon the recommendationof the Arts Council that building of the National Theatre should nowbegin.(iii) The demand for a National Theatre is backed by the main professionalbodies concerned, namely, the Theatrical Managers&apos; Association,Equity, the League of Dramatists and the British Drama League.(iv) Both the main political parties have expressed support for the project in recent publications, although the Conservative Election Manifestocarefully avoided any specific commitment.(v) There are active supporters of the project on both sides of the House,and it is clear that Questioning about the Governments intentions willbe resumed in the new Session.(vi) The 400th anniversary of Shakespeare&apos;s birth falls in 1964, and there willbe feeling in many quarters that the opening of the National Theatrein April of that year would be the most fitting form of celebration ofthis national event.8. Against this background it would be difficult for the Government tocontinue to stall on this issue any longer, by taking the line, for example, that further interests need to be consulted or that more time is needed for taking adecision. I think that the Government would incur discredit and laterembarrassment if they do not now face up to the issue, and make their immediateintentions clear.9. . On the other hand, I do not think that this necessarily means that thetime has come for the Government to take a final decision either that the project should be enabled to proceed or that it must be shelved indefinitely. Theprovision of Exchequer finance under the 1949 Act is conditional upon thepreparation of a satisfactory scheme for erecting, equipping and managing a theatre. No such scheme has yet been presented, although there is reason to know that the Joint Council are working on one. It would be only reasonable for theGovernment to say that they could not be expected to commit themselves finallyon the project until a satisfactory scheme had been submitted to them; and thatthe decision whether and when to go ahead would then be taken in the light ofthe general public reaction to the scheme, and of the economic situation at thetime. What I think we cannot avoid saying now is whether or not we are preparedto consider a scheme when one is submitted to us. If we are not prepared toconsider it, then it would be right to say so. If, on the other hand, we are prepared in principle to consider a scheme, then I think it would be equally wise to make this clear, and to take the opportunity to ensure, so far as possible, that the projectdoes not assume proportions which would later be embarrassing to us. At thesame time we must recognise that an announcement by the Government that theyhad invited the Arts Council to arrange for the submission of a scheme whichwould, I think, be the right way to go forward, if we should decide to do so would go a considerable way if not the whole way to committing the Government toenable the project to proceed in due course.Cost and Timing10. In 1949 it was estimated that the theatre could be built and equipped for  1 million. At present prices the total cost would be nearer  2 millions -representing at 6 per cent, an annual charge of  120,000.  It is possible that the
building could be erected in two phases, the first of which might cost no morethan  1 million. Such an arrangement would no doubt cost more money in thelong run.11. The theatre would need an annual subsidy, payable through the arts council. The Executive Committee of the Joint Council are said to be thinkingnow in terms of a subsidy of the order of  350,000 a year. This figure is apparentlybased on an expansive plan whereby the existing Stratford and Old Vic companies would form two of three sections of a National Theatre Company, one of whichwould be used for touring purposes. This is the kind of feature of any schemewhich it would be desirable to nip in the bud. It would certainly be desirable,and should be practicable, to stipulate that, if the project is to go forward, it mustbe on the understanding that the annual subsidy would not exceed a stated figure,say  250,000 a year, for a number of years-a ceiling figure which the Governmentcould always increase at a later date if the case for some increase had by then become unanswerable. It would also have to be made clear that the Governmentwould not expect the ceiling figure itself to be reached for a number of years, whilethe theatre and company were being built up.12. If the annual cost of making a capital contribution of  2 millions is assumed to be  120,000, and the annual running subsidy is put at  250,000, thetotal annual cost of the theatre to the Exchequer would be  370,000.13. The earliest date at which building work would start is probably the spring of 1962. The capital cost would then be spread over two years from 1962to 1964. The company would no doubt be formed and getting into training whilethe theatre was being built, and some annual subsidy would probably be neededfrom 1962 onwards.14. There seems to be little doubt that, if the project is eventually to proceed,further legislation will be necessary. This could perhaps be prepared andintroduced in the 1961-62 Session if an acceptable scheme were forthcoming bythe summer of next year.No Alternative Project15. There is clearly no prospect of satisfying the advocates of the projectby any compromise or alternative measure that would cost less. Two suchpropositions have been put to and rejected by the Arts Council, namely:(i) That a National Theatre should not be built until the company had been created, and had justified themselves over a number of years. In the arts CounciTs view, company and building must be brought into beingsimultaneously.(ii) That the money required to establish a National Theatre should be spenton creating a &quot; grid&quot; of up-to-date theatres in, say, 10 provincialcentres a suggestion put forward by the Minister of Education atthe Home Affairs Committee. The Arts Council, however, after seeking the advice of their Drama Panel which includes a strong provincialrepresentation unanimously rejected the suggestion. In their view&quot; a provincial theatre grid might be a very valuable ancillary to aNational Theatre, but could be no substitute for it, and would probablyfail in its purpose without the central focus of a National Theatreorganisation to provide ideals and standards to inspire and encourage it&quot;.Balance of Arguments16.   The main arguments in favour of a forward step are these:(i) The Arts Council and important interests in the theatre world stronglyadvocate the project on its merits, although there is very little indicationwhether public opinion generally is in favour of it.(ii) The launching of the National Theatre in time for the Shakespearequatercentenary celebrations would be approved in many quarters,whereas a decision not to go ahead would undoubtedly provokecriticism.(iii) A National Theatre would be a good tourist attraction and foreign currency earner.
17.  The arguments against going forward are:(i) The National Theatre is bound to be an expensive project, and one whoseultimate cost and implications will be difficult to foresee or control.(ii) The estimated cost of establishing and subsidising a National Theatre islarge in relation to the present total of Government expenditure on the arts (about  8 millions in 1960-61), and a decision to proceed with the project would be likely to lead to pressure for increased exchequer support of other branches of the arts. Even if the decision were accompanied by a clear statement that the creation of a national theatre as a first priority must reduce the scope for increased support for other claimants in the arts field, the claimants would still be loudlyvocal and difficult to contend with.(iii) The present is an unpropitious time to announce a Government decisioninvolving new expenditure on what many people would certainly regard as an unnecessary project, even though no expenditure would fall due for at least some eighteen months ahead.18. The question seems to me to be a very difficult one. I am sure that wemust now make a definite move one way or the other, but the choice is awkward.On the one hand, I am impressed by the arguments in favour of going ahead withthe project. On the other hand, I am reluctant to contemplate taking on yet another commitment at the present time. It seems to me that the public would find this hard to reconcile with all we have been saying about the need for economy in public expenditure. It is true that by reserving a final decision until a schemewas submitted to us we should, in theory, retain the right to decide against the project in the end or to postpone its implementation until economic circumstance were more favourable. Ideally this would be a convenient project to have availablefor putting into operation at short notice when there is next a recession in capital investment. But there is little doubt that, once a scheme was prepared and generally approved, we should be under the strongest pressure to go straight aheadso as to complete it in time for the 1964 quatercentenary, whatever the economic climate at the time.19. I should welcome the opportunity of discussing the issue with mycolleagues.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,3rd November, 1960.
