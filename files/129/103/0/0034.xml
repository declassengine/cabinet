Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1960C. (60) 184 Copy No.  555th December, 1960CABINETTOURISMMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department i welcome on general grounds the proposal in the memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (60) 179) that we should consider ways and means of attracting more tourists; and I am particularly glad that he has included among matters which should be considered the inadequate arrangements for handling passengers at the seaports at which large numbers of continentalpassengers arrive. I was myself on the point of pressing for something to bedone at the south coast ports especially at Dover, where the congestion on the arrival of some of the services from Ostend is causing indefensible delays for whichthe blame is wrongly laid at the door of the Immigration and Customs Services.2. In considering the President^ paper, my colleagues should be aware that,on the initiative of Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, when he was Foreign Secretary, I recentlyarranged for the preparation of material by the Home Office, the Ministry ofTransport, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Board of Customs and Excise toserve as the basis of a review of our existing arrangements for dealing withimmigration, customs, motor cars and plant and animal health requirements.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd had urged that we should if possible adopt more liberal policies in these matters in the interests of Western European unity; and it had beenagreed that the position should be the subject of early consideration by theDepartments mainly concerned. The material prepared for this purpose will,I think, be of value in any wider examination of our tourist potential upon whichwe may agree.3. I would only add that so far as the immigration controls are concerned to which the President directs special attention I do not think that we can relaxfurther our present scrutiny at the ports, which is kept to an absolute minimum,unless we are either to open the door to the large-scale entry of foreign workers and seekers after the benefits of the welfare State or to adopt a system of policecontrol of aliens which would probably be much more objectionable. I expect that in other fields too we may find it difficult to reconcile relaxations of practice which would be in the interests of tourism with our own domestic requirements.But I fully agree that we should fake stock and see what can be done.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,2nd December, 1960.58153
