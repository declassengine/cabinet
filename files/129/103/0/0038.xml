(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 18813th December, I960CABINETCOAL SALES TO THE IRISH FiEPUBLICAND NORTHERN Ireland memorandum by the Minister of power the Prime  Minister of Northern Ireland, Lord Brookeborough,recently drew the attention of the Prime Minister and the Home Secretaryto the fact that Northern Ireland pays more than Eire for British coal.Coal in Northern Ireland is about 35s. a ton dearer because it is treatedas part of the United Kingdom home market, while Eire is treated asan export market in which the National Coal Board have had to matchAmerican and Polish prices in order to keep a foothold.   Lord Brookeboroughreferred to the dissatisfaction and political embarrassment caused by thisdisparity and asked whether anything could be done to improve the situation.2.        Two steps are proposed.   First, the Board have decided to makea small price reduction for most of the house coal shipped to NorthernIreland.   Secondly, because house coal is in short supply in the UnitedKingdom, and because of the losses involved in selling at present export-prices, the Board have decided that the time has come to increase theprice of this coal to the Republic.   They propose at the end of the presentcontracts next May to quote importers in the Republic similar prices for house coal to those charged for sales to Northern Ireland.   This stepwill almost certainly bring to an end the trade, which is about half thepresent British coal exports to the Republic, because importers there will find it cheaper to turn to American or Continental supplies.3.        The quantities of house coal which the Board export to destinationsother than Eire are negligible, and they do not expect to receive any seriouscomplaints of discrimination.   The Board will make known their decision in the course of normal commercial negotiations for new contracts.   Thedecision is a commeicial one taken by the Board and will not involve theGovernment, but it will be of substantial assistance to the Northern ireland government and I think we should welcome it.4.        If my colleagues see no objection to the National Coal Board&apos;proposal in respect of trade with the Republic, Lord Brookeborough willbe informed accordingly.R. F. W.Ministry of Power, S.
