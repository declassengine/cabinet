(Tins DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 169 COPY NO.   &amp; l24th November, I960CABINETFOREIGN COMPENSATION (EGYPT)(INTERIM DISTRIBUTION) ORDER, 1959Memorandum by the Lord Privy SealUnder the Anglo-Egyptian Financial Agreement of March, 1959,the Government of the United Arab Republic paid Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  27-1 millions as compensation for property which they took overpermanently (i.e. Egyptianised) and for injury or damage to property which was sequestrated and which they undertook to return to the former owners.   Of this sum approximately  lj millions has been distributed to the claimants under the Foreign Compensation (Egypt) (InterimDistribution) Order 1959.2. Nearly all claims for Egyptianised property have probablynow been presented to the Foreign Compensation Commission.   Theseamount to slightly more than  66 millions, but this figure may be sub-stantially reduced on assessment by the Commission.   Claims in thesecond category (i. e. those for injury or damage to property whichwas sequestrated but which has since been released) have only recentlybegun to come in;  at present these amount to less than  1 million.Such claims will continue to be made for some time and it is impossibleto calculate the sum to which they are likely to amount.   The total valueof the sequestrated property is very considerable and the loss on it mayreach a fairly high percentage of its value, but it seems unlikely thatclaims for this loss will amount to more than  30 millions.   We have therefore assumed that claims in both categories should not total morethan  100 millions and it is quite likely that the total will be substantially less.   In taking the figure of  100 millions as the maximum for the claims,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I agree that it would now be possibleto make a further interim distribution of compensation from the fundswhich the Egyptians have paid us.3. Under the first interim distribution the smaller claimantsreceived a considerably higher percentage of their claims than those with larger claims.   I would now propose to increase the distributionbroadly in favour of the larger claimants so that the overall sum may bemore evenly distributed.   On this basis the Chancellor of the Exchequerand I have calculated the figures in the schedule of the draft Order inCouncil attached, which are inclusive of, not additional to, the sumsalready paid out in the first interim distribution of compensation.   Theseallow for no change in the 70 per cent which has been paid on the first 5,000 of each claim under the first distribution.   Similarly there willbe no change in the payment of 50 per cent on claims between  5,000and  10,000.   It is proposed that payment on claims between  10,000 and 50,000 should be at the rate of 50 per cent and on those between  50,000and  500,000 the payment should be raised to 25 per cent.   This should-1-
go a considerable way to meeting the complaints of the middle claimants.Payment on claims over  500,000 would now be at the rate of 20 per cent.I annex a table showing the rates of distribution, together with their effect on specimen Bums.4. Assuming that the claims do not amount to more than 100 millions in all, I estimate that this new distribution will mean atotal payment from the Fund of about  23 millions.   To the extent thatthis sum is decreased by the assessments of the Foreign CompensationCommission, the total payment will be reduced.   To meet this we have 27^- millions received from the Egyptians together with interest(amounting between June,1959 and 3lst October,1960 to  741,613 gross,on which income tax of  287,375 is due, leaving a net income of 454, 238) and ex gratia loans already received by the claimants whichwill be deducted from the payments to be made to them (which Iestimate will be about  1 million).   This makes a total of  29 millionsat present. It will therefore be seen that the amount remaining for afinal distribution is comparatively small.5. I should now be grateful for the approval of my colleagues for these proposals as set out in the draft Order in Council attached.If this course of action is approved, I would like at the same time tomake certain technical amendments to the Foreign Compensation (Egypt)(Interim Distribution) Order 1959 made necessary by the changes inpercentage rates of payment and to meet certain difficulties in determining the eligibility of persons to receive payments.   these amendments are included in the draft Order in Council attached, andtheir purport is explained in a note at the end of the Order.E.H.Foreign Office, S.W.I.23rd November, I960-2-
