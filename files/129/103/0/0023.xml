COVENT GARDEN MARKETMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Cabinet decided on 17th November that the plan to rebuild theCovent Garden market bvet the railway sidings at King&apos;s Cross should noton present information be ruled out;  and asked that further consideration should be given both to the feasibility of the King&apos;s Cross plan and to thepossibility of so amending the Covent Garden Bill, now before the Houseof Commons, as to empower the new statutory Market Authority to rebuildthe market either on its present site or at King&apos;s Cross (C. C. (60)58th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. The Home Affairs Committee and, subsequently, a group of theMinisters primarily concerned have now considered these questions. Ourconclusion is that we should proceed with the Bill in its present form.3.        We are advised that, being a hybrid, the Bill cannot be amendedduring its passage through Parliament in such a way as to widen its scope.Since the Bill in its present form requires the Market Authority tc providea market &quot;in the Covent Garden area&quot;, it would have to be withdrawn ifthe option contemplated by the Cabinet were to be given.4.        The merits of the King&apos;s Cross plan are far from certain.   Moreimportant, it is at least equally uncertain whether the market interests would be willing to move to King&apos;s Cross: indeed, there is good reason tosuggest that they would not.   What is certain is that there is a wide measureof agreement on the present plan to reorganise the market and rebuildit on approximately its present site and that it would be a long time -perhaps many years - before agreement could be secured for any alternative.5.        That delay we cannot afford.   Something must be done at once to relieve the traffic congestion caused by the present market and eliminate the fire ride involved in the storage of containers there.   In the long term the King&apos;s Cross plan might or might not be preferable from the trafficpoint of view, but there is no doubt that the present plan would bring abouta very great improvement.   The congestion in the Covent Garden area isdue primarily to the parking of market lorries in the adjoining streetsand, as the plan is completed, they will be cleared off the streets intothe market area. We can say positively that the plan would produce traffic conditions in the Covent Garden area which could be regarded as  tolerable,at least for some years.6.        To proceed with the Bill would not preclude subsequentlegislation if the new Market Authority were to come forward with aproposal that, after the period of reorganisation, the rebuilding should becarried out at King&apos;s Cross.   But we are satisfied&apos;that, in order to avoid-1-SECIRETC. (60) 173 COPY NO. \l23rd. November, I960CABINET
perpetuating a damaging uncertainty among the market interests andowners of property in the Covent Garden area, we should say no more on this than that if the Market Authority made such a proposal theGovernment of the day would naturally consider what was the most appropriate course of action in the circumstances then existing.7.        Politically, the weakness of our case is that, although we are known to have had the King&apos;s Cross plan in our hands for twelve months,we are not in a position to pronounce positively on its merits.   Wesuggest that if the Cabinet accept our conclusion, the decision to proceedwith the Bill should be presented on the basis that the Covent Garden planaccords with the modern conception of gradually replacing bulkmarketing by a system of selling from samples and that, since it is acceptable to the wide range of interests concerned, it offers the onlypossibility of early action to deal with the actual and pressing problemscaused by the present market - that is, traffic congestion and the firerisks.8.        We invite the Cabinet to concur   in our view that we should proceed with the Covent Garden Bill in its present form, and against the background presented in this paper.R. A. B.Home Office, S. W.l.23rd November, I960-2-secret
