Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1960Copy No. 54CABINETHOUSE COAL PROSPECTS FOR THE WINTERMemorandum by the Minister of PowerDuring the last few months there have been complaints about delays in thesupply of house coal. This memorandum contains the best assessment I can makeabout the prospects for the winter.2. The delays have been caused by the exceptionally large increase in demand for house coal. People have been ordering in anticipation of the recentprice increase and the ending of summer prices, and because consumption has beenhigher due to the bad weather. During the eight weeks up to 24th September,merchants&apos; disposals to consumers were 800,000 tons (27 per cent.) higher than last year, and the National Coal Board&apos;s despatches to the merchants were465,000 tons *(13 per cent.) higher. The Board have therefore had difficulty in keeping pace with the abnormally high increase in merchants&apos; disposals. Thegrowth in merchants&apos; stocks has also been appreciably less than a year ago. these stocks now (1st October) stand at 1-35 million tons, compared with 1-77 million tons last year. At the same time the National Coal Board&apos;s undistributed stocksof large coal have fallen to 1 - 04 million tons compared with 2 - 65 million tonsa year ago.3. Winter purchases by consumers of large coal (railways and otherconsumers, as well as the domestic user) are likely to exceed 25 million tons.Allowing for the maximum draught on merchants&apos; stocks, the National Coal Boardestimate that the demand they will have to meet themselves will be 24 million tons,which is the same as last winter. The Board hope to be able to make available22 - 6 million tons from current production, which would leave a balance of 1 - 4 million tons to be met by lifting from the Board&apos;s stocks. The figure of 22-million tons assumes an improvement in the percentage of large coal in total output from the average of 22-1, achieved in the first eight months of this year,to 23 - 3. Although it is right to set this percentage as a target, it may be optimisticto count on achieving it. If we assume that the percentage is increased halfwayto the target level, only 22 million tons will be available from current productionand 2 million tons will have to be met by lifting from Board stocks. As theBoard&apos;s total stocks of large coal will be only about one million tons at thebeginning of winter, there is a possible deficiency of a million tons.4. The Board think they could make available 700,000 tons of doubles fromtheir undistributed stocks, although the quality of this coal would not be altogether acceptable to consumers. They also have 2 million tons of unscreenedcoal, which they could at some expense screen to yield up to a further quarter ofa million tons of large coal. But in order to meet the total expected demand itis essential that the percentage of large coal is raised at least halfway to the targetlevel. It is also essential that transport facilities should be adequate to move thecoal to the merchants.5. The Board are acutely aware of the dangers of the situation and areconcentrating attention on two main aspects of it. In the first place they aremaking a major effort to improve the percentage of large coal, even though this c. (60) 15217 th October, 196057895
runs counter to the need for increasing mechanisation and productivity and reducing costs. Divisions have been given targets of large coal production andthe mechanisation programme is being revised so as to avoid, as far as possible,increasing the use of the types of equipment which tend to degrade the size of thecoal brought to the surface. The August large coal percentage (22-8) wasencouraging, but it was possibly affected by the pattern of colliery holidays.6. The Board are also pressing the British Transport Commission to make sure that adequate transport will be available. Estimates of the total tonnage tobe moved are now being examined by the Commission. These will undoubtedlyshow that emergency measures will have to be put into operation in order to make more wagons available to the Board as the winter progresses. It will be necessaryamong other things to switch more power station coal to the roads in order to release wagons for house coal.7. I am keeping in very close touch with the Chairman of the Coal Boardand I will, with permission, circulate a further memorandum before Christmas.R. F. W.Ministry of Power, SWA,17th October, 1960.
