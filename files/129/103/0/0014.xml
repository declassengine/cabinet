Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1960C. (60) 164 Copy No.   5515th November, 1960CABINETPOLICE pay memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Royal Commission on the Police was appointed in December 1959.They were required among other things to consider:&quot; The broad principles which should govern the remuneration of theconstable, having regard to the nature and extent of police duties and responsibilities and the need to attract and retain an adequate number of recruits with the proper qualifications.&quot;The Royal Commission decided to produce an interim report on pay, and theyhave now informed us of their recommendations. The report is due to bepublished on 24th November.2. The general background to the report is that there has long beendissatisfaction in the police about their pay, and this is in spite of the fact thatthey have received frequent increases in recent years, the last three in consequenceof awards by arbitrators. Until this year recruiting has been quite good on thewhole, and numbers have increased by some 10,000 in the last 10 years; butwastage has remained very high, and there is still a shortage of about 13,000 men.The shortage is particularly acute in the great conurbations, where crimeflourishes; and there is a serious problem in London, where there is a deficiency of some 30 per cent. This year recruiting has taken a serious turn for the worse,and there are now some 400 fewer constables than there were at the beginning ofthe year.3. The police received their last pay increase in April 1958. Taking intoaccount the increase in wages and earnings since that date, they have a validclaim for an increase of some 10 per cent., but no claim has been lodged in viewof the appointment of the Royal Commission. It is important to bear this figureof 10 per cent, in mind in assessing the recommendations of the RoyalCommission.4. The Royal Commission have recommended a specific scale of pay forconstables. They came to the conclusion that merely to make recommendations about general principles would lead to a long dispute on the Police Council forGreat Britain the negotiating body about the interpretation of the principles.In the end there would probably be failure to agree, and reference to thearbitrators. The Independent Chairman of the Council is understood to havegiven evidence in private to the Commission to this effect. The Commissionconsidered that this would be an intolerable situation, and they have accordinglyset out the scale of pay which the application of their principles, in their judgment, produces for the constable.5. At present the police constable is paid at a rate of  510, rising to  695after nine years. The Royal Commission recommend that he should be paid ona scale of  600, rising to  910 after nine years. They also recommend thepayment of special increments of  30 each on the completion of 17 and 22 years&apos;service, making a maximum of  970. These increases range from about 20 percent, at the beginning to 30 per cent, at the end of the normal scale, and 40 per58052
cent, after taking into account the two long service increments. The Commissionmake no recommendation about the date of operation, and their only referenceto the pay of the ranks above constable is that in settling them  910, rather than 970, should be regarded as the constable&apos;s maximum.6. It is difficult to estimate the exact cost of accepting the Royal Commission^recommendation in view of the uncertainty about the pay of the higher ranks, but itisireasonable to adopt as a maximum a figure of  20 millions a year, of which halfwould fall to be met by the Exchequer and half from the rates, for the existing members of the service. In addition, an increase in pay of this order shouldstimulate recruiting, and so increase the cost of the service. Eventually, there willbe a substantial addition to the present pension bill of   17 - 5 millions a year.7. I have no doubt that the recommendations of the Royal Commission willbe generally welcomed both in the police service and outside. There has been much publicity recently about the need for higher pay for the police, and a debate in the House of Lords in January of this year showed the strength of the feeling onthis question. As soon as the report is published strong pressure is likely to developfor the Government to give immediate effect to it. I see no alternative to our doing so, and in order to obtain the best effect on recruiting, to prevent any discontent inthe service, and to anticipate strong public and Parliamentary pressure, I am sure that we should take immediate action. On the other hand, the duly constitutednegotiating machinery must be respected. The Police Council for Great Britain,on which the Secretary of State for Scotland and I are represented, is due to meeton 30th November; and if the report is published on 24th November I propose tosay, in a public statement on that date, that the Government attach great importanceto early action, and that I have referred the report to the Council with a request forthem to consider it as quickly as possible.8. If the carrying out of the Royal Commission^ recommendations weredelayed by protracted negotiations, and perhaps reference to arbitration, therewould be great discontent in the service and a serious situation might arise. Ishould hope that both the local authority and the police members of the police council for Great Britain would be willing to agree to an immediate settlement forthe constable, by the adoption of the scale recommended by the Royal Commission,and to an interim settlement for the higher ranks on the basis of maintaining roughlytheir present cash differential over the constable^ maximum. (In practice, it wouldbe necessary to increase the differentials by  10 to ensure that a sergeant is not paidless than a constable who is receiving the long service increments.) I should be glad to have authority, through the representatives on the official side of the Home Officeand the Scottish Home Department, to encourage such an agreement and, if it isreached, to implement it immediately. The date of operation would be the dateof signature of the report, and the final rates of pay of the ranks above constablewould be left for later negotiation. If the Staff Side were disposed to claim an earlier date of operation, I hope they would not feel that that need hold up the interim settlement. That settlement need not prejudice further negotiation, and ifnecessary resort to arbitration, on the eventual date of operation. But myrepresentatives would make it clear that if this issue is left open it does not imply that in my view there is a valid claim to retrospection to an earlier date than the signature of the report.9. I am sure that a quick interim settlement of police pay is desirable, and Iseek the approval of my colleagues to proceeding as indicated in this paper.Naturally, I cannot say whether the police authorities and the representatives ofthe service will agree to the course I have outlined.10. The Secretary of State for Scotland, with whom I have been inconsultation, is in general agreement with this memorandum..R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,14th November, I960.
