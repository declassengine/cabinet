.....x , secret. (60) 185 COPY NO.7th December, I960CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE NATIONALISED TRANSPORTUNDERTAKINGSNote by the Minister of transport i circulate for the approval of my colleagues a revised draft white paper on the reorganisation of the nationalised transport undertakings.This has been prepared by the Prime Minister with the assistance of theChancellor of the Exchequer and myself, on the basis of a draft produced by the Departments concerned following the discussion in Cabinet on1st December (C.C.(60) 6lst Conclusions, Minute 3).2.        It will be seen that, although there has been a good deal of re-writing and the draft is now more closely argued, few points of principlehave arisen.3.        I hope that the Cabinet will feel able to give final approval to thedraft this week in order to enable the White Paper to be printed in time for publication on Tuesday, 20fch December, before Parliament rises.E. M.Ministry of Transport, W.l.7th December, I960.
throughout this document the expression &quot;nationalisedtransport undertakings&quot; excludes the Statutory air corporations.J-^Revised 7th December, 1960)secret draft WHITE PAPERREORGANISATION OF THE NATIONALISED TRANSPORT UNDERTAKINGS1 . Her Majesty&apos;s Government, having reviewed the position and prospects of the nationalised transport undertakings&apos;^ now putforward their proposals for their future structure, working andfinancial reorganisation.      In reaching their conclusions, theGovernment have been assisted by the valuable advice they havereceived from the Special Advisory Group on the British transport commission.      They have also taken into full accounts the Report on british Railways from the House of Commons Select Committee on nationalised Industries, and the views of the British transport commission and the Trade Unions.The Governments Aim2. The Governments aim is that the nationalised transport under-takings shall be soundly based both in organisation and finance,providing efficient services to industry and the public and giving agood livelihood and worthwhile jobs to those who work in them.3. There is much to do and a long way to go.      The accumulateddeficits of the British Transport Commission at the end of 1960 willbe of the order of  500M.  and are currently running at the rate of 1 00M. a year.ko Sweeping changes will he needed.      Effort and sacrifices willbe required from all.      The public will have to be prepared to facechanges in the extent and the nature of the services provided, andwhen necessary,  in the prices charged for them.      The taxpayer willhave to face a major capital reorganisation as well as continue tocarry a large part of the  burden until the railways are paying their way again.      Those working in these undertakings, if their livelihood-hood is to be assured, will have to play their part in
increasing productivity and enabling the labour force to be deployed so as to secure maximum efficiency in operation.    Whenthe Government made funds available to implement the GuillebaudReport last spring, they made it clear that far-reaching changes would be necessary.The Problem5.    The heart of the problem is in the railways.    They area great national enterprise and a vital basic industry.    Theyemploy half a million people and represent an investment of nearly 1600M. which is growing by more than  lOOIvi. each year.    a railway system of the right size is an essential element in ourtransport net-work and will remain so for as long as can be fore-seen.    The development of other forms of transport and new techniques have faced our railways,  like the railways in othercountries, with problems of competition and adaptation to moderncircumstances ana public demand.6.    The railways are now in a grave financial plight.    They area long way short of covering even their running costs - bysomething of the order of  60M.  a year.    This is quite apart fromthe problem of meeting their interest charges, whether upon theprice paid for the undertakings or upon the money since borrowedfor modernisation and other purposes.    These interest charges nowtotal some  75M.  a year.   *7.    The practical test for tne railways,  as for other transport,is how far the users are prepared to pay economic prices for theservices provided.    Broadly,  this will,  in the end settle the size and pattern of the railway system.    It is already clear thatthe present  system must be made more compact.    There must alsobe modernisation,  not only of lay-out,  equipment and operatingmethods, but of organisation and management structure..1.*&quot; the figures in this paragraph relate to railwaysalone;  they make no allowance for surpluses, atpresent some  10M,  a year after meeting interest charges,  earned from the other activities of theCommission.-2-secret
o8.        The answers to these problems will not be found overnights butthe Government are convinced that as an essential first step theremust be radical changes in the organisation, financial constitution and the statutory framework of the undertakings controlled by the-British Transport Commission.THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S MAIN conclusions .       The activities of the British Transport Commission as atpresent constituted are so large and so diverse that to run themeffectively as a single undertaking is a virtually impossible task.The size and difficulties of British Railways have understandablytended to preoccupy the Commission and have undoubtedly affected itsoutlook over the whole range of its activities.10,     While there have clearly been some shortcomings of management,these have no doubt been due in part to the structural defectsreferred to above.      These have been particularly apparent in financial and commercial matters.      In the consideration of thesematters there has been a marked tendency for technical and operatingfactors to prevail over others.      There has also been,  as the SelectCommittee point out in paragraph 1+17 of their Report,  a &quot;confusionin judging between what is economically right and what is sociallydesirable11,11.      The commercial capability of the railways is circumscribed.byoutmoded statutory restrictions and obligations on their trading operations.12,     Mounting deficits, the size of capital debt in relation tothe earning capacity of the assets represented, and the increasingburden of interest as modernisation proceeds, present a situationdetrimental to the morale of management and staff,  to financial control, and to hopes of recovery.- 3 -f&quot;&quot; p1 ^&quot;1 Tft pi^&quot;^
IIP13.    In these circumstances,   the Government have decided(a) to replace the British Transport Commissionand the existing organisation by a new structure designed to overcome the maindefects and disadvantages of the presentorgani sation;(b) to reconstruct the finances of the Commissionand in particular those of the railways;(c) to give the various activities the maximumpractical freedom of operation in their commercial affairs.11+.    The Government propose that each of the main activitiesof the present Transport Commission should be managed by aseparate board holding its own assets and responsible forits own capital debt.    This should lead to concentration of effort,  devolution and definition of responsibility,and thus secure more effective management,  and fosterfinancial discipline.    The object is to provide each Boardand management with a clearly defined task within a setfield.    The administration of Such diverse activities asthe Railways, Ports,  London Transport and Inland Waterways,presents special problems,  each of which calls for particular qualifications an, experience.    The Boards forBritish Railways, London Transport,  British transport docks and British Waterways will each be incorporatedunder Statute with the appropriate duties and powersnecessary to the efficient ccnd ct of those undertakings. In viewof their importance ana the special nature of their problems theyTHE GOVERNMENT&apos;S FROPOSALSA NEW STRUCTURE-h-
Owill be responsible direct to the Minister of Transport, who will appoint their members..     All the other activities will be groupedunder a Holding Company (see para. 2k below).     A chart showing thenew structure is on page 18 *The British Railways Board15.     The British Railways Board will assume the responsibility forrunning the railways as an effective national system and will be vested with the railway assets and the responsibility for the capitaldebt of the railways as a whole.      It will however perform only thosecentral functions which are essential to the running of the railwaysas a single entity;    all other functions will be the responsibility ofthe Regional Railway Boards (see paragraph 17 below).      Notably theBritish Railways Board will be responsible for such matters as national staff and wage negotiations, overall control over finance and investment, policies for safety, training and research, and the determination of the future size and shape of the railway system.16,      The Railways Board will be composed as follows:(d)     One or two part-time members.Regional Railway   Boards17.      The Regional Railway Boards, which will replace the presentArea Boards, will be fully responsible for the management and operation of their regional railway systems.     Each will beautonomous in all matters which concern Jts region alone.      Theywill thus continue the process of devolution of authority anddecentralisation of management.     To assist it in carrying out its duties each Regional Railway Board will maintain a regional tradingaccount.      (The Commission&apos;s consultants have suggested possible a full-time Chairman and Vice-Chairman.A member from each of the Regional Railway Boards(ordinarily the Chairman or General Manager).Certain full-time members with special responsibilities.
bases for such accounts and their report is under consideration)./The precise arrangements for capital expenditure, which would be within the control of the Regional Board, and major capitalexpenditure, which would require the approval of the Railways Board,must be worked out as experience develops^18*      The membership of the Boards will be small in number and will contain a strong element of full time Members.     The Chairman willbe appointed by the Minister.      The post of Regional general manager will carry a seat on the Board.A3.      To secure coordination between national railway policy and regional railway operation one Member of each of the RegionalRailway Boards will, as already stated, be a Member of theBritish Railways Board.Packet Ports and Shipping Services20,      The paisket ports and those shipping services which areextensions of the railway system will continue to be treated aspart of the railway system.London Transport21 .      The London Transport Executive will again be called the london passenger Transport Board and will continue to be composed mainly of full tims  members of whom a number will have, special responsi-bilities.      It will be responsible for the public transport monopolyat present delegated to the London Transport Executive.      as hitherto, it will work in close concert with the London lines ofBritish Railways in all matters of common concern.British Transport Docks22.     The ports and docks at present administered by the Commission&apos;british Transport Docks Division will be transferred to a new statutory Docks Board.      The Board will be small in number.      its composition will reflect those functions affecting the Docksincluding finance which require to be dealt with centrally.     Themanagement of the more important of their ports will be represented on the Board.
Inland Waterways23.    British Transport Waterways will he placed under anindependent statutory board to be known as the Inland WaterwaysAuthority.    This body will own and manage the nationalisedinland waterway system,,    It will also be responsible for proceeding with the redevelopment or disposal of waterways which no longer have a transport use.    The composition, powers and dutiesof the new body will require further discussion.    It will benecessary to ta&amp;e account, on the one hand,  of the chargewhich the waterways system imposes on public funds,  and,  on theother,  of the varied purposes which they can be made to serve.The Holding Company2ij..    British Road Services,   filling bus Group,  Scottish Bus Group,British Transport Hotels, Road Freight Shipping Services,   andThomas Cook and Son Ltd., will each be operated as companiesincorporated under the Companies Act with their own boards ofdire ctors.25.    All these undertakings (except the Hotels) are alre auy i ncompany form;  and all operate in the same general field as privateenterprise with which they are often in competition.    They willall,   including the Hotels, now be grouped under a new holding company responsible to the Minister who will appoint its Board.26.    The Commission&apos; s -present minority shareholdings in certaintransport concerns including bus companies which are subsidiaries of the British Electric Traction Company limited will be trans-ferred to the Holding Company.    Certain controlled companies and holdings essentially connected with the-.railv/ays will fall-within the general responsibility of the Railways Board,-27.    On the other hand there are certain companies eithercontrolled by the Commission or in which the Commission holda minority interest,  the activities of which are essentiallyconnected with the Railways.    The Commission^ holdings inthese companies will be transferred to the Railways Board.-7- -secret
Freehold and Leasehold Property2d.    The development of the valuable properties at present heldby the Commission is  a matter requiring special attention (see also para.   59 below).    It is proposed to set up one or moreorganisations specially equipped to advise and as appropriateact for the statutory Boards and Companies in connection withthe development,  transfer and the disposal of property no longer required,  and thus to assist in obtaining the best possible return.COORDINATION29.    Coordination of policy between the new Boards includingallocation of funds for new investment will be the responsibilityof the Minister of Transport.    In this he will be assisted by anew advisory body,  the Nationalised Transport Advisory Council.Suitable arrangements for coordinating the day-to-day activitiesof individual undertakings will also be established by means of consultation between the Chairmen  of the new Boards.30.    The new organisation is intended to provide for direct contact between the Minister and the component parts of the nationalised transport industry.    This will necessarily be closestwhere there are deficits to be financed from the public purse.Apart from this the Government do not propose that theMinister&apos;s existing statutory powers and responsibilities inrelation to the nationalised transport undertakings should beextended.    As in the case of other nationalised industries, theMinister&apos;s main charge will be for overall coordination and forsecuring the general efficiency of the industries in accordance withhis responsibility to Parliament for them.    He will continue todischarge these responsibilities through his powers of appointment and of general direction, ana his control of aevelopment,investment and finance.    His special duties in respect of safety,  training ana research will continue.-o-
oNationalised Transport Advisory Council31.    The Nationalised Transport Advisory Council&apos;s main responsi-bility will he to advise the Minister on questions referred to it by him relating to the coordination of the nationalised transport undertakings and on questions of policy.    It will also be availableto advise the Minister in the exercise of his responsibilitiestowards the particular undertakings including appointments,  finance and development.    The Council will have no executive or supervisoryfunctions.32.    The Nationalised Transport Advisory Council will consist ofthe Chairmen of the Boards of British Railways, London Transport,British Transport Docks,  Inland Waterways Authority, and the holding Company,    Other members will be added,  drawn from outsidethe nationalised transport undertakings.    The Minister willordinarily act as Chairman of the Council.APPOINTMENTS33o    All appointments to the major boards will be made by theMinister of Transport.    Certain other appointments will be subjectto his approval.3h.    In making appointments zo  the various Boards the minister will have regard to the special contribution which can be madeby those with Trade Union experience.    It is essential to use this experience in the management of industries,  such as theRailways, where manpower plays so large a part.35.    The Government consider it important that,  so far aspossible,  the nationalised transport undertakings should producetheir own leaders.    Promotion from within the undertakings tothe highest levels should. be within the grasp of those whoprove themselves capable.    In particular,  there should be muchgreater opportunities in future for those in all parts of therailway service to make their way to the top.    At the outset,however,  some major posts may have to be filled from outside.-9-
FINANCE36. A far reaching financial reconstruction is necessary to dealboth with the serious financial state of the railways and becauseof the changes proposed in the organisation.FINANCIAL RECONSTRUCTION37o    The financial situation of the Commission and the railways(as indicated in paragraphs   3  and   6  above)  is so serious thatthey cannot now carry on without large scale support from theExchequer.    Financial reconstruction has therefore becomeimperative.    The expectation that the Commission,   ana morespecifically the railways, will be able to meet in full theirexisting liabilities is now unrealistic.    A drastic scaling down of debt is urgently needed to give the railways a fresh start.3o.    The plan of financial reconstruction now proposed is of an interim character.    This is inevitable in view of the uncertainprospects.    The railways are in -che mi^st of a large modernisationprogramme,  of which the financial results are yet to be seen:it will take time also to reap the benefits of the new organisationand of the greater freedom of action which the Government proposefor the railways.    The objective of the financial reconstructionis to find a &quot;working basis for the railways over the next fiveyears and to lay the foundations for financial recovery.39o    Accordingly the Government put  forward the followingproposalso    The figures quoted are based upon the  positionrecorded in the Commission&apos;s last Balance Sheet onDecember 31st,  IS 59,  and will have to be worked out indetail later.    Nevertheless,   they give a broad indication of the general size and nature of the problem and theaction proposed.Capital LiabilitieskO.    The net capital liabilities of the Commission at31st December 1959 amounted to approximately  2000M.,  of-10-
owhich  12+OOM.  consisted of British transport Stock in the handsof the public and  6O0M. of advances from the Minister ofTransport:  and it is with these liabilities that the proposedreconstruction is primarily concerned.2+1.    Some  LOOM,  of the  2000M.   capital liabilities areattributable to the non-railway activities of the commission which,   in the main,  have been self-supporting.    Responsibilityfor this amount of debt will,  in effect, be transferred to theappropriate new boards.    The debt in each case will be based onthe book values of the assets transferred.U2.    The balance some 81600M.,  relates to the railways.    Of this,some  2+0OM.  is attributable to losses which have accumulated between1955 and 1959 and have been financed mainly by Exchequer advances.There is,  in the Government&apos;s view,  no prospect of these lossesever being recovered,,    They propose,  therefore,  that this amountshould be written off ana the outstanding nebt reduced accordingly,2+3.    After this  2+OOIvi.  of accumulated losses has been written off(para.2+2)  1,2Q0M.  of capital liabilities is left.    The government propose that,  of this sum  i+OOM.  - equivalent to  the written downhook value of the railways&apos;  investment since modernisation began in 1955 - should continue to rank as an interest-bearing loan onnormal terms.2+2+0    The remainder ( BOOM.) would be placed to SuspenseAccount and would carry neither fixed interest nor fixedrepayment obligations.    The amount and treatment of this .Account will ha subject to review from time to time,  in thelight of developments and in particular of a careful review which will have to be made of the book value of assetsacquired up to ana including 1955&quot;    Amounts may well haveto be written off in respect of ascertained capital losses,(including losses in respect of assets which becomeobsolete as modernisation proceeus).-11-
The existence of the Suspense Account, however, will enable theExchequer to obtain some return if railway finances improvesufficiently.      The possibility cannot, however, be ruled out that much of the amount placed in Suspense may well ultimately have to be accounted lost and written off.1+5*        These proposals for capital reconstruction of the British-Transport Commission are summarised in the following TableSummary of British Transport Commission *s CapitalLiabilities and Government&apos;s Proposals for ReconstructionOtherActivitiesRailways M*  M.Capital Liabilities (after deducting Capital RedemptionFund investments) 1,600 1+00 2,000(paragraphs 1+0 and 1+1 )PROPOSALSDebt to be written off on accountof Revenue Losses (paragraph 1+2) 1+00 1+00Debt to be carried in Suspense 8 00                                    800(paragraph 1+4)Interest-bearing Capital Liabilitiesto be retained 1-1-00               1+00                800(paragraphs 1+3) : &apos; ;.- : &apos; -TOTAL: 1 ,600 1+00 2,000Effect on British Transport Stock and other capital, liabilities1+6.        The Treasury will assume all responsibilities for existing british Transport Stock,      The rights of stockholders will thereforebe fully safeguarded.     At the same time appropriate amounts of debt to the Exchequer will.be assumed by the new Boards.Consequences of the Capital Reconstruction1+7 o        The effect of these proposals is that the railways would begiven immediate relief in respect of obligations to the extent of 1200M., of which  1+00M, would be written off, and  800M. put tosuspense.      While the Government regard these drastic measures as- 12 -secret
required to deal realistically with the existing financial si tuttipn,  they also think it most desirable thattheir nature and size should he fully appreciated. Their effect willhe.to take from the shoulders of the railway undertaking(a)  the whole burden of accumulated losses and (b) thegreater part of the liability relating to its capital value prior to the beginning of modernisation in 1955?except insofar as at a later date the undertaking may beable to resume the burden.    But these heavy liabilities,though removed from the shoulders of the railways, willnot have ceased to exist.    They will only have been trans-ferred to the public in another form since they will fall upon the&apos; Exchequer.Future Revenue Prospects and Objectives2+3.    The capital reorganisation outlined above,  will bythe writing off of  2+0OM.  and the carrying of  800M.  tosuspense provide an immediate relief to the railways ofover  2+0 M.  annual interest.    They will, however,  haveto pay interest on :-(a) The reduced capital liability of 2+0OM.  referred to in paragraph 2+3 ;(b) New borrowings for capital expenditure;(c) Certain other liabilities,  e.g.superannuation funds and Savings Bankdeposits (paragraph 55).At the end of the next five years the total charge underthese heads may amount to some  60-70M.  a year,  depending on the level of new borrowings and the rate of interest.Before the railways can meet these charges they willhave to eliminate their operating loss,  now running at atotal of  60M.   a year.-13-SECRET
1+9.        The Government recognise that the task before the Railwaysof eliminating the present operating loss and moving to a surplus of 60-70M. a year within the next five years will be very formidable.They will therefore keep the financial position of the Railwaysunder very close review and will make a special review of theposition at the end of the five years.      They will&apos; establish   inconsultation with the railway administration targets of financialperformance which the Railways should aim to achieve from year to year over the five-year period.50.        It is still clear on a realistic appraisal of the situation that large sums will have to be provided from the Exchequer duringthe interim period to meet railway deficits;    and the Government will seek the necessary powers.Productivity and Manpower51 .        If the railways are to regain solvency, and provide a fairlivelihood for their workers,  efficiency of operation and the most economic use of manpower are crucial:    thus they must be a specialconcern of the new Railways Board.      As the Select Committee on nationalised Industries noted, work study - which has been success-fully applied In a number of fields - should be extended far beyondthe 6 per cent, of railway staff so far covered.      The british railways Productivity Council has already considered this, and theGovernment have welcomed the recent  joint appeal by the employers&apos;and the Union sides of the industry for cooperation by all concerned.Railway Pares and Charges52.        Increases in railway fares and charges must, where and whenappropriate, make their due contribution towards meeting railwaycosts.- 1j+ -
53.    The foregoing special arrangements for the remission of debt and the writing off of liability apply only to the railways.The  other Statutory Boards will be expected to conduct their affairs in accordance with the general system applicable toBoards of this character,  that is taking one year with another,to balance their accounts.    Special aid may,  however, have to begiven in the initial years to the Inland Waterways.5h.    The Holding Company is in a different category,  since itwill hold shares in businesses which are operating in the samefield as private enterprise.    These businesses,  like similarbusinesses in the private sector, may be expected to yield agood return.    Subject to regulations which affect private aswell as public businesses of these kinds it will be the dutyof the holding company to secure the best possible results forthe public purse.    The profits of the Holding Company group will accrue to  the  Exchequer in the form of dividends andshould be some offset to losses on other nationalised transport undertakings.Other Financial Matters55-    There are  certain other liabilities not mentioned in the table in paragraph LuT,  including liabilities in respect of savings bank deposits and superannuation funo.s - which amountedto about  I4OOM. at 31st December 1959 and are attributable mainly to the railway So    The Government do not propose any relief from these liabilities for the undertakings.    The Government have noted the observations of the Select Committee on nationalised industries (in paras.150 to 15U of their Report) on the investment of savings bank deposits and superannuation funds in the british transport Commission&apos;s undertaking.    They are considering withthe Commission what changes might be made in the present arrange-ments.    This consideration,  of course,  in no way affects thesecurity of the deposits and the rights of the beneficiaries, whichwill continue unimpaired.    Consideration is also being given tothe scale of depreciation and obsolescence provisions which shouldbe made by the various new undertakings.-15-
SECRET A r&quot; foCOMMERCIAL FREEDOM56.        In this reorganisation and financial reconstruction it wouldnot he reasonable to leave the railways subject to out-of-daterestrictions on their commercial activities.   .Fares and Charges57.        The present restrictions on the ability of the railways to adjust quickly and adequately their freight charges and passenger fares are, in the Governments view, no longer justified in presentcompetitive conditions.58.       The railways will therefore be freed from statutory control .over their charges except rail and bus fares in the London passenger transport Area where the London Transport Executive and british railways have a virtual monopoly of public transport.      This change will substantially reduce the functions of the Transport Tribunal.rFreehold and Leasehold Property59.        The present statutory restrictions on the development ofproperty by the nationalised transport undertakings will be suitablyrelaxed.Pipelines60.        The Commission already have power to accommodate, by way of leases, pipelines on their property.      Subject to any general legislation on pipelines which the Government may wish to promote,it is proposed to give certain of the new undertakings, particularlyRailways, powers to lease, provide and operate pipelines on their property.Coastal Shipping61.        The Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933,  and the Transport Acts of191+7 and 1953 contain provisions protecting coastal shipping fromcompetition from inland transport.      The Government are at presentexamining these provisions in the light of the need to give greatercommercial freedom to the railways and of the interest of the coastal shipping industry.-16-SECRET
- 17 -LEGISLATION62.        The Governments proposals for the new structure, for financialreconstruction, and for freedom of commercial operation will requiremajor legislation.      Consultations and preparation will take sometime to complete.      The Government propose to introduce thenecessary Bill in the next Session of Parliament.      Should interimlegislation he required, it will he introduced.CONCLUSION63.        Her Majesty&apos;s Government have, throughout their considerationof these problems,  sought to find practical answers to thedifficulties with which the nationalised transport undertakings are confronted.      The Government have been guided solely by their concern to establish what is best for the industry and best for the country.They put these proposals forward as providing the best opportunityfor the various undertakings and especially the railways, to becomeefficient and soundly based.
