COMFIDEMT8AL . ^^   O(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 167 COPY NO.C&apos;l16th November, I960CABINETGENERAL GRANT FOR THE SECOND GRANT PERIOD (1961-63)Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the joint paper by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and myself (C. (60) 166) sets out the expenditure on general grant- services by thelocal authorities in England and Wales and the amount of grant which will be payable by the Excheuqer in respect of those services for the next two years.The Scottish negotiations have not yet progressed far enough for the parallelfigures to be present.   But the general outline is sufficiently clear to bring out the following totals:-(a) England and Wales - population 45.755 millions;(b) Scotland - population    5. 208 millions.	1959-60 Actual &amp; millions	1960-61*   millions	1961-62   millions	1962-63   millionsEstimated     (a) relevant expenditure (b)	707.5 80.6	769.8 87.0	818.2 91.1	851.1 93.9TOTAL	788.1	856.8	909.3	945.general        (a) Grant Cb)	402. e 51.3	429.0 54.4	454.0 5S.85	472.0 58.6TOTAL	453.3	483.4	510.85	530.6*Th.ese are the estimated figures of relevant, expenditure andgrant after re-opening in 1959(it will be seen that Scotland will receive about10 per cent more grant per head of population thanEngland and W al es.)-1-
2.   These figures are, a minimum commitment.   We shall have to spend more in 1962-63.   There is a prospect of another salary increase for teachers, whichwjuld mean re-opening the grant for 1962-63j   and other pay increases too.I am advised that we must expect to have to make an extra grant of about 15 millions for England and Wales alone.3.   So it goes on - increases in grants every year:-(a)   England and Wales1960-61  27 millions1961-62  25 millions1962-63  13 millions *  15 millions, i. e.   33 millions.This allows nothing for the Anderson Report (for which the local authoritieswant an extra high grant) or fcr any further policy  improvements in   educationor in health and welfare during the next two years.4.   The size of the grant follows from the present estimates of the relevant expenditure by the local authorities.   For education (England and Wales) this expenditure was  598 millions in 1959-60, and is estimated at  690 millions in 1961-62 - from last year to next year an increase of  92 millions, or nearly16 per cent.   If teachers&apos; pay goes up, this rate of increase will continue in1962-63.5.   The number of school children is not expected to rise during this period.And the increase in the number of teachers in the schools will be interrupted,because of the transition to three-year teacher-training.   The big elements are:-(i) The big rise in teachers&apos; pay (and other local authority pay).(ii) The cost of bringing into use new school buildings (-  -million placesa year) and other costs (e.g. , loan charges) arising from the investment programme.(iii) The rapid expansion of further education (10 per cent per year in thenumber of teachers and 13 per cent per year in other costs).(iv) The growth of teacher-training, youth services, etc.6.   For health and welfare, relevant expenditure is estimated to rise from 63 millions in 1959-60 to  74 millions in 1961-62 - an increase proportionatelyas great as that in education.   There are new services in process of developmenthere (notably mental health) but the figures reflect all-round expansion.7.   I have accepted these figures because I understand that they are a fairreflection of policies to which the Government have become committed.   but these expenditures are growing much faster than our resources.   I am boundto ask my colleagues whether they would have accepted this rate of expansionif they had seen the bill in advance.   Moreover, these expenditures have sucha momentum that we are already heavily committed further ahead than 1963by the way in which our policies are developing.S.
