Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1960C. (60) 172 Copy No.  6 523rd November, 1960CABINETCHANNEL tunnel memorandum by the Minister of TransportEarlier consideration was authorised on 18th February, 1960, to inform the Channel Tunnel study group that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to look sympathetically atthe tunnel project if a feasible and commercially viable scheme capable of attractingthe necessary capital were produced (C.C. (60) 10th Conclusions, Minute 6). the study Group were not told this since, shortly afterwards, they presented a Reportshowing they were looking for a great deal of financial support from Governments.2. A t the request of the Prime Minister, I arranged for the Report to be examined by Officials. Their full report was circulated to the Economic PolicyCommittee.3.   Officials reached these Conclusions:(a) The tunnel is probably a feasible engineering and commercial proposition,although there are necessarily uncertainties in the Study Group&apos;estimates of capital cost and annual revenues.(b) The tunnel would probably bring appreciable political advantages, andsome economic and trading benefits.  It presents no defence difficulty.(c) The promoters are seeking financial assurances and privileges from theUnited Kingdom and French Governments which are quiteinappropriate to a private venture.(d) Investment in a tunnel (estimated at some  130 millions over five years)will increase the demands, which in any case will grow considerably overthe next few years, on the resources available for investment in transport facilities.(e) The promoters&apos; proposals make too many demands on Governments forspecial financial assistance and are unacceptable as they stand.4.   These Conclusions were considered by the Economic Policy CommitteeOn 2nd November the Committee agreed that the Government could not accept the present financial proposals of the promoters of the Channel Tunnel.But I was asked, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary, to circulate to theCabinet a brief for talks with the French Government.5.   French consideration is probably not so far advancedWe believe that French officials have examined the economic aspects of the project and will now tackle the policy aspects with representatives of the study group. The French Government may not yet have reached conclusions about government guarantees, tax exemptions, &amp;c.58078
6.   But talks are worthwhileIf the French agree with us on finance, they may try to put the onus ofrejecting the Study Group&apos;s proposals on us. But we should exchange views andlearn what we can of French intentions before we hold further talks with the study Group. At this stage, the Foreign Secretary and I think that talks shouldbe exploratory and without commitment.7.   I recommend this brief for Officials:(a) They should use the report referred to above as their main guide.(b) They should discuss with the French those aspects of the Study Group&apos;sreport on which the French have reached provisional conclusions.They should say that they are ready to discuss other subjects when theFrench are.(c) They should not disclose our view that the present financial proposals areunacceptable. But they should leave no doubt that there are serious difficulties over the guarantees, commitments, and special privileges inrespect of tax exemptions, &amp;c, which are sought from Governments bythe Study Group. They should not attempt to forecast Ministers&apos; views,but should emphasise the desirability of leaving it to the Study group to develop revised financial proposals.(d) They should try to discover some idea of the French time-table with aview to arranging any further joint discussions.(e) They should report to Ministers before any further discussion with the study group.5.   We must satisfy public interest in the talksIf the French agree to discussions, we must decide what we tell the Study Group,the Channel Tunnel Parliamentary Group and the Press. The Foreign secretary and I think that both Governments should say that the Study Group&apos;s proposalsraise a number of difficult problems. These concern both the United Kingdom andthe French Governments. Officials are simply continuing their consideration ofthese problems. Reference to difficult problems might counteract undue optimismwhich might otherwise result from the decision to hold the talks.9.   I invite my colleagues:(a) To endorse the conclusion of the Economic Policy Committee on the present financial proposals of the Study Group (see paragraph 4 above).(b) To approve the opening of discussions, at official level, with the FrenchGovernment on the lines proposed in paragraph 7 above.(c) To approve the proposals on publicity in paragraph 8 above.E.
