SEC Re I65C. (60) 17525th November, I960CABINETTHE ECONOMIC situation memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn his paper (C. (60) .168) the Chancellor of the Exchequer pointsout that I have recently announced certain measures designed to stimulateexports.   They will have some effect, though one cannot say for certainhow great the effect will be or how soon it will be felt.   But in any case it is clear that more needs to be done.Can we compel people to export?In a free economy there is no easy means of doing this other thanby restricting the home market.   As we no longer allocate supplies oflabour or materials we have no sanction on which we can rely, and in theabsence of a sanction the setting of export targets seems to be a veryunprofitable enterprise.   In general we are, by our restrictions on home demand, forcing people to turn more to export markets just as we havebeen moderating the flow of imports.   But it isa clumsy and unsatisfactorymethod, to which there are both economic and political limits.I hope that during the negotiations between the members of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G. A. T. T. ) we shll agree to considerable reductions, on a reciprocal basis, in industrial tariffs.This will both ease the way for some exporters and create greatercompetition for some inanufacturers in the home market.   It should be ahelp but it will take time to work.Apart from this I do not see any means of compelling people to export more.Can we induce people to export more ?By this I mean financial inducements in the form of subsidiesor tax remissions related to export turnover.I am convinced that these measures would be undesirable, andthis is the view of the great majority of British industry.   A subsidyrace is one that we should not win.   As for tax remissions, it would bevery difficult to work out an acceptable scheme, because it is oftenimpossible to say who really deserves the credit for any given volume of exports, e. g. how much is due to the final assembler and how much to thecomponent manufacturer, how much to the producer, how much to theseller.   But in any case we are precluded from introducing such schemesnot only by the G. A. T. T.  but also by the terms of the European &quot;Non-Aggression Pact&quot; in the ee matters, which we negotiated with the support ofthe Federation of British Industries and which British industry would not wish to see abrogated.copy no. 0 Cj-1-secret
All we can do i3 to encourage and assist exportersThere are many ways in which the Government can help, sometimesdirectly, sometimes in collaboration with industry.The services of the Export Credits Guarantee Department are of greatimportance to exports, though it is sometimes overlooked that, important as they are, they only cover some 20 per cent of our total export effort.I have recently introduced, with the Chancellor&apos;s agreement,, a number of improvements in this Department&apos;s services and I am satisfied that, intheir proper field of credit insurance, they now provide for Britishexporters facilities that in general are at least as good as those enjoyed by our competitors.   The parallel problem of the provision of finance,particularly for the lengthening credit terms now demanded for heavy capital equipment, has not yet been solved and I am in touch with theChancellor about possible solutions.The Board of Trade provide a wide range of services toexporters, ranging from commercial intelligence to the support of overseasfairs, or the invitation of foreign business visitors to this country.   Withthe Chancellor&apos;s help I am expanding and improving these services.   Themain problem seems to be to ensure that all businessmen realise theadvantages of making use of them.There are some joint activities for Government and industry.One example is the recently formed European Export Council, whichI hope will produce   results as good as those produced by the DollarExport Council.   Another example is the various ways in which smallfirms can be helped to export e. g. by co-operative action or by establishedfirms lending their facilities to new exporters.   Here the main work hasto be done by industry, though we are giving them an impulse.There is a definite psychological problem in the tax treatmentof businessmen who travel abroad.   The sums involved are minimalbut the irritation is real and I am discussing this with the Chancellor.SUMMARYThere are many ways in which the Government can help and encourage exports.   We are constantly trying to expand and improve -therr .But we must face the fact that these are all marginal improvements.   I donot believe there is any easy and dramatic move that we can make to improveexports.   The fundamental problem is one of business psychology.   unless and until we can drive home to all in industry the need for a greater exporteffort, we shall just not succeed.   This calls for a sustained campaign ofeducation in which Ministers and leading industrialists must work together.We shall be accused of exhortation but we must not fear this accusation.Already, in fact, interest in exports has been very greatly stimulated, asis witnessed by the great increase in enquiries coming to the Board of Tradeoffices at home and abroad.   We must press on.   I can see no solution toour export problem unless it is based on a different outlook to the whole problem amongst all those - be they employers or workpeople, in industry -who have to take the decisions that in practice determine the amount of our export sales.   The Government will have to play their part, in this process by convincing industry, through their general fiscal and economic policy,that it is necessary, and also worthwhile, to respond to this educationalcampaign.Board of Trade, S.W.1. k&quot; M*25th November, I960 -2-SECkET
