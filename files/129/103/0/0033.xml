1^1CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December I960C. (60) 183 Copy No.    586th December, I960CABINETORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION ANDDEVELOPMENTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at the Western Summit meeting in December 1959, the Americans suggestedthat the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) of whichthey and the Canadians are only &quot; associate &quot; members might be refashioned into an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (O.E.C.D.) withthemselves and the Canadians as full members and with a new constitution totake account of the changes in the economic climate which have taken place sinceO.E.E.C. was first set up in 1948. We welcomed this suggestion, as did the otherGovernments concerned, and directions were given for the necessary preparatory work to be put in hand. My predecessor gave the Cabinet a progress report onthis work on 21st July (C.C. (60) 44th Conclusions, Minute 6). It has now reachedthe point where a draft Convention for the O.E.C.D. has been agreed at the official level, subject to a few outstanding points of detail, and the text is now ready for signature if the Governments concerned approve it.2. There will be a meeting in Paris on 13th and 14th December at whichthe President of the Board of Trade and I will represent Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The purpose of this meeting v/ill be to settle the outstanding points, to approve the draft Convention and to sign it.3. Since it was first put forward at the Western Summit a year ago, her majesty&apos;s Government have consistently supported the idea of transformingO.E.E.C. into O.E.C.D. Most if not all European countries, including ourselves and our partners in the European Free Trade Association, attach great importanceto creating a successor body to O.E.E.C. which will carry on its traditions and actas a focal point for economic co-operation on a Europe-wide indeed on an atlantic scale. They and we are anxious that we should not lose this opportunityof creating an up-to-date Organisation in which we can work together more closely with the Americans and Canadians and so strengthen the economic ties betweenWestern Europe and North America.4. The most important task of the new Organisation will be discussion of member countries&apos; economic policies and their impact on other countries. its second important task will concern the less-developed member and non-member countries, including consultation on the ways and means of assisting them todevelop, and expanding and improving the flow of long-term development finance.O.E.E.C. will also have a role in the field of trade though less important than wasthat of O.E.E.C. to examine the general trade policy and existing trade practicesof each member country.5. These are the main objectives and we should continue our support of them.There are, of course, some differences of view between some of the european countries and the United States for example, about the trade functions of the new organisation and these will no doubt be further discussed at the ministerial meeting next month, although they do not affect the text of the draft convention which has been generally agreed.6. I should be glad of the Cabinefs authority to proceed on the above lines and for the President of the Board of Trade and myself to sign the Convention ofthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on behalf of her majesty&apos;s Government.S.
