(60) 187 COPY NO.   gjg13th December, I960CABINETCOMMONWEALTH YOUTH TRUSTNote by the Secretary of State for CommonwealthRelationsI annex for consideration by the Cabinet a note of Ministers&apos;Conclusions on the Commonwealth Youth Trust.I ask the Cabinet to approve:-(a) the recommendations in the note of Ministers1Conclusions;(b) the draft Government announcement attachedto the note.D.Commonwealth Relations Office,S. W. 1.12th December, I960.ANNEXCOMMONWEALTH YOUTH TRUSTNote of ministers conclusions the Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Gerald Tempterrecommended the establishment of a Commonwealth Youth Trust, whoseobject would be to strengthen the bonds between Commonwealth countriesthrough their younger people.    Where possible it was to operate throughexisting agencies;   where these were lacking it was to institute new ones.One of its main roles in the first ten years was the building of a CommonwealthYouth City in London to house 5,000 students at a capital cost of about 10 millions.    The Templer Committee thought that the Trusfs other activities would involve an expenditure of some  400,000 per annum for-1-SECRET
the first ten years and  200,000 thereafter.     This money was to be raisedlargely by public subscription.2.        Ministers were generally in agreement with the recommendationsof officials that the Templer Committee&apos;s proposals could not be accepted as they stood, at any rate at the present time.    They agreed with theTempler Committee that more accommodation is urgently needed for overseastudents in this country, but they thought that the Committee&apos;s solution ofthe problem - the building of a Commonwealth Youth City in London - was somewhat misconceived.    In the first place it would be extremely expensiveand would only deal with the problem in London, whereas at least half the oversea students are at universities and colleges outside London where the accommodation problem is just as acute.    In the second place, it wouldseem unsound in principle to concentrate oversea students in one enormousemporium divorced not only from their particular college, but from theirEnglish counterparts and from English people generally.     Oversea studentsought to be housed for at any rate the first year of their stay in the UnitedKingdom in hostels which are much more closely integrated with their particular college;  and furthermore these hostels should not be exclusivelycomposed of oversea students, but should have at least fifty per cent oftheir residents from the United Kingdom.3.        Ministers therefore agreed with the recommendation by officialsthat, instead of financing a Commonwealth Youth City, the Governmentshould embark on an immediate programme of hostels designed to provide5,000 new places for oversea students over the next four or five years.This is estimated to cost  3 millions in capital and  275,000 a year inrunning expenses.    So far as possible, it is hoped that these hostels couldbe integrated with the existing programme of new hostels for United Kingdomstudents.4.        So far as the setting up of a Commonwealth Youth Trust isconcerned, this stands or falls by the chances of obtaining enough money from private sources.    Unofficial advice from industry is that firms (whowill be the main source of this finance) are most unlikely to be willing tocontribute towards a Trust on anything approaching this scale.    In anycase, owing to other appeals in the same general field, it would not bedesirable to launch one for a Commonwealth Youth Trust for at leastanother eighteen months.5.        For a number of reasons the establishment of a Trust financedlargely from the Exchequer could not be justified.    There is therefore no alternative to deferring this particular recommendation until it appearsthat the prospects of an appeal for funds would be more successful.Ministers thought that the position should be examined again in anothereighteen months.6.        The existence of the Templer Committee&apos;s report is fairly wellknown and the Duke of Edinburgh is believed to be sympathetic with thegeneral aims and purposes.    Ministers did not think the report should bepublished;   it was written on a confidential basis and contains some material which could be embarrassing.     But the Government are committed to make
dieS\C a134a statement about it at the beginning of the new session.    Ministersrecommend that this should be on the lines of the attached draft (Appendix).November, I960APPENDIXDRAFT GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENTQuestionTo ask the Prime Minister whether he will make a statement on thereport of the Templer Committee on the setting up of a Commonwealth YouthTrust.AnswerYes, Sir.    A Committee was set up in February, 1959, under theChairmanship of Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer to make a confidentialreport to Ministers on certain proposals previously outlined for setting up a commonwealth Youth Trust.    I should like to pay tribute to Sir Gerald Templeand all those who were associated with him on the Committee, and to recordHer MajestyTs Governments deep appreciation of their willingness to devote so much of their time to this important task.Their report recommends that a Trust should be established whosefundamental object would be to strengthen Commonwealth bonds through itsyounger people.    The Trust would administer funds to be raised mainly by public appeal.     While sympathetic towards the proposal, the Governmentare advised that such an appeal would not be a practical proposition at this time;  they propose to keep the matter under review and to revert to itwhen it is judged that an appeal would be more likely to succeed.The Government are indebted to the Templer Committee for drawingtheir attention to the urgent need to provide increased living accommodation for oversea students in the United Kingdom.    The Government have examined the matter in the light of the Templer Committee&apos;s report and have decided,as a matter of urgency, to embark on a programme of 5,000 new hostelplaces for oversea students in various parts of the country over and above those now available.    In addition the programme will provide for a numberof new or enlarged British Council social and cultural centres for Common-wealth and oversea students in various towns where the oversea studentpopulation has greatly expanded in recent years.    The programme will bespread over a period and will cost about  3 millions.     The government intend to take advantage of the knowledge and experience of organisationsin the student welfare field which are active in the towns in which these facilities are to be provided, and they hope that these organisations andother interested persons will share in meeting the expenses of running thehostels as well as in meeting their capital cost.    It is intended that the
British Council should act on behalf of the Government in opening urgentdiscussions with these organisations.The Government are also prepared to consider on their meritsapplications for assistance from public funds for specific organisations andprojects in the field of Commonwealth youth, and they hope that privatesupport for such will not be lacking even in the absence of a Trustspecifically concerned with this work.November, I960
