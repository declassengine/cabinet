GRANTS TO STUDENTS:   PARENTAL MEANS TESTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartmentOn 6th October, the Cabinet asked that the Education PolicyCommittee should consider a scale of parental contributions which mightbe adopted as an alternative to abolition of the means test (accompaniedby withdrawal of the income tax allowance   for students) as recommendedby the majority of the Committee on Grants to Students (AndersonCommittee) (C. C. (60) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 5).2.   The Education Policy Committee are satisfied, after very full consideration, that the arguments against abolition of the means testare decisive.   Apart from its cost, it would not help the right people.:nearly one-half of the additional cost would benefit the one-sixth ofaward-holders whose parents are in the top income groups.3.   With the authority of the Cabinet the Minister of Education announced at the Conservative Party Conference in October that there would bea &quot;radical revision&quot; of the present means test.   With the help of a working Party of officials th e Committee have devised a plan embodyinga scale of parental contributions and certain other elements which weare satisfied would fulfil this undertaking.   The means test provides fora contribution of 8 per cent of &quot;scale income&quot; about  600 per annum,starting at  700 plus 10 per cent of any scale income over  1,400, and provides for a minimum award of  50 in all cases.   This scale is only slightly less generous than the minority recommendation of theAnderson Committee and avoids the disadvantages inherent in theAnderson minority scale.   The plan as a whole is in some respects more generous than the Anderson minority, though less so in respect ofvacation grants.   We are agreed that it should be applied to all studentsat universities and to those taking comparable courses of further education and those attending teacher tiaining colleges.   On this basis the additional cost of the scheme in the next academic year would beabout  10 millions more than the present scheme with the existingmeans test.   The additional cost of abolition (with comparable &quot;extras&quot;)would be about  15 millions.4.   The application of the scheme to Scotland requires further considera-tion.   There are obvious difficulties in not applying it equally to scotland as to England and Wales;   but there is some inequality at present and toadopt complete parity would not only cost about  1 million a year (includedin the  10 millions referred to above) but would introduce certainanomalies which require further examination.* o[THIS DOCUMENT    IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.

5.   I regret having been obliged to circulate this memorandum at such short notice, but the Education Policy Committee regard it as important that an announcement of the Government&apos;s intentionsshould be made tomorrow, 1st December, in advance of an organisedcampaign for abolition to be launched next week by the National Unionof Students.6.   We therefore invite the Cabinet to agree to the adoption of thescale of parental contributions referred to in paragraph 3 and to authorisethe Minister of Education to announce the Governments intentions,in general terms, in answer to a Parliamentary Question tomorrow.R.
