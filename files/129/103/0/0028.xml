C. (60) 17829th November, I960SUPPORT FOR GERMAN FORCES THROUGH THENORTH ATLANTIC ALLIANCEMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceBackgroundMy colleagues may have been puzzled by newspaper reports that theGermans are about to establish bases here.     The reports are incorrect.2.   On 25th March, I960, the Defence Committee agreed thepolicy which we shcrjld. follow in respect of requests by the Federal GermanGovernment for logistic assistance.3.   Subsequently at the meeting of the Defence Ministers of the north atlantic Alliance it was made clear that the problem was essentially of amilitary nature and that requests for assistance should be sponsored by themilitary authorities of the Alliance.    We undertook to consider anyrequests by countries in the Alliance for facilities at the Hebrides GuidedMissile range, and to consider also what we could do to help the germans in other ways, if we were asked to do so.COPY NO.CABINETPresent Position4.   In the intervening months various general logistic studies have beenprepared by the military authorities of the Alliance, which will come beforethe North Atlantic Council at their meeting later this month as a series of reports by the Military Committee.    These are not expected to lead .directly to any significant solution of the German difficulties.5.   Concurrently, the Germans have concluded bilateral agreements with other countries - e.g. , France, the Netherlands - for the provisionof training areas and depots.6.   They have also quite recently followed up our own offer to help withan enquiry through our respective delegations to the North atlantic alliance about what facilities we might be able to offer for training,storage and naval repairs.     We have told them, through the same channels,that we would wish to have some detail of their requirements before wecan consider their request.    A few days ago the German delegation tothe Alliance informed our own that their authorities would not be in aposition to give us any definite indication of their needs until January.
7.   The present reports are stated to emanate from the German Ministryof Defence.     We had no warning that the Germans proposed to give anypublicity to this matter:  on the contrary, as the whole problem is still under diocussion in the Alliance, we justifiably assumed that they wouldtreat it with discretion.    They have received no information from usabout what facilities we might offer,    I have sent a personal message tothe Federal German Minister of Defence, Dr. Strauss, deprecating the publicity and expressing the hope that nothing further will be said in Bonn.Re co mm endation8.   I invite the Cabinet to note the present position.H. W.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.29th November, I960.-2-
