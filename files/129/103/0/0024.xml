Printed for the Cabinet. November 1960C. (60) 174 Copy No. g 724th November, 1960CABINETHIRE PURCHASE controls memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the hire purchase controls, which prescribe a minimum down payment anda maximum period of repayment, were introduced as part of our general policyof restricting credit.2. Hire purchase controls have many disadvantages. They are difficult tomaintain in the face of determined evasion. Their results are difficult to predict.They are apt to have very sharp effects on individual industries (though this is admittedly the obverse of the fact that they are the most rapidly acting measureswe can take in this field). Despite these disadvantages I fully agree that theyshould be part of our general policy of credit restraint at this time.3. I am concerned, however, with the extent to which they are having theireffects. I believe that in a number of industries, particularly the motor carindustry, the effect is quite disproportionate. Whereas the effect of creditrestrictions in general has been not to reduce consumer demand but merely toprevent a further expansion, in the case of those industries affected by hire purchaserestrictions there has been a very sharp contraction. There is, therefore, a casein equity for some relaxation.4. I believe that there is also an economic case. The psychological effects of the restrictions, combined with all the fuss that the manufacturers are makingabout them, are serious and have a cumulative effect. Consumer durables suchas motor cars and electric appliances are traditionally subject to considerablefluctuations for the obvious reason that people can so easily postpone the purchaseof things which, though attractive, are not essential and whose unit cost is high.The more the manufacturers complain, the more the customers are likely to postpone their purchases. There is, therefore, a definite danger of a downwardspiral developing. In particular, the motor car industry, which has such wideramifications, is suffering difficulties in the home market superimposed on a sharpsetback to exports. Production of motor cars, which in May of this year was49 per cent, up on 1959, in October was 18 per cent. down. The motor carindustry is bound to be subject to seasonal fluctuations but a fluctuation of this magnitude is something formidable.5. I feel, therefore, that the time has come to make some modest relaxation in the hire purchase restrictions in order to prevent a real deterioration in the motor car and other industries.6. The logical move would be to extend the period of repayment from two years to three years. I do not propose any reduction in the minimum deposit(20 per cent, in most cases, 10 per cent, in a few). This seems to me to be areasonable requirement. I do not see how you can build healthy industries onthe basis of a demand from consumers who are only prepared to pay initially anexiguous proportion of the true price of the article. But I think the lengtheningof the period of repayment would be helpful, though not spectacular, and wouldbe well received as being a genuine effort to help without going beyond the boundsof prudence.  It would be of most assistance to the motor industry but I do not58088THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
regard this as a serious criticism because among the industries affected the motor industry is both by far the largest and also the one with the best export record.An extension from two to three years would be of some help to the makers of television and radio, electrical appliances and furniture. They would be lesssatisfied than the motor manufacturers but frankly in view of their export recordI think they have the smallest claim on our sympathy.i 17. The argument against making a relaxation is our balance of payments position. I accept that this is serious. Export prospects look very disturbing.Imports continue at a high level and although we may perhaps gain some benefit from a relaxation in the rate of stock-building, this is too speculative to count on.If, therefore, relaxation in the hire purchase terms of the kind I propose wouldhave any adverse effect on our balance of payments, I would not propose it. ButI do not think this is the case. There is substantial slack now in these industries and there are large stocks. The taking up of this slack and the liquidation of these stocks would be unlikely to have any significant inflationary effect. I do not think there would be any noticeable effect on the rate of importing either raw materialsor finished articles, so long as the relaxation is a modest one. Equally I believe thatthe industries concerned would be able to supply all the export orders they are receiving. So far as the labour position is concerned, one must recognise though not necessarily state in public that despite short-time working in the motor industry no substantial amount of labour is moving into such things as general engineering or machine tools. The reasons are complex, e.g., the high rate of payeven on a short week in the motor industry, confidence that employment in theindustry will eventually rise again, and the relatively low proportion of skilled workers in the motor industry. But the fact remains that by maintaining the presentdegree of restriction we shall not in practice release any significant amount oflabour for industries with unfilled export orders.^ 8. I agree that any general relaxation at present would be entirely wrong.Equally, any spectacular improvement of conditions in the industries which byreason of hire purchase restrictions have suffered a disproportionate amount of damage would be unjustifiable. But I believe that a small relaxation would do no harm to the balance of payments and would provide a steadying factor in these industries, particularly the motor trade. For this reason I should advocate thatwe make a relaxation in the period of repayment while maintaining in their fullrigour our general credit restrictions. This would he entirely in accordance withthe facts of the present situation when we are seeing a continuation of great strainin the economy as a whole, combined with a very abrupt falling-off in the demand in particular sectors.9. If my colleagues agree that we should take this step I should like to announce at the same time one or two measures to tighten up the regulationsagainst certain forms of evasion that are of growing significance and which ifincluded could eventually undermine the controls in general.R. M.Board of Trade, S.W.1,23rd November, 1960.
