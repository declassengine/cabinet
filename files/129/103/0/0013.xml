Printed for the Cabinet.   November I960C. (60) 163 Copy No. g J10th November, 1960CABINET&apos; SUEZ FINANCE company memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Governments holding in the Suez Finance Company (formerly the suez canal Company) comprises shares and bonds which are together worth about 17 millions at current prices. Our shareholding represents about one-third ofthe total equity in the Company.2. By an Agreement with the Government of the United Arab Republic(U.A.R.) signed in April 1958, the Company renounced their assets in Egypt and accepted in part compensation  29 millions, to be paid in instalments, the last ofwhich falls due on 1st January, 1963. The Egyptians have so far paid 16-7 millions, leaving three instalments of  4-1 millions each to be paid.3. There is no reason of policy for the United Kingdom Government toretain their holding in the Company. The reasons for the original acquisition nolonger apply now that the Canal has been nationalised. The Company are nowin effect a miscellaneous management and investment trust with a widespreadportfolio; nearly half of their assets are held in francs, and less than a quarter in sterling. Moreover on present prices the dividend yield is only about 1 per cent.There is however a prospect of capital appreciation, particularly if thecompensation payments are made in full. This would not be a sufficient reason for continuing to hold the shares indefinitely, though it affects the question of the timing of the sale. Further, our holding could be a positive source of embarrassment to us if, for example, the U.A.R. Government defaulted on one ofthe outstanding instalments of compensation, or in connection with the Company&apos;sassets in North Africa.4. In the past two years there have been enquiries from British and american interests (as well as one recently from Zurich) about our intentions. We havereplied that no decision to sell has been taken but that the enquirers&apos; interest willbe noted against the possibility of a sale subsequently. On one of these occasionsin June 1959 the then Chancellor of the Exchequer considered that it would be agood thing to get rid of this holding if we could, and the Treasury have sinceproceeded on the assumption that the Government would dispose of the holdingat a suitable time.5. The question of timing has however presented some difficulties, since inrecent months certain factors have pointed against any immediate sale. Inparticular the shares have tended to be under-valued, partly because the investingpublic have not been well informed about the Company&apos;s activities and generalsoundness. The view so far held has been that the appropriate time for disposalof the holding would be after rather than before the end of 1960, though clearly in a major disposal operation of this kind the precise date would depend on market conditions and other considerations.6. While I would agree, other things being equal, that we ought now to beprepared to dispose of our holding as soon as a favourable opportunity presentsitself, there is one consideration that gives me pause.  This is the risk that the58036
receipt of a large sum from the sale of our holding might stir up pressure to supplement the  27 - 5 millions compensation fund provided by the Anglo-Egyptiansettlement for former owners of property in Egypt.7. Payments to claimants out of this fund are proceeding rather slowly. Thereason is (as the claimants are aware) that the U.A.R. Government have been sodilatory in returning sequestrated property that the owners have only recently beenable, to formulate claims for loss and damage. There has thus been only a smallinterim distribution from the fund so far. A proposal for a second, and muchbigger, distribution is now under examination. The final distribution will probably not be known for two years or so.8. We have to consider the implications of this time-table for the proposalto dispose of our holding in the Suez Finance Company, provided that satisfactoryterms could be arranged, early in 1961. Against a sale at this date it may be saidthat:It would provoke a renewal of pressure for assurances as to the total amount of compensation that will eventually have to be paid to claimants(i.e., how far the United Kingdom Government are ready to supplement the 27-5 millions fund). There is little doubt that a sale would be linked byinterested parties with the compensation question; and though there is in factno connexion between the two, it would not be easy to keep them apart in public discussion.In favour of a sale at this date, rather than a deferment for anything up to threeyears, it may be said that:(i) We should in any event come under pressure at the time of the sale.(ii) Since the claimants are aware that the size of the final distribution willnot be known for two years or so they could hardly press actively, atthe time of the sale, for a larger final distribution.(iii) If satisfactory proposals can be worked out for the second and largerdistribution, and the distribution is announced before the sale, this might do something to allay discontent for the time being and the political pressure might be reduced.9. It would of course be possible to defer the sale indefinitely. I would consider this undesirable not merely because there is no reason of policy to retain our holding, but because of the possible embarrassment that in certaincircumstances, as suggested in paragraph 3, we might be caused. These arearguments against an indefinite deferment; but they also suggest that we ought notto allow the risk of pressures for more compensation to have an undue influence on our decision when to sell the holding.10. The considerations in paragraph 7 suggest that the balance of advantagelies with a sale early in 1961, if conditions are suitable, and that nothing would be gained in respect of claims on the  27-5 millions fund by deferring the sale for anything up to three years. The considerations in paragraph 8 suggest that an indefinite deferment would be undesirable.11. I should be glad to know whether my colleagues agree with these conclusions.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,10th November, 1960.
