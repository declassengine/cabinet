Printed for the Cabinet.   December- 1960C. (00) 181 Copy No,   5 92nd December, 1960CABINETCOMMERCIAL TREATY WITH Japan Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have approved the proposals of the Presidentof the Board of Trade for the future conduct of the negotiations for a commercial treaty with Japan. In view of the political implications of any move to placeAnglo-Japanese trade on a freer basis I think the Cabinet would wish to be aware of the line which the President proposes that our negotiators should take whenthe talks are resumed on 14th December.background. At present by invoking Article XXXV of the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (GATT) we impose discriminatory quantitative restrictions, on importsof most Japanese manufactures. The Cabinet agreed at their meetings on10th March &quot;and 10th May that we should resume negotiations for a commercial treaty giving Japan most-favoured-nation rights in respect of quantitative import restrictions, subject to the safeguards that we should maintain restrictions on certain sensitive products and retain the right to impose or reimpose restrictionson other products if necessary (C.C. (60) 16th Conclusions, Minute 2, and30th Conclusions, Minute 6).3, The Japanese have accepted the broad principles of these proposals andhave offered us two, ways of implementing them, Under- alternative A we should cease to invoke Article &quot;XXXV against Japan as soon as the. treaty is signed andin return we should, get more or less permanent bilateral safeguards. Underalternative B we. should continue to invoke Article XXXV and our bilateralarrangements for safeguards would be only short-term,Present proposals. The President proposes that we should be prepared to negotiate without commitment on the basis of a modified form of alternative A. Under this wewould cease to invoke Article XXXV against Japan, subject to a bilateral agreement that we have the right to maintain restrictions on certain listed items and to imposeor reimpose restrictions on any imports which in our judgment threaten to disruptour market. This agreement would last until terminated by mutual consent or until arrangements acceptable to both Governments for dealing with the. problemof market disruption were evolved in the framework of. the,. GATT. We couldnot, however, accept a Japanese proposal that until a 0ATT solution had been worked out any dispute about the application of the safeguards, should be referredto the GATT and any recommendation or ruling of the contracting parties wouldoverride the provisions of the bilateral agreement.        &apos;5. Our abandonment of Article XXXV would remove a constant irritationto our political relations with Japan. From the economic standpoint the negotiation of a treaty would give our exporters permanent mpst-fayaured-nationrights in the Japanese market which is expanding rapidly. Imports of many goodsinto Japan are closely restricted at present, but there are plans for removing many
of the restrictions in the next few years. A.treaty on the lines proposed would giveour exporters an equal opportunity with others to benefit from the greater freedomof trade. Indeed, a firm framework for future trade between the two countries is an indispensable preliminary to any vigorous effort by our exporters to developthis important and expanding market.6. Whichever alternative we accepted, we might have to take part in a new procedure for consultation agreed on at the GATT Session just concluded, underwhich the contracting parties may invite any country to discuss with them measures taken by it to deal with market disruption, whether or not they involve a breach of GATT obligations, at any rate in so far as the interests of third parties maybe affected by the measures, e.g., by the diversion of Japanese exports to them.7. If, on the other hand, we chose alternative B, we should continue to invoke Article XXXV against Japan, and the bilateral safeguards and themost-favoured-nation rights on both sides would terminate after three years(or the finding of an acceptable GATT solution if that were earlier); thearrangements might, however, be continued thereafter for a year at a time withthe consent of both parties. Under this alternative we should retain the bargainingstrength against Japan which our refusal of GATT relations has given us. Butthe value of this may well decline as Japan liberalises her trade and so enlargesthe field over which she can discriminate against our exports. Moreover,alternative B is essentially a short-term arrangement and, if it were adopted, thecontroversial question of commercial relations with Japan would come up again in a few years&apos; time.Subsidiary Matters8. The Japanese have put forward some subsidiary suggestions. Of these,the more important are:(a) Restrictions on goods in the sensitive list and restrictions imposed under. the ultimate safeguard should wherever practicable be operated at the exporting end.(b) The sensitive list should be cut down and there should be time limits forthe maintenance of restrictions on some of the goods which remain on it.(c) The use of restrictions to protect Colonial interests in the United kingdom market should be limited to the traditional interests of Colonies towhich the treaty is extended.9. As regards (a), some countries (the United States, Canada, Australia and denmark) have relied for some years on &quot; voluntary &quot; Japanese export controls,while others (in Western Europe) have refused to accept this form of control.The Japanese themselves admit that they cannot effectively apply export control to all kinds of goods: they ask for it only where they believe they can make itwork, and they accept that we should reinforce it (as we do for Hong Kong textiles)by admitting only goods accompanied by the proper export authorisation. Weshould also have the right to reimpose our own import controls whenever it became clear in any case that the Japanese export control was not effective. In thesecircumstances the President proposes to accept export control at the Japaneseend in suitable cases for items on the sensitive list, subject to satisfactory arrangements being worked out in detail, and to agree that if it is necessary toconsider fresh restrictions we will wherever possible discuss with the Japanesethe use of export controls before imposing our own import controls.10. As regards (b), the composition of the sensitive list is of crucial importance to us, and the President will later submit separate proposals for dealingwith the Japanese request that it should be shortened. He does not consider thattime limits for the maintenance of restrictions need be ruled out in principle,although they would not necessarily be acceptable for all items.11. As regards (c), the Secretary of State for the Colonies has represented that we should continue to insist that the restrictions to protect Colonial interests inour market should cover all items of Colonial interest and should not be limitedto the traditional items. The Japanese are likely to oppose this strongly, if only because of the political difficulties for them of leaving Hong Kong free to develop inthe United Kingdom Market new export lines from which Japan would be excluded.
SECRET&apos;:&apos;&quot;3Summary12. The modified form of alternative A would give Japan the appearance of full GATT rights to which they attach considerable importance, while providingus with safeguards for our sensitive industries and giving our export interests abetter chance and greater incentive to compete for the growing Japanese market.Whether in the end an agreement on these lines will prove acceptable to both sideswill depend to a large extent on the composition of the sensitive list of goods onwhich import restrictions will be maintained by us.13. I invite the Cabinet to agree with the conclusions of the Economic PolicyCommittee that our negotiators should proceed on the lines set out in paragraph above and should adopt the attitude expressed in paragraphs 9-11 on the subsidiarymatters. The Economic Policy Committee will consider the sensitive list at a later stage and will if necessary submit their views to the Cabinet.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,2nd December, 1960.
