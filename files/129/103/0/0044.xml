C. (60) 194 Copy No.    5 321st December, 1960CABINETHOUSE COAL PROSPECTS FOR THE WINTERMemorandum by the Minister of power in my report on house coal prospects in C. (60) 152, I said the National coal board estimated that the demand on them for large coal during the winter might be24 million tons, the same as last winter. The Board hoped to get 22 - 6 million tons from current production by raising the percentage of large coal in the total output to23-3. The balance of 1 - 4 million tons plus any shortfall from current production was to come partly from the Board&apos;s stocks of large coal, which were about  - 75 million tons at the beginning of winter, and partly from extra doubles and fromthe screening of large coal out of the stocks of unscreened coal.2. My report expressed some doubts about the ability of the industry to achieve the target of 23-3 per cent, large coal in total output: I am glad to say thatin November the collieries produced 3-61 million tons of large coal, representing24 per cent, of their total output the best monthly percentage realised for over twoyears. If this performance can be maintained, supplies from current productionduring the winter as a whole would be 0 - 7 million tons higher than anticipated. TheBoard are, indeed, now aiming to do even better than this.3. On the other hand demand has continued very high. During the first five weeks of winter, merchants&apos; disposals to consumers were about 450,000 tons (18 percent.) higher than last year. Some of the extra coal supplied has no doubt gone intohouseholders&apos; stocks, and an increase in demand of this scale is most unlikely tocontinue for the whole winter. But demand for large coal could still be appreciablymore than the estimated 24 million tons, particularly if the weather is unusually coldor if householders start hoarding because of rumours of shortages.4. The National Coal Board have so far more than kept pace with the highdemand and their despatches to merchants in the five weeks were 640,000 tons (26 percent.) more than last year. Merchants&apos; stocks on 3rd December were 1-77 million tons, only about 7 per cent, below last year&apos;s level of 1-91 million tons. This is a useful improvement on the stock position when I last reported to the Cabinet.Merchants&apos; stocks were then nearly 24 per cent, below last year. The Board&apos;s ownstocks of large coal had only fallen to 0-66 million tons on 3rd December, havingbeen helped out by some screening of &quot; unscreened &quot; stocks.5. The other problem touched on in my previous note was that of ensuringadequate transport for supplies of house coal. Here an agreement was reached between the Board and the British Transport Commission, under which diversionsof power station and industrial coal to the roads are being built up to a total ofabout 100,000 tons a week. The arrangements have been going smoothly, althoughthe Board tell me there have recently been a few local difficulties, such as fog, theretention of wagons by some consumers, and the reluctance of others to acceptroad-borne supplies. These difficulties are being watched, but the Board expect the 100,000 tons figure to be reached by Christmas, as they had planned.6. The Coal Board think that by February, when demand will be at its peak,diversions on a larger scale may be needed.

figure on this, especially as rail movements generally have been going much moresmoothly than last year. This possible need for larger diversions is being kept under review and will be discussed with the Commission early in January.7. To sum up, although the National Coal Board, with the co-operation ofthe British Transport Commission, have had considerable success in stepping upsupplies, we are not yet in a position to say that the danger of house coal shortagesis over. I shall continue to watch the situation carefully, keeping in close touchwith the Chairman of the Coal Board.R. F. W.Ministry of Power, S.W. 1,21st December, 1960.
