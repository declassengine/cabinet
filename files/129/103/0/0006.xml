NATIONAL INSURANCE AND NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE;RATES OF CONTRIBUTIONMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and NationalInsuranceAs requested by the Cabinet on 18th October (C. C.(60) 54thConclusions, Minute 6), I am circulating a table which compares the presentweekly rates of national insurance and national health service contributions for men and women with the rates that would become payable next April at different earnings levels (a) under the National Insurance Act, 1959, as it now stands;   (b) under the 1959 Act as it will be amended in the light of thedecision to increase pensions;   and (c) under the 1959 Act as so amended,with the additional national health service contribution proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.2. I have also consulted the Government Actuary as to the approximatenumbers of contributors who may be expected on average to be at these levels of earnings next April.    They are as follows;-In graduated schemeWeekly earnings -Less than  9(Including some who normally   .earn more than  9 a week but who are temporarily (e. g. , dueto sickness or short time) earn-ing less, or nothing)Between  9 -  11Between  11 -  13Between  13- 15More than  15MenWomen(millions)2. 01.02. 02. 64.01.61. 00.40.10. 2Contracted out(all earnings levels)Self- employed(all earnings levels)Non- employed2. 41.30.10. 60.10. 2(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)C.

It should be noted that these figures exclude some 2. 6 million employedmcrried women who have opted out of, and some 200,000 employed widowswho are not liable to, the flat-rate and minimum contributions;   both ofthese, therefore, also do not pay the national health service part of the contribution.J.
