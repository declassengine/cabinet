ItsReport was circulated with C. (60) 122.2. The Report estimates that by 1970 the Commonwealth is likely to consistof not less than 17 or more than 24 Members (see Annex).3.  The Report concludes :(a) that  any  form  of &quot; half-way  house&quot;  between  Colonial  and  full commonwealth status would be unacceptable;(b) that Commonwealth membership should therefore be granted to allterritories, irrespective of their size, which attain independence;(c) that changes in procedure at Prime Ministers&apos; Meetings should beconsidered, in order to prevent them from becoming too unwieldy asmembership grows.4. No comments have so far been received from the other commonwealth governments to whom copies of the Report were sent.5.  I recommend the Cabinet:(a) to accept the conclusions in paragraph 3 above;(b) to authorise me so to inform other Commonwealth Governments, and to propose to them that the Report should be discussed at the next meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.D.
