Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1960C. (60) 182 Copy No.    5 65th December, 1960CABINETPUBLIC INVESTMENT 1962-63Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer proposed New procedure in investment reviews in previous years Ministers have settled investment programmes for the following financial year and provisionally approved the largerpublic investment programmes two years ahead. In C. (60) 112, my predecessorproposed that this year we should fix, within the provisionally agreed programmes,minimum programmes for 1962-63 which would not subsequently be reduced save in the most exceptional circumstances. If economic conditions permit, it may bepossible next July to increase these minimum programmes; in the meantimedepartments would have a more solid basis for planning ahead than they wouldhave had under the previous procedure.2. On 19th July the Cabinet agreed that officials should examine the programmes for 1962-63 on the lines proposed (C.C. (60) 43rd Conclusions,Minute 5).Applicability3. It was not to be expected that the idea of minimum programmes andmargins could be applied uniformly. The circumstances of the differentprogrammes differ too widely. My officials report that they fall into three groups,as set out in the Annex to this paper.4. For Group A, which includes most of the larger programmes, it is recommended that minima and margins should be fixed at the levels shown. the division proposed has been agreed at the official level with the department concerned in each case.5. The British Transport Commission and the Atomic Energy authority are in a special category Group B because their investment programmes are under review. The Transport Commission^ programme has been put provisionallyat the same figure as has been provisionally fixed for 1961-62, i.e.,  175 millions,and the programme of the Atomic Energy Authority at the figure proposed inthe Authority&apos;s latest investment return, though this is likely to be reduced as aresult of the review now in hand. When these two programmes are finally determined, it should be possible to divide them into minima and margins in thesame way as those in Group A.6. Group C are programmes for which it is not considered practicable tosettle fixed minima at this stage. There are a number of reasons for this: to fixmargins now in the &quot; Other Central Government&quot; and &quot; Local Authority &quot;, &amp;c,programmes would involve a disproportionate amount of complication over verysmall figures; for other programmes it is not realistic to fix margins because ofthe nature of the control over the investment or because of the way in which expenditure depends on deliveries. If, however, the economic situation does not permit us in due course to approve the whole of the margins, in additions to theminima, for the programmes in Groups A and B, it may well be necessary to call for adjustments in those in Group C. Such adjustments would be best effectedthrough the appropriate machinery as and when required.
Total iot 1962-63 .-)-!- ........7. The total for all the programmes now proposed, including minima andmargins, is  1,810 millions in round terms for 1962-63. This represents aconsiderable increase over the total of programmes approved for 1961-62. I havealready expressed my concern at the increase in public expenditure of all kinds.But I am prepared to agree to the minima now and we can consider the marginssnext July at the annual Investment Review.8. In Group A we have a minimum total of  1,245 millions with a margin of  56-1 millions for final decision next July. Group B is a special categorybecause we do not yet know what the programmes will be, but we should be ableto obtain some margin. Group C includes miscellaneous central Governmentand local authority investment totalling nearly  200 millions; this covers numerouscomparatively small projects which we cannot deal with like Group A, but whichcould be pruned next July if necessary.9. I consider that the margins proposed above should be adequate for the dual purpose of giving Departments a basis on which to plan and of giving usgenerally a realistic margin from which we can operate if need be next July. Ilook to my colleagues to resist any proposals for further increases in either theminimum or total programmes between now and next July and to ensure that theyavoid any commitments for 1962-63 which might involve an excess over theminima before decisions are taken next year.Conclusion10.   My proposals are therefore as follows:(i) For the programmes in Group A, the minima set out in the Annex shouldbe approved now and the margins provisionally approved; final decisions on the margins should be taken at the next Investment review in the summer of 1.961; meanwhile, no commitments should be enteredinto which would encroach on the margins.(ii) Minima and margins should similarly be determined for the british transport Commission and Atomic Energy Authority, when the presentreviews of these programmes are complete.(iii) The programmes in Group C should be provisionally approved, subjectto the reservation in paragraph 6 above.11.   I invite my colleagues to approve these proposals and to arrange fortheir Departments to proceed accordingly.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,2nd December, I960.
