THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November I960C. (60) 160 Copy No. 5 12nd November, 1960CABINETNATIONAL service memorandum by the Minister of LabourCall-up for National Service will end on 17th November when the last men,about 1,800, are being summoned to report at Army centres.2. It is already known that call-up is to end this year, but it is not known that it is to end in mid-November rather than December. This has been achieved by increasing the rate of intake. The target we set ourselves will have been fullyachieved by 17th November.3. It is important that nothing should be said before they have joined their units to indicate that these will be the last National Servicemen. The last mento be called for compulsory service, which will continue for two years, may not unnaturally feel themselves to be unfortunate. We should not risk exacerbatingthat feeling or do anything which might encourage last minute defaulting.4. I would therefore like to make an announcement in the House on thefollowing morning, Friday, 18th November. My colleagues may care to see the annexed draft of what I propose to say.J. H.Ministry of Labour, S.W. 1,2nd November, 1960.58001
annex proposed STATEMENT ON NATIONAL service in accordance with the Government^ declared intention of converting the armed Forces to an all-regular basis by the end of 1962,1 am now able to announce that the men who received enlistment notices instructing them to join their unitsyesterday are the last to be called up.The House will appreciate that National Servicemen now serving must expect to complete their full period of service. Similarly, conscientious objectors whohave been registered on condition that they undertake civilian employment must continue to fulfil their obligations. The provisions of the National Service Actsregarding claims to reinstatement in civilian employment remain in force.It is now 21 years since conscription was introduced, and during that periodover 5% million men have been called up by my Department, most of them duringthe war. Over 2 million have been called up since the end of the war and manyof these have shared the dangers and hardships of active service in different partsof the world. I am sure the House will join me in paying a tribute to the spiritwhich our young men have shown throughout these years.I should also like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to all members of Hardship and Reinstatement Committees, Conscientious ObjectorTribunals and others who have given advice and assistance in the human andindustrial problems created by National Service.November 1960.
