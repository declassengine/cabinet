The report has beenexamined by the Home Defence Committee and is submitted for considerationby the Cabinet.2. Part III of the report attempts to assess the extent to which inadequacyof home defence preparations may impair the effectiveness of the deterrent policyin a time of international tension. The officials who prepared the report wereunable to reach &quot;unanimous agreement on this question: the arguments on eitherside are set out in paragraphs 16 to 21 of the report.   The Home Defenceifl Committee, equally, are unable to present an agreed recommendation to Ministerson it. They are however agreed upon the importance of keeping the existingstructure of Civil Defence in being, at least for the present; and they accept theview of the Home Office and other Departments mainly concerned that for thispurpose home defence measures must be sustained at a level which will secure thecontinuing support and interest of the local authorities and voluntary agenciesI through which Civil Defence must be operated. They also accept the view of theDepartments concerned that, in order to achieve this, it will be necessary to incurover the next few years additional expenditure of the order of  4 millions a year,H    as recommended in the attached report.3. Part VI of the report discusses a number of other home defence measuresI    which do not involve immediate expenditure.   The Home Defence Committeeconsidered that one of these-the question whether plans should be made for alimited evacuation of priority classes-should be brought specifically to theI    Cabinet&apos;s attention in connexion with the more general issues raised in the report.On this a separate memorandum is being circulated by the Ministers concerned.The remaining measures discussed in Part VI of the report might be examinedH further by the Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence, in the light of theI    conclusions reached by the Cabinet on the main issues.Hfl (Signed)     NORMAN BROOK.||^[ Cabinet Office, S.w\ 1, ^[^Hjfl ? ?          15th December, 1960.HI I 9Sm m^[ fl TOP SECRET
HI &lt;. H^Lm M TOP SECRET 3HOME DEFENCE POLICYrtft I.-INTRODUCTION&quot; The Home Defence Review Committee was established in February 1960,^LwM with the approval of the Prime Minister, to review home defence policy having^LwM regard to the nuclear deterrent and the latest assessment of the possibility and^LwM nature of a nuclear attack on this country during the next ten years.2.  The following is a brief historical background to the establishment of the^LwM Committee. The civil defence organisation was disbanded at the end of the war,^LwM and was revived at the time of the Berlin crisis of 1948. Following the invention HWj^LwM of the hydrogen bomb the Strath Committee was established to consider the defence^LwM 1 implications of fall-out. It reported in 1955, and recommended substantial^LwM expenditure in order to provide reasonable protection for the general public^LwM against nuclear attack and measures for their continued survival after attack. The^LWm Defence Committee (D.C. (55) 1st Meeting) endorsed the recommendations as amum  urn     ^asis ^or ^e rev&apos;si n  f home defence planning, subject to Ministerial approval ofI      detailed schemes.I 3.  Various measures designed to reduce the casualties from a nuclear attack1      were authorised; but the stockpiling of food, the safeguarding of water suppliesand the provision of other facilities on the scale then considered necessary for thecontinued survival of those who outlived the attack was not undertaken becauseof the cost. The home defence budget was progressively reduced from  70 millions HVJ^LM in 1955-56 (which was not fully spent) to  18-5 millions in 1958-59. In 1958 theDefence Committee considered a memorandum by the Prime Minister (D. (58) 36)^-m     j     suggesting that the possible courses for future home defence policy were to reduce HVJpreparations to those which contributed directly to the efficient operation of the^^fl     j     nuclear retaliatory forces; to provide for survival measures after attack, either in HSjj     addition to or in place of current preparations; or to continue the current HWjprogramme at about the existing level of expenditure.  The Defence Committee HWJ^^m considered (D. (58) 18th Meeting) that additional expenditure for survival measuresafter attack, though desirable, could not be contemplated at that time. TheyJ     accepted the &quot; illogicality&quot; of home defence policy, at least temporarily, on theJ     basis that its main purpose was to maintain the morale of the population rather^^m than to provide effectively against nuclear attack.  They agreed that the main^^m emphasis of the programme should be on measures which gave a positive and^^m visible indication of the Government&apos;s support for the voluntary civil defenceservices, and that home defence expenditure should continue at about the thencurrent level ( 18-5 millions annually).4.  However, the view that the policy was illogical inhibited the Government^-^Ly from giving any comprehensive explanation of their attitude towards home^-^Ly defence, and encouraged the persistence of doubts, particularly among those^-^Ly concerned with it outside the Government service, about the validity of the^-^Ly measures that were in progress.^-m 5.  An increase in the home defence estimate for 1960-61 to  19-5 millionswas endorsed by Ministers on the understanding that a review of policy wouldtake place during 1960. HV]II.^NATURE OF THE THREAT TO THE UNITED KINGDOM6.  Before the value of home defence can be assessed, whether from thetechnical military point of view or as an ingredient of the deterrent policy or as an^-m aid to survival in the event of war, it is necessary to examine briefly the nature of theI If    u  Even if there remains a possibility of a limited war in Europe, it seems^^H*     I   improbable that there could be a physical threat to the United Kingdom except in theevent of a threat of global war.  Provided that the West can maintain a credibledeterrent, the Soviet Union is unlikely deliberately to resort to global war.TOP SECRET ^|^-M b ^-M
4 TOP SECRETHowever, the possibility of global war arising through miscalculation of either -\mm\^L\mm\               political or military factors cannot be ignored; and the threat of global war^whieh ^k\m\^k\%W               the policy of the deterrent is designed to withstand, will be invoked by the Soviet ^-\m\wMMMM               Union to a greater or lesser degree so long as the political tensions of the cold war I Bvflftwfl                     8.  The threat, for us, is the ability of the Soviet Union to devastate this country ^k-Wwith anuclear attack, atpresent launched primarily by manned bombers. Intelligen ? WMMMderived solely from information of a technical nature and without taking into account ^k-W-W-WM               political assessments might to-day give us no warning of Soviet preparations to ^k-Wattack the West, but in the most favourable circumstances warning could be as ^k-Wmuch as a day or two.  There would be about ninety minutes warning of the moment ^k-WWMMMM               of a Soviet attack on the United Kingdom by present-day bombers, but if ballistic BwBmissiles were used now there could be no warning.  By 1963 the threat could be ^k-Wentirely from ballistic missiles, but bomber attacks would be likely to supplement ^k-WwMMMM               the initial missile attacks.  By this time the strategic warning is likely to be less than I WMMMMat present.  With the completion of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System(B.M.E.W.S.) there would be warning of the moment of attack, which might be as ^k-Wlittle as three minutes or as much as twelve minutes.  Warning of attack on North HAmerica would be unlikely to increase the warning obtained by the United Kingdom. H9. Home defence preparations must to some extent be geared to these warning H wMMM^L\mm\ periods. But since the major risk of war is likely to come, not through a calculated H ^k*wmBVH                Soviet intention to initiate global war but from some miscalculation, it is likely that :- H ^k-wmnuclear attack would be preceded by a period of political tension.   Such a period wawmmight be short or long, but at some time during it the Government might have to jH ^k*wmWMMMM                consider what precautions, including home defence measures, should be taken. J BVflHome defence preparations made in peace would not commit the Government in a Hperiod of tension, but would enable them to take precautions if they thought fit atthe time.  The political advantages (both at home and abroad) of being seen to be II WMMMtaking such measures would have to be weighed against the possibility of their being ^k*wmwMMMM regarded as provocative in the situation then prevailing.10. For illustrative purposes Appendix A contains assessments of the weight HwMMMM                and pattern of two possible plans of attack on the United Kingdom and their effects. HAny such assessments must necessarily be speculative, but there is no doubt that the ? ^k-wm^L\mW                Soviet Union could effectively knock the United Kingdom out of a war involving the ^k*wmWestern Alliance. If nuclear bases and cities were attacked on the scale assessed, H BVIand there were no general evacuation or provision of shelter, there might be overBvfl twenty million deaths (thirteen million from fall-out) and four million otherserious casualties.  Four to five million casualties might be avoided if a scheme WMMM;              for evacuating six million people had been carried out; and millions more might bemKWKm                avoided if it had been possible to provide adequate shelter from fall-out. Therewould probably be sufficient food for survivors, though there would be serious ^k*wm-wawm                distribution problems; water, power and transport would probably suffice for^^^1                survival purposes if certain precautions had been taken.  All these assessments could 1 BVflbe substantially altered by variations in the weight and pattern of the attack, theBVH                amount of warning and the wind and weather conditions prevailing, as well as by ^k-9m^ky%m\                the home defence preparations made in advance.  It would be useless to try to relate WMMMMhome defence planning to a particular scale or type of attack, but any attack should ^k-WWA^mW                clearly be assumed to cause widespread destruction and casualties.11. The Committee have not examined the possible consequences of chemicalwMMMMM                or biological attack.  The advice available to them was that the use of either against ^k-9mthe United Kingdom was unlikely. I wMMMIII-PURPOSES OF HOME DEFENCE jGovernment control^^^1                      12.  The Committee are unanimous that there is one type of home defence ^L-9mTkW-WM                measure which must be maintained, whatever view is taken of other measures- ^k-wm^k-%%W                namely, preparations for carrying on the government of the country (including I BVflBVftV                the provision of emergency headquarters for the central Government and of a ?^k--W                regional organisation, together with their essential communications).   They/ JI ^k*wm^k---m                 consider that any Government must fulfil the duty of providing, so far as it can, WMMMMWMMmMM                 for the maintenance of a framework of administration in all circumstances. ^k-wmSECRET
11  #) ITOP SECRET S13.  There is not the same unanimity about the value of other home defenceI    measures, which are considered in the following paragraphs in relation to theirtechnical military value and to their part in the deterrent policy.Technical military value of home defence preparationsttfZh. ^* ^ne deterrent policy is based on plans to ensure that, if the Soviet strucka nuclear counter-attack from this country would be practicable. Homedefence measures in the United Kingdom do not affect the technical ability ofWestern forces to launch nuclear weapons against the Soviet. Nor would theycomplicate the Soviet task of inflicting an unacceptable level of damage on theUnited Kingdom; the position would be somewhat different in large countries suchas the United States and the Soviet Union, where space for dispersal and economicresources are sufficient to permit the taking of home defence measures of such aH    nature as slightly to complicate the task of attacking forces.15. Thus, the home defence preparations which we could take would notaffect the maintenance of nuclear equipoise between the West and the Soviet bloc.The place of home defence in the deterrent policy ^^fl16. The assumption is that this country is unlikely to use strategic nuclearforces except in retaliation against an enemy attack. The main aim of defencepolicy is to make it clear that such retaliation can be and will be carried out. Theeffectiveness of this policy depends in part on the ability of the Government toretain the general support of public opinion in withstanding threats of nuclearattack by making it clear to the enemy that any such attack would incur certainnuclear retaliation. In normal times the deterrent policy may not be seriously ^^flquestioned by the majority of people, and the Soviet leaders will be influencedj 1 primarily by the balance of military strengths and not necessarily by their assessmentof the determination of the West to use nuclear forces. But in a period of tension,when the West might take a stand involving the risk of global war, the Soviet Unionwould judge the determination of the United Kingdom, not simply by our militarystrength or by any particular home defence measures, but also by the supportI which the Government commanded for the deterrent policy in general. Againstthis background, opinion on the Committee varied widely as to the need for homedefence measures other than provision for the maintenance of Government control.Minority view17. One view is that, since the basic aim of Western defence policy is toprevent war, our preparations should be directed to increasing the possibility andencouraging the belief, both at home and abroad, that the deterrent will succeedH in this aim. Our limited resources are therefore better spent on maintaining aneffective military deterrent to war in all its forms than on insurance against an eventas unlikely as global war. Home defence preparations, on any scale that we canafford, are futile against the actual threat. If there is only a short period ofwarning, it may be impossible to carry out any substantial measures before attack,and any measures which can be taken would have little or no effect on morale.Even if there were time to take full precautions before attack and the necessaryadvance preparations had been made in peace, the casualties could not be reducedbelow about eleven millions, even on the least pessimistic of the assumptions inAppendix A. Such preparations as we could afford would have an appreciablysmaller effect. In any event the public have for a long time been aware that thereis no means of providing adequate protection against the consequences of an attackwith nuclear weapons, and the vast majority of people appear to have acceptedthe deterrent policy as the best means to avoid the ultimate choice betweensurrender and global war. In a time of tension the number of the undecided willbe marginal; they are uhlikely to be influenced by home defence measures on any^^fl scale that we can afford; and whatever the attitude of this minority it will notinfluence the action of the Government or the Soviet judgment of the resolutionof the Government. Indeed, the greater the effort applied to home defencemeasures in time of tension or before, the more the impression may be spread thatthe Government does not really believe in the effectiveness of its deterrent policy.18. However, those who take this view recognise that it would be politicallyimpracticable to carry it to its logical conclusion by abandoning home defence^[ TOP SECRET
TOP SECRET ^ ^LW^k-W measures entirely at the present time.  They consider therefore that expenditure^LyLyM on home defence preparations should be severely restricted.  It would include ^LyMWmTmW some provision for carrying on the Government of the country (see paragraph 12), ^LtM^mYMM but it would exclude measures designed solely to increase the number of survivors MYMf^LyMM of a nuclear attack.  The public should be encouraged to accept that the best ^LyMWMmYM defence and hope of survival lies in resolute support of the deterrent policy. WMMmwmm Majority view mW mmm19.  Most members of the Committee hold the view that there will always ^LyM^LwM be a great number of people who, in a period of tension involving a risk of nuclear ^LyM^LyMM attack, will increasingly question the Government&apos;s deterrent policy, unless they    H ^LyM^kwm can be assured that some home defence preparations have been made against its ^kwrnpossible failure.  The longer the period of tension lasted, the more important it WkYM^LwU would be for the Government to be seen to have at its disposal measures designed ^LyM^mWM to reassure the public in this way, and the more opportunity there would be to ^kwrn^mWm carry out the measures planned. By steadying public opinion such measures could    B ^kwrn^Lyaym well strengthen the Government&apos;s hand at a vital time. In this case the maintenance ^LyMof public support of Government policies based on the retaliatory deterrent in a ^LyM^mWm period of tension becomes the primary object of home defence preparations. Those ^kwrn^mWm who hold this view regard the taking of home defence measures as an integral part ^LwM^Lyaym of the deterrent policy, and not merely as something which must be accepted because m-mt^Lyaym of the political difficulty of abandoning home defence. It is relevant that this view ^LyMis gaining hold among other members of NATO, who might well doubt our ability ^LyMto pursue a deterrent policy in a time of tension if we were significantly to reduce ^LyMour home defence preparations. ^LyM^LyM\ 20.  Some of the Committee who hold the majority view also think that as ^LyMlong as there is a risk of war, whether from miscalculation or through some ^LyMunforeseen change in the situation of nuclear equipoise between East and West, mMMthe Government has a duty to take measures to mitigate the consequences to the ^LyM^mWm civil population if global war occurs. Although the maintenance of public support ^kwrn^kwm of Government policies in a period of tension would still be the primary object of ^LyM^mWm home defence preparations, there are some measures which would greatly improve ^LyM^mWm the prospects of survival after attack, even though their value for sustaining public ^kwrn^LyM! morale before attack may not be conclusive.   In practice these measures of ^LyMinsurance are largely the same as those required to rally public opinion. -WLym^LwU 21.  Whatever precautions are taken, the casualties and devastation resulting ^LyMMXyM from a nuclear attack would be on an unprecedented scale, and the public could      I ^LyMnot expect to have anything like the same degree of protection as in the last war. mmm\^mWM                 The education of the public in the limitations of home defence measures and in | I ^kwrnunderstanding the deterrent is essential to any future home defence programme. ^mYM^mWm But if such measures as are undertaken are to succeed in maintaining public ^kwrnmorale, they must be of such a nature as to appear reasonable to local authorities WmYM^LyLM and others concerned with home defence, and indeed to the general public. ^LyMIV.-POSSIBLE  FUTURE  PROGRAMMES ^LM^LyM 22.  The following paragraphs deal with the application of these points of ^Lwm^LyLM view to future planning and expenditure. Possible programmes are first examined ^LyM^LyM in terms of expenditure (Sections IV and V). Section VI is concerned with certain ^LyM^LyaW questions of policy where financial considerations are not decisive, at least in the ^LyMnext financial year. ^mYMmmm* 23.  In the current year 1960-61 we are spending about  19-5 millions onhome defence, including Post Office capital expenditure on defence measures. This    I MmYM^mYAYi Post Office expenditure, which is estimated for the current year at about  4 millions, ^LyM^mWM has been excluded from the figures used in the remainder of the report, which, ir ^kmm^LyaM respect of communications services, show only the rental payments to the Pesrf&apos; ^LyM^LyU Office which would be paid in connexion with defence by civil Departments. For ^LyMWmYkW purposes of comparison, therefore, current expenditure is taken to be  15 . 5 millions ^LyMTOP SECRET
I H^LM TOP SECRET 7in 1960-61. All figures exclude administrative costs in Government Departments,since these are not normally shown in the home defence budget.^Lw\ 24.  If the minority view referred to in paragraphs 17 and 18-namely, that^LWm home defence preparations have little real value-were accepted, it would followmmm H   ^at certain additional expenditure might be incurred in completing measures to^LWM ^ble the government of the country to carry on during a period of tension andI    after attack; but that, for the rest, no additional expenditure should be incurred,^LWM m    and that instead every opportunity should be taken to reduce expenditure as and^LWM when this proved politically or otherwise possible.^-M 25.  This view is not expounded in detail in the rest of the report, since mostH of the Committee think that home defence measures serve a useful purpose in BKJ^Lw\ M    support of the deterrent policy.   At the same time they do not believe that^-W. the present programme is satisfactory as it stands. They have therefore considered^LWm two possible courses-^LWM (a) Programme X, which involves some increase in expenditure, the object being^LWm to provide a coherent and publicly defensible policy;^LWM (b) Programme Y, which contemplates expenditure being kept as near as^-W. possible to its present level despite the consequent inadequacies.Programme X ^LWmWi^-M 26.  To suggest large increases over the present figure of  15 -5 millions wouldH be unrealistic. There is no prospect of going back to the position of say five years^LwM ago, when the home defence budget was about  70 millions and contemplatedsubstantial increases in, for example, food and medical stockpiles. Programme X, wLm-M^LwM which covers a five-year period, is intended to show the most economical programmewhich could be presented as a reasonably consistent and logical one and would be^LwM likely to command confidence among local authorities and others concerned with^LWM home defence, and through them the general public. This programme is set out in^LwM some detail at Appendix B. It involves a total cost of about  19 millions in 1961-62.^LM The total would rise to  20 ? 2 millions in 1962-63 and  20 . 4 millions in 1963-64. Itwould drop significantly during the following two years, and the average for the five^LWm years would be about  19-6 millions.Programme Y^LwM 27.  Programme Y, covering the same five-year period, is that recommended if^LwM Ministers should decide that any substantial increase over the current rate of^LWM expenditure cannot be afforded. Unless there is to be a major change of policy, some^LwM increase in expenditure in 1961-62 is unavoidable. For one thing, Ministers have ^LWM^LWM already approved certain proposals, including the Carrier system for warning^LWM purposes, which are bound to mean more expenditure next year. Furthermore, the^LwM present programme is in some respects ill-balanced, and it seems to the Committee^LWM I       that a start should be made towards filling the more serious gaps in it. Because ofexisting commitments there is little room for redeployment of effort next year within^LwM a programme on broadly the present scale; but over the next five years the balanceBH of such a programme could be improved, although inadequacies would remain.^LwM Programme Y (details of which are given at Appendix C) involves expenditure of^LWM  16-4 millions in 1961-62 and in 1962-63 and smaller sums for the following three^LWM years. The average for the five years would be about  16-2 millions.^LWm Expenditure not in either Programme^LWM 28.   If it were decided to make a survey of accommodation for shelter purposes^LWM (see Section VIB) and to institute a bounty for the Civil Defence Corps, the Auxiliary^LwM ?    Fire Service and possibly the National Hospital Service Reserve (see Section VI D)^LWM there would be an increase in the total cost of whatever programme is adopted of^-M about  1 million in 1962-63, rising to  1 -5 millions by 1965-66.^LWm Main items of expenditure, 1960-62^LwM A  29.

The main heads of expenditure are discussed below.(a) Government ControlPremises32. The present plans envisage an underground emergency headquarters forthe central Government; extensive devolution to ten regional commissioners inEngland and Wales and a Scottish headquarters; and a system of subordinateP^H controls within each region, consisting of sub-regions and groups, areas and sub-areas.   Scotland would have three zones under the Scottish headquarters, eachwith its groups, areas and sub-areas.  In the following paragraphs references ti\regions should be read as including zones in Scotland. *vsr j ^^^H33. The emergency underground headquarters for the central Governmentis due for completion in 1961-62.TOP SECRET ^[
I ITOP SECRET 934. Except where use can be made of existing purpose-built protective ^LmW^k-W II accommodation, the plan is to improvise the other headquarters by strengthening ^L\m\^ky^y         accommodation in existing buildings so as to provide some protection against WMMMM35. A start has been made with the regional headquarters. It will cost about WMMMM^k-wm  1 million to complete them. Each regional headquarters is planned to ^L-W^L\m\ /Commodate about 450 staff. Additional staff may be needed, but will have to ^-\m\^k-wm         oe housed elsewhere in support offices. A start has also been made on the sub-^k-wm regional headquarters: the programme is likely to cost about  0-3 million. WMMMM^L-9m 36.  The other headquarters are provided by local authorities with a 75 per ^-\m\^k-wm cent. Exchequer grant. A start has been made with a small programme for group^k-wm and area controls. The minimum programme likely to be at all acceptable to local ^-\m\^k-wm authorities, which would include provision for some sub-areas, would involve ^-\m\\ I grants of about  3 - 7 millions.^L-9m 37.  Under Programme X the regional and sub-regional headquarters would ^L\m\^L\m\   \l    be completed in 1965.   The programme for group, area and certain sub-areaI    controls would be completed in 1968.38. Under Programme Y the regional headquarters would be completed in^k-wm H 1968 and the sub-regional headquarters in 1971. The programme for group, area^k-W   I     and certain sub-area controls would last until 1980.Communications^L-9m 39.  The exercise of control after a nuclear attack would depend to a greatj    extent on the availability of communications. These should be considered under^k-wm two broad heads, namely Post Office communications and stand-by point to point40. Post Office communications.-The Post Office network is designed to^k-W meet the needs of the country as a whole, and individual routes carry many^ky^y circuits. The whole Government control organisation, apart only from links between^k-W area headquarters and sub-area headquarters, is planned to be provided with^k-wm   I    communications which will, so far as possible, avoid the large cities by dispersalof circuits over a variety of routes, and be independent of public supplies of power.These emergency communications with the necessary equipment will, broadlyspeaking, be provided pari passu with the provision of premises. Communicationsbetween area and sub-area headquarters will depend on the normal telephone41. The installation of communications at the central Government^k-W headquarters will be completed in 1961. The rental of these facilities for the civil^k-W        Departments will amount to  0-285 millions a year. This figure has been includedin both Programmes X and Y. W-w-W42. Rentals payable by civil Departments for communications required forthe remainder of the control organisation will, when completed, amount to  1-25^L-W millions a year.  Programme X provides for these facilities to be installed down^k-W        to and including sub-regions and groups by 1966, and for the facilities from sub-^Lmmt I    regions and groups to areas by 1969. The corresponding dates under Programme Y ^k-9M^k-W        are 1972 and 1981, but links between regional headquarters and regional support^k-W        offices would be installed by 1969.43. Point-to-point single channel stand-by  wireless.    The Post Officecommunications system (which itself includes a &quot; backbone &quot; multi-channel radio ^^^Jsystem) cannot be guaranteed to withstand a full-scale nuclear attack. Thefollowing proposals therefore provide for stand-by point-to-point wireless links^k-W        within the control organisation.44. Such a link between the central Government headquarters and regionalheadquarters would provide a valuable insurance and would, at the very least,^k^W enable the central Government to confirm .whether or not regional headquartersmWMMM I    were functioning after an attack. The provision of an Army wireless link betweenj    Headquarters  United  Kingdom Land Forces  at  the central Government^-\m\ headquarters and Divisional/District Commanders at regional headquarters is^L-mM Understood to be under consideration. If it were established, it should suffice for^-\m\ I    this purpose. Because of the probable disposition of units Service wireless cannot^k^W be assumed to be available for civil controls below regional level.TOP SECRET ^LmmmJ
45. The interruption of Post Office communications from regionalheadquarters down to and including area headquarters would seriously impair theability of the Government to exercise control. Although plans provide for somedegree of alternative routing, there is a strong case for supplementing them withstand-by point-to-point wireless on a minimum scale. The cost would be about 0-5 millions.46. Post Office communications from area headquarters to controls belyT|would depend on the normal local telephone lines. Since these would beparticularly vulnerable, it has long been planned that they should be supplementedby wireless provided by the Home Departments. The cost of such wireless linkswould be about  0-63 million.47. Programme X provides for stand-by wireless links between area andsub-area headquarters to be completed in 1966 and for such links to be establishedbetween areas and higher controls up to regional headquarters by 1969. IProgramme Y makes no provision for wireless for these purposes. Neitherprogramme provides for a civil link between the central Government headquarters Iand regions, since the establishment of an Army link, if agreed, would suffice forcivil purposes (see paragraph 44 above).British Broadcasting Corporation48. The British Broadcasting Corporation have made plans to maintainsound broadcasting in war even if electricity supplies are interrupted. Theyprovide for a national broadcasting service and transmissions in each civil defenceregion. Work on this essential service started in 1959.49. Programme X contemplates completion of the work by 1966.  Under iP^H                    Programme Y the completion date would be 1969.^[50. Annual expenditure on the food stockpile (including storage charges^is at present  2-31 millions.   This stockpile should be just about enough to jprovide a spartan diet for the survivors of attack, if adequate arrangements aremade for controlling the supply and distribution of home-produced food and forprocuring, shipping, landing and distributing food from abroad with as littleinterruption as possible.51. Most of the preparatory work for the distribution of food would be lostunless there were ration documents available to enable supplies to be controlled.The printing of ration books, which could not be kept secret, might arouse publicconcern about the risk of war; but on the other hand, it would be difficult to enlistthe co-operation of those concerned in preparing an emergency food scheme if itwere known that it was not proposed to print ration books by any particular date.The cost of printing would be about  0 . 2 million.52. Both Programmes X and Y include the maintenance of the food stockpileat the present rate of expenditure, the printing of ration books, by 1965 and theprovision of equipment for emergency feeding arrangements and food monitoring.(c) Water Supplies f^^A53. Some emergency equipment for pumping and carting water has beenacquired (to a value of  1-25 millions), but since 1958 no expenditure on freshcapital items has been authorised. The item of  19,000 in the 1960-61 programmeis for maintenance and training.54. The Committee have concluded that, with the interruptions to distributionwhich would occur under the scale and pattern of attack now assumed, aprogramme suggested some years ago for softening plant to remove dissolvedfall-out from reservoir water (estimated at  18 millions) should be abandoned. tl^^lThis would mean that the population dependent on reservoirs, like the remaining a^^ltwo-thirds of the country, would have to rely on emergency equipment and^[ manipulation of supplies from other sources.   N^-^^|55. It seems to the Committee that some additional provision should be made d^^|for water supplies in war. Their proposals for both Programmes X and Y reflect fc^^lH TOP SECRET ^[
II H I^Lm top secret                          ii ^Lm^LwM this view, although a detailed scheme would have to be worked out after a survey ^LwMmMXm and  consultation  with  water  undertakings.    Programme  X  provides  for \m\\^Lm  0-25 million in 1961-62,  0 5 million in 1962-63 and  0-75 million in the^LwM jl succeeding years.   Programme Y provides for  0-2 million in 1961-62 and ^mW\wMmf  0-25 million in each of the following years. mMMmmm\ 1 W% mmm^LjM\ Electricity mXWM^LWM 56.  The provision of stand-by generating equipment will often be the only ^LWMI practical means of ensuring electricity supplies for essential purposes immediatelyHB after attack. Expenditure on stand-by generators is included under the items for ^Lw\W^LM which the generators are needed, and is not shown separately. ^L^L\^LwM 57.  The national grid supplies might take days or, in heavily damaged areas, ^Lw\^LWm  I months to restore.   Discussions with the industry about electricity in war are ^Lw\^LWM   It proceeding, and in due course may lead to proposals for additional expenditure. ^kwM^LWM 58.   In the meanwhile Programme X includes a token figure for a 50 per cent.^LwM Government grant of  25,000 in 1961-62 and  50,000 a year thereafter towards WmM^LWm measures to facilitate the restoration of supplies.  This figure has been included^LWM because of the importance of electricity supplies, but its size cannot be related to ^kwim^LM the magnitude of the task of restoration.   No provision is made underProgramme Y. ^L^Lm^L^LM Gas ^L^L\^L^L\ 59.  About  0-4 million (of which  0-2 million fell on the Exchequer) has ^L^L\^L^LW   I been spent on defence measures for the gas industry, largely for the purchase of ^L^L\^L^L\   I equipment needed to restore production and repair breaks in the distribution ^L^L\^L^L\   I system after attack. Gas is important for certain survival purposes, such as food ^L^L\^L^L\ processing. ^L^L\^L^Lw   I 60.   Supply prospects after attack would be improved by further expenditure ^L^L\m^-w   I of about  0-6 million on equipment and about  1-35 millions for shelter againstfall-out for employees required to remain at work in an emergency. The Exchequer ^L^L\^L^m would bear 50 per cent, of the cost. ^L^L\^L^L\ 61.  Programme X would permit the completion of this scheme by 1966. ^L^L\^MM    I Nothing would be done under Programme Y. ^MM^^H-   I PetroleumI 62.  The Government has built over a thousand miles of pipeline and two ^L^L\I million tons of protected storage as an emergency addition to the commercial oil ^L^Lmfacilities which are heavily concentrated in the big ports and cities.  The present BB^V&apos; value of the Government system and the associated stocks is over  50 millions, ^L^Lm^L^L\ and the annual upkeep about  0-6 million. Plans are being prepared to secure the ^L^M^^He I more effective control and operation of the system in nuclear war. These include^^He  I the provision of fall-out protection and stand-by pumps at key operating centres^^Hg.  I at a cost of about  0-5 million.^L^- 63.  There would be serious problems of distribution of motor fuel^L^Lw immediately after attack.   Stocks already distributed, for example, at petrol^L^LM stations, would probably last only for a few days.  The surest solution would beh^Kt! I essential services to build up their own stocks, but a cheaper remedy would1 be for the Ministry of Power to supplement their bulk reserves by laying in B^JI distributed stocks of, say, 50,000 tons, which, if they survived the attack, would be^L^L\ about a week&apos;s supply for essential services.  These stocks could be bought for^Hq,^ I about  0-75 million, and stored and maintained relatively cheaply in surplus AirI Ministry depots in various parts of the country.^^Hed I 64.

Printing would cost ^^B^?ng I about  10,000.^^?n^L|     65.  Programme X would permit the completion of the control and protective0 &quot;measures for the Government&apos;s emergency oil system and the purchase of a ^^B^^Hde distributed reserve of motor fuel by 1963, and the printing of fuel authorisation ^^B^^Ject forms by 1962.top secret bb^-W 58148                                                                            c 2 ^L^Lm

Programme Y would permit the completion of the control and protective H \mmm\^LmmWM                measures by 1968, but no provision would be made for a distributed reserve of H ^L\m\^LmmWM                motor fuel or for the printing of fuel authorisation forms. ^Lmmf67.  War planning for the coal industry is concerned mainly with drc Iorganisational problems of distribution after attack. No Government expenditw[X ^Lmm^L\mmM                is foreseen at present, but the possibility of minor expenditure in due course ^LmWcannot be precluded.^^^m TransportPorts^^^1                     68.  Plans have been made to receive shipping in war at the smaller ports ^LmW^LmmmM                and at anchorages, and about  8 millions has so far been spent, mainly on ^LmW^LmmmM                equipment. The re-supply of this country with food and other essentials after attack \mmm\^LmmW                is vital to survival. Good progress has been made with the emergency ports scheme, ^LmW^LmmmM                which would cost  1-8 millions to complete. ^LmW^LmWAM                     69.  Under Programme X final completion of the emergency ports scheme ^LmM^L\\\A                would be achieved by 1969 at an average annual capital expenditure of  0 . 2 million. ^L\\A^LX^-X                Under Programme Y capital expenditure would continue at the current rate of ^LmM^m\\\\                about  0-1 million a year and the scheme would not be finally completed until ^LwMRailways ^LmW^LmmWM 70.  Up to 1956 about  2-6 millions had been spent to help the railways tofunction after attack (including  1-4 millions on London Transport railways). Onepermanent emergency train control centre and five mobile centres and telephone^^^H               exchanges were completed. Nothing has been spent since. ^Lmmf71. Although a nuclear attack might leave much of the railway system intact, 9333MmWgMMM                it might destroy a number of main terminals and control and communicationscentres.  A complete alternative system of control cannot be contemplated, but J MMMadditional mobile and static control and communications centres would help to ^LmWensure the distribution of supplies of essential food and other materials. The total ^LmWXwMMmM               expenditure would be about  0-5 million. H72. Under Programme X this plan for alternative control and communications^^^1                centres would be completed by 1965. No provision is made under Programme Y. ^ MMM^k\\\A                Road transport 1 i^^H^^^b                     73,  The wartime organisation for controlling and providing road transport c^^flhas been planned on a regional basis, and would make the maximum use of the ^m\\\^k\\\A               existing structure of the industry, from which controllers would be appointed at all A^^llevels. No capital expenditure is involved. ^m\\\^L\\\A                     74.  Many vehicles would have to be requisitioned during the precautionary if^^flperiod for the Army and the civil defence services.  The advance printing and I a^^Hdistribution of requisitioning forms would be essential.   The cost of printing  ^^l^LwM               would be about  1,000.75. Under both Programmes X and Y the printing of requisitioning forms I in^^Hwould be completed by 1962. D^^l(f) Medical Services I F/^^H76.

The existing home defence stockpile of medical supplies and hospitalequipment, which is worth about  16 millions, is inadequate in content anddistribution, and a worthwhile improvement could be made at a modest cost.79. Programme X provides for expenditure of about  0-15 million a yearon training and training equipment for forward medical aid, the introduction ofI    fte emergency home nursing scheme at an annual cost of about  30,000 and anH  v xfriprovement in the medical stockpile, on which expenditure would run at  0-35million a year.80. Under Programme Y expenditure on training for forward medical aidwould continue at the current rate of about  0 . 1 million a year. The emergencyhome nursing scheme would be introduced, but annual expenditure of  0-235million on the medical stockpile would permit only marginal improvements in it.(g) Civil Defence OrganisationAdministrative and training costs81. These amount during the current year 1960-61 to  2-593 millions. This P^H^^fl         sum includes the costs of the Ministry of Works in providing various training^^fl schools, stores and depots; the salaries of the Home Office civil defence regionalorganisation; and the cost of running the Civil Defence Staff College and trainingschools.82. Programmes X and Y both envisage keeping expenditure as near to itspresent level as possible.Grants to local authorities83. These amount this year to  5-032 millions, and therefore account for aconsiderable proportion of the total expenditure on civil defence. Grants covera variety of items, but most of the expenditure is in respect of the Civil DefenceCorps.  Grants are paid by the Home Departments, the Health Departments andI   the Ministries of Agriculture and Housing for the maintenance and training of the^^fl Corps, including equipment, uniforms and local authority training and storagepremises.84. Programme X proposes for next year an additional  0-15 millionP^^fl        primarily to take account of increasing costs, particularly of staff, and an additional 0 . 1 million for further equipment for the ambulance and first aid section of theCivil Defence Corps, especially ambulances. Programme Y makes provision forthe first of these items only.85. No provision is made under either programme for the payment of abounty for the Civil Defence Corps, but if this proposal were accepted, additionalcost would be incurred in 1962-63 and later years (see Section VI D).Miscellaneous expenditure86. This covers a wide variety of expenditure, including provision of radiacinstruments, wireless, training vehicles, grants to the Women&apos;s Voluntary Serviceand research.  The total expenditure this year under these various headings is 1-291 millions. ^187. Programme X envisages an increase next year to  1-349 millions. TheP^^H        increase is accounted for mainly by provision for operational wireless for the Civil P^HDefence Corps, training vehicles and equipment. Under Programme Y expenditurenext year would be  1 - 309 millions.Fire Service equipmentI        88.  This year about  0-368 million is being spent on providing trainingequipment ( 0-25 million) and stockpiling emergency supplies of six-inch hose?  ( 0 118 million). H89.  In 1952-54 expenditure on operational equipment ran at about  6 millions^H^lAm year.  A good stock of emergency pumps was accumulated, but the programme^^HjP ? ^was cut short in 1956, and little provision has been made for emergency piping or^^Bt       for water storage.

Programme Y provides an additional  80,000 a year for ^LwMthis purpose.   Neither programme includes expenditure on a bounty or on annual j I ^LyMcamp payments for the Auxiliary Fire Service. These are discussed in Section ^i^k *(h) Warning and Monitoring Organisation ^LwM^k-ym                       91.   The present civil warning system could be brought into operation at ^LyMabout forty-eight hours&apos; notice, and could give warning of a manned bomber attack j I ^LtM^kmm                 to the bulk of the population.  It is inadequate, however, because it does not ^mYM^k-ym                 provide siren cover over country districts, and it has become too slow with the ^mYM^k-w.                increase of aircraft speeds and the threat of ballistic missiles. A system known as ^LyM^k-M                Carrier is being introduced to give warning to selected points within seconds of I ^LyM^LwM                 the detection of an attack.  It will be linked in due course with the Ballistic Missile ^LyMEarly Warning Station at Fylingdales.  The estimated capital cost of the Carrier I ^LyMscheme is about  3 millions.   In addition there will be continuing charges for ^LyM^kmm                 maintenance and rental.  The annual cost falling on the home defence budget ^mYM^k-ym                over the next five years for all these purposes would average  0-66 million under j I ^LyM^k-ym                 Programme X and  0-47 million under Programme Y. ^LyM92. The Royal Observer Corps are trained to monitor and report fall-out, j I ^mjm^LwM but there is no provision for warning the public against fall-out. Twenty-eight of ^LyM^LyM the thirty-one group headquarters and 1,200 out of about 1,950 posts will be built ^LwM^LwM or under construction by 1961. The total cost of completing the building ^LyM^LyM programme and completing the provision of radiac instruments for the Royal ^LwM^LwM                 Observer Corps is about  1-6 millions.93. Programmes X and Y permit the completion of the building programme ^LwM^Lyaym                 by 1963 and the upkeep of the existing warning system.  Programme X provides ^LyMfor the completion of Carrier and for warning cover (against both attack and I wmw.^k-ym                 fall-out) throughout the country by 1964.  Programme Y provides for the ^LyMcompletion of Carrier by 1968 and for country-wide warning cover by 1969. ^LyM^LyM                      94.  Both programmes depend on the use of Post Office communications for ^LwM^LyLyI                passing fall-out information after attack.  Further consideration is being given to ^mYM^kjLm                 methods of transmission where line communications are particularly vulnerable, ^LyMand to the possibility of operating all sirens in the country from a central point I WkYkYiby remote control.

The last published statement of Government policy was given in the 1956 ^k-W.^LyLw                 Defence White Paper, which said that the Government had approved in principle H W-yLMa scheme for evacuating some twelve million people in the priority classes (children, ^LyMTOP SECRET I ^LW
I I   (  ITOP SECRET 15 |Hadolescents, expectant mothers and the aged and infirm) from the major cities to the ^[less thickly populated areas.97. The assumption later adopted that our deterrent bases, mainly in theEastern part of England, would be a first priority for attack in a thermo-nuclear war?     invalidated this scheme.  Early in 1959 an outline alternative scheme was preparedinoviding for the movement of some six million persons in the priority classes fromreduced areas within a smaller number of cities to places in the West and the South- fi^lEast of the country.  This revised scheme was considered by Ministers on severaloccasions, but no decision was reached.98. Conflicting considerations arise in deciding evacuation policy. The bulkof the population must clearly be urged to stay put in a period of tension, just asindustry should be encouraged to keep going for as long as possible up to the time ofattack (Section VI C).  But there are the following points in favour of planning a^^fl voluntary scheme of evacuation for selected priority classes-(a) Evacuation would be more likely to save lives than any other civil defencemeasure (in the absence of specially provided shelters) by reducing thedensity of the population in the most thickly populated areas, wherecasualties from attack would be very great. Without a scheme theGovernment would have practically nothing to offer the inhabitantsof our largest cities as a means of reducing the number of casualties in anuclear attack.(b) Civil defence planning assumes that a major task in war would be to bringhelp to the stricken cities. For that purpose it has been planned to stationmobile units of the civil defence, fire and police forces outside the cities jj^Hand to locate all government headquarters down to civil defence areaheadquarters away from likely targets.   Plans have also been made tomove from the cities staff and resources needed for the wartime operationof services such as shipping and ports, hospitals, railways and oildistribution.   It is hardly consistent to make no plans for the removal ofwomen and children if they wanted to go.(c) An evacuation scheme could not be improvised at short notice. Thefreedom of manoeuvre of any future Government in a period of tensionmight well be restricted if no official scheme were ready to put intooperation should the Government consider it necessary.(d) An announcement that we were abandoning evacuation would be aninnovation in NATO civil emergency planning.  At home it would belikely to lead to demands for an expensive shelter programme.99. On the other hand there are these considerations-(i) The loss of the Eastern half of the country as a reception area necessarilylimits the number and size of evacuation areas. Thus, the six-millionscheme proposes no evacuation from the areas in which the deterrentbases are situated; and a number of cities which were heavily attackedduring the last war (e.g., Plymouth) are also excluded. Some of theareas to be evacuated are small in relation to the destructive power ofthermo-nuclear weapons (being in fact those of an earlier evacuationj scheme related to atom bomb attack).  Moreover they adjoin thicklypopulated areas where no plans for evacuation are contemplated.(ii) Although the six-million scheme would provide for people to be moved IHfrom high risk areas, use would still have to be made for receptionpurposes of areas which are near possible targets or which might in somecircumstances be subjected to heavy fall-out.(iii) People who stayed at home would have food in their own houses. If^^B&apos; they were evacuated, a heavy burden would suddenly be thrown on thefood supply arrangements in the reception areas.  There would be^^H. serious difficulties in adjusting supplies quickly.(iv) Families would be split at a time when they might wish to stay together, j^H^^HK H /jSm and movement of some of the priority classes (particularly women of^^Kr I working age) might tend to disrupt the day-to-day life of the country.To move and house six million people would be bound to cause muchconfusion.TOP SECRET H
16 TOP SECRETmmmm 100.  One imponderable factor is the extent to which an official evacuationscheme, if put into operation, would increase or decrease the risks of unorganised H ^k-WM^m-W                panic evacuation on a scale which might bring the life of the country to a standstill. ?On the one hand, it can be argued that these risks would be increased if the ^k-WMGovernment showed that they recognised that some parts of the country were safer ? ^k-WMthan others, by themselves putting an official evacuation scheme into operation. IMOn the other hand, if there were such a scheme, the Government of the day co^ft*-. I I3MMMappeal to the public sense of duty, state that there was no room in the recepuonr j ^LXwareas for unofficial evacuees and give a warning about the risks from fall-out ^LXw^L\mm\                for people caught in the open; and it might be that their appeal for non-priority ^k-WMclasses to stay put would in these circumstances meet with a considerable response. ^k-WM101. Planning an evacuation scheme would not be expensive; it would ^L-9mprimarily involve the time and effort of central and local government servants and ^k-WMtransport officials. One question to be settled would be whether expenditure ^LXw(estimated at about  40,000 and included in Programme X) should be incurred in I ^LwMthe advance printing of billeting allowance books. ^LwM102. The Government runs the risk of criticism whether it has an evacuation I ^k\\\scheme or not.  If there is a scheme, it may be criticised for its inadequacy; iit, &lt;!lthere is no scheme, the Government may be accused of imprudence oap&apos;jM ^LwMirresponsibility.  But it would be difficult to postpone for very much longer theannouncement of a decision one way or the other.  As pointed out above, the ^k\\\1956 Defence White Paper stated that the Government had approved a scheme ih I ^LwMprinciple. Earlier this year it was explained in Parliament that this proposal was ^LwMbeing reviewed in the light of the latest strategic appreciation; interest in Parliament ^LwMcontinues, and there is also pressure from local authorities and others who are ^LwMgreatly concerned with evacuation policy for the results of this further review to ^LwMbe announced. ^k\\A103. On balance, the Committee consider that it is desirable to plan an ^kwM^L-MM evacuation scheme, and to announce that this is being done. If, however, the ^LwM^LwYW                 Government decide against evacuation, it would be desirable for them to say so I H ^LwM104. If there is to be a scheme, it should be voluntary, and hence the numbers ) I ^LwM^L-MM who would take advantage of it cannot be foreseen. However, it seems reasonable ^L\\A^L-MM                to plan for the evacuation of some six million people, generally on the lines of i I ^k\\Athe outline scheme prepared in 1959.   That scheme was based on earlier ^L\\Aassessments of the weight and nature of the attack, and its details would need to be ^k\\Areconsidered in the light of the latest assessments. By limiting the priority classes ^k\\AWWWW-A                to children up to school-leaving age and mothers of such children and expectant I wMMMmothers (that is, leaving out some 800,000 adolescents, aged and infirm) it would ^LXw^tyWW                be possible to have either more, or somewhat larger, evacuation areas. Thedifficulties referred to at paragraph 99 (i) would not be eliminated, but on the whole I ^m-Wthis would seem to be a desirable modification. I105. The Committee therefore recommend that the preparation of an H ^-\mevacuation scheme generally along the lines of the six-million scheme should be ? ^-\m\approved in principle and an announcement made.^^^1                      106.  Paragraph 117 of the 1956 White Paper on Defence said- ] ^L-W^^^M                     &quot;... Full protection within a few miles of the ground burst of a megaton weapon j II^^^H                     is impracticable. Outside this range protection against blast and heat could be II^^^M                     obtained from shelters similar to those used in the last war.  The danger of II ^LXwfall-out, however, necessitates shelters which can be occupied for periods of II^^^J                     forty-eight hours or more. An ordinary brick dwelling house with nine-inch II^^^H                     walls used to the best advantage reduces gamma radiation by a factor of about | It^k-W-m                      twenty times. Further protection could be obtained by thickening the existing I II^^^fl                     walls and ceilings of roofs of houses. To give a high degree of immunity, the Iideal would be a shelter below the surface of the ground, preferably inside the^.   || . ^LwM.. m 1 &apos;-MM^LX%%m The White Paper went on to say, however, that&quot; to provide this degree of protection | 1^^^H                on a country-wide scale would not be feasible1^L-W                                                    TOP SECRET j ^Lm

This paragraph of the White Paper still holds good, except that with the ^Lm^LwM          scale of attack now assumed, the likely intensity and area of fall-out would generally ^LW^LwM          necessitate a longer occupation of the best available accommodation. ^B^LwM 108.  Denmark, Holland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland have been building^LwM shelters for some years.   Russia is said to have been providing strengthenedmmm ^yements under multi-storey buildings since 1952.  There is much discussion inBB         (Germany and the United States about shelter provision.   If the United States Bj^-^k          embarked on a large shelter programme, it might lead to a revival of interest in the ^B^-^k          subject in this country. ^B109.   Much shelter still exists from the last war, but the amount is ^B^-^L\           steadily decreasing, and a good deal of it would be unsuitable for prolonged ^Boccupation. There is at present useful shelter for only a very small proportion of the ^B^-^Ly           population. ^B^-^L\                110.  If purpose-built shelters or specially strengthened basements were ^Bavailable in cities for protection against blast and heat, they would be likely to save ^Bmany lives outside the area of complete destruction. But to provide such protection ^B?      for a substantial proportion of city dwellers would be beyond our resources. The ^BCommittee do not think it would be practicable to stipulate that basements in all newframe-built structures should be strengthened, since this would provide shelter onBB           only a small scale (and for the most part in the middle of the likely target areas), Bflmmmm B     would almost certainly mean that the whole cost would have to be met by the ^BExchequer, would be likely to lead to demands for shelter elsewhere and would ^B^-^L\           probably need legislation. The Committee are therefore unable to recommend any ^Bspecial provision at the present time for protection against blast and heat. ^B^k^Ly                111.   Shelter against fall-out could secure a large reduction in casualties. In ^B^-^Ly           the estimated attack referred to in Section II the number of deaths from fall-out ^B^-^Ly           might be reduced from thirteen millions to less than one million if measures had been ^B^-^L\           taken in advance to improve the protection of buildings, if sufficient provisions had ^B^-^Ly           been laid in for a two weeks&apos; stay, if the public had been warned of the approach of ^B^-^L\     I     fall-out and if those concerned remained continuously in their refuge for up to two ^Bweeks and then spent not more than fifteen hours in getting clear of the fall-out area.112.   Sample surveys have been carried out in a number of local authority areas^L^L\   H    of the protective factors against fall-out provided by houses and by larger buildings ^B^-^L\           which could be used as communal fall-out shelters.  These sample surveys show ^B^-^Ly           that the position varies greatly from area to area, and suggest that, if the maximum ^B^-^L\           reduction of casualties were to be achieved, it would be necessary to carry out ^B^-^Ly           a detailed survey of each area and to make a careful plan for the use of communal ^B^-^L\     j     shelters by those whose homes provided a low standard of protection. ^B^-^Ly     I          113.  If a nation-wide survey were decided on, local authorities would need ^B^-^L\           temporary additional assistance. It would also be necessary to consider what other ^B^-^Ly           measures might be necessary in peacetime-for example, whether anything should ^B^-^L\           be done in the way of stockpiling containers for water in buildings earmarked as ^B^-^Ly          suitable for use as communal shelters. Experience gained from the sample surveys ^B^-^Ly          suggests that the cost of a nation-wide survey over a period of years might ^B^^B I well amount to  2-3 millions, of which 75 per cent, would fall to be met by way of ^B^-^Ly           Exchequer grant.114. A number of unresolved questions remain. To give some examples- ^-MH how is the use of buildings for communal shelters to be fitted in with plans Bfl^-^Ly for evacuation and care of the homeless? At what stage is it to be assumed that ^B^-^Ly the movement to communal shelters would take place? What are to be the ^B^-^L\ assumptions about the protective factor for houses below which families would be ^B^-^Ly advised to leave their homes? What plans are to be made for the use of industrial ^B^-^Ly premises? Would physical work be put in hand in peacetime, and what would be ^B^-^Ly the order of the cost? Further examination of these and other difficult problems ^B^-^L\          is needed before any suggestions can be put to Ministers that local authorities ^B]    generally should be asked to survey their areas in detail. ^BmW I I ^115. In view of what is being done about shelters in other countries, and ^B^^fl          in view of the size of the contribution which shelters might make towards the^-^Ly          saving of lives, the Committee think it right that this examination should take ^Btop secret H
TOP SECRET W !?place; but for the present Ministers are asked only to note that these studies arecontemplated and that a further submission will be made to them in due course.116. Whatever was done by the Government and by local authorities, muchwould depend in the end on the public&apos;s improvising fall-out protection in theirown homes. The Committee think that the necessary guidance to the publicon how to do this should be prepared in greater detail than is at present availablyso that at a time of emergency it would be ready and could be given public^CflDand could indeed be made available in the meantime if members of the publicasked forC.-Industry117. Although some of the larger industrial concerns have formed civildefence units in response to Government requests, there is no general policy forthe conduct of industry in a period of tension preceding nuclear attack or in thesurvival period afterwards. Industrial organisations taking part in civil defencepreparations have frequently sought guidance on the role of industry in homedefence planning.118. In a period of tension the execution of such measures as mobilisationor evacuation would cause difficulties for industry, but it is important for themaintenance of the economy and of public morale at such a time that industryshould keep going to the best of its ability for as long as possible up to the moment ^^flof attack. The Government of the day would have to encourage industry to dothis, but the task would be simplified if industry were given guidance on theselines in peacetime.119. After an attack there could be no hope of maintaining the normal Ieconomy of the country.  Industry and the public generally will probably realisethis, particularly if measures are taken to educate them in the realities of nuclearwarfare. Nevertheless it would be essential to take early steps to maintain orrestore certain basic industries and services (for example, food, water, power Iand communications), and the Committee recommend that some expenditureshould be incurred on these in peace. Various measures for these industries havebeen mentioned in Section V, but further consultations will be necessary in thecase of some industries, for example, electricity. j120. Other industries, for example, building, textiles, chemicals and^^fl                engineering, would be needed in the restoration period; but expenditure couldnot be contemplated in peace on physical preparations for their restoration afterattack, which would depend on the maximum improvisation with the resources Iavailable at the time.  It is, however, important to identify in advance the key^^fl industries likely to be needed at various stages after attack, in order to giveregional commissioners guidance in the allocation of resources and manpower. HConsultations with industry would be necessary for this purpose.   Apart fromthe basic survival industries, notably food and water, industrial organisations Ishould be told that the main task is to plan a control organisation which couldimprovise the best use of available resources after attack. j121. The Committee therefore recommend that an approach should be madeto industry on the following lines-(a) Industrial production and other forms of work should continue as far Has possible in the period after the institution of preparatory homedefence measures up to the time of attack.(b) During the period immediately after attack first efforts should be directedto restoring those services essential to the maintenance of life.(c) Production in other industries essential to the early stages of the restorationperiod should be resumed as soon as possible by the maximumimprovisation with the resources available at the time. I(d) The co-operation of industry is needed in peacetime-(i) to assist in the identification of essential undertakings; and(ii) to examine what measures might be taken in peace to assistspeedier restoration of production in these industries afteJ&amp;)Hattack, with maximum improvisation with resources availably Hthe time.TOP SECRET
HI&apos; I^LW m T0P SECRET 19 ! lmm\\Wwum i mmmUJM D.-Civil Defence Corps and Auxiliary Fire Service^L\\W Functions and organisation ^L^LM^LwM 122.  The Civil Defence Corps, although planned as a national body, consists ^-^Lmof a number of local divisions recruited, trained and equipped by county, countymum I   ?&quot;(BiT(&gt;uSh and large burgh councils.   Its 350,000 members are divided into five ^L^LX^-m        K sections-headquarters, wardens, ambulance and first aid, welfare, and rescue.^^^h123. The Corps is supplemented by industrial civil defence units raised by^-m managements of the larger firms, and consisting at present of about 200,000^mm volunteers.124. The purpose of the Civil Defence Corps is to provide trained civilianmanwpower to man the lower levels in the control system, to supply the higher levels IIhb^hIof control with information, to guide and instruct the public and to care for thevast number of survivors likely to be injured, homeless and destitute. These arefunctions which cannot be fully discharged by any other body at present in being.The police would be reinforced in war by special constables, but even so would befully committed in their primary duty of maintaining law and order, and wouldindeed themselves need support for this purpose from the armed forces. A largepart of the Service man-power which would be made available to support homedefence would come from the Territorial Army. Of the planned strength of 186,000^-m for the Territorial Army at least 100,000 would be available to support the civilpower. They would assist the police; and there would be innumerable tasks thatcould be performed by disciplined bodies of men working under their own officers.But the Territorial Army is not so organised as to be able to replace the civil defence .||^^Hservices, since some areas of the country have no Service units; units would in anyevent be likely to be used away from their peacetime stations, and would lack thelocal knowledge which, for example, wardens and civil defence headquarters must^-m have; and the advantages of a disciplined force would disappear if the force were BKJ^-m widely dispersed into small groups.  A flourishing and efficient Corps could playan important part in maintaining public morale in a period of tension and inH     mitigating the effects of an attack.125. There is a strong case for maintaining a Civil Defence Corps, but theHome Departments envisage the need for a review of the Corps as it exists atpresent, since of a paper strength of 350,000, probably not more than 150,000 haveundertaken serious&apos;training, and only a small proportion are of high enough quality j^^Hto be capable of holding posts of responsibility. There is clearly scope here forconsidering some tightening up of training requirements.126. The Committee recommend that in the light of their review of homedefence policy the functions and organisation of the Civil Defence Corps shouldbe examined in the general context of the man-power resources likely to be availablefor home defence in war. Such an examination could best be carried out under the jaegis of the Civil Defence Committees, and should include the Auxiliary FireService. m^hIBounty scheme ^-^-\127. Proposals have been put to the Committee for the payment of a bounty,on Territorial Army lines, to members of the Civil Defence Corps.128. If there were to be such a scheme it would be necessary to put strict j^^Hconditions on it.  It would be restricted to members who gave an undertaking toserve full time in war-an undertaking which is not at present required frommembers. It might also be provided, for example, that the bounty would be paidonly when a suitable training test had been passed; that enlistment would be for ??^??1m^m\ I    a    ec* Per^;  f years&gt; during which a minimum amount of training would have &apos; ^^^1to be carried out; and that volunteers would then pass into a reserve, where theywould do only refresher training but would still be liable for call-up.^?1 129.  The cost of a bounty scheme would depend on the number of those &quot;^^H^Bl ^prepared to accept the necessary obligations and able to pass&apos;the necessarv test.^^H;H ^Fhe Home Office consider that 50,000 initially would be a good start. If thisnumber qualified; and the bounty were  20&apos;a year for senior officers,  15 for juniorofficers and  10 for other ranks, and half these rates for reservists, the initial costTOP SECRET58148 d
TOP I ^[would be of the order of  0 . 75 million in a full year. If the total number qualifying   j Ifor a bounty eventually rose to 200,000, the total expenditure involved would besome  2 millions.130. The main argument for a bounty is that it would be a visible andimpressive symbol of the Government&apos;s belief in the value of civil defence.  It   f1would boost the morale of the Corps. It would in particular remove the grievaflt\ &apos;that members of the Corps have no treatment in conditions of service comparaxfil mwith the Territorial Army, with whom they associate increasingly in exercises andtraining.  The introduction of a bounty scheme should make it easier to carry      ^^flthrough a reorganisation designed to improve the standards and efficiency of the 1Corps as a whole, and in particular to provide a corps d&apos;elite--a nucleus ofwell-trained men and women who could act as leaders if war came.131. It is argued on the other hand that a tightening up of training Irequirements and the imposition of an obligation to serve full time in war wouldprobably make little practical difference to the situation if war came, and that abounty scheme would therefore not be worthwhile.  It is also pointed out that it |is difficult to estimate the cost, though it might be possible to limit the numbersqualifying for payments. If the scheme attracted a widespread response, the cost    I ^^flmight exceed present forecasts; and the concession of a bounty to a non-military waorganisation might well lead to demands from other voluntary bodies for similartreatment.132. Any bounty scheme would clearly have to be extended to the AuxiliaryFire Service. About 16,000 men have volunteered for it, but more are needed, 11especially as the Royal Air Force reservists who were trained for fire service inwar between 1954 and 1958 are a dwindling body. If 10,000 men (including somenew volunteers) qualified for a bounty, the cost would be about  0-15 million ayear. There would moreover be a strong case for paying a proportion ? ^^flof volunteers to attend camp at the Home Office schools provided originally forthe Royal Air Force reservists. (No comparable expenditure would arise inrespect of the Civil Defence Corps.) The cost of camp payments in the first year^^Hj would be about  50,000. If the scheme proved successful, the cost of bounty andcamp payments might in time amount to  0-4 million a year.133. The payment of bounties to the Civil Defence Corps and the AuxiliaryFire Service might prompt a demand to extend bounties to the National Hospital IIService Reserve, although the circumstances are not quite the same as in the CivilDefence Corps.  If, however, this had to be conceded, the annual cost might be II 50,000. The Home Office think that there would be good grounds for resisting^tggM any other application, in particular from industrial civil defence.^^H&apos; 134.  The Committee recommend that the proposed review of the CivilDefence Corps and the Auxiliary Fire Service should include consideration of the Idesirability of a bounty scheme.I^I^Ih i^i^ilE.-Consultation with other Governments135. Planning in certain fields, such as shipping and oil, involves consultation   &lt; Iwith other Governments under the auspices of NATO.  On the initiative of theAmericans, Germans and Dutch the place of civil emergency planning in NATOdefence arrangements is now under consideration, and it has been suggested that wmW^Athe present NATO structure should be revised in order to give the same prominenceto civil emergency planning as to military planning on the grounds that it forms an Iintegral part of the deterrent. It seems right that we should continue to play our Ipart in NATO civil emergency planning, though we might try to temper the pace Ito suit ourselves. I136. Although the planned NATO Central Supplies Agency would advise Imember countries on supply problems in war and co-ordinate demands where I ,necessary, the United Kingdom should try to make arrangements for the  Hprocurement of food in war from overseas. The Committee recommend that wJP jflshould consult the Governments of the countries to which we should chiefly look Ifor supplies, particularly within the Commonwealth. I j^^HTOP SECRET I ^[
II F.-Manning of Government Headquarters \^^fl 9 137.  Headquarters down to sub-region would be staffed mainly from theWMM H Civil Service and the armed forces.   Staff are being earmarked for the central WXWM%jkWM Government but not for lower formations.  The headquarters will not function wkwM-MWm efficiently in war unless some common-user staff have been trained beforehand, wXjmWWW /Specially for communications and intelligence duties.   Voluntary training has WkWM^LwM   I oJen undertaken for regional and sub-regional headquarters, but so far the ? j^HWXWM   I voluntary system has proved generally unsatisfactory and no training has been WkWmTkYkW   I done for the central Government headquarters. j \m\WMwKyM% i 138   The detailing of staff for training or the offer of greater inducements WWuWkWmTt   I to encourage volunteers would both present difficulties, and the Committee think WjmWkvkW   I that greater efforts should be made to obtain volunteers by traditional means, at^^111 least initially.G.-Accommodation ^Lw\w\vkM. i I 139.  The Government and local authorities would need to take over many WXVmTkYkW   I premises in an emergency for such purposes as emergency hospitals, sheltering and wAWMwkjkW   I feeding the homeless and establishing bases for operational forces.  The register ^LwMwkwkM which was started in 1949 for such premises is out of date, and the Committee ^LvMwLwLM H recommend that it should be reviewed in the light of current assumptions about WXjMwLwM the nature of an attack and home defence measures. mXWMtLvLw.

Those members of the Committee who do not take the minority view mjKjMU-mU 1 described in paragraphs 17 and 18 of this report consider that the broad choicemLwM I before Ministers is between affording some increase in expenditure on the scalewkwkW 1 indicated in Programme X, and restraining expenditure as near as possible to the j!WWW 1 Present level&gt; as indicated in Programme Y. The choice&apos; depends on balancing thewLwLw 1 burden of the additional expenditure under Programme X against the advantagesMwM  I which it would provide in the form of a coherent and publicly defensible policy. j jwKyM  I        144.  The effect of the choice of programme on the public and on those 1wLwLW 1 concerned with home defence is important, since the Committee consider thatMwM 1 home defence has reached a point where it needs re-energising, if it is not to decline.WXWLW ? Apart from some increasingly perfunctory references in the annual Defence WhiteWXjM   I Paper, there has for some years been no comprehensive public statement by theWmwM   I Government of its attitude to home defence; and many people have tended to-MWm   I conclude that the Government has lost faith in the practicability of this country&apos;sWwXm   I surviving a nuclear attack.  It has become increasingly difficult to maintain the^LjM   I enthusiasm of the civil defence services.  Plans for maintaining the government^LwM ^organisation below the central Government are still at a rudimentary stage, the^^111 ^Vrrun&amp; ana&quot; monitoring system is inadequate, little has been done to safeguardwLwLM water supplies after attack and there are obvious deficiencies in planning in suchwkjkW fields as evacuation and shelter.TOP SECRET
H ^ 11HI 22 TOP SECRET145. The paragraphs that follow illustrate the consequences of the choice Ibetween Programmes X and Y by summarising their effects on the measures Iinvolving expenditure described in Section V, and by examining their implications ^k\\Afor the handling of the policy issues discussed in Section VI. ^LwM146. As the analysis in Section V shows, Programme Y would enable a start IIto be made on filling some of the gaps in the present programme.  In particuLss | Iit makes some provision for subordinate headquarters and for Post OfrS4|!B ^Lmmjcommunications in the control organisation; for resuming the purchase oft ^LXwemergency equipment for water supplies; for a scheme for instructing the public I ^LXwin first-aid and emergency home nursing; for printing food ration books; and for I ^k-wmextending the warning system so as eventually to provide warning of attack and j Ifall-out over the whole country. Over the five-year period, as existing commitments I jwere worked through and there was increasing scope for redeployment, it would j Ibe possible to secure a better balanced programme within broadly the present I Ifigure of expenditure.147. But the analysis in Section V shows the wry considerable defects of I IProgramme Y as compared with Programme X- ^k-wm^L-9m                        (a)   (i) Under Programme Y the regional headquarters would not be II ^L-9m^LX-W                                       completed until 1968 and the subregional headquarters not until   I ^LXw^k-9m                                        1971. The subordinate controls would not be ready for twenty   I ^LXwyears. There would be no wireless backing from region down to IS&lt; -area. This means that the abihty of the central Government to   I ^LXWTWwM                                        exercise authority from emergency headquarters, on which   H ^L\m\^k-wm                                        considerable sums have already been spent, would be severely I ^LXw^k-wm                                        restricted for a long time and would even then depend on   I ^LXwcommunications which would be very vulnerable.^L-9m                              (ii) Programme X, on the other hand, would enable the regional and j I ^LXw^k-wm                                        sub-regional headquarters to be completed by 1965, and the ^LXw^k-wm                                        programme for subordinate controls to be completed by 1968. 11 ^LXw^k-wm                                        Wireless links would be provided from regional headquarters ^LXw^k-M down to sub-area by 1969. I ^kXw^k-wm                            (iii) Also, under Programme Y the essential broadcasting services would I^k-wm                                        not be completed before 1969, whereas under Programme X they ^m-w^LXw                                        would be completed by 1966. ^LXw^L-9m                         (b)   (i) Although Programme Y includes some provision for drinking water ^LmU^k-wm                                          supplies, the amount is so modest that it would take many years j I ^LXW^k-9m                                        before even a minimum programme could be achieved.  Similar ^LXw^k-wm                                        considerations apply to fire-fighting equipment. ^LXw(ii) Programme X would enable some worthwhile provision to be made in 11 ^-\m^LXw                                        both these important matters. ^LXw^L-9m                         (c)   (i) The Ballistic Missile Early Warning Station at Fylingdales will be able j ^L-W^k-wm to give warning of attack by ballistic missiles in 1963. Under I ^LXw^k*wm                                        Programme Y this warning could not be transmitted to the whflfe I^k-wm                                        population until five years after the Station had come into I ^LXw^k-wm                                        operation; and it would not be possible to grve public warni|gl ^LXw^Lwm                                        of attack and warning against fall-out over the whole country ! ^ MM^m-W                             (ii) Programme X would enable the Fylingdales warning to be given to the I ^-\mwhole population by 1964.   It would also enable warnings I ^m\M^k-wm                                        against fall-out to be given by the same yeas- ^L\m\(d) Programme Y would not permit the final completion of the ports i ^-mWemergency scheme before 1980.

HI * HTOP SECRET 23P^H 148.  It is the view of a majority of the Committee that Programme X is the??J minimum needed to provide a coherent and publicly defensible policy; and that if??J Ministers accepted this programme, it would then be open to them, if they felt itI^HJ appropriate, to make a comprehensive statement about home defence policy. If,B     on tne otrier hand, the decision should be in favour of Programme Y, the Committee??J do not consider that Ministers would be in a good position to volunteer a??J /gpjnprehensive statement of policy, having regard to the deficiencies of this \WW\W??J vpTogramme to which attention is drawn above.   Nor do they consider that a??J programme on this scale would be sufficient to counter the present lack of interestHHJ among local authorities and others concerned in home defence planning.P^H 149.  The action to be taken on the policy issues discussed in Section VI also W\\\WHHJ has to be considered against this background. The recommendations made by theHHJ Committee on these issues would in general be a good deal easier to carry out if flH^iMinisters decided on Programme X, and if some general statement of policy were Is^l150. For example, the Committee have explained why they think that in anyHHJ event some statement on evacuation policy cannot be deferred for long; but, unlessHHJ I the Government were in a position to make a comprehensive statement on homeHHJ defence policy, the announcement that an evacuation scheme was to be preparedHHJ could well lead to embarrassing questions about other aspects of home defence.P^^J A number of other proposals-the suggested approach to industry about policy??J in the precautionary period and after attack; guidance to local authorities aboutthe use of schools and other premises in an emergency; our role in NATO homeWWW mW     defence planning; the attraction of volunteers to man the control organisation- nJlH^iWWW    1     could best be carried out in the context of a publicly known and coherent ilH^B^Government policy on home defence. Furthermore, such a policy would providethe most convenient basis on which to deal with the printing of food ration booksP^^fl and the introduction of the emergency home nursing scheme, both of which it isrecommended should be carried out whichever programme is adopted. Theproposed reviews of the Civil Defence Corps and of shelter policy would notimmediately raise the question of public presentation, but they might well involve iH^iH     consultation with local authorities and others outside Government circles.H VIII.-CONCLUSIONS151. The Committee all believe that some provision should be made forP^^H carrying on the government of the country in nuclear war, and that the provision P^^HH I of emergency headquarters for the central Government and of a regionalorganisation should be completed.P^^J 152.  There is a minority view that other home defence preparations haveWWW I no P^ace m our defence policy, since we could not afford to undertake preparationson a scale that would influence the public&apos;s attitude to the deterrent policy in aperiod of tension, still less provide adequate protection against attack. Thosewho hold this view consider that our limited resources are best spent on maintainingan effective deterrent, but they nevertheless recognise that it would be politically | j H^Himpracticable to abandon home defence entirely at the present time. They considerthat expenditure for this purpose should be severely restricted, and progressively |^f^ft reduced as this becomes politically possible.153.  The view of the majority of the Committee is that home defencepreparations are an integral part of the deterrent policy, primarily because of their 1jP^^| potential value in steadying public opinion in support of this policy in a period^^?f ?     f tension.  Some of the Committee also think that the Government has a dutyto take measures to mitigate the consequences to the civil population in global H^HmmmmM war, and that home defence preparations are justified in order to increase the P^^H9   chances of survival if a war were to come. In practice, measures which would be HHIjustified on this latter ground are largely the same as those which would be ofvalue on the former ground, namely to steady public opinion in a period of tension.^^|^ i *54.  ^e Committee have considered two possible programmes of expenditurein relation to the majority view.   If expenditure were held broadly at its presentHHJ level over the next five years, on the lines of Programme Y, some improvements couldTOP SECRET
24 TOP SECRET wbe made in home defence preparations; but these would still suffer from serious ^L-9mlimitations. The Government could not show that they had a coherent and 9-wMreasonable home defence policy; it would be difficult to give a positive lead in home^L\mm\                defence or to make a comprehensive statement of policy; and little could be done to ?remedy the present lack of interest among local authorities and others concerned in j ^k-wmhome defence planning. ^L-9m^LV-M                      155.  These difficulties would be reduced if some moderate increase in h&lt; m) jdefence expenditure could be allowed, on the lines of Programme X. This would H -9-wmpermit significant improvements within a reasonable time.156. Whichever programme is adopted, there are certain other measures, H ^L-9mWMMMM                 which would not involve significant expenditure, at least during 1961-62, which the I WMMMmajority of the Committee consider should be taken.

HI I^Lm TOP SECRET 25^LjM Appendix AMmW I l)^SESSMENT OF WE1GHT AND EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR ATTACK ^LMmMmf mWMumUmm \mmMuMmt Weight of attack mWMW-WM 1.  A Soviet attack would aim to put this country out of the war by the use ^LyM^LwM of nuclear weapons.  The Soviet already have the ability to do this as part of aW-WM general attack on the West, and by 1963 they could do so by using missiles alone. WXjM^LwM 2.  They would probably give first priority to our nuclear bomber bases and mwXji^mm\ \ offensive missile sites. There are now.about seventy of these targets, and under ^-WW-WM present defence policy they are likely to remain (in roughly their present number wkjmWkWM and distribution) the primary targets for an enemy attack at least until the later mXWM^LwM 1960s. The error of missiles successfully fired will probably not exceed ^-1 mile, ^-UMmM but in order to have a reasonable assurance of success the Soviet Union might WAjM^kjm well initially launch two weapons against each military target, and might make ^LwMWmwM follow-up attacks. For maximum effect the Soviet would probably use ground-burst TArM^11 3-megaton weapons.   An initial attack on this scale would not, comparatively ^Ljm^LtM speaking, cause a great number of casualties from blast and heat, but with presentWxjM | home defence preparations fall-out would account for millions of deaths, the ^LjM^krM number depending largely on the wind direction at the time of attack. In addition, ^mTMmmTM I the Soviet Union, in order to ensure the elimination of this country from the struggle, ^mTM^krM would probably also attack centres of population, the seat of government and major ^mTMWatmA ports, and two 3-megaton weapons might be launched on London and one on each ^mjM^LjM of say fifteen other large centres of population.  On these assumptions the initial W\jMWXjM onslaught on bases and centres of population would consist of not less than one ^LjM^Ljm hundred and fifty 3-megaton weapons directed largely at the Eastern half of ^LyM-MWM England and the Midlands, but with isolated targets on the West Coast and in l^^lWAJAJi Scotland. ^LjmMmmM. 3.  Towards the end of the 1960s the number of military targets in this country Mm\m\^Ljm would decrease, if there were by then few or no identifiable deterrent bases in the ^LmWUnited Kingdom. In that case the Soviet Union would no doubt concentrate their WAmW^mmW attack against cities. In order to have a reasonable assurance of success, the Soviet ^mmWm^LW Union might launch six 3-megaton weapons on London and one each on perhaps^mmW I twenty other centres of population. Although it is difficult to be specific, it seems MmwmmrAWt likely that a much smaller attack might well suffice to put this country out of the WmwMmv-wM war, but it seems only prudent to assume that the Soviet would want to make sure. ^LmYM^k^Lt 4.  Any assessment of enemy plans must be speculative; but the Soviet Union^mWm has the ability to launch a crippling attack against both military and civil targets WmmWWWmM in this country simultaneously with a general attack on the West, and it is therefore^LmYM I necessary to consider the worst that might happen. wkjkmWAmW 5.  it seems unlikely that the Soviet would plan to use either chemical or ^LmW^LmW biological warfare against targets in the United Kingdom. WkjAWEffects of attack Wmmm^L^Lt 6.  The effects of a nuclear attack on this country would depend on the^krM ] weight of weapons used, the choice of targets, the protection provided for theWkWM population, e.g., by means of evacuation or shelter, and the prevailing weather^LwM conditions, and in particular the wind direction and strength.  Any estimate ofWajaM the effects of a nuclear attack is inevitably somewhat arbitrary. The wind direction^LtM alone could greatly alter the picture.  The following paragraphs illustrate whatm^mm. might happen with the most common Westerly wind.^LjM 7.  If nuclear deterrent bases and cities were attacked on the scale envisaged inWkWM paragraph 2, then in the absence of general evacuation or shelter for the population,^kmm the casualties from all causes, including fall-out, might amount to over 20 millionsMmTM &apos; filled and about 4 millions seriously injured or sick. If the attack were confined to^kwM twenty-one cities, then on the same assumptions about 12 million people would bemWM killed and over 4 million would be injured or sick.mmmt TOP SECRET^-M 58148 ^k^M

If a scheme for evacuating say 6 million people from centres of population EmMhad been successfully carried out, the number killed in either of the assumed patterns ^L%Mof attack might be reduced by about 4 million and the seriously injured by about ^LwmwMJM                 i-i million. MXWM9. Out of the estimated total of over 20 million deaths resulting from an attack ^Lw\on bases and cities no less than 13 millions would be caused by fall-out. MamNof ^LWM^LwM                 these casualties could be avoided if it were economically and physically practivSKfc ^??hto provide shelter against fall-out: in the best case the reduction might be as much^LwM                      12 million. ^LwM10. On the assumptions adopted fall-out would be most widespread in the ^LwM^LwM Midlands and the Eastern half of England, but other areas might be affected, ^LwMfMXm depending on the targets selected. In the areas worst affected by fall-out various MXWM^LwM services, vehicles and stores of food and fuel might be intact, but they would be ^mWM^LwM inaccessible, perhaps for a considerable time. In the rest of the country there would ^mWMwMxM be gross over-crowding resulting from movement of people from the cities before MXwM^mWM attack, whether or not there were an official evacuation scheme, and the arrival after ^mWM^LwM attack of the injured and homeless. The life of the country would be severely ^mWMWmjM disrupted, and resources of food, water, transport, fuel and other supplies would H wMXW^LwM have to be carefully husbanded. Distribution of resources would be a major ^LwM^mWM problem. There might be sufficient food to provide survivors, on average, with an ^mWMwMW adequate but spartan diet; but the distribution difficulties might leave some areas wM-M^LwM very short of food. Emergency feeding would have to be improvised on a large scale.^mWM Water supplies, power and fuel resources and transport would probably suffice for ^mWMmXwM essential needs, if certain minimum precautions had been taken. Given adequate wkWm^LwM labour and two or three days&apos; warning of attack, the emergency ports system could ^LwM^mWM probably handle most imports on a scale required for survival, although there would ^LwMmXwM be difficulty over bulk cargoes of grain. For a considerable time after attack wMmM^LwM telephones and telegraph services could be maintained at only about 5 per cent, of^LwM their normal capacity, and would have to be reserved for essential purposes. The ^LwMMXwM armed forces would probably have to help the surviving police forces to maintain I cq ^Lwm^LwM law and order. The effects of attacks on the scale discussed above and the prospects I x mXwm^-WM of survival after attack could be affected by the home defence measures taken I 5 ^LwMMXwM in peace.
