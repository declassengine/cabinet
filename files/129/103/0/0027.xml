H.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 177 COPY NO.29th November, I960CABINETHOUSING policy memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand Minister for Welsh AffairsHOUSING TO LETIn C. (60) 96 (paragraphs 36-47) I drew attention to the urgent need toresuscitate the building of houses for letting at economic rents.    I pointedout that there was no early prospect of private builders coming back into theletting field, and suggested that the only way of making progress would befor the Government to be prepared to lend money, at current rates ofinterest, to approved housing trusts or associations willing to build to letwithout subsidy and on a non-profit making basis.2.      Since then I have put forward a limited scheme which would enable us to make a start in the near future on building to let by such associations.An outline of the scheme is given in the annex to this paper.3.      Briefly, it envisages that the Treasury should be prepared to lend upto  25 millions, at the rate of interest currently applicable to loans to localauthorities, to finance schemes by housing associations for the building ofhouses to be let at cost rents.    Any borrowings would be subject to myapproval, and I would have to be satisfied that both the scheme and theassociation were sound.    I should not normally be prepared to authoriselending for houses costing more than  3, 500 all-in, and in general I would look for a lower cost.     Rents of such houses would, at the current rate ofinterest, range from about  2 15s. a week for a two-bedroomed flat to 4 15s. a week for a family house with garage;   and these should be withinthe capacity of families in the income range of  14 a week upwards.4.      The scheme is essentially a pump-priming operation to demonstrate,first, that there is an effective demand for the renting of medium pricednew houses or flats;   second, that people are prepared to pay cost rents inorder to secvire such a house or flat;   and third, that the Government havp apolicy other than municipalisation for the provision and management ofrented houses.5.     My proposals have been considered by the Housing Policy Committee,and discussion showed general agreement that they would make a valuable,though modest, contribution towards securing more rented accommodation,and that they had considerable political attraction as an alternative to theOpposition^ policy of municipalisation.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer,however, has reservations;   and it was agreed that my proposals should besubmitted to the Cabinet with the support of the Committee generally, butreserving the position of the Chancellor.-1-SECRET
6.      In order to meet some of the Chancellor&apos;s difficulties, I havedeliberately made my scheme a very limited one, covering not more than12,000-1 5,000 houses, and I envisage that it would be spread over a periodof five years, at the end of which time it would be reviewed.    I also propose that houses built under the scheme should rank against the housing programme in the public sector, so that it would not mean any additionto the programme.7.      I understand that the Chancellor&apos;s main objection to my scheme isthat for the Public Works Loans Eoard to lend money to housing associationsat the same rate as they charge to local authorities would entail &quot;concealedsubsidy&quot;.     But houses to let built by housing associations will under my proposals be in substitution for houses built by local authorities - some of whose present tenants could afford cost rents.     Purchase for owner occupation does not meet the need of everyone who can afford what a housecosts.    If the authorities are left to build all the rented houses that are needed, they get the same money (except that they borrow in the market ifthey can) at the same rate - and they would be paid Exchequer subsidy as &apos;well.    It is part of the approved subsidy proposals that authorities will getsubsidy for all the houses they build; it is their function to build for thosewho cannot afford the full cost of a house.    Surely we do not want toencourage more directly subsidised housing than is necessary?    For inthis lies the real issue - unless we are prepared to do something now tobreak out of the subsidy net in which virtually all new building to let has for so long been enmeshed, we shall have no choice but to acquiesce in aposition in which housing supply is increasingly divided between owner-occupation and municipal subsidised housing.8.      I believe we should do something now, and that my scheme, modestthough it is, will at least make a start in the way we ought to go.Accordingly I ask the Cabinet to approve my proposals, and for authorityto be given for necessary provisions to be included in the forthcomingHousing Bill dealing with subsidies.IMPROVEMENT AND CONVERSION OF OLDER HOUSES9.      I have put forward two proposals to the Housing Policy Committeeto encourage the improvement and conversion of older houses with the aid of grant by making the return to owners on their expenditure more attractive.    They are:-(i)     To increase the permitted addition to the rent that may becharged after improvement from 8 per cent to I2jr per cent of the owner&apos;s share of the cost of improvement.(ii)     To relax the rent conditions attaching to the taking of grantso as to permit the owner, in the case of a conversion oran improved decontrolled house, to let the property at a free rent after 3 years instead of 10 as at present.10.    The Committee have approved proposal (i), but doubts were raisedabout (ii) on the ground that to reduce the period of the rent conditionscould be represented as an extension of decontrol and might result in theimpression that the Government were going back on their Election pledgethat there would be no further decontrol of rents in the present Parliament.
11.     My proposal does not in fact involve any extension of decontrol what-soever.    It would apply only to existing houses and flats which have beendecontrolled by rateable value under Section 11(1) of the Rent Act, 19 57, or have or will become decontrolled on vacant possession under Section 11(2);and to conversions providing new units of accommodation which have beenfree from control since 1954.    These decontrolled properties becomesubject to a rent limitation for a period because up to half the cost ofimprovement or conversion has been paid for at public expense, and it is felt to be wrong that the owners should be able to appropriate forthwith theadded value paid for by the public.    Shortening of the period for the rentlimitation involves therefore no more than an alteration of the grantconditions, and does not affect the status of the property under the RentAct at all.12.    Under existing law the requirement that the rent limitation should run for 10 years is qualified by a right to the owner to sell, though for owner-occupation only, at the end of 3 years without being required to repay the improvement grant.    As things are, therefore, the tenant in suchcases cannot count on any greater security than 3 years (subject of course to the terms of his lease).    To allow the owner to charge a free rent at theend of 3 years would in principle be a logical extension of the right to sell,and would not threaten the tenant with any less security than he possessesat present.    On the contrary, his position might well be improved, as theowner would have an incentive to continue letting, instead of trying eitherto force the sitting tenant to buy after 3 years or to evict him in order tosell with vacant possession to an owner-occupier.13.    For these reasons, my proposal can be defended against any suggestion that it involves an extension of decontrol or any necessaryworsening of the position of sitting tenants.    But I can see that it could berepresented as a measure that would operate to the disadvantage ofdecontrolled tenants on the ground that the owner would have two strings tohis bow - letting as well as sale (for owner-occupation) after 3 years as a means of putting pressure on the sitting tenant to pay a higher rent as theprice of avoiding eviction.14. This argument could not be brought to bear in the case ofconversions, for here (save very exceptionally) there is no sitting tenant.New dwellings are being created, and new lettings made for the first time.Prospective tenants would be under no compulsion to accept the terms offered for 3 years without knowing what rent they would have to paythereafter, and could bargain accordingly.15. Conversions are important, as they mean the provision of moresmaller units, and these are badly needed in the current Rent Actsituation.    They are in general a good deal more costly than ordinaryimprovements;   and also less easy to sell than the single house.    Ownersare therefore reluctant to incur substantial expenditure on this accountso long as they are held down to a limited rent for as much as 10 years.16.    I have considered whether my proposal could be limited toconversions only.    There are however two difficulties about this.    Itwould mean treating one form of decontrolled property differently from-3-secret
another, and for this there is no case in principle.     Secondly, thoughconversions are more important than ordinary improvements in the sense that they provide additional accommodation, no distinction has hitherto been made between them in the policy steadily pursued since 1954 to secure a wider vse of grants;  and I think we should be on difficult ground if we now sought to provide a greater incentive to one than the other.    Accordingly,I am convinced that we must treat both alike.17.    I still think that it would be sense to allow a free rent after 3 years as an alternative to sale;  and I believe it would help the housing situation.Nevertheless, I recognise that people would seize on it to try to stir up newstorms about free rents.    I should like to include this provision in theBill, but if my colleagues think it would be too provocative I am ready to drop it.    I would welcome the Cabinefs views.H.

Outline of a scheme for Government loans to housing associations for the building of more houses to letUnder the scheme the Treasury would make available a maximum of 25 millions to be lent to approved housing associations by the Public works loans Board atthe same rates of interest as they charge from time to timeto local authorities and for the same periods.     This money would finance the building of houses to let at cost rents to families in the income range of 14 a week and upwards.2.      Houses to be built with the benefit of loan must be of a cost normallynot exceeding  3, 500 all-in.     They would rank against the housing programmin the public sector.3.      The scheme would be subject to review at the end of five years.4.      Approved societies for the purpose of the scheme would be housing associations registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts,Such associations already have an established place in the housing field as responsible non-profit-making bodies;   and their membership, organisation,accounts, reports and methods of borrowing money, etc. , are regulated bymodel rules approved by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.5        Every scheme ranking for loan would first be approved by theMinister of Housing and -Local Government..    The Minister would requireto be satisfied both that.a genuine demand for the houses existed and.thatthe scheme was likely to be economically sound.6.      Loans would be up to 100 per cent of cost (including land, site works and professional fees) and would be repayable over a period of 60 years.Subsidy would not be payable for houses built with the benefit of loan, exceptfor purpose-built accommodation for old people which would continue as atpresent to rank for the appropriate subsidy.7.      Exclusive of subsidy for old people, rents would range broadly from about  2 15s. a week for a two-bedroomed flat built at an all-in cost of 1, 800 to about  4 15s. a week for a family house with garage costing 3, 500.    The table of specimen rents appended includes for purposes of comparison the weekly cost of purchasing comparable property for owner-occupation over 20 and 25 year loan periods.8.      The figures of the table are confined strictly to the liabilities arisingout of the cost of the house and the mortgage.    Over and above these aretax and rate liabilities, broadly comparable but differing in certain respects.Above all, the owner-occupier is acquiring an important asset.    but nevertheless there are some who prefer to be tenants, and others who byreason of age, sex, etc. , are not able to secure the rights of ownershipeven if they wish to do so.November, I960 - 5 -
It is proposed that loans should be limited to houses and flats withan all-in cost (including land, site works, professional fees, etc.) notexceeding  3,500.    Table &apos;A&apos; shows the weekly rent payments for arepresentative range of dwellings, starting with a two-bedroomed flat atan all-in cost of  1,800.    Interest is payable at 6 per cent and the 60 yearloan covers 100 per cent of cost.    Table &apos;B&apos; shows, for purpose of comparison, the weekly outgoings for comparable houses being bought for owner-occupation with 20 and 25 year mortgages, in the price range from 2,000 -  3,500.    The mortgage gives 100 per cent of value, and interest is taken at 6 per cent.TABLE &quot;A&quot;	 1, 800		 2, 000		 2, 500	 3,000		1	 3,	500	     s.	d.	     s.	d.	     s.    d.	     s.	d.	 	s.	d.Annual loan										charges	Ill    7	6	123   15	0	154 13     9	185  12	6	216	11	3Repairs, Manage-ment, voids	26   0	0	26    0	0	26    0    0	26    0	0	26	0	0Annual rent	137    7	6	149    15	0	180    13   9	211    12	6	242	11	Weekly rent	2 12	10	2    17	7	3     9   6	4     1	5	4	13	31					TABLE *B&quot;					20-year mortgage										Annual loan										charges			174     7	5	217   19    3	261    11	1	305	2	11Repairs,										Manage-										ment, voids			26     0	0	26    0    0	26     0	0	26	0	0Annual										mortgage repayment			200     7	5	243   19    3	287    11	1	331	.2	11Weekly										mortgage										repayment			3    17	1	4  13   10 -6-	5    10	7	6	7	secret appendix
