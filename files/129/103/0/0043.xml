C, (60) 193 COPY NO.19th December, I960CABINET41COST OF THE HEALTH service memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home department the draft Health Estimates for next year show an increase of 54 millions, or 8. 8 per cent, over the original Estimates for the current year (even after disregarding the increase of  6 millions in capitalexpenditure).2. The Home Affairs Committee have considered and approvedproposals by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of health for meeting about half of this increase, as follows:-Saving in full year  millions(i)   Welfare foods(a) halve the subsidy onliquid welfare milk 11.5(b) charge cost price forother welfare foods 1.2(ii)    Increase charges for -(a) dentures by amountsranging from 5s. to 15s. 1.0(b) spectacle lenses by 4s.a pair 1.3(iii)    Increase maximum charge foramenity beds in hospital from to l\ guineas a week 0.3(iv)   Double the prescription chargeof Is. per item 12. 227. 5(26. 2 in 1961-62)-1-
Against this saving it would be necessary to set off the estimated additionalcharge on the National Assistance Board - about  1. 5 millions in a full year - and a sum possibly of the order of  2-3 millions to compensatethe milk industry for any loss due to reduced consumption of milk.3. Welfare foods.     We are advised that the reduced consumptionof milk and  other welfare foods which must be expected to result fromthis proposal is unlikely to be great enough to have any significant effecton health (though the possible effect on large families is being further considered).    But we should have to take account, in the annualprice review, of its effect on the milk industry.4. Dental and optical appliances.    The proposal to increase thecharges for these is the only one of the proposals which would require legislation.    The yield is relatively small but the change would provide an opportunity to make certain concessions, desirable as a matter ofpolicy, on children&apos;s glasses and dental appliances for children andexpectant and nursing mothers and to make these charges, with all other national Health charges, variable in future by regulation.    For these reasons the Committee were generally of the opinion that legislation would be justified but, largely because of the effect on the parliamentary programme, I feel obliged for the moment to reserve my own position.5. Prescriptions.    The average cost of prescriptions has increasedby 50 per cent since the present charge was fixed four years ago and thedrug bill continues to increase at an alarming rate.    The Health ministers are planning a major attack on it on another front;   but. we are satisfiedboth that the charge should be increased and that, if so, it should be by100 per cent.     We do not believe that this need lead to compensatory over-prescribing:   there are arrangements for preventing that (which neverthe-less protect patients who have a chronic need for drugs).     But we recognise that, while the National Assistance Board can and will takecare of their own clients, this proposal may have a quite serious effecton elderly people who are just above the assistance level.6. I must add that the political impact of these proposals as awhole, conjoined with our proposal to increase the &quot;health stamp&quot; by is. ,will be very considerable.     The plan is to announce them and to introduce the Bill on the stamp simultaneously with publication of the HealthEstimates octrly in February.     We shall be very strongly attacked and presentation will not be the easier when it is realised that the product ofthe stamp increase, about  36 millions next year, and the product ofthese proposals will together slightly exceed the estimated increase inthe cost of the services next year (about  62 millions as against 60 millions).    On the other hand there is much anxiety among our own supporters about the increase in Government expenditure generally andthe mounting cost of the Health Service in particular.    The preponderatingbalance of opinion in the Committee is that the political effect of doing nothing to meet this would be definitely worse than that of going forward with our proposals.-2-
7. The Committee therefore recommend the Cabinet to agree thatwe should go forward with the proposals set out in paragraph 2, subjectto further consideration of the question of, and the practicability of,legislation on dental and optical appliances.R. A. B.Home Office, 3. W. 1.19th December, I960.-3-SECflET
