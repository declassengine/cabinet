THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 166 COPY NO.   Cll6th November ,JL960CABINETGENERAL GRANT FOR THE SECOND GRANT PERIOD (1961-63)ENGLAND AND wales memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Housing and Local Government and Ministerfor Welsh AffairsFollowing discussions with the local authorities of England and Walesat the official level, the estimates of expenditure for the second grant period(1961-63) on the services covered by the General Grant are put at 818.19 millions for the year 1961-62 and  851.15 millions for the year 1962-63(see Annex).    The figure for 1961-62 is an increase of 6.3 per cent over theestimate for the preceding yean    that for 1962-63 is an increase of 10. 6 percent over the same base year.   On these figures, general grants of  454millions (1961-62) and  472 millions (1962-63) (as compared with  402 millions and  429 millions respectively in 1959-60 and 1960-61) are indicated.2.   These grants are based on current rates of pay and prices with only such increases as can be definitely foreseen and quantified.   If there is within the period a substantial increase of pay for teachers - as is likely inthe second year (1962-63) - and others, the grants would require to be increasedagain.3.   Ministers will be meeting the associations of local authorities on thesematters on 23rd November, and this may necessitate some final adjustment in the figures set out above.   It is intended to bring before the legislation committee for its approval the draft report to the House of Commons, whichis a lengthy document and not yet complete.4.   Meanwhile, we agree that grants for 1961-62 and 1962-63 should be fixed at the level indicated in paragraph 1  above.   The Chancellor, however, isdrawing attention in a separate paper (C. (60) 167) to the general implications of this growth in public and in Supply expenditure.S. L.H. B.15th November, I960
