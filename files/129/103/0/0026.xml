DRAFT WHITE PAPERPROPOSALS FOR REORGANISATION OF THE NATIONALISED TRANSPORT industry.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government, having reviewed the positionand prospects of the nationalised transport industry, now put forward their proposals for its future structure, working,and financial reorganisation.2.    In reaching their conclusions the Government have hadthe advantage of valuable advice from the Special AdvisoryGroup under the Chairmanship of Sir Ivan Stedeford, whichconsidered and made recommendations touching on all the main problems connected with the nationalised transport industry.They have had the advantage too of the timely and valuableReport on British Railways (11 July i960) from the House ofCommons Select Committee on Nationalised Industries.   Theyhave also had the benefit of the views put forward by theBritish Transport Commission and by the Trade Unions.THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S AIM3.   The Government&apos;s aim is that there shall be a soundly-based and viable nationalised transport industry, assuredin its future and a thriving part of our economy.    Onlyin this way can it provide efficient and economic services to industry and the public, and a fair livelihood andworthwhile job for those who work in it.k*   There is much to do and a long way to go.   The british transport Commission^ deficits had reached a total of  350M.by the end of 1959 (or  kOOM. if certain postponed revenue expenditure is included).   A further  100M. is likely to be-1-
added this year. The Government are however resolved to take all practical measures to achieve the objective stated above.THE PROBLEM5.    The heart of the problem is in the railways, which representabout three quarters of the Commission&apos;s undertaking.6.    British Railways are a great national asset and a vitalbasic industry.    They employ half a million people and represent an investment of nearly  1600M. which is growing by more than   &apos; 100M.  each year.    A railway system of appropriate size is anessential element in our transport network and will remain soas lang as can be foreseen.7.    But the railways are now in a serious financial plight.They are a long&apos;way short of covering their running costs,  let alone meeting their capital liabilities.    The development ofother forms of transport aid new techniques have faced them,like the railways in other countries,  with problems of competition and adaptation to modern circumstances and public demand.3.    The ultimate test for the railways, as for other transport,is how far the user is prepared to pay an eoonomic rate fortheir services.    This will,  in the end, broadly settle their size and pattern for the future.    It is clear,however,thatthere must be a streamlining of the system.    There must toobe modernisation, not only of layout, equipment andtechnique, but of organisation and management.9.    All the answers to this problem will not be foundovernight.    The full scope and outcome of railway modernisation-2-
and the eventual size and shape of the railway system forthe future will emerge as a developing process from thepractical measures to be taKen now.*10.    But the Government are clear about the direction inwhich they must move.    They are convinced that as anessential first step tiiere must be radical ,changes in the structure, organisation, financial constitution and statutory framework of the undertakings controlled by theBritish Transport Commission.General considerations11.    In their consideration of this matter,  the Governmenthave not been prompted by any intention of returning anyof the Commissions undertakings to private ownership or control.    Should such a step seem necessary at any time,it &apos;will require separate consideration.    Their concernhas been to establish what practical measures can be takennow to improve the efficiency and economy of those undertakings,and achieve the aim set out in para. 3 above.12.    Nor do the Government propose that the Minister&apos;s*existing statutory powers and responsibilities in relationto the nationalised transport undertakings should beextended.   As in the case of other nationalised industries,the Minister&apos;s main charge will be for overall coordination and
for securing the general efficiency of the industries in accordancewith his responsibility to Parliament for them.     He will continueto discharge these responsibilities through his powers of appoint-ment   and of general direction?and his control of development,investment and finance.     He will retain his special interest insafety, training and research.     The new organisation is intendedto provide for direct contact &quot;between the Minister and the component parts of the nationalised transport industry.      This will necessarily&quot;be closest where there are deficits to &quot;be financed from the publicpurse.,THE GOVERNMENT &apos; S MAIN CONCLUSIONS13* The British Transport Commission as at present aonstituted is so large and its activities so diverse that to run it effectively asa single undertaking is a most difficult task.      Its basic featureswere designed for a system of integrated transport which was neverfully introduced nor found acceptable by public opinion in theUnited Kingdom.1U* The size and difficulties of British Railways have naturallytended to preoccupy the Commission, thus affecting its structure andoutlook.      But, while the railways are of preponderant size and importance there is, as the Select Committee on nationalised industries noted, no authority with the single- minded task of running them,15. There is an obscurity of objectives arising from, as the- SelectCommittee say, a &quot;confusion, in judging &quot;between what iseconomically right and what is socially desirable&quot;.(Select committee report Para. h/!7).i16, Some management shortcomings, no doubt due in part to the structural difficulties, have &quot;been observed particularly, in thefinancial and commercial fields.     There has &quot;been a marked tendency for technical and operating considerations to prevail over others.- k -
J.31dis --------JL3HD3S17- The commercial capability of the railways is circumscribed, byoutmoded statutory restrictions and obligations on their trading operations,18. Mounting deficits., the size of capital debt in relation tothe earning capacity of the assets represented, and the increasingburden of interest as modernisation proceeds,present a situationdetrimental to the morale of management and staff, to financial control, and to hopes of recovery.19. In these circumstances, the Government have decided:-(a) to replace the British transport Commission andthe existing organisation by a new structure designedto overcome the main defects and disadvantages of thepresent 0rgani3at.i0.n3(b) to reconstruct the finances cf the undertaking and inparticular those of the railways,:(c) to give the various activities, as appropriate,  themaximum practical freedom of operation in their commercial affairsrTHE GOVBRNM^ISfgVS\PROPOSALSA..NEW STRUCTURE20.  The Government propose that each of the main activities of theBritish Transport  Commission^ undertaking shall have its ownseparate board vested with its own assets and responsible for itsown capital debt.      This should lead to concentration of effort,devolution and definition of responsibility,  and thus secure more effective management, and foster financial discipline.      Theobject has been.to provide each Eoard and management with a clearly defined task within a sot fields      The administration of such diverseactivities as the Railways, Ports, London Transport, and inland waterways, presents special problems, each of which calls for particular qualifications and experiencec- 5 -
^STATUTORY BOARDS21. The Boards for British Railways, London Transport, british transport Docks and British. Waterways will each he incorporatedunder Statute with the appropriate duties and powers necessaryto the efficient conduct of those undertakings,      In view of their importance and the special nature of their problems they will he responsible direct to the Minister of Transport, who will appointtheir members.Railways22. (a)    British Railways Board,     The British Railways Board will assume the responsibility for running the railways as an effectivenational system,.      It will perform the central functions essentialto the running of the railways as a single entity.      In particular it will be responsible for overall financial control and direction,national staff and wage negotiations,  safety, training and research,the future size and shape of the railway system, and those technical and engineering matters which, with modernisation policy, requirecentral direction,23. The new Board will also &quot;be responsible for railway workshop and for railway catering services.     A number of controlled companies and interests in companies connected with railway activities,including for example David McBrayne Ltd., will be the general responsibility of the Railways Board,2k. There will be a Chairman and Vice Chairman, assisted by bothfull time and part time members, who will thus provide the board with experience drawn from within and outside the industry.      some members will be executive with special responsibilities.     Each ofthe Regional Railways Boards (paragraph 25 below) will be represented.&apos;25.  (b) Regional Railway Boards.      The present Area Boards will bereplaced by new Regional Boards, appointed by the Minister.      the regional Boards will be autonomous in all matters of regional concern and will   have the character of company
^boards.    They will he the main instrument of continuing   the processof devolution of authority and decentralisation of management.      Toassist them in their task they will maintain their own separateregional trading accounts.     The Commission5s consultants havesuggested possible bases for such accounts and their report is underconsideration.     There will be more full tine members.      The post of regional General Manager will be superseded by that of managing director with a seat on the Regional Board.London Transport26.    The London Transport Executive will again become theLondon Passenger Transport Board.    It will continue to beresponsible for the public transport monopoly at presentdelegated to the London Transport Executive.    As hitherto,it will work in close concert with the London lines ofBritish Railways in all matters of common concern.British Transport Docks27.    The ports and docks at present administered by theCommission^ British Transport Docks Division will be trans-ferred to a new statutory Board.    The packet ports will remain with the railways.Inland Waterways28.    British Transport Waterways will be placed under anindependent statutory board to be known as the InxandWaterways Authority.    This body will own and manage the nationalised inland waterway system.    It will also be concernedwith the redevelopment or disposal of waterways which no longerhave a transport use.    The composition, powers and duties ofthe new body are under consiueration.    It will be necessary totake account,  on the one hand,  of the charge which the water-ways system imposes on public funds,  and,  on the other,  ofthe varied purposes which they can be made to serve.-7-
A HOLDING- COMPANY: COMPANY BOARDS-29,    British Road. Services, Tilling and Scottish Bus Groups,British Transport Hotels, Road Freight Shipping Services,and Thomas Cook and Son Ltd., will each he operated as companiesincorporated under the Companies Act v/i th their own hoards of directors.30.    All these undertakings (except Hotels) are alreadyorganised in Company form and operate in general competition with private enterprise counterparts.    They will he groupedunder a new Holding Company responsible to,  and appointed by,the Minister.31.    The holding Company will also hold the publicly ownedshares in those companies where the majority of the sharesare in private hands,  including bus companies which aresubsidiaries of the British Electric Traction Company Limited.Certain controlled companies and holdings connected with therailways will be the general responsibility of the railways board (see para.  23 above).Property32.    The development of the valuable properties held by theCommission is a matter requiring special attention (see alsopara.62 below).    It is proposed therefore,  in consultationwith the Chairmen of the new Boards,  to set up one or moreorganisations specially equipped to advice the undertakings and to assist them to obtain the best possible return fromtheir land ana properties.COORDINATION33.    The Minister of Transport&apos;s overall responsibility for thecoordination of transport in the United Kingdom will include a responsibility for coordinating the new Boards,  including the-8-SECi,
the allocation of funds for new investment.    In this hewill be assisted, by a new auvisory body,  the British transport council.    Suitable arrangements for coordinating the day-to-dayactivities of individual undertakings will also be established,following consultation between the Chairmen of the new Boards.British Transport Council34-.    The British Transport Council will advise the minister on the coordination of the nationalised transport industry as a whole  and. on questions relating to it.    The Council willalso be available to advise the Minister in the exercise ofhis responsibilities towards the nationalised transport under-takings including appointments,  finance and development.    TheCouncil will have no executive or supervisory functions, but will be qualified by its membership and by the knowledge and information available to it to advise the Minister on suchmatters as he may refer to it.35.    L There will be an independent Chairman of the Council,JJ/The Chairman of the Council will be the Minister of Transport   &quot;Jwho will be assisted by an independent Vice-Chairman / bothJappointed by the Minister.    The Chairmen of the British Railways,London Transport,  British Transport Docks, British Waterwaysand Holding Company Boards will be ex-officio members.    Othermembers will be drawn from outside the nationalised transport industry.    They will include,  it is hoped, representation of organised labour.APPOINTiVijiNTS3b.    As already stated above,  all appointments to the majorboards will be made by the Minister of Transport who will look to the British Transport Council for advice about them.    certain other appointments will be subject to his approval.-9-
37.    The Government considers it vital that,  as a general rule,  the nationalised transport industries should producetheir own leaders.    Fromotion from within the industries tothe highest levels should he within the grasp of those whoprove themselves capable.    In particular, there should bemuch greater opportunities in future for those in all partsof the railway service to make their way to the top.    Atthe outset, however,some major posts may have to be filled from outside.FINANCE3d.    Financial reconstruction is necessary to ueal both with the serious financial state of the railways and withthe changes proposed in the organisation.Present Position39.    The railways&apos; full liabilities on revenue account ini960 are likely to exceed receipts by almost  LUGm.Operating costs exceeded receipts by  h2m.  in 1959,  and ini960 the deficiency is expected to be about  60m.    Therailways are thus a long way from being able to make any payments towards interest on their borrowings which,  includinginterest on borrowings for modernisation (at presentcapitalised),  amounts to some  75*n.  a year.hO.    The Commission&apos;s financial situation is so serious that they cannot carry on without large scale support fromthe Exchequer,  even after allowing for the outturn oftheir other activities   which may provide a surplus ofsome  10m.  in i960.
FINANCIAL RECONSTRUCTIONi;1 . Financial reconstruction has &quot;become imperative.      the expectation that the Commission, and more specifically the railways,will he able to meet in full their existing liabilities is nowunrealistic,     A drastic scaling down of debt is inevitable and is urgently needed to give the railways a fresh start.k3. The general adjustments proposed by the Government are summarised in the following table.     It must be emphasised that the figurestherein:(a) relate to the position recorded in the british transport Commission&apos;s last Balance Sheet (i.e.at 31st December, 1959)j(b) are intended only broadly to indicate the generalsize and nature of the problem and the measures proposedby the Gove rnment.The eventual figures will, of course, be somewhat different.     Theywill have to be worked out later,TABLESummary of British Transport Commission^ GapitalPosition and Government/ s Proposals for RecojT^rucTionCapital LiabilitiesOther Liabilities including Super-annuation Funds and Savings Bank,(Mainly Railways)TOTALPROPOSALSDebt to be written off on accountof Revenue LossesDebt to be carried in SuspenseFixed-Interest Capital LiabilitiesOther continuing liabilities(Mainly railways)TOTALRailways         Other TotalActivities M.

Capital Liabilities2+3. As the table shows, the proposed reconstruction is primarily concerned with the Commission&apos;s net capital liabilities.     Some kOOM. of them are attributable to the non-railway activities ofthe Commission, and responsibility for this debt will,  in effect,be transferred to the appropriate new Boards.      The debt in eachcase will be based on the book values of the assets involved,kk. Of the remainder, some  kOOM. represents accumulated lossesfinanced mainly by Exchequer advances.      There is,  in theGovernment&apos;s view, no prospect of this ever being recovered.     they propose,  therefore, that this amount should be written off and the outstanding debt reduced accordingly .k5. This leaves  1 ,200M. of capital debt,  representing broadly thecapital liabilities of the railways after writing off debt equivalentto the losses.      The Government propose that, of this total,  kOOM. -which represents the written down value of the railways&apos; modernisa-tion investment since 1955 - should continue to rank as a fixedinterest loan on normal terms.U6. The balance ( 800M.) of capital liabilities - incurred to acquire&apos;the bulk of the pre-1956 assets - should be placed to SuspenseAccount and should carry neither fixed interest nor fixed repaymentobligations.      The amount and treatment of this Account will besubject to review from time to time,    in the light of developments.Amounts may well have to be written off in respect of ascertainedcapital losses,  (including losses in respect of obsolete assets which must he expected as modernisation proceeds).      The existenceof the Suspense Account, however, will enable the Exchequer to elaimsome return if railway finances improve sufficiently.      The possi-bility cannot, however, be ruled out that much of the amount placedin Suspense may well ultimately have to be accounted lost andwritten off.
Other Liabilities ni&quot;*- secret &quot; 51Q7. There are certain other liabilities, including liabilities inrespect of savings bank deposits and superannuation funds - which amounted to about  ^OOM. at 31st December 1959 and are attributablemainly to the railways.      The Government do not propose any relief from these liabilities for the undertakings, but they will, ofcourse, continue to stand fully behind them.Effect on Transport Stock and other Cspital Liabilities1+8;    The Treasury will assume all responsibilities forBritish Transport Stock.    The rights of stockholders will therefore be fully safeguarded.    This will be done bytransferring to the Exchequer the rights and liabilitiesattaching to the British Transport Stock (some  lJLj-OOm. ),and by substituting, for this and for other capitalliabilities (about  600m.) appropriate amounts of debtdue from the successor organisations to the Exchequer.Commentaryk9.    The effect of these proposals is that the railways would be given relief in respect of obligations to theextent of  1200M.,  of which  hOOM. would be immediatelywritten off;  and  dOOM.  suspended debt would not pressupon them unless or until they are able to bear it.    TheGovernment regard these drastic measures as no more than is required to deal realistically with the existing financial situation.    But they also think it most desirable that thenature and size of these measures should be fully appreciated.Their broad effect will be to take from the shoulders of therailway undertaking (a) the whole burden of accumulatedlosses and (b) the greater part of the  liability relatingto the capital value of this vast undertaking prior to thebeginning of modernisation in 1955* except insofar as ata later date the undertaking may be able to resume theburden.    But these heavy liabilities will not have ceased to exist.    They will have been transferred to the public in another guise,  since they will fall upon the Exchequer,which is the public purse.
Future Prospects and Targets50.    The capital reorganisation above will reduce the  interestcharge on the railways by over  l+Om.  a year.    There remain, how-ever, a large operating deficit, interest charges in respect ofthe reduced&apos;capital liabilities,  and interest charges on otherliabilities.    Over the next five years there will be additionalborrowings for investment on which also interest will be payable.    The total interest charge which will be affected bythe amount of such borrowings and the rate of interest might amount to between  60m.  and  70m.  a year at the end of the fiveyear period.51.    In these circumstances,  the Government propose thatoperating deficits, plus interest charges,  should for a.period of up to five years be made good by grant,  and shouldnot be accumulated as a debt.    They will ask Parliament to vote the necessary moneys for the purpose.52.    The Government propose,  therefore,  to review thefinancial progress of the railways year by year, with aspecial review at the end of the five years.    they recognise that the task of transforming the present deficitduring that period to a surplus of  60m.  to  70m.  is veryformidable.    Clearly,  the first and paramount aim of the new board must be to break even on operating account at theearliest practicable moment.    But thereafter they mustaim to meet also their remaining liabilities for interest.53. Targets must therefore be set. The Government will discuss with the railway authorities the figures for the short-term and longer-term objectives.- 1U -
secretProductivity and Manpower54-.    Productivity and manpower are crucial and must be aspecial concern of the new Railways Board.    As the SelectCommittee on Nationalised Industries noted, work study -which has been successfully applied in a number of fields -should be extended considerably beyond the 6 per cent,  ofrailway staff so far covered.    The British RailwaysProductivity Council has already considered this,  and theGovernment have welcomed the recent joint appeal by theemployers&apos; and the Union sides of the industry forcooperation by all concerned.Uneconomic Services55.    The Select Committee on Nationalised Industries (inparagraphs 4-22 to 427 of their Report) suggested thatuneconomic services which the railways were required tocarry out on grounds of the national economy or of socialneeds should be met by specific grant from public funds.This question also affects other nationalised undertakings,and the Government will consider it in that general context.For the time being,  where the railways are concerned,  anysuch services would in practice be covered by the largecontributions proposed from public funds.Financial Duties of Non-Statutory Boards56.    The Boards incorporated under the Companies Act willrun their businesses as commercial undertakings.    It willbe their duty and that of the Holding Company,  to securethe best results for the public purse.    Their profits shouldbe a valuable offset to the large sums of public money required by other nationalised transport undertakings.- 15 -
Other Financial Matters57.    The (Government have noted the observations of theSelect Committee on Nationalised Industries (in paras.150 to 154- of their Report) on the investment of savingshank deposits and superannuation funds in the british transport Commission&apos;s undertaking.    They are consideringwith the Commission what changes might &quot;be made in thepresent arrangements.    This consideration, of course,  inno way affects the rights of depositors and beneficiarieswhich will continue unimpaired.    Consideration is also being given to the scale of depreciation and obsolescenceprovisions which should be made by the various new under-takings.
6 a The present statutory restrictions on the development ofproperty by the nationalised transport undertakings will besuitably relaxed.63* The Commission already have power to accommodate, by way of leases, pipelines on their property.      It is proposed to givecertain of the new undertakings, particularly Railways, powers tolease, provide and operate pipelines on their property.      these will be subject to the Minister&apos;s consent where new investment isnecessary.^ COMMERCIAL FREEDOM58* In this reorgsinisation and financial reconstruction it wouldnot be reasonable to leave the railways subject to out-of-daterestrictions or obligations which fetter their commercialactivities.Fares and charges59. The present restrictions on the railways to adjust quicklytheir freight  charges and passenger fares are,  in the Government&apos;view, no longer justified in present competitive conditions.* *0O0 Therefore the railways will be freed from statutory controlover their charges.      An exception will be for rail and bus *faresin the London Passenger Transport Area where the London transport executive and British Railways have a virtual monopoly of public transport.61. This change will substantially reduce the functions of theTransport Tribunal.
61$. The Road, and Rail Traffic Act, 1933* and the Transport Acts of1947 and 1953 contain provisions protecting coastal shipping fromcompetition from inland transport.      The Government is at presentexamining these provisions in the light of the need to give greatercommercial freedom to the railways and of the interests of the coastal shipping industry.65. The Governments proposals for the new structure, for financialreconstruction, and for freedom of commercial&apos; operation will requiremajor legislation.      Consultations and preparation will take sometime to complete. ;   The Government propose to introduce thenecessary Bill in the next Session of Parliament.     Should interimlegislation he required, the Government will take the necessary steps.Ministry of Transport,28th November, I960.LEGISLATION
