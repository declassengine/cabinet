secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1960C. (60) 170 Copy No.   5124th November, 1960CABINETSALARIES OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARDS OF NATIONALISEDINDUSTRIESMemorandum by the Paymaster-GeneralWhen the Cabinet considered the problems of the nationalised industries inJuly 1959 they agreed that further consideration should be given to overcoming thedifficulties which stood in the way of securing the best possible men for the boards of the nationalised industries (C.C. (59) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 5). TheCommittee on Nationalised Industries have been considering these problems onthe basis of a report by officials and have agreed to a number of comparatively minor changes (e.g., in relation to methods of recruitment, and pensions of personscoming in from outside employment) which will, we think, improve the situation,and which can be introduced without special legislation. The major problem,however, is salaries and on this we considered that we should seek the views ofthe Cabinet.2. The present salary system for Board members divides the Boards intobroad categories of importance and, within those categories, provides a uniformsalary structure. Thus the Chairmen of all the major Boards (e.g., the british transport Commission, the National Coal Board) receive  10,000 a year whatever their origin and relative capacities, and whatever the relative responsibilities fromtime to time. The salaries were last fixed in July 1957 when the salaries of the chairmen of the main Boards were raised from  8,500 to the present  10,000 ayear.  All these salaries are published in an annual White Paper.3. One of the most urgent tasks in putting the nationalised industries on a proper basis is to ensure that we secure the best people available to run them. TheCommittee on Nationalised Industries consider that the present system of salariesis a severe handicap in achieving this aim. The salaries of some public board members are clearly very much out of line with those paid in really big industrial undertakings, although similar capacities are needed for both, and Ministers areunable to discriminate between individual members of nationalised Boards,whatever the responsibility undertaken or the personal capacity. So long as thesesalaries are published, any attempt to introduce variations on a personal basis would cause embarrassment to Ministers in their relations with other memberswhose salaries were not increased, as well as repercussions throughout the publicservice generally. Some method of introducing flexibility into the system must befound which avoids these difficulties.4. In the view of the Committee, the best solution would be for the Ministerto determine the salaries for each Board member, with the agreement of the Treasury,in the light of what was needed to get the best man available for the job.The Minister would not, however, disclose individual salaries, but would assume theresponsibility laid on public companies in private industry by the Companies Act,1948, which requires disclosure of only the total remuneration paid to a Board.5. Of course, there would be criticism of any such change. It might be saidthat it was opening the door to Ministerial patronage, and that it would conceal the58093
payment of excessive salaries to Board members. The point would also be made thatit was a derogation from the principle that Ministers should be prepared to account in detail to Parliament for the exercise of statutory powers conferred upon them.6. Acceptance of the new principle would thus require some change inthe public attitude to the nationalised industries. We consider that Parliament andthe public may be ready for such a change. The increasing financial failure of someof the nationalised industries has created a new desire to see them run on a morebusiness-like basis. The public may be less concerned than before to regard board members in the same way as the public service generally, and more ready to make a comparison with men running large-scale industrial undertakings. Members of bothsides of the House would see that the proposal would remove one of the disadvantages from which the nationalised industries suffer, compared with private industry, in attracting the best possible management. And we could claim that itwould make possible the introduction of a much needed flexibility into the salaryarrangements, which could not be obtained so long as individual salaries were published. Unless this approach is followed, we shall inevitably be driven back to continuing the present uniform salary structure, with arbitrary increases from timeto time.7. We therefore recommend that we should try to introduce the principle that ministers do not disclose the salaries of individual Board members, but only thetotal remuneration paid to a Board. Amending legislation would be needed forsome at least of the nationalised industries. For all of them, it would require anacceptance by Parliament that information about total Board remuneration was asufficient disclosure of the manner in which the Minister^ statutory power had been exercised. Before committing ourselves publicly to this principle, therefore, wethink we should at least obtain the views of Government supporters. It would be best for the nationalised industries if the principle could also be more widely accepted, and it might be desirable to arrange for the proposal to be aired publiclyon an appropriate occasion, before a firm Government line is announced.M.Office of the Paymaster-General, S.W. 1,24th November, 1960.
