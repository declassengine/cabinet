C. (60) 157 COPY NO.      -324th October, I960CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CONTRIBUTIONNote by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance append a. copy of a minute which I sent to the Prime Minister on19th October, and which he has asked me to circulate to the Cabinet.J. A.  B.-C.Ministry of Pensions and national insurance, W.C.2.24th October, I960.PRIME MINISTERFollowing the discussion at Cabinet yesterday, I would like toput to you two points.(a) It is very uncertain how the starting of the new graduated schemenext April will go.    It is not yet generally realised or understood how bigthe increases in contributions will be.    The Labour Party, however --see, in particular, the attached copy of Mr. Grossman1 s speech yesterdayintend to exploit to the full the substantial increase in contributions whencompared with the modesty and remoteness of benefits.They will, of course, point out that, as virtually no graduated pension will be paid in 1961-62, the  120 millions extra contributionsrequired by the National Insurance Act, 1959, will be mainly for thebenefit of the Exchequer position - more than wiping out a deficit underthe old scheme which otherwise would have fallen on the Exchequer.In all, the contributors to national insurance will be finding  250 millionsmore in 1961 -62 than in the present year.In these circumstances the addition of a further  50 millions tothis burden seems likely to prejudice the whole operation.(b) On the breach of faith point mentioned by the Lord Chancellor,there is, apart from our speeches about the benefit of the reducedcontribution to the lower-paid worker, the following further point.,    O(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
The Manifesto read:   &quot;Our new pension scheme will put national insurance on a sound financial footing, concentrate Exchequer help on those withthe iowest earnings i . i &quot;In any event, those with the lowest earnings are going to lose their reduction in contribution.    In exchange they will get better benefits.But, although the undertaking to concentrate Exchequer help on them isplainly in the context of national insurance, not of health, it would seemvery difficult, particularly if the two changes were synchronised, to reconcile in debate an undertaking such as this with an actual increase inthe total contribution made solely for the relief of the Exchequer.Such an argument would be even more difficult to sustain in thelight of the fact that the preceding paragraph of the Manifesto, whilepromising various developments in the Health Service, is silent on thequestion of further contributions to pay for it.J. A. B. -C.19th October, I960.
SPEECH ON PENSIONS BY MR. R. CROSSMAN, M. P.Speaking on old age pensions at a meeting of women&apos;s sections ofKent Labour Parties at the Granville Hotel, Ramsgate, yesterday (Tuesday,18th October) Mr. R.H.S. Grossman, M. P. , Chairman of the Labour Party,said:   &quot;Very soon after Parliament meets we shall be told precisely how much the Government is now prepared to concede to the campaign whichwe launched as long ago as May, 1957 for a minimum pension of  3 for asingle person and  4 10s. for a married couple.    I predict that theGovernment will not give the full ten shillings necessary even to bring the pension up to this minimum figure.    I also predict that whatever increasethey do give will be largely financed by increasing yet again the national insurance contributions.&quot;Our attack therefore must be two-pronged.    Of course our firstcare must be for the old people and in this country where we are assured that we never had it so good we must insist on a really substantial increase for them.    A ten shillings increase is the very minimum.&quot;But we must be equally strong in exposing how the Governmentis steadily shifting more and more of the burden of paying for pensionsoff the shoulders of the wealthy taxpayer and on to the shoulders of the insured worker.&quot;Indeed, in ten years it has transformed what we built as a genuine system of contributory insurance into an ingenious method oftaxing the working class.&quot;To-day the national insurance contribution has     nothing to do with insurance.    It has become an infamous poll tax which bears heavieston the lowest paid worker.&quot;Common justice demands that the increase in the old age pension should be financed not through national insurance contributions which fallexclusively on the working class but through taxation which is spread moreevenly over rich and poor.    I assure you that the whole situation inside theParty and in the country as a whole would be transformed if we could spendas much energy in the coming weeks on a united offensive against theTories&apos; treatment of the aged as we have in the last twelve months on internal wrangles over a defence policy about which the only certainty isthat it will be obsolete long before the next General Election. &quot;19th October, I960-3-
