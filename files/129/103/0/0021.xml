Printed for the Cabinet.   November I960C. (60) 171 Copy No. 5 323rd November, I960CABINETGENERAL GRANT IN SCOTLAND, 1961-63Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for ScotlandThis paper relates to the general grant arrangements for Scotland in theperiod 1961-63: these correspond to the proposals for England and Wales whichwere described in paper C. (60) 166 discussed on 17th November (C.C. (60)58th Conclusions, Minute 6).2. After discussions with the Scottish Local Authorities on the official levelthe Scottish Departments estimate the expenditure on services covered by thegeneral grant at  91-25 millions in 1961-62 and  94-27 millions in 1962-63.Detailed estimates are appended. These estimates are based on current ratesof pay and prices with only such increases as can be definitely foreseen andquantified. The figure for 1961-62 is an increase of 4- 8 per cent, over the estimate for the current year: that for 1962M53 is an increase of 8-3 per cent, over thesame base year. (The estimated increases in England and Wales are 6 - 3 per cent,and 10-6 per cent.) On these figures general grant would amount to  57 millions in 1961-62 and  59 millions in 1962-63.3. The Minister of State, Scottish Office, is meeting the elected representativesof the Scottish Local Authority Associations on the afternoon of 25th November.There are still a few items of estimated expenditure in dispute but it is not expectedthat the net result of the discussion should be to alter the figures quoted aboveby an appreciable amount, and as a result of the discussion some upwardadjustment of the figures quoted above may be. necessary. This should not exceedah increase in the expenditure figures of the order of  150,000 in each year anda proportionate increase in the grant.4. As in England and Wales, a supplementary order increasing the grantsagain will be necessary if there is a substantial increase, e.g., in teachers&apos; payduring the grant period.5. A draft Report to the House of Commons, together with a draft general grant (Scotland) Order, will be circulated to the Legislation Committee for its next meeting.S. L.J. S.
