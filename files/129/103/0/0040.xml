mm secret ^flTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTWm Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1960 MM^c. (60) 190 % Copy No.     S 2MM 16th December, 1960 MMCABINETEVACUATION POLICY^Mji Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government andMinister for Welsh Affairs^^fl The arguments for and against planning a scheme for evacuating women and^Mw\ children from some of the large centres of population are set out in paragraphs 96^MM to 105 of the report by officials of their review of Home Defence policy.^MM 2.  I would like to put before the Cabinet what seem to me to be the crucialMtwM questions.^Mwt 3.  As a Government we do not have the soft option of staying mute. It is MM^Mm now almost two years since the Commons were first told that we were reviewingMlm the plans previously announced  for evacuating some  12 million people. MM^M\\ Parliament and the local authorities may at any time now demand to know^Mm the outcome. ^Mt^M\\ 4.  The choice lies between abandoning evacuation as a policy and taking^Mu further, in consultation with the local authorities, the examination of the outline^M\\ plan to evacuate some 6 million women and children.   There is not room toevacuate 12 million.^^fl 5.   Conditions are wholly different from 1938-39.   My own thinking isgoverned by the conviction that no British Government would, in advance of^^Hl actual war, give the order to put evacuation plans into effect. That would start ^MM^M\\ a general exodus from the cities, bringing the economic life of the country to a MM^M\\ standstill. That is an argument for adopting a policy of &quot; stay-put&quot; in place of^Mm a policy of evacuation. ^Mg^M\\ 6.  But I can see that an announcement that we were abandoning^Mwj evacuation would have serious implications.   It might run us into greatmM\ difficulty with other countries of the North Atlantic Alliance: and it would MM^Mm be hard too to get public opinion, at this point of time, to accept a policy of^Mwt stay-put for all, women and children included. We might indeed stir up a great MM^M\\ deal of alarm and bitter argument about an operational matter which, in my view,^Mw\ will have singularly little practical importance if ever home defence plans haveMMwt to be put into operation. MM^MM 7.  It would involve no great expense to carry to the next stage-namely, MWMMMwt consultation with the local authority associations-the consideration of the outline MMM^MM scheme for evacuating some 6 million of the priority classes. The details of this MmM^MM scheme will need some further work in the light of the latest assessment of attack. ^M\\^MM 8.  Consultation with the local authorities will however bring out the practical ^Mw\^MM limitations on the planning of any evacuation scheme.   It will become clearly ^MtmM apparent that Eastern England can no longer be used for reception: that the flI capacity of the country areas elsewhere limits the numbers which could be MfM^MM accommodated to an extent which will make it impossible to plan evacuation from ^Mjt^MM all likely target areas, or of all the women and children who might be within the ^M\\^MM range of blast and fire damage in the areas chosen for evacuation: and that there ^MmMM\\ would be considerable fall-out hazards in some of the reception areas. ^MmsecretMWM Mm*
SECRET9. It might help to shape opinion on this whole subject of evacuation, ifthese matters which now condition the drawing up of an evacuation policy werebrought into the open.HHJ 10.  On balance, my recommendation is that we should announce that we HHJhave abandoned the &quot;12 million scheme &quot; and that we are proposing to explorefurther with the local authorities proposals for evacuating to the western half oittkthe country and to south-east England some 6 million people in the priority classes.^But I think it is important that the announcement should be made in a way whichHHJ will leave us free to reconsider the whole matter in the light of the consultationsand what emerges from them. The opportunity might be taken, in the course ofthe consultations, to sound opinion privately on the question whether it is tolerableto leave out of the priority classes the adolescents, the aged and the infirm, asrecommended in the Report of Officials (paragraph 104).^H^^fl Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,16th December, 1960.I ISECRET
