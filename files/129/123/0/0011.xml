THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)RHODESIA; HELP FOR LOYAL CIVIL SERVANTSNote by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations am circulating with this note a paper which has been prepared by officials of the Treasury, Commonwealth Relations Office, and theMinistry of Overseas Development.    The paper indicates the scope ofthe proposals which are at present contemplated.    I should be grateful for comments so that final details of the scheme can be worked out and anearly announcement made.    I would draw attention particularly to thefollowing points.(a) Whereas Pensions are guaranteed for all, salary payments are proposed normally for a period of six months only in the casesof officers who leave Rhodesia.    Apart from the Governor and members of the Judiciary there is no guarantee of salary for those who remain.    I am inclined to think that on politicaland moral grounds it is necessary to guarantee either thepayment of salaries to such persons or to some reimbursementat a later date not less than that proposed for officers who leavethe country.(b) The proposed arrangements do not include the payment of salaries in any case after a six months period, nor do theyenvisage the continuing accrual of pension rights after thedate on which officers vacate or are &quot;dismissed from&quot; their offices.    I suggest that further consideration should be givento these points.(c) In considering these proposals it should be borne in mind that weare publicly committed to the view that officers &quot;dismissed&quot; inthese circumstances will continue to be regarded as loyalmembers of the Rhodesian Service to which they will normallyat some stage return.    There is no question of their beingautomatically regarded as having resigned and we are not asking them to do so.(d) A number of presentational points should also be borne in mind.(i) We do not regard the proposals as in any sense &quot;acompensation scheme&quot;.(ii)  The proposals, if they are to make a good impact, will need to be presented in the simplest and sympathetic terms.(iii) In the light-of the Governors views it will be ncessary toavoid repeating publicly the fact that his and the salaries ofthe Judiciary are to be specially preserved.C.
