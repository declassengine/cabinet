;S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C,(oi:) 106 COPY NO.21 st December, 1965CABINETLEASEHOLD reform memorandum by the Minister of Housing; and Local GovernmentPublic AuthoritiesMy immediate Departmental concern is that neither enfranchisement,nor extension of leases to 999 years, should apply against local or newtown authorities.2.       The Lord President has set out the arguments against this inparagraph 8 of his memorandum (C.(65) 184).    I would only add thatleasehold is a valuable form of public ownership which should be developed,not destroyed.    It provides for good upkeep, which becomes increasingly important as v/e build to higher densities;  and it makes comprehensive re-development possible, when it is due, without forcing the authority to resort to compulsory purchase.    It is perfectly defensible to distinguish between publicly and privately ov/ned property; we have e.g. done this in rent regulation which does not apply to houses publicly owned.3.       We should remember that both in the new towns, and in areas of comprehensive development by local authorities, v/e have fought toretain the freehold in public hands, except in very special circumstances(churches etc).    It v/as the Conservative Government who, in 1952, firstmade it possible to dispose generally of freehold in these cases.    &quot;lie stillinsist on retaining it in public ownership so far as the new townsindustrial and commercial estates are concerned.    New town corporationshave, since 1952, sold some freehold to owner occupiers, but there hasbeen relatively little of this.    I want to get a great deal more owner occupation in the new towns; but I believe that much of it should be on aleasehold ba.sis, the greater part of the freehold estate being retainedintact as was our original conception.4.       It is true that the leasehold system as we have it at present cambear hardly on the lessees of public authorities towards the end of the lease, as it does on the lessees of private landlords.    But I think that could be cured by seeing that they got better terms when the lease had. tobe terminated.    It might perhaps be possible to devise a system underwhich the leaseholder ov/ned the house though not the land, so that if andwhen he had to be dispossessed for re-development he was paid the valueof the house including value for his own maintenance and repair,5.       I do not think that it would be possible to distinguish, as had beensuggested, between the leasehold properties of public authoritiesaccording to the powers under which, or the purposes for which, theywere originally acquired.    None of us, incidentally, has any knowledgehow much residential property local authorities hold on leasehold, orhow it was originally acquired.-1-CONFIDENTIAL

Compensation6.       If the Cabinet are disposed to think that the 999 year principle would effect too drastic a transfer of property values, an alternativebasis for compensation on enfranchisement might be found in adaptingthe principle embodied in the Rent Act.    That provided for &quot;fair rents&quot;as between landlord and tenant;  i.e. the market rent, excluding any value due to scarcity.    In the leasehold field this might be adapted by providing that the compensation payable on enfranchisement should bethe market value excluding not only the value due to scarcity, but alsothe value due to the maintenance and (where applicable) improvement ofthe house by the leaseholder and his predecessors.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W.1.21 st December, 1965
