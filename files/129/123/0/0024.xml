DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)66C. (65) 174 COPY NO. ^_7th December, 1965CABINETTHE TRAINING OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE IN ENGLANDAND WALES AND THE POSITION OF EX-OFFICIOJUSTICES OF THE PEACE;  DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Lord chancellor at their meeting on 3rd December the Home Affairs Committeehad before them a draft of a v/hite Paper on the Training of Justices ofthe Peace in England and Wales and approved the draft for publication,subject to the concurrence of the Cabinet.    The draft White Paper is annexed to this memorandum.    At the meeting of the Home AffairsCommittee I mentioned that, at the request of the Scottish Home and health Department, I would make certain minor verbal amendments tothe draft to make it clear that the Governments decisions conveyedtherein apply only to England and Wales; these will be made in the printed text.2.     As long ago as 1948 the Royal Commission on Justices of thePeace* recommended that Justices on first appointment, and Justiceswho are appointed to Juvenile Court Panels, should be required toundertake some training.    The National Advisory Council on theTraining of Magistrates, which was appointed in June 1964 by my predecessor to advise him in regard to all matters relating to thetraining of lay Justices of the Peace, has now advised me to giveeffect to the Royal Commissions recommendations and I propose toaccept this advice; this is the purpose of the proposed White Paper.3.     All those who have had to consider the training of lay justices of the Peace have had to face the problem of those persons who becomeJustices by virtue of holding some other office, a.nd in particular thosewho are elected to various locs.1 government offices (Mayors ofBoroughs and Chairmen of County and Urban and Rural district councils).    A list of these persons is appended; they amount in all toabout 2, CCO persons in England and Wales, which compares with the16,400 Justices on the Active List who have been appointed by name.The Royal Commission recommended^ That Chairmen of County and urban and Rural District Councils should cease to be Justices ex-officiobut that a Mayor, being the symbol of the corporate character of the borough and having had for centuries the duty of keeping the peace,should continue to be  a Justice during his term of office.     The RoyalCommission also thought that Privy Councillors and other &quot;high officers&quot;should remain Justices ex-officio both because they do not often act asJustices in fact and because they generally held office for life or atleast for a substantial period of time.*    Cmd. 7463 (1948) Paragraphs 88 - 92 and 197 - 199.f    Paragraph 159-1-

4.      Most of those who gave evidence to the Royal Commissionthought that at least some of the Justices ex-officio, should be abolished,but, in spite of the weight of opinion against the retention of localauthority of Justices ex-officio, this recommendation of the RoyalCommission was not implemented in the Justices of the Peace Act,1949; and indeed the Government resisted, in the passage of the bill through Parliament, an attempt to abolish ex-officio Justices on thegrounds that nothing should be done which might affect the prestige and status of local authorities at a time when the whole future structure oflocal government was about to be reviewed.5.      I am, however, firmly of the opinion that it is in the interestsof the administration of justice that no person should become aMagistrate solely by virtue of holding some other non-judicial office.Only those persons who are best qualified to administer justice shouldbe appointed to the Benchi- and it does not follow that because a personholds some other office, such as the Chairmanship of a local authority,he is necessarily best fitted for the work of a Magistrate.    Such aperson, if he is in fact suitable for the Bench, should be considered for appointment together with other candidates, under the normal procedure for the selection of Justices.6.     Now that I wish to introduce the compulsory training of Justices,set out in the White Paper, the existence of ex-officio Justices becomeseven less justifiable.    My colleagues on the Home Affairs committee agreed that in general the abolition of Justices who served only by virtue of local government office would be acceptable, provided that itwas applied throughout local government.7.      To abolish the ex-officio Justices of the Peace will reqtvirelegislation and I appreciate that it may well not be practicable tointroduce this in the present Session.8.     Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval of the White Paper, I have arranged with the Lord President to publish it on the 22nd December.9.      I invite the Cabinet -(a) to approve the publication of the attached white paper, subject to the formal amendments mentionedabove;  and(b) to approve the introduction of legislation at an earlydate to abolish Justices of the Peace ex-officio.Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office, S. W, 1.7th December, 1965-2-

co&apos;:. r:,.\LTHE TRAINING- OF JUSTICES OP THE peace in EN6LAND AND WALESIINTRODUCTIONJustices of the Peace have administered justice in this country for more than 600 years.     In addition to the criminal jurisdiction which theyhave long exercised, other duties have been laid upon them over the years.Until the last quarter of the nineteenth Century they were responsible forthe local government in every county.     The institution of elected countycorporations and the birth of local government as we now know it removed from the Justices most of their administrative functions, but since thattime there has been a steady growth of crime and an ever increasingregulation of affairs by successive Governments through legislation.     Muchof this legislation has imposed on the Justices new responsibilities andhas extended their jurisdiction.     A host of offences unknown to theirforbears   have been created, notably in relation to road traffic, while the availability of Legal Aid particularly in domestic proceedings has not onlyadded to the number of cases coming before the Courts but has tended toextend the length of time taken to hear each case.     This has had the resultthat, in the cities and boroughs especially, the number of attendances which individual Justices are called upon to make has greatly increased and isstill increasing, and -what the sittings themselves are becoming longer.2.     The Justice of the Peace today has to devote more time than ever beforeto administering a legal system which is at once far more sophisticated and far more detailed than anything with which his predecessors had to deal.3.     In recent years, moreover, an ever increasing interest has been takenin the treatment of offenders.     This is due to a desire in the first place to ensure that law-breakers are dealt with in the most efficacious mannerfrom the point of view both of the offender and of the community, andseoondly to achieve, as far as possible, a measure of consistency in dealingwith similar offences.4.     To carry out these varied and onerous duties we still rely upon theordinary men and women of this country.     To this task they have broughtcommonsense, sympathy and a wide experience of life and of affairs.     Pew ofthem are lawyers and it would now be impracticable and, indeed, undesirable,to seek to replace our lay magistrates by a professional and stipendiarysystem.5.     Nevertheless, having regard to the increase in the importance and the complexity of their work it has   bdeome apparent that there is an urgent need, both in the public interest and for the sake of the Justices them-selves, that they should receive some training for the difficult and responsible work which they so unselfishly undertake.-1-CONFIDENTIALn.ANNEX-a c1 0

*Cmd. 7463 (1948)-2-JL s&quot;II^^PJSgffTP ..p0siyij0n6.     Until the foundation of the Magistrates&apos; Association in 1920 there wasno central organisation of Justices of the Peace for any purpose.     Anytraining which a Justice may have received, therefore, came about as amatter of chance.7.     One of the fundamental purposes of the Magistrates&apos; Association was toencourage Justices of the Peace to undertake some measure of training and toprovide the necessary means in the form of meetings, conferences, discussions and literature.     The training of Justices was not, however, officially orformally considered until 194-6, when the Boyal Commission on Justices of thePeace was appointed.     In consequence of evidence which the Commissionreceived, both from the Magistrates&apos; Association and from other witnesses,it recommended that new Justices should be given some instruction in theduties they had to perform.     Two paragraphs from the Report of the IloyalCommission^ which de-al with the instruction of Justices are as follows -&quot;89. The lav; that justices have to administer is extensive and complex and any attempt tc give lay justices an adequate knowledge of it wouldnot usually succeed.     Ytaat we think is possible and should be done isto train justices to understand the nature of their own duties ratherthan the substantive law that they administer.     In the forefront weshould put the meaning of &quot;acting judicially&quot;.     The Lord Chief justice of England, Lord Goddard, in his evidence points out that justices do.not get reproved for being wrong in law, but that a failure to actjudicially is a reason for censure.     In the course of court proceed-ings a justice must be sufficiently instructed to perform his dutieswithout constant reference to the Clerk.     Thus he must know theprocedure in ordinary cases&apos;,   it is for instance not unknown for abench to misunderstand the nature of a submission that there is no case to answer.     He should know something of the law of evidence, at leastenough to enable him to avoid mistakes in any questions that he mayask.     &quot;vThen justices know and understand their duties they and the clerk can work satisfactorily together:   if they are ignorant the clerkmust either watch thom make mistakes that may be serious to the parties and to the justices, or intervene and take too much part in theproceedings.

4A c90. A particularly important part of the work of justices lios in thedecision as to the course they should take &quot;with an offender or other person before the court,,     Knowledge of the various courses that mayopen is not sufficiently widespread, and we think that this shouldreceive special attention.     It is essential that every justice shouldunderstand the meaning of the various sentenoes that can be given and orders that can bo made.     New methods of dealing with persons foundguilty must also &quot;be studied as they come into operation.&quot;8.     The royal Commission recommended that on appointment a Justice shouldbe required to give an undertaking that lie would follow a prescribed schemeof instruction and that he should not sit judicially until he had completedthat training.     This recommendation was not implemented.     The Justices ofthe Peace Act, 194-9, however, created magistrates  Courts Committees to administer magistrates  Courts throughout England and Wales, and section 17of the Act imposed upon every Magistrates&apos; Courts Committee the duty, inaccordance with arrangements approved by the Lord Chancellor, of making andadministering schemes for providing courses of instruction for the justices of their area.     When, in 1952, that section came into operotion, the LordChancellor&apos;s Office circulated, as a guide to every magistrates  CourtsCommittee, a Model Scheme for Elementary Training.     The magistrates  CourtsCommittees almost without exception either formally adopted that scheme orevolved schemes of training of their own based very closely upon it.Difficulties were experienced, however, by some Committees in carrying out any scheme of instruction.     This was in poxt due to the fact that, althoughevery Committee was under an obligation to provide training for its Justices,the individual Justices themselves were not correspondingly bound to under-take any form of training which had been arranged for thorn.     In addition,practical difficulties were encountered.     Some newly appointed Justiceswere unable to attend lectures, either because of the nature of their employment or because they lived in remote areas and travelling was difficult.A further problem arose in those areas where only one or two new Justiceswere appointed each year and where there were therefore too few to justify a course of&apos; lectures.3,     Por these reasons, the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office and the Magistrates&apos;Association co-operated in preparing a course of instruction which could besent to Justices by post.     In the past ten years over 3,000 magistrateshave taken advantage of this course and it has constantly been revised and brought up to date.     It suffers, however, from the disadvantages inherent in any postal system of instruction and, in particular, it gives no opportunity for oral discussion.     Furthermore, it is hard to gauge theextent to which individual Justices have benefitted from the course, since it has never contained any provision for them to answer questions on it.

10.   Since 1956 the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department has sent to every justice of the Peace on appointment a copy of a booklet entitled &quot;Notes for NewMagistrates&quot; which gives an outline of Magistrates&apos; duties, the conditionsin which they are performed and the rules by which magisterial proceedings are governed.     In addition, copies of the Home Office handbook, &quot;the sentence of the Court&quot;, were sent on publication in ISoh- to every Justicethen on the Active List and since that date a copy has been sent to each newJustice on appointment.     This handbook contains comprehensive information about the various forms of treatment available to the Courts, and what is involved in each of them, and its purpose is to help the Magistrates in selecting the right sentence.-4-

IIINATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE TRAINING of MAGISTRATES11.   After discussions with the Council of the Magistrates&apos; Association,the Lord Chancellor decided that the present situation was not   entirely satisfactory and accordingly in June 196A, he established a NationalAdvisory Council on the Training of Magistrates, charged with the duty of advising the Lord Chancellor generally on the policy to he applied to thetraining and instruction of Justices of the Peace throughout England andWales.12.   The National Advisory Council has made exhaustive enquiries as to how the present arrangements for the training of magistrates are &quot;being carriedout by Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees and to what extent Justices   of thePeace, and particularly newly appointed Justices, are availing themselves of the facilities which are being provided for them.13.   These enquiries have been addressed both to Magistrates&apos; CourtsCommittees and to Justices of the Peace.   Magistrates&apos; Courts committees have been asked not only to give details of their present arrangements forthe instruction of newly appointed Justices, but also to estimate thepractical consequences if the Royal Commission^ recommendation for compulsory trairdng were implemented.   The Council also decided to consulta representative cross-section of newly-appointed Justices and, for thisreason, a questionnaire was sent to all those Justices who had been appointedbetween 1st July, 1962 and 30th June, 1963,   This questionnaire asked whattraining had been made available to the Justices and to what extent they hadavailed themselves of it.   If they had been unable to attend training whichwas offered to them, they were asked the reason for this.   These Justiceswere also invited to give their opinion generally on the need for trainingnew Magistrates, the form which any courses should take and the times and places where training could best be provided.1A,   A very high percentage of replies was received to these questionnairesand, as a result of them and of the answers given by the differentMagistrates&apos; Courts Committees, the Government is satisfied that for themost part Committees are doing their best to provide at least some elementarytraining for the thousand or so new Justices who are appointed each yearand, furthermore, that a very largo majority of these Justices do in factreceive some form of training.

15.   It was the overwhelming, and indeed almost unanimous, opinion of the justices who were questioned that newly appointed magistrates do require some basic training.   It is significant that many of these Justices alsocommented that such training should be made compulsory.16.   In addition to obtaining the views of individual Magistrates&apos; CourtsCommittees, the National Advisory Council sought the opinion of theCentral Council of magistrates  Courts Committees.   The National AdvisoryCouncil also had the advantage of a memorandum by the Justices&apos; Clerks&apos;Society.   Both these organisations were in favour of the compulsorytraining of newly appointed Justices.17.   The National Advisory Council has accordingly advised theLord Chancellor that the time is now opportune to introduce obligatorytraining for Justices in the manner described in the following paragraphs.This recommendation has been accepted and the Government has decided thatthe new arrangements for compulsory training shall apply to all Justicesappointed after the 1st January, 1966.

CONFIDENTIAL q        AxIVCOMPuXSORY TRJilKimiS.   Those who are appointed to the office of Justices of the Peace arenature and responsible persons, many of whom already occupy prominentpositions in the community before they become magistrates.   Although thevast majority of these persons are anxious to receive some training forthis important and technical, but novel, task, it must be recognised thatthey are giving up their time to a Voluntary Service.   The Government has accordingly decided that obligatory training should not be imposed by legislation but should be achieved by requiring all those who have beenapproved for appointment as Justices to give an undertaking that, if theyare appointed, they will couplete a prescribed course of instruction withina year.   A Justice who fails to comply with this undertaking -without good cause may be removed from the Commission.   The Lord Chancellor r/ill havepower, at his discretion, to grant an extension of tine in which to complete the course in appropriate cases.   When exercising this power in respectof Justices in Lancashire, the Lord Chancellor will normally act inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.19.   The Lord Chancellor will also be able to exempt any individual, orany specified class of person, from having to undertake a course of instruction, or any part of it;   for example, a person who already holds,or has held, judicial office at the time of his appointment as a Justice.20.   The amount of instruction which a newly appointed Justice should berequired to undergo must be governed by the amount of tine that he can reasonably be expected to give to the work.   Some apprehension has been expressed lest if too much training is demanded the best candidates willbe reluctant to accept appointment.   This applies particularly to youngmen and women who are required for service in the Juvenile Courts as wellas in the Adult Courts.   It is extremely difficult to find men and womenbetween the ages of 30 end 45 who can spare enough time to discharge theduties of a Justice of the Feace.   At this age both business and familycommitments nay be expected to be at their greatest.21.   For these reasons the Government have decided that obligatorytraining should be limited to a basic course of instruction for allJustices newly appointed, to the Commission and to a special course of instruction for those Justices who are appointed to the Juvenile CourtPanels.-7-

VBASIC COURSE OF INSTRUCTION22.   It is the view of the National Advisory Council on the Training of magistrates, &quot;based on overwhelming evidence from practised Justices andClerks, that experience on the Bench is itself the finest form of training and that theoretical instruction, although desirable and indeed necessary,must; &quot;be based on the foundation of at least some practical experience if itis to be intelligible and of value.     On the other hand, the vast majorityof Justices of the Peace have never been in a Magistrates&apos; Court before they are appointed and it is therefore necessary to give a new Justice someelementary information and instruction about his functions before he attendsCourt for the first time, even as an observer.     The National AdvisoryCouncil has therefore recommended, and the Government has accepted, asyllabus for the Basic Training of Newly Appointed Justices, which is tobe taken in two stages.     This syllabus is set out in Appendix A.     Thefirst stage is to be completed before the new Justice sits to adjudicate andthe second within one year of his appointment.23.   The objects of this training are set out in the syllabus, which is sodesigned that the theoretical and the practical instruction of newJustices can proceed simultaneously and as parallel phases of onecontinuing operation.24.   It is intended that the first stage of the training should &quot;be carriedout locally;   that is to say, at the court at which the new Justice willsit.     In the case of cities and boroughs this will, of course, be the cityor borough Magistrates&apos; Court;   in the case of county Justices, it will bethe court of the Petty Sessional Division to which the Justice is assigned.This will be of assistance to the new Justice, who will have no further to travel than he will have to go when performing his ordinary magisterialduties.     It will also have the advantage of introducing the new Justice as quickly as possible to his colleagues and to his Clerk and of making himfamiliar with the surroundings in which he will be working.25.   The second and more substantial stage of the Basic Training should notstart until the new Justice has had some experience on the Bench, and it isimplicit in the scheme that tspecial care should be taken to ensure thatnewly appointed Justices, at least during their first year, should alwayssit with at least two experienced colleagues.-8-

26,   The syllabus for the second stage calls for instruction under sixheadings, but the precise number of periods of instruction is notspecified.     It would be possible to complete this stage in a courseextending over one weekend (Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon);   buttwo such weekends would be preferable, in order to allow more time forinstruction and discussion.     Such weekend courses might be residentialfor those Justices who have far to come, while those who live   nearer tothe place where the course is held may attend daily.   It would also bepossible to carry out the second stage in a series of instructional periodsheld once a week or once a fortnight over several weeks or months, at whatever time of day or in the evening might be most convenient for the justices concerned.s

VIINSTRUCTION FOR - J[JJMILE-.C0TJRT JUSTICES27.   The Royal Commission on Justices of the Peace recommended that eachMagistra-f.es1 Courts Committee should prepare a scheme for the traiiiing ofJuvenile Court Justices and that every Justice appointed to the JuvenileCourt Panel for the first time should undertake not to adjudicate in the juvenile Court until he had completed the requirements of the scheme.This recommendation vra.s not implemented, but iii 1953 a Model Scheme forJuvenile Court Training was circulated by the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office toall Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees with a recommendation that it should beadopted and put into effect as soon as possible.23,   In 1960 the Departmental Committee on Children and Young Persons (theIngleby Committee) issued its Report in which it made certain.in recommendations as to the training of Juvenile Court Justices.     Paragraph 161 of itsR.eport* reads -&quot;161,   It is our view that every member of a juvenile court panel,whether lay or stipendiary, should be adequately trained for his duties.    He needs not only a grasp of law and court procedure -which the professional magistrate will already have - but a knowledgeof the services available to the court, including the medical andpsychiatric services, and the ways in which it can deal with thechildren wfco come before It;   and not least important, familiarity withthe technique of handling young people that the best juvenile courtshave so successfully developed.     V/e hope that magistrates&apos; courtscommittees will lose no time in drawing up schemes of specialisedtraining for juvenile court magistrates on tho lines of the modelscheme to which we have referred,     While we do not consider it practicable for the law to require a magistrate to complete such acourse of training before he adjudicates in a juvenile court, weshould like tc see this rule adopted in practice.&quot;29,   The enquiries which have been made by the National Advisory Councilon the Training of Magistrates show that in fact only a relatively small number of Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees administer special schemes of instruction for their Juvenile Court Justices,* Cmd, 1191  (I960).-10-

:;o:.    ./..-* mLU,*      itJ30.   The Children and Young Persons Ant 1963 gave effect to the Report ofthe Ingleby Committee, hut it did not implement the recommendation for compulsory training.    YJhen the Bill was before the House of Commons an amendment was moved to provide that a Justice should not be qualified to sit as a member of a Juvenile Court Panel unless he had followed a courseof instruction in the w*rk of a Juvenile Court provided in accordance with section 17 of the Justices of the Peace Act, 1949 (see paragraph 8 above).The Government at that time resisted the proposed amendment to the Bill,but undertook to secure compulsory training for Juvenile Court Justices byamending the Juvenile Courts (Constitution) Rules, 1954*     The Rules werenot amended, however, because the Lord Chancellor decided that the wholequestion of the training of Justices should be reconsidered and he accordingly referred the subject to the National Advisory Council on theTraining of Magistrates.     The Council, having considered this problem,recommended that obligatory training should be introduced for JuvenileCourt Justices on lines similar to those already described for Justicesnewly appointed to the Commission.31.   It would be illogical for the compulsory training of Juvenile CourtJustices to be secured by a different method from that used for Justicesnewly appointed to the Bench.     The Government has therefore decided thatthe training of Justices on a Juvenile Court Panel should also be effected by means of an undertaking.     The problem is complicated, however, by thefact that a Justice may never be appointed to a Juvenile Court Panel at all,Furthermore, appointment to a Panel is by election by and from the justices of the area in which the Panel operates.     It is not possible, therefore,to obtain undertakings from Juvenile Court Justices before they join a Panelbecause it is not. known in advance who they will be.     The Government hasdecided that the only practical way to deal with the matter is to obtain anundertaking from all Justices at the time of their appointment to theCommission that they will complete, not only the course of Basic Training,but also a course of Juvenile Court draining, either before (if they so wishand it is possible to do so) or within a year after they are elected to aJuvenile Court Panel.32,   This undertaking will be required of all Justices appointed in thefuture.     Those Justices who are already on a Commission, but are not yetserving on a Juvenile Court Panel, will be asked to take the new course ofJuvenile Court Training either before or immediately after they are appointed to a Panel,

JL U v33.   The Government have accepted a syllabus for the training of JuvenileCourt Justices which has been recommended by the National AdvisoryCouncil.     This, like the syllabus for Basic Training, is to be taken intwo stages.     The details are set out in Appendix B.     The objects of thetraining are contained in the syllabuses.     The observations made inparagraphs 24 to 26 above in respect of Basic Training apply also,mutatis rmitandija, to the Juvenile Court Training.

ft   fiki ^inc: kits a iVIIs^her TaATi\1ijj&amp;34.   It is the Governments intention that, in addition to the courses forJustices newly appointed to the Conmission and to the Juvenile Court Panel,courses of instruction for all Justices on the Bench should continue to bearranged by Magistrates&apos; Courts Connittees, either separately or in collaboration with neighbouring Connittees.     These courses will not beconpulsory, but all Justices will be exhorted to attend then from tine totine throughout their active careers.     iii though experience of sitting inCourt is itself the finest fom of training, Justices can help themselves to perform their tasks with greater efficiency by refreshing their knowledge,in particular with regc.rd to developments in the treatnent of offenders.In this connection all Justices, and not only those newly appointed to the bench, should visit institutions for the treatnent cf offenders fron tine totine in order to see for themselves how these may have changed in the lightof contemporary ideas and practice.     Magistrates&apos; Courts Connittees shouldmake arrangements for Justioes to visit such institutions periodically.35.   The Government also wishes to encourage Justices in every area to neettogether regularly to disouss problems of common interest.     Such meetingscan be particularly useful for considering sentencing problems with a view toachieving oonsistency in dealing with similar offences involving offendersin comparable circumstances.3.6o   The Government hopes that Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees will not only take the initiative in making arrangements for the instruction of Justicesthroughout their careers on the Bench, but will also encourage the activitiesof other bodies who are providing facilities in this field.     The Magistrates&apos;Association, through its Branches, has long been active in furthering thetraining of Justices;   more and more Universities and other institutions of higher or further education are arranging courses either directedspecifically to Justices or appealing to wider audiences which includeJustices.     The Government recognises the value of all these endeavoursand wishes to encourage then.-13-

and. 7463 (1948) Paragraph 92.-14-RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTERING TRAINING37*   The Royal Commission on Justices of the Peace* pointed out thatvarying local conditions do not allow of any rigid national scheme of instruction to Justices.     Local circumstances and conditions, and people themselves, vary throughout the country.     The training of Justices in rural areas has always presented more difficulty than in the urban areas.     Inthe case of cities and boroughs with their own Commissions it is usual for asubstantial number of Justices to be appointed at the same tire, and it isnot difficult to assemble them for training.     Public coimminications in urban areas are normally available and adequate.     In rural districts, onthe other hand, only one or two new Justices are usually appointed at atime in each Division, and the problem of assembling them for training in a reasonably convenient centre is a very real one.     Public communications maybe inadequate and bad weather can be a decisive factor.     Another feature of country districts is that most benches are served by part-time Clerks, whoalthough&apos; they discharge the ordinary work of a Magistrates&apos; Clerkconscientiously and efficiently, yet have othor commitments and are not always available to give instruction to the Justices.     The boroughs, onthe other hand, are almost entirely served by full-tine Justices&apos; Clerkswho are more easily able to devote time to this important task.     It is right, therefore, that the local Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees, which woraestablished to administer the magistracy, should be charged specificallywith responsibility for providing training schemes in their respective areas.This responsibility they have, on the whole, discharged effectively;especially having regard to the absence in the past of any correspondingobligation on Justices to undertake training.     The Government sees noreason to alter this arrangement now, and it proposes to leave to the magistrates&apos; Courts Committees the responsibility for administering theschemes of instruction in accordance with local conditions and requirements.

CONFIDENTIAL i,       i38.   I/hile it is for the Magistrates! Courts Connittees to arrange who shall give the prescribed instruction it seems likely, and indeed right, thatJustices&apos; Clerks vd.ll usually be asked to cany out a large part of the basic Training and of the Juvenile Court Training.     This training is essentially practical and Clerks are better qualified to inpart the requisiteInformation than persons not irjneditately engaged in the adniiiistration ofjustice in Magistrates&apos; Courts.     Many Clerks already have considerableexperienoe in this work, since they have been carrying into effect theexisting arrangements for training.     There nay be sone difficulty in this regard in Divisions which have only a part-tine Clerk;   but in these casesthe first stage of the Basic Training syllabus nay &quot;well be carried out bythe Chairman of the Bench or by another senior and experienced Magistrate.The second stage nay be arranged on a collective basis at sone convenientcontre.     The Government is, however, exploring the possibility of making available suitably Qualified persons to give instruction to Justices.39.   It will be the duty of magistrates  Courts Committees, as it is now,to see that Justices are provided with such books as they require, and theGovemnent hopes that in all aroas small libraries of books will beavailable for the use of Justices, not only during the course of their training, but also at all other tines.AO.   The Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office will assist Magistrates&apos; CourtsConmittees in the discharge of their obligation to train Justices and will issue notes for the guidance of the Committees.     The Lord Chancellor has appointed a Training Officer who has been charged with this specificresponsibility.     The Training Officer is also Socretary of the NationalAdvisory Council on the Training of Magistrates,-15-

-16-IX The COST OF TRAINING-41.   The expenses incurred by magistrates  Courts Committees indischarging the administrative responsibilities imposed on them by the justices of the Peace Act, 1949 are met by the county and borough councils concerned.     These expenses include specifically the provisionof courses of instruction for Justices and the payment of travelling and subsistence allowances in connection with the attendances ofJustices at approved courses of instruction.     The Government repaysto the local authorities by far the greater part of the amount whichthey have made available to Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees.42.   No Justice will have to pay any of the cost of his training whilefollowing any course which he is required to complete or any approvedcourse, and he will be entitled to travelling and subsistence allowances in appropriate circumstances.     This will apply not only to the coursesnormally administered by the Magistrates&apos; Courts Committee but also those arranged by other bodies, such as the Extramural Department of a university, provided that the course has been approved by theLord Chancellor for inclusion in a scheme of ti?ai ning.43.   The amount of additional expenditure which will arise from the new arrangements outlined in this Paper cannot be precisely estimated, butit should be small.     The extent of the now compulsory training is little more than that which Justices are now encouraged, but not obliged,to undertake.

XJUSTICES 0? THE. Pil-CE SI 0FFICI044-.   The Lord Mayors and Mayors of boroughs and the Chairmen of countycouncils, urban district councils and rural district councils are justices of the Peace by virtue of holding their respective offices.   They numberapproximately 1,600.   Some of these persons may already be Justices of thePeace appointed by name, before they are elected to local government office,but upwards of three-quarters of them will not have been so appointedpersonally.   The Royal Commission on Justices of the Peace* discussed theposition of Justices ex officio and recommended that Chairmen of countycouncils and of urban and rural district councils should cease to beJustices by virtue of their office.   This recommendation has nut been implemented, but the introduction of compulsory training for Magistratesmakes it necessary to re-examine the position of the Justices ex offjLciq.4-5.   Clearly compulsory training, if it is to be applied at all, should cover all Justices and net only those who are appointed to the commission by name.   The local government ex offi^cio Justices, however, assumesoffice as the result of an election and it is not practicable therefore to make his appointment conditional on his undertaking to follow a courseof instruction.   Moreover, a large number of these persons hold office forone year only and therefore they would barely have time to complete their training before they ceosed to be Justices.   The Government is considering whether persons should continue to become Justices by virtue only of holding some other office.   In the meantime, the Government hopes thatthose who become Justices of the Peace ox  ffioio will not exercise their right to act as Magistrates regularly unless they complete the first stage of the Basic Training Course.*Ciad. 74-63 (1948) paragraphs 151-161.-17-CONFIDENTIALN

XI4-6.   The arrangements now announced for the ohligatory training ofJustices are only a beginning.     The National Advisory Council willobserve how these arrangements work in practice and will advise theLord Chancellor from time to time whether, and if so how, theyshould be improved or modified in the light of experience.47-   Ihe National Advisory Council are also considering whether the twobooklets (&quot;Notes for New magistrates &apos; and &quot;The Sentence of the Court&quot;)which are now supplied by the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office to all newlyappointed Justices (see paragraph 10 above), should be replaced byan instructional manual which would be kept up to date and couldbe used also as a continuing work of reference, albeit of a somewhatgeneral and elementary character.48.   The desirability of using other forms of training, includinginstructional films, is also under consideration.49.   Although the Government is aware of the practical difficulties inherent in enforcing the training of busy people who are asked tobecome Justices of the Pea.ce, it regards the proper administrationof justice in the Magistrates&apos; Courts as being of supreme importance.It is therefore determined that every reasonable step should be takento ensure that those who are appointed to the office of Justices ofthe Peace are wholly fitted for the important work which they haveto perform.     What is now to be carried out is orJy the first step.-18-CC :oAA;; LLvrflAA1        1 6 0

A 0XIISJJMMARY50.   In summary, the arrangements for the instruction of Justices ofthe Peace will in future be:-(a) Compulsory training will be introduced for all Justices of thePeace appointed after 1st January, 1966.(b) Compulsory training will be achieved by requiring all thosewho ha.ve been approved for appointment as Justices to give anundertaking that, if they are appointed, they will complete a prescribed course of basic instruction within a year.     Theywill also be required to undertake to complete a course ofJuvenile Court Training either before they are elected toa Juvenile Court Panel or within a year of becoming a memberof such a Panel.(c) A Justice who fails to comply with this undertaking withoutgood cause may be removed from the Commission.     The LordChancellor will have power, at his discretion, to grant anextension of tine in which to complete the course in appropriate cases.(d) The Lord Chancellor will have power to exempt any individual or any specified class of person from having to undertake acourse of instruction, or any part of it.(e) Both the basic course of instruction for Justices newlyappointed to the Commission and the special course of instruction for Juvenile Court Justices will be in two stagesand will be carried out in accordance with a. syllabus preparedby the National Advisory Council on the Training of Magistrates.(f) In addition to the compulsory courses of instruction, courses for all Justices on the Commissions of the Peace will be arranged by Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees on a voluntary basis.     these will include visits to penal institutions.(g) The Government will encourage Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees tomake greater use of courses organised by the Magistrates1Association, by Universities and by ether similar bodies.(h) Responsibility for administering the schemes of instructionwill rest with the local Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees, whowill receive assistance and guidance from the Lord Chancellor&apos;department.(i)   Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees will provide such books as maybe required by Justices during the course of their training and at other times.-IP-CONFIDENTIAL

Expenses necessarily incurred by Justices in followingcourses of instruction -which have been approved by the LcrdChancellor will be defrayed out of public funds.The amount of additional expenditure which will be incurred in consequence of the arrangements outlined in this paper islikely to be small.Justices of the Peace ex offigdo must be subject to obligatorytraining to the same extent as other Justices, but there arepractical difficulties in the way of applying trainingschemes to these persons.     The Government is considering whether persons should continue to be Justices by virtue only of holding sone other office.The arrangements now announced for the obligatory trainingof Justices are only a beginning.     They will be extended and improved in the light of experience.-20-

SYLLABUS FOR BASIC TRADTETG-of mitii i^oj^^^^i^o tks^ace1.     For the purposes of Basic Training, a newly appointed. Justice of thePeace is a person who is first so appointed after 1st January, 1966.The Lord Chancellor nay exempt any particular individual or any class of person from undertaking this training or any specified part of it(e.g. persons who on appointment to the Bench already hold judicial office or are practising lawyers).2.     The Basic Training Course does not include any instruction in relationto the work of Juvenile Courts;   there is a separate syllabus for thistraining which Justices need not undertake unless they wish to do so.Justices who are appointed to Juvenile Court Panels will, however, berequired to complete this specialised training if they have not already done so.3.     The Basic Training of newly appointed Justices is to be carried outin two stages and is designed to enable them -(a) To understand the nature of their duties so that they shall acquire thejudicial mind and accordingly act judicially whilst sitting on the Bench.(b) To obtain sufficient knowledge of the law to follow with understandingany normal case they may be called upon to hear.(c) To acquire a working knowledge of the rules of evidence particularlyin relation to what is admissible and what inadmissible.(d) To leam the various courses which may be taken in dealing withoffenders so that they understand the nature and purpose of the sentence whichthey impose, and the other methods of treatment which they may use, and their effect.(e) To understand the relationship which should exist between members of the bench, the Clerk to the Justices, the Probation Officers and the staff of theCourts, and the duties in court of the police and of advocates.-21 -appendix a

The First Stage will consist of -(a) Attendance as an observer on not less than three occasions for a totalperiod of not less than six hours at a Magistrates&apos; Court sitting in PettySessions.     It is highly desirable that one sucn attendance should be at acourt other than the Justice&apos;s own court.     After each attendance of anew Justice at his own court the Chairman, Clerk or a senior Justice willspend a short tine with the Justice to explain what has happened in court or to answer any questions.(b) Instruction on the  Magistrate and his Office.     This will dealgenerally with a Justice&apos;s duties and his relationship to the public.     Itwill stress-.hat is meant by a judicial attitude, a judicial mind and actingjudicially.     It will explain the necessity for decorum on the Bench and forthe action to be taken if there is any possibility of bias, whether realor apparent, through any interest which a Justice might have in a particular case or in the parties in any proceeding before the Court.     The relationship between the Bench and the Clerk and other staff will be explained, and alsothe positions and functions of advocates and the police.     A few words willbe said about the work of a Justice out of Court, if only to warn a newJustice not to sign documents unless he is convinced that he can and should sign them,(c) Instruction on the practice and procedure In  magistrates   Courts andevidenee.     This vail be extremely elementary and will give an outline of themanner in vnich cases are conducted, explaining the difference between civil and criminal cases and between summary and indictable offences, and betweenthe procedure when cases are being tried and -when they are being heardwith a view to committal to another court for trial.     The organisation ofthe Court will be explained and new Justices will be shown specimens of formsand other documents in common use.   In relation to evidence, it is important to stress bhe kind of evidence that is admissible and inadmissible0   Thedifference between the burden of proof in civil and criminal cases   and between matters of law and matters of fact will be pointed out.; -22-

(&amp;) Instruction on the methods of punishment and treatment. This will cover in the simplest terms possible methods of dealing with offenders.(e)   Instruction on Domestic and other Civil proceedings.   This willexplain as simply as possible the jurisdiction of Justices in domesticproceedings and the various other kinds of civil and administrative workwhich they may be called upon to do.6.     Newly appointed Justices are expected to read any books which aresupplied to them on their appointment, or are recommended for theirinstruction, by the Lord Chancellor.SECOND STA&amp;E7.     The Second Stage of the Basic Training of newly appointed Justiceswill not begin until the Justice has sat and adjudicated on at least three occasions in Petty Sessions, and it must be completed within twelve monthsof his &quot;aeing sworn in.   It will consist of instruction in six subjects and certain visits to institutions.8.     Instruction(a) The Magistrates&apos; Court arid its place in the judicial system, expandingupon the matters referred to in the Basic Training and including the reviewof Magistrates&apos; decisions by way of appeal.   At this stage something morewill be said about the rules of evidence, the burden of proof, and aboutpractice and procedure.   A brief description of the arrangements for providing legal aid will also be given.(b) Road Traffic offences and penalties, with special emphasis on thestatutory penalties enjoined in certain circumstances.(c) The problems of punishment and treatment.   In addition to recapitu-lating the methods of dealing with offenders, particular reference will bemade to -(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)the objectives of sentencing;possible sentences, including fines;the factors influencing the choice of a particular sentence;the methods of obtaining information about offenders and advice as to their treatment;consistency in sentencing;the mental condition of offenders and whether this needsspecific attention, and if so, how this may be ensured;the right of Justices to visit certain prisons and other institutions and their demeanour when visiting them.(v)(vi)23-

(&amp;)   Probation, -pith particular reference to probation orders with special requierements, and including the related committee work.(e) domestic proceedings, including the jurisdiction of magistrates  Courts,their powers and duties, with particular reference to the welfare of theparties and their children.(f) Matters other than criminal or domestic proceedings which cone beforeMagistrates1 Courts.   This will include the committee work of Justices inrelation to liquor licensing and betting licensing, the registration ofclubs, such civil proceedings as are heard in Magistrates&apos; Courts and such applications as may be made to individual Justices (including the signing of documents).9*     &quot;Visits to InstitutionsA newly appointed Justice must, within the first year of his appointment,visit a prison to which his Court commits on remand, ani either a seniordetention centre cr a Borstal.The objects of visiting Institutions are to stimulate the interest ofthe new Justice in penal treatment and to acquaint him with the nature ofthe punishment which he can inflict.In addition to those books with which newly appointed Justices aresupplied on appointment by the Lord Chancellor and which they should read as soon as possible, all Justices are strongly advised to read any otherbooks which may be recommended to them by the Lord Chancellor, theirMagistrates1 Courts Committee or their Clerk.11.   Attendance at Other CourtsParticularly in the early months after his first appointment, a newlyappointed Justice should make every effort to visit other Courts (Assizes,County and Borough Quarter Sessions and other magistrates  Courts).Justices appointed to County Commissions of the Peace should take any opportunity which is offered to them of attending and sitting at quarter sessions.   Clerks will assist their Justices in any way that they can tocarry out this recommendation.EECOMMENMTIONS

12.   Bench MeetingsNewly appointed Justices should take every opportunity of attendingmeetings of Justices of a Bench or any other meetings of Justices whichmay ae arranged.   These meetings, at which procedure, sentencing policy,new legislation and decisions of superior courts may be discussed, areof value to all Justices at all times, but they are of special value tonewly appointed Justices, who are given, an opportunity at such meetingsto ask questions and to obtain advice from more experienced colleagues.-25-&apos; -i        r\-8- w s3
