vessels DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC i,.AJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 17914th December, 1965CABINETCOMMERCIAL POLICY:  IMPORTS OF BROILER CHICKENSFROM DENMARKMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the External Economic Policy Sub-Committee of the economic development Committee considered on 6th October an application madeby the National Farmers&apos; Union jointly with the National Association ofPoultry Packers for the imposition of an anti-dumping duty on Danishbroiler chickens, and agreed that (although there was a clear case forimposing an anti-dumping duty) we should try to reach a reasonable by negotiation with the Danes.    It was not thought necessaryto decide at that stage on a ceiling figure for Danish exports to us,although it was agreed that we should want a figure lower than the13,000 tons annually which represented the rate of imports from them inthe first six months of 1965.     Ministers subsequently agreed that weshould try to settle the case on a limit of 6, 500 tons, warning the Danesthat if no settlement could be reached, we would impose an anti-dumpingduty.2.       Officials have discussed the case with Danish officials.     the danes disputed our findings of dumping and material injury, but wereprepared to restrict their exports to recent levels.    They werepersuaded to reduce them still further and were apparently prepared toagree to 8, 000 tons a year, with no grov/th factor, and not more than000 tons in any one month.     The Department of Economic Affairs,Foreign Office and Board of Trade consider this would be a satisfactory settlement.     8,000 tons is well below the actual imports of 11,100 tons from Denmark in 1964-65, when British production was about 250,000tons.3.       The Minister of Agriculture believes that a stand must be madeon the figure of 6, 500 tens phased evenly over the year and that, if this figure is unacceptable to the Danes, the imposition of an anti-dumpingduty could, if necessary, be justified in GATT.    In his view, theproposal to go to 8,000 tons in order to reach agreement with the Danesignores the fundamental issues, viz:(a)    the United Kingdom broiler industry is unsubsidised and istherefore especially entitled to proper protection from unfairforeign competition;   the agricultural industry will regard this case as a test of the Governments good faith on the protectionof agriculture against foreign dumping;-1-copy NO,G6

Danish broiler exports to the United Kingdom have always been small.    In 1963, the last year before the Danes started dumpingbroilers, they sent us 640 tons, and only in 1958 did they sendus as much as 2, 600 tons.     They have obtained their present level only by unfair competition.     They have no right to any ofthat extra tonnage;  it is, therefore, extremely generous togive them the right to send, at dumped prices, a tonnage tentimes as great as they were previously sending;under the National Plan, the poultry industry is expected to meetthe whole of the increased demand for poultry meat;   thisassessment was specifically based on the understanding thatthe industry would be protected from unfair competition.     Togive the Danes the quantity the Board of Trade are suggestingwould give them virtually the whole of the increase in the first year of the Plan and between 20 and 25 per cent of the total increase during the period of the Plan as a whole.    It wouldbe justifiably attacked as entirely inconsistent with the aims ofthe Plan and as throwing doubt on the sincerity of theGovernments intentions on the Plan as a whole.     There is notechnical difficulty in the way of the United Kingdom industrymeeting, at reasonable prices, the whole of the increase in demand, and every ton given to the Danes represents a quiteunnecessary drain on our balance of payments - in favour of a country with which we already have a very substantial adverse balance of trade;the finding of the Board of Trade&apos;s investigation was that a con-tinuance of Danish imports at their recent level would materiallyinjure the United Kingdom industry if no action were taken;  inthe judgment of the Ministry as the Production department responsible, a reduction to 8,000 tons would not be sufficientto prevent the injury, and the industry would not be getting theprotection to which it is entitled under the legislation;the presentational aspect vis-a-vis the agricultural industry isvery important.     The Government have faced increasingcriticism from the industry over the bacon sharing understanding,and have recently had to refuse a request for an increasedshare for the British industry in order to maintain to the full the spirit of our obligation to the Danes.    It is thus highly understandable that the Government should have to defend asettlement on broilers on grounds which the industry will findquite unconvincing.    If it is not given the protection of an anti-dumping duty, the industry will justifiably expect that any&quot;deal&quot; on the basis of a voluntary quantitative restriction should give corresponding protection;   the industry would expect a figure comparable to the imports from Denmark before dumpingbegan, and will find even 6, 500 tons very hard to acceptwithout considerable public criticism;the Minister nevertheless thinks that it would be possible tojustify 6, 500 tons maximum to the industry;  that figure has the valuable presentational advantage that it is below the Danishsales to us in 1964 (about 7, 000 tons) when the industry had agood year;-2-

(g)    there is no evidence - indeed previous experience points to the reverse - to indicate that a concession to the Danes on thismatter would mitigate their critical attitude towards us on other issues.4.      In the Minister&apos;s view, therefore, the balance of the argumentspoints in fact to a figure substantially lower than 6, 500 tons, but hehas been prepared to agree to that figure in ox*der to try to meet hiscolleagues;  in his view, however, such a figure, evenly phased overthe year, must be regarded as the absolute maximum.5.       The President agrees with (f);  but the Danes have said that theywill not accept 6, 500 tons and that, failing agreement with us, tliey willrestrict their exports to us unilaterally at a rather higher figure than8,000 tons and take us to GATT if we then impose an anti-dumpingduty.    We cannot be sure that they would carry out this threat, but ifthey were to do se, the Board of Trade believe we might have the v/orstof ail worlds.6.       Anti-dumping duties can be imposed, consistently with the GATTand consistently with United Kingdom legislation, only where materialinjury is caused or threatened to a domestic industry.     The Board ofTrade could not reasonably &quot;be satisfied&quot;, as they are required to be by our anti-dumping legislation, that exports at a known and limited levelcf even 9,000 tens a year, with suitable phasing, would result inmaterial injury to our large broiler industry (especially while admittingthat exports at a level of 6, 500 tons - the level already offered to the danes - would not).    Even at 10,000 tons, imports would be no morethan 4 per cent of domestic production.7.       If the Danes were to carry out their threat, therefore, v/e wouldbe faced with the choice of accepting imports at a rather higher level than 8,000 tons, or of imposing anti-dumping duties which it v/ould bevery difficult to defend as being consistent with our statutory and international obligations.     (As a large part of our own exports aredumped, we wish other countries to adopt a liberal interpretation of&quot;material injury&quot;.     Certainly the doctrine that dumping has &quot;no right&quot;to sales (see paragraph 3(b) above) whether or not material injury iscaused, is not one which the United Kingdom could accept).0.       The Board of Trade cannot see the relevance of the national plan to the question cf deciding whether imports should be limited to, 000 or 6, 500 tons;  for the difference cf 1, 500 tons could hardlyjeopardise the prospects of increasing poultry production by the100,000 tons (including 70,000 tons of broilers) which the Plan saysshould be achieved by 1970.     The Presidents view is that it would be quite wrong to forgo the chance of settling this case by agreement withthe Danes in order to save the difference of 1, 500 tons from them.9.       In the light of these opposing views, the Cabinet is asked todecide what reply should be given to the Danes.     The alternative coursesar e:-(a)    to inform the Danes that we cannot agree to a higher figurethan 6, 500 tons, evenly phased over the 12 months, and thatfailing agreement an anti-dumping duty would be imposed;

(b)    to agree to a total of 0, 000 tons with not more than 800 tons inany one month.    If Ministers agree to this, we should askKer Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Copenhagen to seek confirmationthat Danish Ministers are also prepared to agree, and toagree with the Danes on the form of a public announcement.D.P.
