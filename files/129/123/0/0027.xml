ROAD SAFETY LEGISLATION:  DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Minister of TransportNeed for a White paper the Cabinet approved earlier this year (C.C.(65) 52nd Con-clusions, Minute 2) the drink and driving provisions of the Road SafetyBill,    It is now clear that the Bill will not be ready in time for publication before Christmas.    Last June the Home Affairs committee agreed that there should be no large-scale Christmas propaganda campaign on drink and driving this year on the assumption that publicityassociated with public ation of the Bill might take the place of a cam-paign.    Since the Bill will not now be ready in time, the Home AffairsCommittee agreed at its meeting on 8th December that a White paper should be published instead.    I hope to publish it on Tuesday, 21stDecember.2.       The second part of the White Paper will deal with the safety oflorries about which there is much public concern.    It will enable us toset out the full range of measures v/e are taking to improve theirsafety.    It will also make the goods vehicle provisions of the Bill itselfeasier to understand since they will be enabling and somewhat technical.3,       The iThite Paper will have the advantage of enabling the issues raised by the Bill to be discussed in public during the Christmas recess.This could, be very helpful in juding public reaction to some of theseverer measures that will be put before Parliament.Text of White Paper4.       The Home Affairs Committee approved the draft of the white paper subject to redrafting on a number of points and invited me tosubmit it for consideration by the Cabinet.     The amendments suggestedby the Home Affairs Committee have been incorporated in the attachedrevised draft, to which I seek my colleagues&apos; approval.T. F.Ministry of Transport, S.

C ^5 N FIDE NT! AL&amp; .L &apos;a road SAFETY LEGISLATIONINTRODUCTION1.     The Governments road safety legislation in the present session of Parliament will deal with two subjects;   the pre-vention of accidents involving drinking drivers and the safety of goods vehicles.    This &quot;Jhite Paper explains the background to the Governments proposals.PART I;    ALCOHOL AND ROAD ACCIDENTSTHE PROBLEMHow alcohol affects drivers2.     Alcohol is only one of the many factors which combine to cause road accidents;   hut it is a serious one.    Moreover, itcan he avoided more easily than many others.3.     Research carried out since the war, both in this countryand abroad, has shown beyond all reasonable doubt that therisk of accident increases as the concentration of alcohol ina driver&apos;s bloodstream rises beyond a certain level;    and thatthe risk increases more rapidly the greater the concentrationbecomes.k.     The reason why alcohol impairs driving ability is that it affects the brain and central nervous system.    What matters,therefore, is the concentration of alcohol in these tissues,rather than the amount of drink consumed.    The alcohol isabsorbed into the bloodstream and distributed rapidly in the body tissues.    Ample experimental evidence shows that the concentration of alcohol in the blood is the best measurableindication of the amount of alcohol actually affecting adriver.    In this country the concentration is usuallyexpressed in terms of milligrammes of alcohol per 100millilitres of blood (mg./l00 ml.)/5.l.

Road Accidents - Christmas1959, Road Research Technical Paper No. 49, London 1960,Fatal Road Accidents at Christmas 1963, Road ^searchTechnical Paper No. 72, London 1964?    Road Accidents inDecember 1964 and January 1965 % Road Research TechnicalPaper No.79, London,  1965-    H.K.S.O.2.hi  . *j5.     The amount of alcohol a person has to consume to pro-duce a given concentration in the blood varies according toa number of factors, such as his weight and constitution, theperiod over which the alcohol is consumed, the form in whichit is taken, and whether he drinks on a full or emptystomach.    It is largely because differences in these factorsaffect the blood alcohol concentration that the same amountof alcohol can produce markedly different effects in differentpeople or in the same person at different times.How many accidents would be saved if drivers did not drink?6,     Until recently it has not been possible to estimate theproportion of accidents which would not have happened if none of the drivers involved had been drinking.    On the one hand,the road accident statistics compiled in this country frompolice reports mention alcohol as a factor only if the accidentis fatal or serious and if there is sufficient evidence tojustify an arrest for driving while impaired by alcohol.    Torreasons which will be explained later, these figures have seriously under-estimated the real position and are no longerused.7.     On the other hand, various accident investigations,including the Road Research Laboratory&apos;s Reports on fatalroad accidents at Christmas 1959,  1963 and 1964 (1) have shown the proportion of serious road accidents in which the driverwas known to have been drinking.    Studies of this kind are extremely useful, but they cannot show how many of the/accidents

accidents in which a driver had been drinking were &quot;caused&quot;(2) by drink.    To do this, it would be necessary to comparethe blood-alcohol concentrations of drivers involved in roadaccidents with those of another group of drivers not involvedin accidents,    Studies of this kind require either a verylarre number of drivers willing to submit voluntarily tomeasurements of their blood-alcohol Level when asked, orlegal powers requiring them to do so.    So far no investigation of this kind has been conducted in Great Britain.8.     But three such studies have been made - in Canada,Czechoslovakia and the United States,    All of them showgreatly increased accident risks with increasing concentrations of alcohol in the driver&apos;s blood.    The largest, most thorough and most recent of these studies was made by IndianaTJniversitj/- in the city of Grand &quot;Rapids, IJichigan, U.S.A. underthe direction of Professor Borkenstein (3),    The results ofthis study, which have been further analysed in this country/by the(2)   Accidents are caused by a combination of circumstances ofwhich the driver&apos;s impairment by alcohol may be one.    In somecases the accident would have happened whether he had beendrinking or not:    in others it would have been avoided if hehad not been drinking.    It might, of course, equally well havebeen avoided, even though he had been drinking, if one of theother factors present could have been prevented.    As far aspossible, the word cause is therefore avoided in this Paper,because it can be misleading.    In those cases where it is used,in the interest of conciseness, it is used in the sense thatthe accident would not have happened if the driver had not beendrinking and not in the sense that drink was the only cause, or that the accident could not have been prevented by the removalof other factors.(3)   BOHIGNSTEIN, R.F.    et al.

by the Road Research Laboratory and are consistent with otherresearch on this subject, are summarised below.    although these results relate to a study made in America, there is noreason to suppose that they are markedly different from whatwould be found for drivers on the road in &quot;Britain.    small scale studies carried out by the Road Research Laboratory inthis country agree with the American figures, although theyare based on samples too small to be conclusive by themselves,There is no reason to suppose that at a given blood-alcohollevel the performance of British drivers is affecteddifferently from that of American drivers.Average increases in risk9.The average risk of being involved in an accident fordrivers&quot; as a whole increases as the concentration of alcoholin the blood rises beyond about 40 mg/100 ml.    Above a coticen-tration of about 60 mg./l00 ml. the increase is rapid.    Inthe Grand Rapids study the figures were as followssTable I:    Increase in drinking drivers 1 risk of being involvedin an accident    (American results)Risk compared with risk whenBlood alcohol level(mg/100 ml;160 or more (mean valueabout 190)drivers have not been drinking*21 times as great140	- 159	10     &quot;	1!120	- 139	5	II100	- 119	6     &quot;	II90	-   99	2     11	II80	-   89	1.9   &quot;	II70	-   79	1.5   &quot;	II60	-   90	1.4   &quot;	II50	-   59	1.2    &quot;	11*For	the purpose of these	figures drivers	were having been drinking if their blood alcohol level was less than10 mg./!00 ml.

hi Jt UThese figures show that at levels above 160 mg./l00 ml., the chance of a driver*s being involved in an accident is, morethan twenty times what it would be if he had not beendrinking.     The figures are shown in the form of a graph inFigure 1.Variations between individuals10.    It is not feasible to measure or compare the accidentrisk of individuals in studies of this kind, but individualscan be grouped according to characteristics such as age, sex,driving experience and drinking habits.     Comparisons on this basis show that the increase in risk after taking alcohol variesfrom group to group.     For instance young drivers and people whodrink infrequently are more seriously affected by small amounts of alcohol than are older, more regular drinkers.     But above a concentration of about 80 mg./too ml., all groups of drivers are seriously affected.Proportion of avoidable accidents11.    Some accidents in v/hich a driver has been drinking evenquite substantial amounts of alcohol would still have happened even if he had not been drinking.     But the figuresfrom the American study given in Table I can be analysed toshow that when a. driver involved in an accident has a high bloodalcohol concentration, the chance that the accident was &quot;caused&quot;by drink is very high (Table II),     A very high proportion of accidents involving drivers with high blood alcohol levels could therefore be avoided if those drivers had not been drinking.The proportion of avoidable accidents is smaller at the lowerblood alcohol levels.5.

Table II:   Proportion of drinking drivers involved in accidentswho would not have been involved if they had not beendrinkingBlood alcohol levelting./TOO ml. V160 or more140 - 159120 - 139100 - 11990 -   9980 -   8970 -   7960 - -6950 -   59Proportion who would not have beeninvolved95908083494734291712.    On the basis of these figures, if it were possible to dissuade or prevent all drivers from drinking, the number ofdrivers involved in road accidents would be reduced by 6$.    Thecorresponding reduction in accidents would he between 5$ ^d9$ depending on the number of single-vehicle accidents andaccidents involving two or more drivers who had been drinking.Prosecutions under the present law are rare at blood alcoholLevels below 150 mg/100 ml.    But the figures show that out ofevery 100 drivers who would not have been involved in an accident if they had not been drinking, 56 had blood-alcohollevels below 150 mg./l00 ml. and 14 had levels below100 mg./l00 ml.13.    If these American results are applied to the latestBritish road accident casualty figures, between 20,000 and35,000 casualties a year could be saved if no driver drovewith more than 40 mg./l00 ml. of alcohol in his bloodstream.If nc driver drove, with more than 80 mg./too ml. of alcoholin his bloodstream between 18,000 and 32,000 casualtiescould be saved,6,CONFIDENTIAL

14.    Research has shown that accidents &quot;caused&quot; by drink tendto bo more serious than accidents in general.    So one would expect the proportion of fatal accidents that would not have happened if the drivers had not boon drinking to bo higherthan the 5-9/  range.    This is supported by the analysis ofthe results of post-mortem examinations of the blood-alcoholcontent of drivers and motorcyclists killed in read accidentsin Sngland and Wales during December 1964 and January 1965.Over 13/   of these drivers had blood-alcohol concentrationsabove 150 mg./too ml.    Over 22? had concentrations above80 mg./l00 ml.    If the ratios obtained from the Americanresearch are true of drivers in this country, then over 20c/cof the drivers killed in these two months last winter wouldnot have been killed if they had not been drinking.The Social Problem15.    The prevention of road accidents caused by drink is largely a social problem;    many people have grown accustomed to drive to and from places where they consume alcohol and,as the ownership and use of private transport increases, theproblem will grow, unless steps are taken to solve it.    Ifthe deaths and casualties caused by alcohol are to bo pro-vented social habits must change.    People must eitherseverely restrict the amount they drink before driving or theymust arrange their social lives so that they do not need to drive after drinking.    There is no other alternative.16.    It was with the object of placing these facts fullybefore the nation that the previous Administration planneda large scale government campaign last winter with theslogan;    ::Don&apos;t ask a man to drink and drive&quot;.    The present government supported this campaign and carried it out, ata cost of nearly half a million pounds.    In some ways the campaign was successful.    There is reasonably good evidencethat it accelerated the change which was already taking/place7.

C5 f*C:.place in the attitude of the public on this subject and madedrivers better informed about the problem.17.    Sut3 while the campaign had a good effect on attitudes,there is little evidence that it affected the behaviour ofthose who drink before driving.    This is, perhaps,  not sur-prising since studies suggest that the larger part of accidents which are due to drink are caused by a relatively small number of drivers, who are in the habit of drinkingfairly heavily.    (On the basis of the figures in paragraph11 more than 80&apos;,&apos; of the accidents which would not have happened if the driver had not boon drinking involve driverswho have probably consumed at least the equivalent of6-9 pints of beer or 6 - 9 double tots of spirits).18.    It is clear that even a massive and sustained campaignis unlikely to achieve any measurable change in the behaviour of such drivers.    Persuasion must, therefore, be backed byan effective legal deterrent - not so much to punish driverswho offend but to dissuade from excessive drinking thosedrivers who at present are careless of the safety of them-selves and others.    This would also make it easier for driversto refuse to drink before driving - without appearingunsociable.8. /19-

THE&apos; :PBEBENT&apos; attftW19.    The present ls-v on driving while unfit through drink (ordrugs) is contained in Section 6 of the Road Traffic act -\ 960and Sections 1  - J ox the Road. Traffic -Act 1962.    The 1 962 Actmade it clear that 0 driver is guilty ox an offence if his ability to drive properly is i;ior the time being impaired&quot; byalcohol;    and it requires the Courts to have regard to any evidence that might be produced showing by analysis ormeasurement the proportion of alcohol in the driver&apos;s bloodor present in his body.    But it gave the courts no guidance onthe degree of impairment to be expected at different blood-alcohol levels.11s Shortc omings20.   These new provisions have no,: been in force for three yearsand, although the number of cases brought before the courts bythe police has risen,  it is clear that they have had little effect.    The scientific evidence proves that the abilityox elraoct all drivers to drive properly is impaired atblood alcohol concentrations of 80 mg/l 00 ml and that everhalf the accidents due to drink involve drivers whose blood-alcohol level is less than 150 mg./,00 ml.    But prosecutions arerarely brought at concentrations less than 150 mg./l 00 ml.,except ,.here an accident has occurred,    Moreover, a high pro-portion of drivers with very high blood-alcohol concentrationswho are committed to Quarter Sessions for trial are acquitted;in the last quarter of 19&amp;U in the Metropolitan Police Districta third of the drivers committed for trial who had been shovvn byurine analysis to have blood.-alcoh.ol concentrations over200 mg./i00 ml. were aquitted and nearly half those with blood-alcohol concentrations between 150 and 200 mg./l 00 ml.2;.    The main reason for this is that, despite the references to&quot;impairment!; introduced in the  .962 Act, conviction stilldepends to a large extent on evidence of the accused&apos;s manner- 9 -CONFIDENTIAL

oi driving or his personal appearance end behaviour.    But by thetime a person&apos;s driving has become affected to such an extent that it attracts the attention of a police constable, hisdriving ability is likely to be grossly impaired.    At levels-.-ell below 150 mg/, 00 ml. a driver can be a serious risk to himself and others but show little or no outwards signs of it,either in his manner of driving or his appearance or behaviour.Even a clinical examination by a doctor is not sufficientlysensitive or reliable tc detect impairment at these levels and the British Medical Association have recornmendedstronglyagainst its use for this jurpcse (h).22.    The second reasons is that, where evidence oi the blood-alcohol concentration is available,  some courts still ask for it to-be translated into the amount of drink the driver musthave consumed.    This is an unreliable and misleading procedure,per the reasons already given in paragraph 5 the amount oialcohol needed to produce a given concentration of alcoholin the blood varies according to a number of iactors;    andthis fact is one oi the main reasons why some people are ableto drink more than others before being affected seriously.    thus a concentration of 150 mg./i00 ml. could be produced by as little as h but might require as many as 13 pints of beer or doublemeasures of spirits.    To give the accused the benefit of thedoubt the lower figure has to be given in court, whereas, if heis a regular heavy drinker, the probability is that the amounthe has consumed is nearer the upper end of the range.    It isthe blood-alcohol concentration and not the amount drunk thatreally matters, because the former reflects the amount ofalcohol affecting the brain.    The B.H.A, have recently said (It.)that new knowledge of the factors influencing rates of absorptionand elimination, particularly when a person is drinking over along period oi time and possibly with food - as is likely to bethe case in ordinary social circumstances - has confirmed that(k)   &quot;The Drinking Driver&quot; Report of a Special Committee of theBritish Medical Association, London ,965 (British medical association)- 10 -CONFIDENTIAL^       VIII.

fat t*Ja most unrealistic picture is given by tables purporting to convert the blood-alcohol concentration into the amount ofdrink consumed.    As a consequence the Association no longerpublished conversion tables of this kind.THE GOVERNMENT * 8 proposals the New Offence.25.    The present law is clearly unsatisfactory and theGovernment decided earlier this year that legislation shouldbe introduced under which a person driving, attempting to drive, or in charge 01 a motor vehicle ./ould be guilty of an offence if he aas shown by a test to have a blood-alcoholconcentration above a prescribed figure.    The government propose that the penalties for the new offences should be thesame as for the corresponding offences under the existing law,including a lneer penalty for the &quot;in charge&quot; than for the&quot;driving&quot; offence.The Prescribed Level2ip.    The british Medical Association have recommended that thelevel should be 80 mg./,00 ml.    They state that there can bevery lew people whose ability to drive properly is notimpaired and their accident risk increased to a signixicantextent at blood-alcohol concentrations in excess of 6&apos;0 mg./i 00 mlAt the same time they make it clear that a concentration of less than that amount cannot be accepted as evidence that ability to drive properly has not been impaired by alcohol.    TheMedical Research Council have also considered the evidence aboutthe association between the. consumption of alcohol andimpairment of driving ability and the recommendation of theB.M.A.    They have concluded that the consumption of alcohol inamounts sufficient to cause a blood alcohol concentration of50 mg./i 00 ml.  or more .7ould impair driving ability in an appreciable proportion of drivers, and that when the amount ofalcohol consumed results in a concentration in the blood of- 11--

* (y r%hi    4)60 mg./i 00 ml. or more,  driving&apos; ability vvould be impaired inthe great majority of drivers.    The Government are,  therefore,satisfied that at a level of 80 mg./i 00 ml. virtually anyone&apos;sdriving ability would be impaired to some extent and that in thevast majority or cases the impairment   .ould be serious.    accord-ingly they propose that the law should prescribe a level of80 mg./l 00 ml.25.    But since many drivers are seriously affected by alcoholat concentrations down to 50 mg./l00 ml. and in exceptional cases lower still,  the existing law should be retained to dealwith those cases ..here evidence of &quot;impairment&quot; can be shewn.Moreover the Minister of Transport ,yill be empowered to vary theprescribed concentration,  subject to affirmative resolution ofboth Houses or Parliament, if this appears desirable in the lightor sxpe ri enc e.Enforcement26.    An offence based on the concentration of alcohol in the blood raises difficult problems of enforcement.    The existingla&apos;.: is unsatisfactory mainly because conviction is largely dependent on clear outward signs of impaired behaviour, whichare usually present only at very high blood-alcoholconcentrations and often are net apparent at all at lower levels,  in spite ox serious impairment of driving ability.Therefore,  simply to make it an offence to drive ,.ith a blood-alcohol concentration of more than 80 mg./l CO ml.  .;culd makelittle difference unless the police are also given peers toenable them to detect and apprehend drivers with a blood-alcoholconcentration above this level, even when there is no outwardevidence that they are unfit to drive.27.    Under their existing powers the police can arrest a driverand take him to a police station only if they consider that his ability to drive properly is impaired by alcohol or other drugs.In practice this generally means that they take action only- 12 -

-* 51 *&quot;* *sht &amp; Vwhen a driver&apos;s behaviour is visibly affected to a markedextent.    The proposed amendment of the law without any extension of existing police powers, would greatly increasethe likelihood or conviction in the kind of case nowprosecuted - that is in the aorst cases of literally drunkendriving.    It might also lead to prosecutions being undertaken in a number oi cases where there is substantial impairment but which do not at present lead to prosecution because of thedifficulty of proof.    But the deterrent effect of this wouldbe likely to be small in the large number of cases whereability to drive is impaired but no outward signs of it can bedetected.Screening Tests28.    There appear to be two practicable ways in which these difficulties could be met and proper enforcement of the new lawmade possible.    Both involve roadside checks by means of a simple breath test carried cut on the spot ...ith a smallportable device ahich gives an immediate reading calibratedto show whether it is probable that the, level ox alcohol inthe blood is above or below the prescribed level and /-netherit is therefore reasonable to require the driver to undergo afurther test at the police station.    It is not a reliablepermanent record and it could not be used as evidence in courtin substitution for specimens given under proper safeguards atthe police station and analysed independently at a laboratory.It would, however,  be an effective way of eliminating at once the vast majority of drivers who were below   the level.    the test is simple and takes only a few minutes.29,    The first way would be by means of spot checks at theroadside.    This would involve stopping individual vehicles atrandom and asking drivers to take a screening test even when the rev/e re no grounds for suspecting that they had had any drink.    Ifthe test showed a reaction above the prescribed level this wouldbe made a sufficient ground for suspecting the driver of&apos;- 13 -

- Ik -committing the blood-alcohol level offence and taking him toa police station for a standard test, the result of whichcould be given in evidence.    If the reaction from the breathtest v/as below the prescribed level the driver would be ablego en his way.

pL ^130.    The second way would be to empower the police to stop a vehicle and ash the driver to submit to a screening test only ifthey had grounds for suspecting that he had taken alcohol.    Thiswould not enable cheers to be carried out at random on the openroad;  they would tend to be made outside places where drink was known to be consumed,  such as public houses, hotels and clubs.But drivers who have been in these places may well not have beendrinking; nor are these the only places where drivers can consumealcohol.    Yet if a driver were seen being stopped by the police in this way, the implication would be that he was guilty of the offence.31.    Both methods of conducting roadside screening tests raisethe difficult question of the proper way to deal with drivers -horefuse or are unable to perform the test.    If it were possible torefuse with impunity guilty drivers could escape  the provisionsof the law completely.    On the other hand some drivers may havegood, medical or other reasons for refusing or being unable to perform the roadside test,    (For example a doctor hurrying to visit an acutely sick patient, or an asthmatic person who cannotblow easily).32.    The Government have given very fully consideration to these problems and have come to the conclusion that roadside screening-tests are desirable if the new law concerns driving .vith more thana prescribed level of alcohol in the blood is to be properlyenforced and have the necessary effect of deterring drivers fromdriving while they are a danger to themselves and others.    TheGovernment consider that random checks would be preferable.These checks would be completely fair and undiscriminating andwould cast no slur on the driver who happened to be stopped,They would be the most effective deterrent, since any driverwould be liable to oe stopped at any time to see whether he hadexceeded the statutory blood-alcohol level,,/33- 15 -

O. P33 o    The Government think that it should rot be an offence to refuse the roadside test if a person can show reasonable grounds for doing so.    The same should apply if, for some reasons, he weregenuinely unable to perform the test.    If a person refuses totake the roadside test and cannot show good reason the Govern:::.aitpropose that he should be liable to a fine.    But to preventguilty persons from evading proceedings for the more seriousoffence of driving with more than the prescribed level ofalcohol in the blood by opting for the lesser offence andlesser penalty involved in refusing a roadside test the police should have tne power to arrest a person who refuses or who doesnot carry out the test satisfactorily and take him to the policestation for a standard test,  if they nave reason to think he hasbeen&apos;drinking at all.3h.    These proposals are drastic.    But the Government believe the majority of people in this country will support them as theonly way of dealing effectively with a serious and growing socialproblem.    They have been particularly anxious that,  in making the law/ effective against drivers who are guilty, they should notimpose unreasonable requirements on those who are innocent.They believe that the vast majority of drivers will be morethan ready to perform the simple roadside test which will clearthem immediately if they have not been drinking and will regard this very small inconvenience to themselves as a reasonable price to pay in the interests of restraining the driver who canplace their own and their family&apos;s life in jeopardy,    Theproposals for dealing with the minority who refuse the test may seem severe but without them the law will not work.,.jlppd-alcojiol jjevel jTests33-    There remains the question of the tests to be made toprovide the crucial scientific evidence of the blood-alcohollevel for use in court.    Under the existing law specimens of blood or urine obtained at the police station are sent to a... /laboratory- Ib -

hi....laboratory for analysis and the results can be used inevidence.    The existing law also contains powers to obtain andanalyse specimens of breath, but these have noc so far been used as further research is still being carried out to establish the accuracy and reliability of this method.    The exist in; lawprovides that if a driver refuses to provide a specimen foranalysis his refusal can be taken into account by the Court assupporting any evidence given on behalf of the prosecution or as rebutting any evidence given on behalf of the defence.360    The Government consider that blood an&quot;, urine analysesshould continue to be made as at present in laboratories onspecimens obtained at the police station.,    Blood tests are  -scientifically the most direct and accurate and should be usedwherever possible.    The specimens should be taken only by a qualified medical practitioner with the consent of the person concerned.    New and extremely accurate methods of analysis havebeen developed using minute specimens of blood such as can beobtained from a pin-prick in the finger-tip or ear-lobe withoutthe discomfort associated .vith previous methods of taxing bloodspecimens.      This should remove the objections felt by some people to giving a specimen of bloodo37.    Urine specimens are regularly taken, and the results ofanalysis given in court,  under the existing lav/.    It has beenfound that the most satisfactory method is for two specimensto be taken and provision will be made for this in the Bill.38.    It is not proposed to make provision at this stage forbreath testing to form part of the substantive test,  as distinct from the screening test described in paragraph 28.    Breath,testing devices have been in use for screening in a number offoreign countries for many years and the Government is satisfiedthat they are sufficiently accurate an.&apos;, reliable for this purpose,Experiments are ^continuing on the use of breath testing forevidential purposes.    Tests in very carefully controlled_ ^ _ /conditions

conditions using breath-analysing machines in a laboratory to analyse breath collected in bags have been successful.    Butthe Government are not yet satisfied with the accuracy of results in normal everyday conditions.    Further work is being done in this field.39&quot;    Evidence of the blood-alcohol level is essential to prove the nevy offence.    It is,  therefore, necessary as far as possibleto prevent people who suspect that their blood-alcoholconcentration is above the level from evading the new provisionsby refusing to supply a specimen.-.    In some countries this is done by extracting tlia specimen of blood if need be by force,Such a procedure would rightly be regarded in  Britain asrepugnant and intolerable.    The Government therefore proposethat&quot;a person brought to the station for a test should be askedto provide a specimen of blood for analysis hut that if heobjects to giving blood and is able to provide urine he shouldbe permitted to do so.    If, however, he fails to provide eitherspecimen and cannot show reasonable grounds for his failure todo so he should be liable to the same penalties as if he hadbeen tested and found to have more than the prescribed level.In other words people who refuse without good reason should notgain any advantage from doing so.hO.    The Government propose that as a safeguard drivers shouldbe entitled to a specimen for their own private analysis ifthey wish, as under the existing lav/,  and that they must beinformed of this by the police when being asked to provide aspecimen,- 18 -

PART II - SAFETY MEASURES FOR GOODS VEHICLESU/i .   This part of the Paper   explains what the Government are doing to improve the safety of goods vehicles on our roads.   Wherenew powers are needed to give effect to the proposals set out belowthe Government will seek them in this Session&apos;s road safetylegislation.Size of the Problem1+2.   Over 1 -g- million goods vehicles are now in use in this country,and in 1 961+ they travelled 23,000,000,000 miles.   There are900,000 light goods vehicles, and 650,000 of the heavier vehicleswith which this Paper is mainly concerned. (5)    By 1969 there arelikely to be about 1,800,000 goods vehicles in use.1+3.   Judged in terms of accidents per million vehicle miles heaviergoods vehicles have a better record than private cars.    But when a heavy lorry is involved in an accident it is more likely thatsomeone will be killed.    (On average a car is involved in an accident involving injury every 265,000 miles, a heavier goodsvehicle every 3h0,000.    However, a heavier goods vehicle is involved in a fatal accident every 7,000,000 miles but a car onlyevery 12,000,000.   Furthermore the average lorry travels more thantwice as far as the average car in a year.all-.   Ministry of Transport vehicle examiners inspect goods vehiclesto see if they are fit for service.    In the 12 months to30th September, 1965 they inspected 139,000 vehicles, and imposedprohibition notices with immediate effect on ih,000 defectivevehicles - 10 per cent of those inspected.   A further 50,000vehicles (36 per cent), though not immediately dangerous, were found to have defects warranting further Ministry inspection afterrepair.    The vehicles inspected are not a strictly representativesample - an apparently defective vehicle is more likely to be chosen for inspection - but the figures are disturbing.   Nor dov /they(5)   These figures exclude trailers.   A heavier goods vehicleis one of over 30 cwt unladen weight.- 19 -CONFIDENTIAL

iXjOf-CJ^m IAL-       v -* &quot;hi s3 eJthey show any improvement on those for the previous year.    Theevidence available does not bear out the impression sometimes given that all lorries are dangerous and badly maintained.   Eut it shows a clear need for improvement.The Governments RoleU/5.    It must always be the responsibility first of the manufacturerand thereafter of the owner to see that a vehicle is fit for service.But the Government can and must do two things.   They must lay downminimum safety standards.   Equally important, they must see thatvehicles comply with these standards.Brakesh6.   There is general agreement that the regulations about thebrakes of heavier goods vehicles need to be made more precise.The Minister of Transport will soon lay before Parliament Regulationsabout the braking systems of new vehicles.    His proposals will take account of valuable adA^ice received from a Ministry Working party on which manufacturers, operators and drivers are represented, andwill, for the first time, specify braking efficiencies for the mainand secondary braking systems of heavier vehicles.   The working party is now considering what efficiencies should be specified for existing vehicles.    Unfortunately, many vehicles now in use do not fully meet the  standards to be set for new vehicles.    The Government1  proposals on this subject will be announced as soon as possible.h7.   The Ministry are reviewing the legal requirements for other items affecting the safety of goods vehicles, such as their lights.There are some other1 items, for example, tyres, on which new regulations may be necessary.   Equally., the existing Regulationsmust be reviewed to see that obsolete requirements do not hampertechnical progress.   Representatives of manufacturers, operatorsand the trades unions are co-operating with the Ministry in this work./Overloading- 20 -

OverloadingI4.80   A new basis is needed for controlling the maximum weights ofgoods vehicles.   The present legal weight limits are related tothe ability of roads and bridges to bear loads, and not to the safety of individual vehicles.   Many lorries at present carryheavier loads than they were designed to do.    Overloading has tworesults.   First, it can put undue strain on the vehicle.    Second,it reduces the efficiency of the vehicle&apos;s brakes, and its powerto weight ratio.    If the power to weight ratio is reduced, the vehicle will climb hills more slowly and obstruct other trafficWhat is needed is a new system to fix a maximum safe weight foreach individual vehicle, or type of vehicle. The Government&apos;s proposalsfor fixing maximum safe weights for vehicles now in use are linked with their proposals for compulsory testing, and are outlined inparagraphs h-9 to 52 below.   For new vehicles safe weights will de-fixed through a type approval system.   This new means of specifyingsafety requirements and seeing that vehicles comply with them is dealt with in paragraphs 6i - 67 of this Paper.Compulsory TestingAS-   The law now provides for the regular testing of all publicservice vehicles, and of motor cycles, private cars and light goods vehicles that are ever 5 years old.    Over 250,000 light goods vehiclwere so tested last year, the great majority by authorised privategarages.    Compulsory testing gets the worst vehicles off the road.Also, whilst it is In no sense a substitute for regular maintenance,it can provide the foundation for better standards of safety byensuring that a vehicle complies with the law at the time of test.The Government decided shortly after taking office to proceed witha testing scheme for the heavier goods vehicles.    Broadly speaking,the scheme will cover goods vehicles of over 30 cwt. unladen weightand their trailers and semi-trailers./50c- 21 -

50.   Any such scheme costs money, and needs capital resources and manpower.   This is true whether the inspection is done by theGovernment itself, or is delegated to other agencies.    Thetesting of the heavier goods vehicles requires special facilitiesbeyond, those needed to test private cars and light goods vehicles cAfter considering the differing views expressed by variousinterested organisations, the Government announced last June their intention to provide a chain of purpose-built testing stations forthe examination of the heavier vehicles.    These Governmentstations will be planned to make the best use of special equipment,and of staff.   Work on planning the stations is going ahea&quot;d.I^asis^for the Testing and Plating Scheme51o   When a vehicle is first tested at a Government station, theexaminer will check that it complies with prescribed Regulationsabout its mechanical condition.   He will also determine the safemaximum weight appropriate to the vehicle.    This weight will be shown on a &quot;plate&quot; fixed to it.     In settling &quot;plated weights&quot; theMinistry will make account of the loads that various types ofvehicle were designed to carry, and the performance of theirbrakes.   To start with, all the vehicles to which the new schemeapplies will be tested once and plated.    As soon as this has beendone, the Government will introduce regular annual tests for them.52.   The Government also plan progressively to reduce the age limit for the vehicles in the existing testing scheme.    They are considering how far light goods vehicles may need to be plated.Improved Maintenance53.   Resources and manpower are needed for testing.    They are alsoneeded to raise the general standard of maintenance of goods vehicles.   This is a formidable task, which will, in itself, makeincreasing demands on operators and private garages alike.    Bettermaintenance of vehicles will, however, pay dividends in greater efficiency in their operation.   The Government intend that theproposed Industrial Training Board to be set up under the Industrial/Trainingm 22 -;;

23.Training Act 196U for the road transport industry and motor vehiclesrepair trade will raise standards both among the maintenance staffof operators., and in the garage trade.5h.    Some firms already have excellent maintenance arrangements,but much more needs to be done to bring home to all operators,including those who own only one or two lorries, the need for regular inspection, and for prompt action to remedy defects.   TheGovernment welcome the initiative taken by the Traders&apos; road transport Association in proposing to establish a maintenanceinspection service.     The Government are considering whetheradditional Regulations should be made about the maintenance ofgoods vehicles so that the owners of vehicles are answerable in law if adequate maintenance arrangements have not been made.   Thisproposal will be discussed with interested organisations.Safer Drivers550    Traffic is growing denser and making greater demands on theskill of drivers.     Goods vehicles have become larger and heavierand able to travel at higher speeds.     So in addition to theproposals summarised in this Paper to improve the mechanicalsafety of vehicles, the Government intend, as they announced last june, to re-introduce special licences and tests for the drivers of heavy goods vehicles.     The basic powers for this are already available in Part V of the Road Traffic Act 196O, but the Governmentwill seek some amendments in this Session&apos;s road safety legislation.The detailed arrangements for licensing and testing are being worked out in consultation with representatives of the operators andtrade unions.(6)/ jjnf orcement(6)   The scheme will apply to the driver of an articulated vehicle,or any other goods vehicle above three tons unladen weight.

2k.Enforcement560   Too little has been done in the past to see that safety regulations are observed.     The most important factor must always be the sense of responsibility of the individual concerned, but more must be done effectively to deter the small minority who areat present flouting the law, and thus endangering their fellowcitizens o57.-   The Government have already announced that they areintensifying the enforcement of the statutory limits on working hours of lorry drivers.580   The Government are also stepping up the inspection ofgoods vehicles, both in roadside checks and in depots.   They will seek amendments of the statutory provisions for these inspectionsso that the most efficient use can be made of the time of vehicleexaminers.      They will seek powers so that in the worst cases adefective vehicle can be prevented from continuing its journeyeven when empty.    (The present powers deal only with the use of vehicles for the carriage of goods.)     When the regular testingscheme is introduced spot checks will continue as a necessarycomplement to ite59c    It is essential that the new plated weights should be effectively enforced, and more weighbridges provided for thispurpose.     Ministry of Transport staff will increasingly regard the check weighing of vehicles as part of their functions.   the pattern of enforcement will depend in part on the results oftrials with modern types of weighbridges.    These trials willstart in 1966.60.   The law provides that an operator who is shown to have failed to maintain his vehicles in a safe condition may have/his

his carrier&apos;s licence suspended, curtailed or, in extreme cases,revoked by the responsible Licensing Authority,,     Action of thiskind is an effective deterrent to persistent offenders.   licensing authorities have recently made greater use of these powers0     Inthe last .12 months they have taken action against the licences of well over 100 operators.Type Approval;61 o   The Government also propose to seek powers to introduce asystem of type approval for new goods vehicles.     The present&quot;Construction and Use&quot; Regulations dealing with the mechanicalcondition of motor vehicles are set in a legislative frameworkthat goes back to the Road Traffic Act 1930 and earlier legislation.,The Regulations are designed to apply to vehicles when in use onthe road.     But as time has gone on the Regulations have become more complex.     And it is increasingly necessary for the owner ofa new vehicle to rely on the manufacturer to ensure that the vehiclecan in fact comply with the lawo62.   Under a system of type approval it is possible to check thatvehicles comply with specific Government regulations before they come into use.-,   The system, briefly, is as follows.   The manufacturerof a new type of vehicle, or, at the start of the scheme, of a vehicle already in production, will be able to apply to the- Ministryof Transport for a certificate that a &quot;sample&quot; vehicle complieswith the relevant Government regulations.      Once this certificateis granted he will be authorised to issue with each similar vehiclea certificate confirming that it is a vehicle of a type that hasbeen approved.     Such a certificate will be needed before a vehicleis used on the road,    Individual approval can be given for vehiclesthat are not of a type./63.25.

63.   These new arrangements will in no way diminish the general responsibility of the manufacturer for the safety of his product.The task of the Ministry when examining a new type of vehicle willbe to confirm that it meets certain minimum safety requirements.Under a type approval system these requirements can be expressedin terms of performance tests - what is to be achieved, rather thanhow the manufacturer is to achieve it.     The Government believe thatthe use of performance tests may assist the development of nowdesigns.     It will make it possible to draw up more affective-regulations limiting the noise made by goods vehicles and about theemission of smoke.6h.   Under a type approval scheme new vehicles will be &quot;plated&quot;at the factory at weights approved by the Ministry of Transport.It will be possible, in due course, to take a minimum power toweight ratio into account in fixing plated weights for newvehicles, although a number of technical problems have yet to be solved.     One of these is to draw up an internationally agreeddefinition of power output.65.   A great deal of detailed, work has to be done before a typeapproval scheme can be started, and the Government envisage thatit will deal, at first, only with a small number of items, principallythose relevant to maximum safe weights.     They propose to work outthe arrangements in close consultation with the motor industry.66.   A number of foreign countries already operate a type approvalsystem.   At present vehicles being exported to those countries have-to be approved in accordance with the arrangements they lay down.Once a type approval system is operating in Great Britain, theGovernment hope it will be possible to make reciprocal arrangements with other countries.      Such arrangements will help exports./67.26.

o67*      If the arrangements for the type approval of goods vehicleswork well, the Government would be ready at a later date to seekpowers to extend the- scheme to passenger vehicles.CONCLUSION68,     In this Paper the Government have explained some of themeasures they arc- taking to reduce the toll of road accidents.Inevitably, the emphasis has been on legal requirements and theirenforcement.    But these can provide only part of the answer.The most important factor is the sense of personal responsibilityof all who use the roads or make or repair vehicles.    Lives arein their hands.27.
